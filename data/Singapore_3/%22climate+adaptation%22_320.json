The good news is that despite the gloomy predictions about the future, ordinary people, grassroots groups and governments are starting to act and in so doing, creating a safer future.</p><p> \"Grassroots (activity) is a critical ingredient for successful climate adaptation to happen,\" said professor of urban climate at Singapore Management University (SMU) Winston Chow.</p><p> \"Urban residents are on the front line of climate-driven hazards, and communities also can provide essential local knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of resources deployed to reduce climate risk,\" he told The Straits Times. </p><p> The ongoing heatwave in South-east Asia and floods in southern China as well as the deadly floods in Dubai are the type of growing risks cities face, said Prof Chow. He is also co-chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group II, which studies climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability.</p><p> More than half of humanity now lives in cities and this will rise to about 70 per cent by 2050, the UN says.</p><p> By the middle of the century, nearly 1,000 cities globally -- from about 350 now -- will see their average high temperatures reach or exceed 35 deg C during summer months, according to C40, a global network of nearly 100 mayors of the world's major cities who are working to tackle climate change.</p><p> This will increase the risks of heat stress and heat-related illnesses, such as heart disease, especially for the urban poor who must work outdoors and also cannot afford cooling appliances at their homes. Heat is already a top cause of death from natural disasters, such as heatwaves, in rich and poor nations.</p><p> Densely packed cities also absorb the sun's heat more, further pushing up temperatures. That is certainly the case with Ahmedabad, a city of eight million people in Gujarat state. A study in 2022 found that urban areas of Ahmedabad are 3 deg C to 4 deg C warmer than the adjacent rural areas.</p><p> Faced with so many climate-linked threats, Asia's megacities are employing a range of strategies. These range from the very simple projects, such as planting more trees, creating more green spaces and painting the roofs of homes and commercial buildings white, to complex engineering ones, such as building sea walls, subway flood barriers and deep drainage networks.</p><p> Cool roofsIn Ahmedabad, Ms Kavethiya is already feeling the benefit of her reflective roof.</p><p> On April 4, the afternoon temperature outside was 41.3 deg C, but inside her home it was a more tolerable 38.9 deg C.</p><p> \"I am thinking, this summer, I will get some relief,\" she said, hoping to put in additional work and earn more money.</p><p> While it costs around 30 rupees to paint one square foot with the reflective paint, Ms Kavethiya's household and about 160 others in Ahmedabad's Koyli Talav neighbourhood were given the paint for free by Mahila Housing Trust, an Ahmedabad-based non-profit organisation that seeks to improve living conditions for poor urban communities. </p><p> The organisation has so far deployed around 10,000 such \"cool roofs\" across the country. It is a low-carbon, low-cost cooling solution for India's less privileged communities who, despite being highly exposed to heat stress, cannot afford cooling appliances such as air-conditioners.</p><p> \"These people have to cool down somehow,\" said Dr Dileep Mavalankar, the former director of Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar in Gujarat's capital city Gandhinagar.</p><p> \"And this white paint is one of the cheaper options. Plus, it is passive, it does not require any electricity,\" he added.</p><p> The cool roof has also helped Ahmedabad resident Umaben Ashokbhai Metkel, 49, who works at home packing birthday party materials. Before her roof was painted, she found it unbearable to be in her house and could work to earn only 100 rupees a day.</p><p> Now, the heat has eased enough so she no longer suffers from dizziness as a result. She can work longer hours and increase her income to between 150 rupees and 200 rupees each day. </p><p> The paint could prove to be a key option for the poor as summers in India become more brutal. The year 2023 has been the second-warmest for India since record-keeping began in 1901.</p><p>India's meteorological department has already predicted that most of the country could be hit with above-normal temperatures and heatwaves during summer from April to June.</p><p> Low-income Indian neighbourhoods often face issues that aggravate heat-related stress. This includes overcrowding, cheek-by-jowl construction that prevents ventilation and the use of cheap but heat-trapping roofing materials.</p><p> This can cause both short-term health problems such as heat-related fainting -- which Ms Kavethiya suffered from -- and long-term ones such as cardiovascular disease.</p><p> Heat stress also reduces earnings. The latest Lancet Countdown on health and climate change estimates India lost 191 billion potential labour hours due to heat exposure in 2022. This potentially amounts to a US$219 billion (S$298 billion) income loss in 2022, equivalent to 6.3 per cent of India's gross domestic product.</p><p> In 2010, Ahmedabad experienced one of its worst heatwaves, leading to an additional 1,344 deaths in May that year, compared with the mean of figures from corresponding periods in May 2009 and 2011. Reasons for these additional deaths included heat-induced dehydration, cardiac disease and respiratory issues.</p><p> The sudden surge in fatalities compelled the authorities to work on a heat action plan, which was launched in 2013 to reduce deaths from heat-related stress.</p><p> The plan, the first such initiative in South Asia, includes a colour-coded early warning heat alert system for the city's officials. This sets in motion wide-ranging measures, such as strategically deployed ambulances, the delivery of drinking water to poorer areas, and the distribution of public awareness materials to teach residents how to cope with heat stress. </p><p> The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, together with civil society organisations, has also put in place simple but effective measures such as having drinking water stations in public spots and enhancing the city's green cover. There are also oral rehydration corners at primary health centres, which are stocked with rehydration sachets and supplements for people showing signs of dehydration.</p><p> An estimated 1,190 deaths have been prevented each year since the heat action plan was put in place.</p><p> Mahila Housing Trust is trying to partner with more local municipal bodies and corporates to support a wider roll-out of its cool roofs across the nation, a step that could save more lives. </p><p> AI-powered park in SydneyIn wealthier cities such as Sydney and Tokyo, heat is also a growing problem. Communities are tackling this by creating cool zones, using special paints on roads and pavements, and making better use of green spaces, among other measures.</p><p> In western Sydney, temperatures can exceed 40 deg C in summer, far hotter than the coastal eastern parts of the city 20km or more away. It does not help that swathes of western Sydney's more rapidly growing suburbia also have dark roofs and less greenery, although local councils are trying to address the situation.</p><p> Sweltering Cities, an Australian not-for-profit organisation formed in 2020, works with communities across Australia to advocate for community-based solutions to rising suburban temperatures. It has led a campaign for sheltered bus stops in western Sydney and is pushing for a ban on dark roofs, which cause hotter homes by trapping heat rather than reflecting it.</p><p>Ms Emma Bacon, the organisation's founder and executive director, said the group formed after it became clear a growing number of residents in western Sydney were reporting they could not walk down the streets due to the heat or could not take their children to the playground because of a lack of shade.</p><p> \"We have these large suburban areas with hardly any trees, lots of concrete, and new developments with no spaces on the street for trees,\" she added.</p><p> \"Often people feel the heat is an individual problem. But these are problems that affect hundreds of thousands or millions of people at once. There needs to be a community voice for finding solutions.\"</p><p> One project holds the promise of a network of cooling parks, helped by artificial intelligence (AI) controlling the irrigation system.</p><p> During a hot, early autumn day at Bicentennial Park in western Sydney on April 7, the afternoon sun was blazing, but finding the coolest spot in the park was refreshingly simple.</p><p> This 42ha park, billed as the world's largest data-based urban cooling project, has an app that indicates, in real-time, the hottest and coolest spots there.</p><p> On April 7, the coolest spot -- at 26.4 deg C -- was a large, shady patch of grass, surrounded by a circle of native vegetation and fanned by a gentle breeze. The hottest spot, closer to 28 deg C, was about a kilometre away, on an exposed hillside that faced the sun.</p><p> In reality, the difference in heat between the two spots seemed much starker, because the app is based on air temperature rather than the \"feels like\" temperature, which also takes into account humidity, solar radiation and wind.</p><p> But this park does much more than guide visitors to the coolest spot for a picnic. Its main role is to use technology to keep the park's temperatures as cool as possible and to push cooler air into the surrounding high-density residential and business areas.</p><p> 'Natural air-conditioning'The director of the project, Professor Sebastian Pfautsch, said that increased urban development and climate change were causing sharp rises in temperatures in western Sydney.</p><p> The aim of the park project was to adapt to this heat by \"turning the park into a natural air-conditioning system\", said the professor of urban planning and management at Western Sydney University.</p><p> \"In this densely populated part of Australia, you cannot mitigate the heat, but you can adapt,\" he added.</p><p> The project, known as SIMPaCT (Smart Irrigation Management for Parks and Cool Towns), uses AI and smart technology to monitor temperatures and weather conditions to direct the park's irrigation. It relies on soil moisture and air temperature data collected from 50 temperature and humidity sensors, 200 soil devices and 13 weather stations scattered throughout the park.</p><p> The data is then applied to a digital model of the park, which considers its undulations, vegetation and surface types, as well as official weather forecasts, to determine how and where to provide irrigation across the park's 200 irrigation zones. The park's irrigation algorithm is also constantly incorporating data on how previous irrigation methods have fared.</p><p> \"We store data about decisions made in the past, so the algorithm can learn from its decisions about the best ways to irrigate the park and keep a threshold of soil moisture,\" Prof Pfautsch said.</p><p> \"Normally, in extreme weather, plants and trees don't have enough water and basically shut down. We hydrate them so that they transpire at maximum rates to cool the park at the maximum level possible.\"</p><p> Transpiration, the evaporation of water from a plant, can help cool the surrounding environment. As the moisture evaporates from the leaves, heat is removed from the air, providing a cooling effect.</p><p> Prof Pfautsch added: \"Cool air also travels downwind, and this cools the surrounding area and reduces the electricity demand.\"</p><p> The park is estimated to be able to send air that is 3 deg C to 4 deg C cooler than surrounding temperatures about 600m into the neighbouring residential and business districts.</p><p> The project is crucial for an area such as western Sydney.</p><p> Though Australia is known for its disasters such as bushfires, floods and drought, more residents die from heatwaves than any other natural hazard. About 700 people are hospitalised and 29 die each year from heat-related conditions such as cardiac arrest or organ damage.</p><p> Residents in Sydney's western area are particularly vulnerable. The area has a fast-growing population -- which is due to grow from 2.7 million today to 3.2 million by 2036 -- but it already experiences temperatures about 6 deg C to 10 deg C higher than coastal suburbs during heatwaves.</p><p> According to a report released in March by the Committee for Sydney, heatwaves cost western Sydney's businesses and residents A$1.4 billion (S$1.24 billion) a year, based on extra cooling costs, productivity losses and health costs, and this amount is due to rise to A$6.8 billion by the 2070s.</p><p> Local councils and the state and federal governments have been trying to tackle the problem, by means including support for projects such as SIMPaCT, which has cost almost A$4 million.</p><p> Tokyo's climate planTokyo, Japan's sprawling metropolis with 14.1 million residents, is also taking steps to combat increasingly extreme weather, including heat. The capital sweltered in 2023 with a record 90 days above 30 deg C, including 22 \"extremely hot days\" at above 35 deg C.</p><p> Mr Toshifumi Fukuyasu of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's (TMG) climate change department said the government was subsidising the installation of \"cool spots\" such as water coolers and mist-spraying stations in public spaces, and promoting the increase of greenery, including on rooftops and walls.</p><p> Another measure is to embed heat-blocking innovation in pavements and roads.</p><p> There are two main methods: either by coating them in a special material that can effectively reduce surface temperatures by up to 8 deg C, or by embedding water-retaining material that can reduce temperatures by up to 10 deg C.</p><p> The solar heat-blocking pavement has a coating that can reflect infrared radiation using a mixture of heat-reflecting pigment and hollow ceramic microspheres. The water-retaining pavement uses a porous asphalt mixture with the void filled with a water-retaining material. The evaporation of water curbs the rise of pavement temperatures. </p><p> About 190km of roads under the TMG's purview had the heat-resistant coating as at March 2024, with a total of 245km to be coated by 2030. Another 21km of roads had the water-retention feature as at March 2023.</p><p> The method involving water-retaining material has more drawbacks, however.</p><p> \"The temperature is lowered when water evaporates, but it won't work unless we use sprinklers or if it rains for a while,\" said Mr Shinji Wada of the TMG's Construction Bureau. Such roads also tend to be less effective in mitigating noise.</p><p> The heat-blocking coating requires no maintenance work such as water-spraying and has the added advantage of reducing road wear by traffic, he added.</p><p> Flood preventionFlooding and sea level rise are major threats to cities throughout the Asia-Pacific.</p><p>Singapore has invested heavily in expanding and deepening its drainage network, for instance, by building more flood retention tanks and tunnels. It has also raised the minimum height of reclaimed land.</p><p> It recently mapped out how to protect the East Coast area from sea levels that could increase by a metre by the end of this century -- by reclaiming three tracts of land off East Coast Park in the Long Island project.</p><p> Reclaimed land and tidal gates would protect a large stretch of coastline and, in addition, create a reservoir. Around 20km of new coastal and reservoir parks could be added.</p><p> It is all part of the city's broader strategy to adapt to climate threats, and plans have continually been adjusted as the challenges become better understood.</p><p> Tokyo has also taken steps to reduce flood risks.</p><p> On March 28, TMG revised its climate change adaptation plan, enacted in 2021, as it observed an increase in short-term but intense rainfall and record-breaking heat conditions.</p><p> This complements the Tokyo Resilience Project, which has 17 trillion yen (S$149 billion) worth of infrastructure upgrades planned over the next two decades.</p><p> The amount includes 7.1 trillion yen for measures against flooding caused by stronger typhoons, as well as tsunamis triggered by earthquakes.</p><p> The TMG is raising river and coastal embankments, and expanding its intricate cavern of underground water reservoirs that temporarily store flood waters.</p><p> It is also fortifying its extensive subway network and sewerage system against flooding -- everyday infrastructure that many take for granted.</p><p> \"Underground spaces such as subway stations flood faster than above ground and, once flooding begins, water rushes in all at once. This makes it difficult for passengers to evacuate,\" said a policy paper by the TMG's Bureau of Transportation issued in February 2023. \"This makes it all the more urgent to take measures against flood damage.\"</p><p> The TMG manages the Toei Subway, which consists of 106 stations across four lines and had an average of 2.24 million users per day in 2022, but is also working with other railway operators like the Tokyo Metro on disaster mitigation measures.</p><p> Among the first lines of defence are water-stop plates and/or waterproof doors at station entrances and exits, while remote-controlled flood-prevention devices are installed at ventilation openings to stop water from rushing in.</p><p> Inside the tunnels, watertight gates can be activated to prevent flood waters from spreading.</p><p> The goal is to complete work on the entrances at seven stations and ventilation openings of 20 stations by March 2025 on the Toei Subway. </p><p> By the 2040s, the entrances and ventilation openings of 65 stations will be protected, while watertight gates will be in place at seven locations.</p><p> Elsewhere, the TMG is also building new trunk sewers in the wastewater collection system to increase stormwater drainage capacity, using the revised hazard maps and flooding run-off analyses.</p><p> \"Imagine if your toilet becomes unusable, or if the sewage pumps are damaged by flooding and unprocessed water flows back to the surface,\" said Mr Takashi Abe of the TMG's Sewerage Bureau.</p><p> \"If sewerage facilities are flooded due to flood damage and sewerage functions are lost, it will have a significant impact.\"</p><p> Watertight gates are being installed at sewerage plants across Tokyo that altogether process 5.5 million cubic metres of water per day, to protect their electrical systems, and water pumping and disinfection functions. This includes one at the Nakagawa Sewage Treatment Plant that is deemed high-risk as it is located near four rivers.</p><p> Across the region, much more needs to be done to dial back the risks from increasingly severe climate impacts. While the technology and resolve exist to make cities more resilient, the risks are growing for those who fail to act. </p><p> \"Global temperatures are not going to decrease any time soon, and climate-driven hazards will very likely become more frequent and intense,\" said SMU's Prof Chow.</p><p> \"When these events hit fast-growing but unprepared cities in the region, the impacts to vulnerable populations and key infrastructure in cities will be severe.\"</p><p> He added: \"In an increasingly climate-disrupted world, city leaders who fail to prepare should prepare to fail.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ms Krishna Pankajbhai Kavethiya, who lives in Ahmedabad, India, has found it increasingly difficult to work from home as a tailor.

The Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS), under the Meteorological ServiceSingapore, has released the findings of the Third National Climate<br/><br/>Change Study (V3[1]) today. V3 projects higher temperatures, more wet and dry extremes, and accelerating increase in mean sea levels for Singapore and Southeast Asia by the end of the century. This is consistent with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report (AR6)[2].</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. V3 updates Singapore's national climate change projections from the previous study (V2) released by CCRS in 2015. Based on a carefully selected set of global climate models from IPCC AR6, V3 downscales[3] the projections to higher resolutions of 8km over Southeast Asia and 2km over Singapore using CCRS' customised Regional Climate Model. Compared to V2, the V3 projections incorporate improved representations and a wider range of physical processes in the global climate system, enabling more accurate simulation of our regional climate on a finer scale.</p><p>3. V3 uses three projected global socio-economic pathways affecting greenhouse gasemission levels to explore the possible range of climate outcomes for Singapore and the surrounding region by end century. These correspond to the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs)[4] used in the IPCC AR6. The low emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) reflects a shift to sustainable development pathways with net zero targets achieved after 2050 while the high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) is driven by energy intensive, fossil fuel-based development. The medium emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) takes a middle-of-the-road pathway where historical patterns of development continue throughout this century.</p><p>Very Hot Days and Warm Nights the New Normal by End Century</p><p>4. Consistent with earlier projections, Singapore is expected to become warmer, with annual mean temperatures rising between 0.6 and 5 degrees Celsius by end century. Singapore's annual mean temperatures, which increased at a rate of 0.24 degrees Celsius per decade in the past 40 years, is projected to rise to 0.55 degrees Celsius per decade by end century under the high emissions scenario.</p><p>5. Very hot days will become more frequent. Singapore experienced daily maximum temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius[5] 21.4 days per year on average in the last 40 years. By end century, we will see between 41 and 351 days per year on average of such high daily maximum temperatures. More warm nights where temperatures exceed 26.3 degrees Celsius are also projected. From an average of 76 nights per year in the last 40 years,<br/><br/>Singapore could experience such warm nights most nights in the year by end century. Rainfall Extremes to Intensify, Dry Periods to Get Drier</p><p>6. Singapore's rainfall is highly variable at seasonal time scales. By the end of century, total rainfall during the southwest monsoon dry season of June-through-August could fallsignificantly below the historical low of 314 mm (recorded in 1997) around once every threeyears. For the northeast monsoon wet season of November-through-January, the corresponding seasonal total rainfall is projected to exceed the historical high of 1507 mm (recorded in 2006) occasionally.</p><p>7. Extreme daily rainfall[6] is projected to increase across all seasons, with increases ranging from around 6 to 92 per cent in the inter-monsoon months of April and May. On the other hand, dry spells[7] could be more frequent and last longer, with Singapore experiencing<br/><br/>on average one dry spell every 10 to 60 months by end of century.<br/><br/>Mean Sea Level to Rise</p><p>8. The mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by 0.23m to 1.15m by end century, and by up to around 2m by 2150 under the high emissions scenario. This increase from the previous V2 projections (around 1m by end century) is primarily due to a better understanding of the contribution of the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets to global sea levels Staying Resilient in The Face of Climate Change</p><p>9. Singapore's future climate depends on the world's shared socio-economic pathways. All countries will have to act collectively to fulfil their net zero commitments. Singapore is doing our part, with the Singapore Green Plan. We are committed to reach net-zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>10. In addition, the Government takes a proactive approach not just in mitigation, but also in adaptation planning to ensure that we are prepared for the impacts of climate change. The Government will take into account the range of possible climate outcomes, including the high emissions pathway, in Singapore's adaptation plans to ensure that we remain climate resilient. Details of the Government's current climate adaptation efforts can be found in Annex B(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/files/Joint%20Media%20Release%20-%20Singapore's%20Third%20National%20Climate%20Change%20Study%20(V3).pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/files/Joint%20Media%20Release%20-%20Singapore's%20Third%20National%20Climate%20Change%20Study%20(V3).pdf</url>).</p><p>11. MSS will also be sharing the V3 data with ASEAN Member States at a later stage. In addition, MSS will be collaborating with international entities and the wider scientific community to undertake joint research using V3 data.</p><p>12. To deepen our understanding of the impacts of climate change, NEA today also launched the second grant call under the Climate Impacts Science Research (CISR)Programme[8] for new research proposals on food security, impacts on human health, water resources, sea level rise and impacts on maritime infrastructure and the transport sector. In December last year, eight projects were awarded under the Programme's first grant call. These projects will make use of V3 results to look into areas like the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases in Singapore, changes in our tropical forest landscape, among others.</p><p>13.

The company's key focus markets are Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">e27 spoke to The Radical Fund's CEO and Managing Partner, Alina Truhina, to learn more about the fund's focus, target sectors, investment philosophy, and Southeast Asia's climate-tech investment space.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What are The Radical Fund's overarching goals? When do you expect to hit the final close?</p><p>Our major goals are to:</p><p>1- invest in and support early-stage portfolio companies to deliver more solutions that drive an inclusive climate transition in Southeast Asia (because SEA is adversely affected by climate change and is also responsible for a growing share of global GHG emissions).</p><p>2- contribute to a growing ecosystem of early-stage entrepreneurs at the forefront of developing innovative tech-enabled ventures appropriate for SEA populations.</p><p>3- deliver scaled commercial returns (ROI) and embedded impact (climate) across the region.</p><p>4- engage more LPs, partners, VCs, government and academia in driving the climate mitigation and adaptation agendas forward through entrepreneurship.</p><p>With the first close of your climate-tech fund, what types of climate startups are you specifically looking to invest in? Have you identified any companies yet?</p><p>The Radical Fund's investment goes beyond traditional cleantech and climate tech verticals. The fund also backs scalable ventures that may not look like traditional climate businesses and have - or may potentially have - climate impact as part of their model and ethos.</p><p>Under climate adaptation (de-risking the impact of climate change for individuals, communities and economies) comes sectors such as fintech, data &amp; analytics, insurtech, edtech, e-commerce, health &amp; well-being, manufacturing, and supply chain.</p><p>Under climate mitigation (directly addressing the <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.ec.europa.eu/climate-change/causes-climate-change_en#:~:text=Burning%20fossil%20fuels%2C%20cutting%20down,greenhouse%20effect%20and%20global%20warming.\">key drivers of climate change</url> , including GHG emissions) are sectors such as agritech, mobility, waste management, forestry, and fisheries.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/the-radical-fund-hits-first-close-of-us40m-climate-tech-fund-targets-early-stage-sea-startups-20230710/\">The Radical Fund hits first close of US$40M climate tech fund</url></p><p>We have engaged with 100-plus founders over the last quarter, and a few in our pipeline that we're looking closely at are within the circular economy, construction tech, nature-based solutions, and fintech, among others.</p><p>We hope to announce our first investment within the quarter.</p><p>Can you walk us through the investment process at The Radical Fund? What criteria do you use to evaluate potential investments? How do you differentiate yourself from other climate-focused funds?</p><p>Criteria</p><p>Our initial investments are at pre-seed, seed and pre-Series A, with further follow-on rounds. As we invest in the earliest stages of a venture's journey, we focus on the founder/founding team. We need to know whether they can build and scale a venture that is commercially viable and has (or may) address a climate opportunity or need.</p><p>For us, evaluating the founder's ability to build and execute in the right way is as equally - if not more - important as the analysis of the financial and investment opportunity.</p><p>We have an inclination for local founders or those who understand their market and, more importantly, the customers they are trying to serve. We also have a bias towards female entrepreneurs.</p><p>We also look for founders who show a specific domain or sector expertise - for example, if they spent years working in a particular industry and have been close to some of the challenges of that industry, which they may now be trying to address.</p><p>Other than the founders, we evaluate the market opportunity, product, commercial, and traction, to name a few, but with an added lens of climate. The latter means having the intention to implement climate goals and management.</p><p>Importantly, we take a very individualised approach to evaluating the ventures relative to the stage that they are at. We would not, for example, expect a pre-seed company to have a comprehensive data room with all commercial, product, governance and other aspects complete.</p><p>Differentiation</p><p>We are focused on inclusive climate transition, which includes climate adaptation and mitigation. This means we do not just focus on carbon emissions reduction or decarbonisation and look for solutions that help SEA adapt to the consequences and opportunities resulting from climate change.</p><p>We look for companies that demonstrate and can deliver scaled, sustainable commercial returns and embedded climate impact outcomes at scale.</p><p>We back founders as early as pre-seed and also seed and pre-Series A. We are an 'operational' VC, delivering hands-on technical expertise to founders in a tailored way. Our team consists of operators, former entrepreneurs, tech and climate specialists.</p><p>We bring experience from other emerging markets, notably Africa and South Asia, and are part of a group providing access to the UK, Europe, Africa, and the US.</p><p>In your opinion, what are some of the biggest challenges or barriers faced by climate-tech startups today? How does The Radical Fund address these challenges and help its portfolio companies overcome them?</p><p>One of the biggest challenges is access to technical expertise: either scientific and/or operational (for example, product development or data science). There are countries with more mature support ecosystems that act as a catalyst (financial and IP) for entrepreneurs to start and grow their ventures.</p><p>For example, Singapore has a very healthy supply of R&amp;D grants, subsidies, and access to organisations that act as a scientific community.</p><p>This is not the case in other markets, and therefore it is harder for early-stage ventures to get access to vital materials, resources (like lab space), and funding to get to the next stage of their growth.</p><p>Another challenge is the risk culture and misperception of some of the stakeholders. It saddens us to hear that some potential clients, corporates, and investors (including LPs) still view climate as a purely philanthropic agenda, not a commercially viable investment.</p><p>Therefore, it takes time for a founder to convince the other party that climate solutions enable cost saving or reduction and/or additional value and profit.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/silverstrand-capital-launches-biodiversity-accelerator-in-sea-20220601/\">This family office has launched a startup accelerator with a mission to protect, restore biodiversity in SEA</url></p><p>The Radical Fund will support in two ways:</p><p>We have a venture-building approach to investing and supporting our portfolio companies. For us, 'value creation' is rooted in providing hands-on product, growth and technical support alongside climate impact management, governance and investment.</p><p>By investing locally (we do not invest in the US or Europe or bring ventures from the West to SEA), we contribute to building a healthy climate venture ecosystem and shifting stakeholders' mindsets. This is embedded in our philosophy and model, and we plan to do much more of this in partnership with many other like-minded VCs and LPs.</p><p>What impact do you hope to achieve by investing in climate-tech startups? Are there any specific environmental or social outcomes you aim to contribute to?</p><p>The Radical Fund is powering an inclusive climate transition in SEA by enabling early-stage ventures to tap into opportunities and scale solutions along climate-resilient pathways. That is the outcome we are focused on.</p><p>The other important outcome we look to drive in the region is to catalyse and develop more early-stage founders for a thriving startup economy in SEA.</p><p>Last but not least, as a fund, we are very focused on diversity and inclusion, in addition to being environmentally conscious. As a team, we are currently 66 per cent female, and we have embedded metrics we track to ensure we keep ourselves accountable as a fund and in whom we invest.</p><p>How do you measure the success of your climate-tech investments? Do you use specific metrics or indicators to evaluate financial returns and impact?</p><p>We collect and help founders develop commercial data and metrics that underpin their business growth: we are very focused on business performance and traction to help the ventures get to product-market fit faster. For example, we look at the retention and engagement rate of users; we are very customer and user-centric, as that is a key signal of whether the founders are building a product that people want to pay for. Of course, we also collect financial and investment data such as valuation growth and fundraising.</p><p>We take a precise approach to determining each company's KPIs (or impact metrics). So a circular economy business may have emission-based KPIs, but they may also create jobs and influence how their local communities understand climate change.</p><p>Every founder and business is different; our role is to see what is possible and how to support them on their climate and commercial success journey.</p><p>A recent news report said there is a reluctance among LPs to back debut funds. Are you facing any such challenges? How keen are LPs on climate tech funds in SEA?</p><p>While the market is challenging, we are seeing the benefits of marketing a fund with a differentiated investment thesis, a robust local commitment, a proven global track record, and, dare I say, a female leader. It also helps that we are attractive to diverse investors.</p><p>There is an increased appetite and appreciation for climate- or sustainability-focused funds, especially an interest from second generations of family offices, foundations and impact investors.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/pipeline-isnt-strong-enough-for-climate-tech-investments-to-thrive-in-sea-20220318/\">Climate tech is in a chicken-and-egg situation in Southeast Asia</url></p><p>Corporates are approaching us as they see the value of diversifying their investments beyond their own VC funds and backing fund managers like ourselves, as we have the on-the-ground and long-term operational experience and extensive knowledge of picking the right founders.</p><p>More development finance institutions and governments are deploying strategic funds: e.g., we are in conversations with a few that see the opportunity to co-design vehicles with us to deploy grants and debt to complement our VC investments for our portfolio.</p><p>-</p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/climate-investment-is-still-veiwed-as-a-philanthropic-agenda-not-commercially-viable-20230721/\">'Climate investment is still veiwed as a philanthropic agenda, not commercially viable'</url>  appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co\">e27</url> .</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/climate-investment-is-still-veiwed-as-a-philanthropic-agenda-not-commercially-viable-20230721/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXE2-ETSG119314168992856670325876100132</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ETSG-119314</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68RV-RTP1-F03R-N04T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1718\"/><timeReceived>8:36 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

That will always be the case.\"</p><p> To overcome the challenges of climate change, international and local government bodies need to plan ahead and drive a concerted effort to adapt, the panellists said.</p><p> Panellist Debra Roberts, co-chair of a working group under the United Nations' top climate science body, said national governments need to take the lead and provide local governments with both guidance and funding.</p><p> \"Because of our multiple pressures that we're dealing with, generally we're not going to move in a particular direction unless a policy tells us we've got to go there.\"</p><p> The panellists' comments come as Singapore shores up its protection against rising sea levels triggered by climate change.</p><p> The island-state has launched site-specific studies and invested heavily in enhancing its coastal defences over the past three years.</p><p> Sea levels are projected to rise by up to 1m by the next century, a recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned.</p><p> In Singapore, they could rise by as much as 4m to 5m, according to national water agency PUB.</p><p> About 30 per cent of the island is less than 5m above sea level, making rising sea levels a significant risk.</p><p> In 2019, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said $100 billion or more may be needed over the long term for the Republic to address this challenge.</p><p> An initial injection of $5 billion into a coastal and flood protection fund was announced a year later.</p><p> Speaking at the panel yesterday, PUB deputy chief executive for policy and development Chua Soon Guan said that Singapore intends to build up its research and development ecosystem in coastal protection.</p><p> He added: \"The question really is how to ensure adequate and timely protection of Singapore coastlines, while at the same time, because of the uncertainty, we need to preserve flexibility for us to adapt to future developments in terms of climate science, technology and engineering.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1040830</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6588-H891-DYX4-01VM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

As a city-state with limited land and natural resources, research and development in Urban Solutions and Sustainability continues to be a key national priority so that we can build a sustainable, resilient, and liveable city. This is especially so as we chart Singapore's long-term development.</p><p>2. At the Urban Solutions and Sustainability (USS) R&amp;D Congress today, Guest-of-Honour Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration, reaffirmed the importance of strong partnerships between the Government, Institutes of Higher Learning, research institutes and firms, to effectively translate research findings into applicable outcomes.</p><p>3. The USS domain is one of the four verticals under Singapore's Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 plan. It aims to challenges in sustainability, liveability, and resilience, through the transformation of our built environment. The USS domain has its roots as early as 2006 when the Science and Technology 2010 plan was developed primarily to address our energy and water constraints. In 2015, the scope of the USS domain was expanded to address other imperatives related to the sustainability and liveability of our future city. These include food, waste, urban design and mobility, as well as climate science.</p><p>4. This year, the Ministry of National Development (MND) has partnered the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) to organise the event. This partnership underscores the growing collaboration across USS agencies and a stronger emphasis on environmental sustainability.</p><p>5. Themed \"Building Sustainable, Resilient and Liveable Cities of Tomorrow\", the Congress features more than 60 eminent speakers from various disciplines, across topics such as leveraging technology for resource circularity, climate adaptation, building cities that nurture citizens' health and well-being, and building resilience in the built environment sector through automation and digitalisation.</p><p>6. At the Congress, Minister Desmond Lee announced several key initiatives to support R&amp;D efforts within the USS domain:</p><p>a) Strategic Collaboration between URA and SUTD on urban planning research</p><p>The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is working with the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) on a five-year strategic collaboration focusing on urban planning research. This partnership aims to enhance urban planners' decision-making processes, support them to better address emerging trends and disruptions in a fast-changing and complex environment, and uplift Singapore's competency in urban planning and design.

This will enable us to better understand the long-term impact of our City in Nature efforts and further enhance our existing greenery management strategies. The $1.82m project will be led by researchers from NTU, over a 3-year period. More details in Annex D (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow</url>).</p><p>7. Even as we build up scientific knowledge through research, today's competitive landscape with shorter innovation cycles requires us to actively proliferate innovative solutions to the market for wider adoption. To achieve this, the USS domain has provided funding platforms to fast track the innovation process, such as the Built Environment Technology Alliance (BETA), Built Environment Accelerate to Market Programme (BEAMP) and the Living Lab (Water) Funding Initiative. Together with the National Research Foundation, Singapore (NRF) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), we have also set up the USS Innovation &amp; Enterprise Office (USS IEO), a national platform that aims to bring more impactful technologies from lab to market for the USS domain. The USS IEO does so by facilitating technology translation in partnership with the larger innovation ecosystem, which includes research performers, industry and agencies such as IPI Singapore.</p><p>8 The Government has also cultivated public-private partnerships through initiatives such as NEA's Innovating and Curating Better Automation and Technology for Environmental Services (INCUBATE) partnership programme. The programme offers a platform for the technology providers, service providers, and progressive premises owners to co-create innovative and productive solutions, conduct trials, and scale-up implementation to address market needs.</p><p>9 As the science and technology landscape is constantly evolving, the Government will continue to provide support though various RIE initiatives to strengthen the USS ecosystem, so that we can continue to build a more sustainable, resilient, and liveable home.</p><p>Issued by: Ministry of National Development, Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment</p><p>Date: 4 October 2023</p><p>ANNEX A (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow</url>) : URA-SUTD Strategic Collaboration</p><p>1. In October 2021, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) embarked on a strategic research collaboration. The 5-year cross-sector collaboration provides a sustained platform to develop R&amp;D solutions and capabilities through quick experimentation, test-bedding and implementation of joint research projects. Through this partnership, URA aims to enhance urban planners' decision-making processes, enable them to better address emerging trends and disruptions in a fast-changing and complex environment, and advance Singapore's competency in urban planning and design.</p><p>2. This is the first of several strategic research collaborations that URA has been discussing with Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) in Singapore.</p><p>3. Under the URA-SUTD collaboration, faculty members including PhD students contribute their expertise and lead research projects co-developed with URA officers. URA will support the funding of these research projects and programmes over the five-year period, which will also include knowledge-exchange and capability-building programmes.</p><p>4. One ongoing research project is titled \"Computational Modelling for Optimisation of Planning and Urban Design Parameters\", led by SUTD's Asst Prof Peter Ortner in collaboration with URA's Design &amp; Planning Lab. Tapping on SUTD's expertise in computational modelling, this project aims to develop a generative design and optimisation workflow for planners to simulate and test planning scenarios within a shorter timeframe, as well as formulate development control and urban design guidelines more efficiently.</p><p>a. Since its commencement in January 2022, the project has demonstrated prototypes that can procedurally generate land parcellation and residential development scenarios as well as optimisation techniques to evaluate and shortlist generated solutions that best fit development constraints.</p><p>b. The SUTD team is also developing a proof-of-concept web application which incorporates generative design and optimisation processes with interfaces tailored to the planning workflow. When implemented, this application has the potential to facilitate more efficient work processes for planners.</p><p>c. This research project is targeted to be completed in 2025. The outcomes will be progressively integrated within URA's ePlanner, an in-house geospatial web application that currently serves over 1,000 planners across 40 public agencies.</p><p>5. The URA-SUTD collaboration has demonstrated the benefits of adopting an inter-disciplinary approach to tackle challenges in urban planning. For instance, the use of mathematical algorithms for land parcel generation and optimising urban forms has introduced opportunities for productivity gains as well as new planning insights. As the Whole-of-Government Urban Planning &amp; Design Technology Centre of Excellence (URBEX), URA will continue to partner IHLs and research institutes to translate research outcomes into user-friendly tools that can improve the work of planning agencies across the government.</p><p>ANNEX B (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):</url> Media Factsheet</p><p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE CENTRE FOR LIVEABLE CITIES AND SINGAPORE-ETH CENTRE IN KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND CAPABILITY BUILDING</p><p>1.

The MoU was inked at the Urban Solutions &amp; Sustainability R&amp;D Congress, held in Singapore, on 4 October 2023.</p><p>2. The SEC is a collaboration between the National Research Foundation, Singapore, and ETH Zurich, Switzerland, as part of the CREATE International collaboratory platform. CLC is a global knowledge centre for liveable and sustainable cities set up with the primary objective of addressing emerging urban challenges.</p><p>3. The MoU was signed by CLC's Managing Director, CLC Ltd, Hugh Lim and Vice President for Research, ETH Zurich, Prof Dr Christian Wolfrum, as co-chair of the SEC's Governing Board. The signing was witnessed by Minister for National Development, Desmond Lee.</p><p>Objectives of the MoU</p><p>3. This MoU will help both parties to establish deeper collaborations for capability building on the application of the Science of Cities in the urban planning and governance domain. It will enable both parties to share knowledge, experience, tools, and methodologies on platforms such as at the biennial World Cities Summit, Science of Cities Symposium, and other workshops and conferences. Furthermore, agencies in the MND family and partners of ETH Zurich and SEC will be able to leverage each other's academic and professional networks to connect with experts globally and tap on subject matter experts to create and share new knowledge on the Science of Cities approach to support liveable and sustainable cities.</p><p>4 The scope of the MOU includes:</p><p>a. Capability Development and Training Programmes</p><p>b. Knowledge Creation and Knowledge Sharing</p><p>c. Academic and Professional Networking</p><p>ANNEX C(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):</url> NTU Singapore - French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) Alliance for Research in Circular Economy (SCARCE)</p><p>1. The proper management of electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) is aligned to the global drive towards circular economy, which contributes to the fight against climate change. E-waste recycling creates \"urban mining\" opportunities to recapture precious and critical metals that could replace primary raw materials such as gold, platinum, lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel. Singapore can play our part in the green economy in recovering critical, precious, and rare earth metals from e-waste to generate economic returns while enhancing the resilience of critical resources.</p><p>2. Through the Closing the Resource Loop (CTRL) Funding Initiative in RIE2025, NEA has pledged $17 million to support the NTU Singapore-CEA Alliance for Research in Circular Economy (SCARCE) to research on developing cost-effective and environmentally friendly solutions for recycling e-waste.</p><p>3. This fund enables SCARCE to build on the promising findings of their Phase 1 research (conducted from 2018-2023). The focus of Phase 2 is to integrate the developed processes into closed loop resource recovery solutions for test bedding, leading to their adoption at an industrial scale. SCARCE will also embark on new and innovative research areas, such as recycling of lithium-ion batteries, smart sorting and mechanochemical methods into achieving better material recovery yield.</p><p>4. Under SCARCE Phase 2, three research thrusts will be pursued as follows:</p><p>Disclaimer: Table can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow</url></p><p>ANNEX D (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):</url> Comparison of litterfall nutrient cycling between forests and urban green spaces in Singapore by NTU</p><p>1. Under the first RIE2025 Grant Call of Cities of Tomorrow's City in Nature research pillar, the National Parks Board (NParks) is awarding its first project to the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The project would kickstart the long-term monitoring of key ecosystem processes such as carbon and nutrient cycling within our forests and urban green spaces. This $1.82m project will be led by researchers from the Asian School of the Environment (NTU), over a 3-year period.</p><p>2. Plants take in and release nutrients throughout their growth and decomposition, and nutrient flows can serve as indicators of ecosystem health. This project aims to establish baseline rates of nutrient release from leaf litter and soil in Singapore's forests and urban green spaces, and to develop a protocol for continued long-term monitoring. This is key for understanding patterns of nutrient flows across different natural and urban landscapes, and detecting fluctuations due to weather, climate, and urbanisation.</p><p>3. Data from this project will enable predictive modelling of nutrient cycling rates under different environmental conditions and landscape management practices. These insights can then inform the enhancement of existing urban greenery management strategies to optimise urban nutrient cycles for improved climate resilience and ecosystem health. By contributing towards the long-term monitoring of ecosystem health, the project will guide our overall City in Nature efforts to conserve and extend our natural capital, and further integrate nature into the urban environment.</p><p>About Cities of Tomorrow's City in Nature research pillar</p><p>As one of the five key pillars under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the City in Nature vision aims to further restore and integrate nature into Singapore's urban fabric, so as to strengthen our distinctiveness as a highly liveable city, while mitigating the impacts of urbanisation and adapting to climate change. To provide a scientific foundation to support these transformative efforts, the Cities of Tomorrow Research &amp; Development Programme set up a new City in Nature research pillar under RIE 2025, led by NParks. This new research vertical will build upon existing R&amp;D efforts in greenery and biodiversity, to strengthen our ecological and climate resilience, and will also seek to inform nature-based solutions for social resilience.

That will require attracting enough foreign investors to the rupee-denominated debt.</p><p> Green bond sales dropped for the first time in a decade in 2022. Globally, companies and governments raised US$863 billion in green, social and sustainability-linked bonds, a 19 per cent drop from the record US$1.1 trillion in 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This came as monetary policy tightening hit issuance, and as asset managers came under fire for alleged greenwashing.</p><p> So far this year, at least two governments have tapped the green bond market. Hong Kong sold the equivalent of US$5.8 billion of debt across three currencies. while Ireland pulled in 35 billion euros (S$50.1 billion) of orders for a 3.5 billion euro sale of 20-year bonds.</p><p> Now, India is putting its first sovereign green bond on the radar of some of its biggest domestic asset managers to drum up demand, said people familiar with the matter. They added that the managers include state-run insurers and pension funds, as well as foreign investors from Japan to the UK.</p><p> Corporate issuers in India have not always found it worth the cost and effort to get a green tag on their debt, given the absence of domestic environmental, social and governance (ESG) debt funds.</p><p> The establishment of a clear benchmark with a sovereign bond and the potentially greater investor interest it may bring could change that. </p><p> Nicole Lim, fixed-income ESG analyst at Abrdn in Singapore, said: \"We could possibly see quite a healthy level of interest, especially from the domestic investors.\"</p><p>India plans to sell the bonds in the coming weeks, through two auctions on Jan 25 and Feb 9.</p><p>  Companies in the South Asian country have issued over US$26 billion of debt, mostly for renewable-energy projects.</p><p> While India may be a latecomer to the green bond market in Asia, sovereign issuers are still a select club outside Europe. This could burnish the appeal of its sale for foreign investors with a green mandate, despite the exchange rate risks that come with a rupee-denominated bond.</p><p> Raising sufficient funding at a low cost will be crucial for meeting the country's renewable energy goals. It currently still relies on fossil fuels for more than half of its energy needs.</p><p> Besides building renewable power capacity, money raised from the sale may be used to boost India's infrastructural resilience to rising temperatures and extreme weather. Globally, funding for climate adaptation has fallen far short of a 50-50 split with mitigation, which aims to reduce emissions. The target was part of the 2015 Paris Agreement.

GIC CIO says it 'pays not to put in too much, too broadly, too early'</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GIC sees great potential in generative artificial intelligence's (AI) power to transform and disrupt industries, but past technology waves have taught that it \"pays to not put too much in too broadly, too early\", said its group chief investment officer Jeffrey Jaensubhakij. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Speaking as the Singapore sovereign wealth fund released its annual report on Wednesday (Jul 26), Dr Jaensubhakij said it is still early days, with a new AI company being set up every week, and dozens attacking the same problem.</p><p> \"Out of 50 companies that attack the same problem, which will really dominate isn't very clear,\" he said. \"What we found in a lot of these technology waves is that it pays to not put too much in too broadly, too early, because it's actually very hard to identify the winners.\"</p><p> Still, from use cases already known, GIC is analysing AI's impact on its investment universe, where there are bound to be losers, its chief executive Lim Chow Kiat noted. </p><p> While declining to go into specifics of investments that GIC is making or divesting from as he reiterated that it is \"somewhat early in the transformation\", Lim said advanced chip production and full stack, full service developments are becoming \"interesting investing subsectors\".</p><p> The tone is markedly different for infrastructure. Referencing GIC's deployment pace of US$10 billion to US$20 billion in new commitments a year in this space, Dr Jaensubhakij said \"we've got the comfort to invest earlier and larger\" in this arena. GIC's portfolio for infrastructure has already grown by five times since it became a standalone active strategy in 2016.</p><p> Backing this appetite, which Dr Jaensubhakij noted is likely to be sustained \"at least for the next few years\", is GIC's early work on sustainability that had guided its investments in the asset class for more than a decade now, he said. </p><p> While it is unsurprising that infrastructure has become a popular asset class for large institutional investors and fund managers, Dr Jaensubhakij said: \"If you're new to infrastructure, you probably wouldn't want to be putting in very large investments at this point in time.\" </p><p> He cited GIC's partnership with Canadian investment management company Brookfield for the takeover bid of Australia-based integrated power generator and retailer Origin Energy, which is currently pending regulatory approval. The transaction values Origin at A$18.7 billion (S$16.8 billion). Origin had been engaged in a \"brown-to-green conversion\" of its coal-fired electricity generation systems, Dr Jaensubhakij noted.</p><p> He added that the infrastructure team has a good view of the technologies that are likely to develop well. This has translated to three or four green hydrogen and green ammonia related investments in the past year, he pointed out. </p><p> \"If our forecast is right, these are things that'll be part of the solution for a cleaner world.\"</p><p> GIC's head of infrastructure for Asia ex-China Nicole Goh named Greenko Energy as a rewarding bet. GIC invested in the renewable power producer with a 280-megawatt operating capability in 2013, and it is now at five gigawatts, with more acquisitions in the pipeline. </p><p> Learnings from Greenko are also informing GIC's future investments into the sustainability sector in India, she said, citing the recent acquisition of smart metering platform Genus Power &amp; Infrastructures as one.</p><p> Chief investment officer for infrastructure Ang Eng Seng, meanwhile, said GIC defines infrastructure as investments with a combination of stable and predictable cash flows, ability to pass through inflation, and low risk of obsolescence.</p><p> This means that GIC would not count a merchant power plant that sells power to the spot market without certainty of volume and price as \"infrastructure\", while one with long-term offtake contracts providing visibility on price and volume would be, he pointed out. </p><p> Asked how GIC squares the emphasis on infrastructure against the expectation for rates to remain high for longer, Ang said while high interest rates indeed present a risk to margins, the asset class' top line could grow at a rate as fast, if not faster than, the rising costs.</p><p> \"In assets where there is strong, close to 100 per cent pass-through, ironically, in a higher inflationary environment, your nominal return actually can go higher.

Speaking as the Singapore sovereign wealth fund released its annual report on Wednesday (Jul 26), Dr Jaensubhakij said it is still early days, with a new AI company being set up every week, and dozens attacking the same problem.\"Out of 50 companies that attack the same problem, which will really dominate isn't very clear,\" he said. \"What we found in a lot of these technology waves is that it pays to not put too much in too broadly, too early, because it's actually very hard to identify the winners.\"Still, from use cases already known, GIC is analysing AI's impact on its investment universe, where there are bound to be losers, its chief executive Lim Chow Kiat noted.While declining to go into specifics of investments that GIC is making or divesting from as he reiterated that it is \"somewhat early in the transformation\", Lim said advanced chip production and full stack, full service developments are becoming \"interesting investing subsectors\".The tone is markedly different for infrastructure. Referencing GIC's deployment pace of US$10 billion to US$20 billion in new commitments a year in this space, Dr Jaensubhakij said \"we've got the comfort to invest earlier and larger\" in this arena. </p><p>GIC's portfolio for infrastructure has already grown by five times since it became a standalone active strategy in 2016.Backing this appetite, which Dr Jaensubhakij noted is likely to be sustained \"at least for the next few years\", is GIC's early work on sustainability that had guided its investments in the asset class for more than a decade now, he said.\u00c2\u00a0While it is unsurprising that infrastructure has become a popular asset class for large institutional investors and fund managers, Dr Jaensubhakij said: \"If you're new to infrastructure, you probably wouldn't want to be putting in very large investments at this point in time.\"He cited GIC's partnership with Canadian investment management company Brookfield for the takeover bid of Australia-based integrated power generator and retailer Origin Energy, which is currently pending regulatory approval. The transaction values Origin at A$18.7 billion (S$16.8 billion). Origin had been engaged in a \"brown-to-green conversion\" of its coal-fired electricity generation systems, Dr Jaensubhakij noted.He added that the infrastructure team has a good view of the technologies that are likely to develop well. This has translated to three or four green hydrogen and green ammonia related investments in the past year, he pointed out. \"If our forecast is right, these are things that'll be part of the solution for a cleaner world.\"GIC's head of infrastructure for Asia ex-China Nicole Goh named Greenko Energy as a rewarding bet. GIC invested in the renewable power producer with a 280-megawatt operating capability in 2013, and it is now at five gigawatts, with more acquisitions in the pipeline. Learnings from Greenko are also informing GIC's future investments into the sustainability sector in India, she said, citing the recent acquisition of smart metering platform Genus Power &amp; Infrastructures as one.Chief investment officer for infrastructure Ang Eng Seng, meanwhile, said GIC defines infrastructure as investments with a combination of stable and predictable cash flows, ability to pass through inflation, and low risk of obsolescence.This means that GIC would not count a merchant power plant that sells power to the spot market without certainty of volume and price as \"infrastructure\", while one with long-term offtake contracts providing visibility on price and volume would be, he pointed out. Asked how GIC squares the emphasis on infrastructure against the expectation for rates to remain high for longer, Ang said while high interest rates indeed present a risk to margins, the asset class' top line could grow at a rate as fast, if not faster than, the rising costs.\"In assets where there is strong, close to 100 per cent pass-through, ironically, in a higher inflationary environment, your nominal return actually can go higher. It's somewhat offset by a higher discount factor, because of the higher equity premium and all the costs,\" Ang said.\"But in the more ideal case of a good pass-through of inflation, it actually improves. So in real return terms, it's more or less stable.\"Giving a sense of the range of infrastructure returns GIC is looking at, Ang said it has been moving down from \"low to high teens\" in the early days, to \"high single-digit to low teens\" in recent years. It is, however, \"moving up a little bit\" now, he stated.Meanwhile, GIC announced the creation of focused teams within asset classes to take more steps to capture sustainability-related investment opportunities. They include: Climate Change Opportunities Portfolio in public equities, which looks to deploy more capital towards climate mitigation and adaptation; Sustainability Solutions Group in private equity, keen to raise investments in early-stage energy transition opportunities; and Transition and Sustainable Finance Group in fixed income and multi asset, to invest in opportunities such as funding decarbonisation and the grey-to-green transition from the bottom up. In its report, GIC noted that the revenues attributable to green solutions have grown at 17.5 per cent annually, although these companies represent less than 7 per cent of the broader market by market capitalisation today.Is GIC skewing towards placing bigger bets on climate adaptation with infrastructure, given that its recent contemplation that a \"too little, too late\" climate scenario has become more plausible? Responding to this question, Ang said infrastructure happens to find itself in the thick of the climate transition, cutting across the value chain of what needs to be done to decarbonise, from renewable power generation to storage, to carbon capture, and the emerging hydrogen economy.What he sees is that while they all present themselves as potentially interesting opportunities, renewable power is the only one that has taken off at a scale needed for the world to see that decline in per unit costs to attain affordability.\"The world needs to get through that hump of paying more first, getting through the issues, and then seeing the benefits of that sacrifice, by looking forward to a future that is green and cheaper in terms of power.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>GIC group chief investment officer Jeffrey Jaensubhakij says it is still early days for generative AI technology, and it is not clear which company will dominate.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68ST-27M1-DYX4-02HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1096\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

While this has helped drive growing interest for fixed income investments, retail investors were largely apathetic towards Singapore's sovereign green bond, as seen from flagging demand for the Aug 24 reopening of an existing 50-year maiden note sold in August 2022.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The public offer saw a paltry subscription rate of just 0.08 times, according to issuance results released by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Aug 30. This is down from 1.06 times at last year's inaugural offering.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the institutional placement remained 1.43 times oversubscribed this round, the order book was down from 2.26 times at last year's debut.</p><p>The reopened sovereign green bond, which matures on Aug 1, 2072, was priced to yield 3.04%. The final yield was 11 basis points (bps) tighter than the initial guidance of 3.15%. The effective yield reflects a coupon of 3% and an offer price of $99.26 per $100 in principal value.</p><p>Edmund Leong, head of group investment banking at United Overseas Bank (UOB), cautions against a like-for-like comparison. \"It's important to view the 1.43 times subscription rate in the context of the larger placement tranche of $2.75 billion.\"</p><p>MAS initially aimed to raise at least $1.8 billion before upsizing the issue to as much as $2.8 billion on Aug 24. Of the offer amount, $50 million was set aside for retail investors in a public offer that closed on Aug 29.</p><p>\"For this 2023 issuance, there was an order book of $3.9 billion for a $2.75 billion placement tranche,\" Leong tells The Edge Singapore. \"In comparison, for the 2022 issuance, the order book was $5.3 billion for a $2.35 billion placement tranche, giving a subscription rate of 2.26 times.\"</p><p>He thinks this year's combined placement order book of more than $3.9 billion \"still reflects healthy institutional demand\" for the 50-year Green Singapore Government Securities (Infrastructure) bonds, \"albeit not to the tune of last year's $5.3 billion order book size\".</p><p>To retail investors, however, the bond market has changed dramatically within a year. \"The yield curve environment is significantly different,\" says Leong. \"While both the original deal and reopening were offered at the same yield of 3.04% p.a., in the same period last year, the Singapore Savings Bond (SSB) was paying an average yield of 2.80% p.a., whereas it's paying an average yield of 3.06% p.a. recently.\"</p><p>Tranches for the 10-year SSBs open monthly. The average interest rate for the latest tranche, which opened on Sept 4, has grown for the fourth consecutive time, reaching 3.16% from 3.06%.</p><p>The first-year interest rate for the latest SSB tranche is 3.05%, increasing to 3.48% at the 10-year mark. The total amount offered is $800 million. Retail investors are likely to compare longer-dated instruments, like the 50-year sovereign green bond, against the SSB in their relative value assessments, says Leong.</p><p>Conversely, Singapore's latest six-month Treasury bill (T-bill), which closed on Sept 28, posted a rate of 4.07%, up from 3.73% in the prior round, marking the first time yields have crossed 4% since January. Interest rates from T-bills reached a 12-month high of 4.4% in December 2022, though this was still shy of the 5.52% record seen in September 1990.</p><p>Concerns over an economic slowdown, the higher interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions have affected bond activity across the board, says Clifford Lee, global head of fixed income at DBS Bank. \"A better barometer for the health of the green bond market will be to look at green bond issuance volumes as a proportion of overall bond issuance volumes.\"</p><p>Citing Bloomberg data, Lee says Apac (Asia Pacific) green league creditable bond issuance volumes in 2Q2023 grew to 4.45% of overall Apac league creditable bond issuance volumes, an improvement from 3.72% in 1Q2023.</p><p>The book-runners of the institutional placement of Singapore's sovereign green bond were DBS, UOB, Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), Citigroup Global Markets Singapore and Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore). The three local banks also served as book-runners for the public offer. OCBC declined to comment on this story.</p><p>$700 mil invested in rail lines</p><p>Singapore plans to issue $35 billion of green bonds by 2030 to fund public-sector green infrastructure projects, as announced by Finance Minister Lawrence Wong at Budget 2022. As of March 31, Singapore's public sector has issued $8.2 billion of green bonds across four categories: Clean transportation, waste management, green building and sustainable water.</p><p>According to the Singapore Green Bond Framework published in June 2022, bond proceeds will fund projects classified as \"nationally significant\" under the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act, or Singa.</p><p>These projects should be controlled and legally owned by the government, cost at least $4 billion, last minimally for 50 years and support national productivity or Singapore's economic, environmental or social sustainability.</p><p>Potential investments under Singa include projects in renewable energy, energy efficiency, green buildings, clean transportation, sustainable water and wastewater management, pollution prevention, climate change adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable management of natural resources and land use.</p><p>Examples include the upcoming Jurong Region Line (JRL) and Cross Island Line (CRL) in Singapore's rail network. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) allocated $700 million, or around 30% of the proceeds from its first green bond, to the two rail lines during FY2022 ended March 31 this year.</p><p>The remaining $1.7 billion is expected to be fully allocated to the JRL and CRL by the end of FY2024, according to the first edition of the Singapore Green Bond Report, released on Sept 21.</p><p>The JRL is scheduled to open in three stages from 2027 to 2029. Meanwhile, construction works for Phases 1 and 2 of the CRL are expected to be completed by 2030 and 2032, respectively, while engineering studies are ongoing for Phase 3, which will serve the Jurong Industrial Estate.</p><p>MOF commissioned Morningstar Sustainalytics to determine the impact of the investments from the green bond proceeds. When fully operational, the JRL and CRL are estimated to result in total carbon savings of between 100,000 and 120,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually, equivalent to taking 22,000 cars off Singapore's roads.</p><p>The expansion of the electric rail network is a \"key enabler\" to achieve Singapore's \"ambitious goal\" of significantly reducing land transport emissions in absolute terms, in alignment with Singapore's target to achieve net zero by 2050, says Indranee Rajah, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office.</p><p>\"The government is committed to a credible, high-quality framework for green bond issuance, and reporting is a key part of this endeavour,\" says Indranee, the Second Minister for Finance and National Development and chair of the Green Bond Steering Committee.</p><p>Other structures available</p><p>Green bonds are just one of several structures available for Apac issuers to meet their climate goals, says DBS's Lee. \"Notably, issuers must find applicable green projects for green bonds to finance. Other structures, such as transition financing, blended financing and sustainability-linked bonds (SLB), complement green bonds in helping the Apac region decarbonise while enjoying sustainable economic growth.\"</p><p>The region's capital required for climate adaptation will be a tailwind for Apac green bond markets, adds Lee. \"The region is more vulnerable to climate change risks than others due to its dependence on natural resources and agriculture and large populations living in locations prone to drought and flood, to name a few.

I thank the UAE Government, the City of Dubai, and the UNFCCC Secretariat for organising COP28 this year. I also thank the UAE COP Presidency for your leadership in advancing discussions and placing the focus of COP28 on facilitating a just and inclusive transition.</p><p>Amid heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty, the latest UNFCCC Synthesis Report has laid bare how far we are from achieving the Paris Agreement's goals. The world is on a pathway to 2.1-2.8C of global warming by 2100. The increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events today - from droughts in Africa and the USA, to heat waves in Asia and Europe - are clear warning signs for us to take decisive action and secure our collective future.</p><p>The first Global Stocktake presents a timely opportunity for the world to course-correct to keep the target of 1.5C within reach. This can only be achieved if we deliver substantive, inclusive, and balanced outcomes at COP28 across mitigation, adaptation as well as means of implementation. At this critical juncture, we need to foster even stronger multilateral cooperation than before. Today, Singapore reaffirms its commitment to domestic climate action, regional partnerships and global collaboration.</p><p>Domestic climate action</p><p>First, Singapore is committed to doing its part by delivering progress on domestic climate action.</p><p>Last year, Singapore raised our climate ambition. We submitted our enhanced Long-term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) with a goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and our updated 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce our emissions to 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030, after peaking our emissions earlier.</p><p>Since then, Singapore has been focusing our efforts on implementation and delivering progress. Our climate targets are backed by concrete policies and plans.</p><p>Singapore's carbon tax covers around 80% of our national greenhouse gas emissions and has one of the highest coverages in the world. We will raise our carbon tax level five-fold to 25 Singapore dollars, or around 19 US dollars, per tonne of emissions in 2024 and progressively to 50-80 Singapore dollars, or 37-60 US dollars, by 2030, making it one of the highest in Asia. This will send a strong price signal and drive emitters to decarbonise, while giving companies greater price certainty for forward planning.</p><p>We have mandated zero vehicle population growth since 2018 and have put in place policy levers to support our vision for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040. Our 2040 target is for public, active and shared transport modes to account for 9 in 10 of all peak-period journeys.</p><p>We are developing a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply ecosystem for Singapore. Neste, a Finnish energy company, recently completed its US$1.76 billion expansion to increase SAF production capacity to up to 1 million tonnes per annum, making Singapore home to the largest SAF production site in the world. Following a 20-month pilot completed in November 2023 which found Singapore to be operationally ready to supply SAF, we are developing a structural offtake mechanism to support SAF adoption in Singapore.</p><p>We have put in place stronger emission standards for the power sector. From 2024, we will require all new and repowered natural gas power plants to be 10% more efficient and at least 30% hydrogen-compatible by volume.</p><p>Singapore is alternative energy disadvantaged and faces an uphill challenge given the lack of domestic mitigation options. Nevertheless, we have invested in holistic and innovative solutions to overcome our constraints.</p><p>Although we have limited to no potential for hydroelectric, tidal, wind and geothermal power, we have spared no effort in harnessing solar power. We are already halfway towards achieving our target of 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar deployment by 2030.</p><p>Given our small physical size and high population density, we have made innovative use of our limited land. We have deployed large-scale floating solar farms, which leverage the surface area of our reservoirs to scale up solar deployment. In 2024, Southeast Asia (SEA)'s first floating and stacked Energy Storage System, Seatrium's Floating Living Lab, will also start operations in Singapore.</p><p>Regional partnerships</p><p>Second, Singapore is committed to working with other Parties to deliver on our pledges through regional partnerships. Through such collaboration, we aim to unlock decarbonisation potential across national boundaries more quickly and effectively for all Parties, to accelerate Asia's low-carbon transition.</p><p>One key enabler is the channelling of finance to catalyse our region's transition. It is estimated that Asia will need US$1.7 trillion in climate and infrastructure investments per annum through 2030. This is a substantial amount - it will be necessary to crowd in both concessional and commercial capital. At COP28, Singapore will announce Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships (FAST-P), a new blended finance initiative that aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion in finance. FAST-P will bring together public and private sector partners to de-risk and finance transition and marginally-bankable green projects in Asia. Through FAST-P, we hope that climate action will be realised as an opportunity for collective regional growth.</p><p>Another key enabler is the promotion of win-win partnerships to fast track our region's energy transition. As cross-border clean energy trade develops, Singapore has announced plans to import around 4GW of low-carbon electricity from Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam by 2035. This lead demand forms the buildings blocks of our joint vision of an ASEAN Power Grid, which will strengthen energy resilience and decarbonise power generation across Southeast Asia.</p><p>Beyond mitigation, regional partnerships are essential to strengthening our collective climate resilience. An important first step is to advance our common understanding of climate science and the regional impacts of climate change.</p><p>To support mutual learning, Singapore will share the findings from our Third National Climate Change Study (V3), the world's first high-resolution regional climate projections based on the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), with regional partners through the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) and the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment for the Southeast Asia Region. We will also work with partners to conduct more robust assessments of climate impacts in specific areas such as food, water and livability.</p><p>Singapore also actively participates in partnerships to advance adaptation priority areas such as food, water, and heat resilience, as well as coastal and flood protection.</p><p>By incorporating V3's regional climate projections into the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's climate risk assessment tools, regional partners can conduct climate change impact assessments on their agrifood systems.</p><p>These efforts complement our other capacity building programmes for water management and governance, such as the Temasek Foundation Water Leadership Programme. Similarly, for heat resilience, the National University of Singapore will host the Global Heat Health Information Network's Southeast Asia Regional Heat Health Node, to build regional capabilities in addressing extreme heat risks.</p><p>For coastal protection and flood management, Singapore has launched the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI). CFI Singapore forges strong connections with industry partners and international experts, to enhance capabilities and expertise in coastal and flood protection. Singapore will also continue to share our perspectives and knowledge through platforms such as the Singapore International Water Week and the International Panel on Deltas and Coastal Areas.</p><p>In line with the UN Early Warnings for All Initiative, which Singapore supported at COP27, we conduct regional capability building activities to strengthen our collective climate resilience. This includes training workshops under the ASMC Capability Building Programme in areas such as regional climate projections, subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction, as well as fire hotspot and haze assessments.</p><p>Global collaboration</p><p>Third, global collaboration is essential to ensure a just and inclusive transition. To accelerate implementation without leaving anyone behind, we must promote knowledge sharing and mutual learning among countries.</p><p>Singapore has been providing capacity building through our Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) and its Sustainability Action Package (SAP). Close to 150,000 officials from over 180 countries, territories, and intergovernmental organisations have participated in programmes covering topics such as climate adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk management, and green finance.</p><p>Multilateralism at platforms such as the UNFCCC continues to be key to ensuring a just and inclusive transition. Singapore is committed to helping forge global consensus, to achieve substantive, balanced and inclusive outcomes.</p><p>Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu will co-facilitate the Ministerial consultations on Mitigation with Norway.</p><p>Chief Negotiator Joseph Teo will lead the Joint Contact Group for the Global Stocktake discussions as co-chairman with the UK.</p><p>As IPCC WGII's Co-Chair for the 7th Assessment Report (AR7) cycle, Associate Professor Winston Chow will help advance global assessments of climate change vulnerability and adaptation options, which will inform the second Global Stocktake in 2028. These findings will be especially valuable for fellow developing countries.</p><p>At COP28, Singapore is pleased to support the following initiatives which call for collective and inclusive climate action:</p><p>We have co-sponsored the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge. Singapore's energy intensity is ranked 11th lowest, when compared to 38 OECD countries.</p><p>To demonstrate support for the COP28 Presidency's Early Coal Retirement Initiative to reduce global dependence on coal, the Singapore government is prepared to offtake transition credits if it meets our standards for high environmental integrity. This is aligned with COP28's focus on accelerating the energy transition, while ensuring sustainable socio-economic development.</p><p>As the country lead for package development under the Forest and Climate Leaders' Partnership, we will announce Ghana's Country Package for Forest, Nature and Climate.</p><p>To support the development of emerging technological and market solutions, we will also be signing Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) and Implementation Agreements (IAs) on carbon credits and low-carbon solutions cooperation with countries such as Papua New Guinea.</p><p>We stand at a critical crossroads. The decisions we make, the actions we take at COP28 will shape the future of our planet and generations to come. The window of opportunity to tackle climate change, the existential crisis of this generation, is small and closing quickly. We must urgently grasp this chance to course-correct and take decisive action to keep the target of 1.5C in sight.</p><p>Let us face climate change not as individual nations, but instead seize this opportunity to Unite, Act and Deliver.</p><p>Source: National Climate Change Secretariat, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Regulatory and Legal]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063346789</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69X3-YJV1-JB5M-W0NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2173\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 2, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Business &amp;

The meetings were hosted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and chaired by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director, MAS and Chair of the NGFS.</p><p>2. The NGFS Annual Plenary Meeting on 25 April 2023 brought together in person and virtually its 144 member institutions and observers to discuss the progress of its workplan in the past year as well as upcoming deliverables. Members discussed climate scenarios and vulnerability assessments of the financial sector, the implications of climate change for monetary policy, the role of supervisors with respect to transition planning by financial institutions, central banks' net zero strategies, and training and capacity building.</p><p>3. The NGFS also conducted its Plenary Outreach with Asia-Pacific members, which discussed identifying and managing climate-related financial risks in the region and facilitating financing flows to support Asia's transition. The group recognized the critical role of Asia in the global transition toward net zero, underscored the importance of climate scenario analysis and the stewardship role of financial institutions in their clients' transition plans.</p><p>4. On 26 April 2023, the NGFS held a full-day Workshop for more than 160 participants, including NGFS members, and bringing together speakers from across the Network, the financial sector and academia. Participants discussed how central banks and supervisors could further support the following areas:</p><p>* Blended Finance: Participants discussed the role of public-private partnerships through blended finance in supporting the transition to net zero and climate adaptation. They also discussed the need to broaden the investor base, grow local financing capacity, scale up cross border private capital flows into blended finance projects, and the importance of credible data and disclosures to measure impact.</p><p>* Macroeconomics of Climate Change: Participants discussed the implications of climate change on financial market pricing, macroeconomic modelling, and monetary policy. This included the challenges in estimating the impact of climate change on macroeconomic variables such as inflation, and the limits of economic models in capturing the significant uncertainties in future climate events.</p><p>* Nature-related Risks: Participants discussed the early findings by the NGFS Taskforce on Biodiversity Loss and Nature-Related Risks, including progress in assessing such risks, the interconnectedness of climate and nature-related risks, as well as challenges faced by financial institutions in measuring and managing these risks. There were also discussions on potential future work, including bridging data gaps and scenario analysis of biodiversity loss.</p><p>* Transition Planning: Participants discussed the importance of transition planning by financial institutions to manage risks from both micro- and macroprudential perspectives. They emphasised the role of financial institutions in stewarding the real economy to transition towards net zero, as opposed to simply divesting and de-risking. Discussion on future work touched on the need to build capacity among central banks and supervisors to effectively engage financial institutions on their transition planning processes and to better understand the regional and domestic contexts of transition pathways and adaptation efforts.</p><p>5. Mr Menon said \"The rich discussions at the NGFS over the past two days is testimony to the progress made by the global community of central banks and supervisors in working with the financial industry to manage climate-related financial risks and supporting an effective transition to a net zero economy. Of course, much work remains to be done. MAS is committed to working collaboratively with fellow central banks and supervisors in the NGFS in our common vision to green the financial system for a sustainable planet.\"</p><p>6.

Good morning. I wish to thank Commissioner Mais for the gracious invitation to speak at this year's Connecticut Conference on Climate Change and Insurance (C4I).</p><p>2. I am glad to be joined this morning, in person and virtually, by fellow insurance supervisors, academics and members of the financial services industry. We are here today with a common purpose: to learn, engage in discussions, challenge existing paradigms, and most importantly, to listen. C4I's agenda this year encompasses a comprehensive range of topics where insurance supervisors, public sector leaders and legislators have vital roles to play, be it \"Bridging Data Gaps\", \"Cultivating Resilient and Sustainable Practices\" among insurers or \"Fortifying Resilience\" through legislative initiatives.</p><p>3. These topics are at the core of how the climate crisis is impacting the insurance industry, its customers and our communities, and where thoughtful, bold and collective actions are needed.</p><p>Role of insurance amidst climate change</p><p>4. It is important to remind ourselves that the insurance industry has been managing natural catastrophe and weather-related risks for decades, making it a crucial player in addressing climate change Insurers manage significant investment portfolios and are increasingly investing in renewables and low-carbon assets, supporting the transition to a greener economy. Insurance also acts as a financial safety net, shifting a portion of the financial burden from individuals and businesses to insurers in the event of climate-related disasters.</p><p>5. Insurers offer specialized policies such as flood or wildfire insurance for climate-related risks, of which some of the most sophisticated are here in the United States, aiding the recovery from climate-induced losses.</p><p>6. Insurers also invest in research to evaluate climate-related risks, to better understand the impacts of events like natural disasters and extreme weather on policyholders. In addition, insurers advocate for climate-friendly policies and are progressively implementing eco-conscious practices within their operations.</p><p>7. It is very encouraging to see how the insurance industry is contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation. This is good news for our societies and communities. Three important questions remain - what more needs to be done, where can private-sector initiatives be complemented by public sector intervention and assistance, and what must change to bring about public-private synergy and multiply our combined efforts. I am hopeful that today's C4I discussions will provide some answers to these questions.</p><p>International Climate Risk Work at the IAIS and SIF</p><p>8. Insurance supervisors can likewise contribute to robust climate risk management and ongoing public-private partnerships that facilitate national and global decarbonisation efforts. Supervisors at the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the Sustainable Insurance Forum (SIF) are collaborating and working collectively towards this end.</p><p>9. First, to strengthen supervisory expectations, the IAIS is reinforcing the importance of incorporating climate-related risks into insurers' business operations and risk management practices by providing additional guidance on supervisory expectations, including through an ongoing review of applicable Insurance Core Principles (ICP).</p><p>10. The first of three consultation papers relating to climate risk supervisory guidance was published in March. This outlined proposed changes to the ICP Introduction to position climate risk within the global framework for insurance supervision, and further proposed changes to the existing supporting material related to governance, risk management and internal controls. The second consultation paper will be published next month, and will cover supervisory guidance related to market conduct, including greenwashing, together with an Application Paper on Climate Risk Scenario Analysis.</p><p>11. Second, the IAIS has undertaken work to improve the availability and transparency of climate risk related data. Climate data elements have been incorporated and analysed in the IAIS' Global Monitoring Exercise for the last three years, and this will continue. Each year's data collection and resulting report contribute to a global baseline of climate risk data, and helps enhance the supervisory community's assessment of the impact of climate change on the global insurance sector.</p><p>12. Third, with the finalisation of the ISSB's sustainability disclosure standards, the IAIS has embarked on new work relating to climate risk disclosures and regulatory reporting for the insurance sector. It will study the type and nature of climate risk disclosures that can provide supervisors, investors, policyholders and other stakeholders with the information they need to assess the risks to an insurer.</p><p>13. The aforementioned priorities of the IAIS are meant to be iterative and mutually reinforcing - climate change awareness reinforced by standards, implemented through scenario analysis and effective risk management, supported by quality and available data. It is also a necessary cycle - one that encourages insurers to invest in modelling longer-term risks and understanding the potential implications; and to appreciate the actions that are required now even as different parts of the financial sector contribute to an orderly transition towards net zero.</p><p>14. While the IAIS has a more extensive membership, the Sustainable Insurance Forum (SIF) is a UNDP-supported grouping of about 40 like-minded insurance supervisors looking specifically into sustainability issues. Through its research and exchange of best practices on climate and biodiversity risks, the SIF is adopting a pathfinder role for the insurance sector by probing further and invoking deeper supervisory discussions, including on less explored areas in the sustainability space.</p><p>15. A 2022 high level stock-take among SIF members found that a number of supervisors had begun to include climate-related risks in their capital frameworks, mostly in Own Risk and Solvency Assessments (\"ORSAs\"), and more were planning to do so. SIF is conducting a deeper dive into the exact approaches taken, particularly among leading insurance supervisors.</p><p>16. Another area of SIF's focus is net zero transition plans. SIF is gathering views from insurance supervisors on national and supervisory thinking on transition plans and aims to enhance understanding among its membership on the progress of transition planning and development of transition plans by licensed insurers.</p><p>Singapore Developments</p><p>17. Let me take the opportunity to share some updates on the work we are doing in Singapore to further origination and access of ESG data, climate-related disclosures and transition planning.</p><p>18. MAS launched Project Greenprint to partner the industry in co-developing digital utilities to facilitate the efficient flow of trusted ESG data. This data would support financial institutions and businesses in mobilising capital toward sustainable projects, monitoring their climate and sustainability-related commitments, and measuring the impact associated with their investments.</p><p>19. Under Project Greenprint, MAS and the Singapore Exchange piloted a digital ESG disclosure portal last year. Titled ESGenome, this portal allows SGX-listed companies to report baseline ESG metrics in a structured and efficient manner, and for investors to access the data in a comparable and consistent format.</p><p>20. Over the past year, more than 180 listed companies have been onboarded onto ESGenome, with over 40% of them starting to populate their data. On average, these listed companies have filled in 60 ESG metrics, with some populating up to 300 metrics. Moving forward, MAS will be scaling Project Greenprint to support national-level reporting needs, including reporting by SMEs and private companies, as well as defining baseline metrics to streamline SME reporting across multiple sustainability reporting frameworks and methodologies.</p><p>Climate-related disclosures</p><p>21. On sustainability-related disclosures, MAS welcomes the publication of the International Sustainability Standards Board's (\"ISSB\") disclosure standards, which will serve as a comprehensive global disclosure standard for corporate sustainability reporting. In Singapore, listed companies in five prioritised industries are already required to provide full TCFD-aligned disclosures this year, and all other listed companies will also have to do so on a 'comply-or-explain' basis.</p><p>22. MAS is working with other government agencies to chart a coordinated Whole of Government approach on strengthening and phasing in sustainability disclosure requirements. Through Singapore's Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee (SRAC), government agencies will work closely with the private sector to develop a sustainability reporting roadmap for Singapore-incorporated companies, including financial institutions and other non-listed companies.</p><p>23. In a recently concluded public consultation, the SRAC has recommended, among others, to align climate-related disclosures to the ISSB Sustainability Disclosure Standards and to mandate climate related disclosures for non-listed companies of annual revenue more than $1bn from FY2027. These are significant steps towards promoting sustainability and mitigating climate-related risks across the whole economy.</p><p>Transition planning</p><p>24. On Transition Planning, the process of transition planning is a crucial means for insurers to aid their own transition efforts, and those of their customers and investee companies, towards a low carbon future.</p><p>25. In this regard, MAS issued a consultation paper on our Transition Planning Guidelines (\"TPG\") last month. The TPG builds on MAS' existing environment risk supervisory guidance and focus on insurers' internal strategic planning and risk management processes, so they can better prepare for the risks and potential changes in business models associated with the transition towards net zero.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>26. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding and managing climate-related risks, there is still much work to be done. The urgency of the issue requires the insurance sector, including supervisors, to continue studying climate risks, improving our capabilities in identifying, assessing, and measuring these risks, and exploring new and innovative ways to mitigate them. The industry also continues to have a role to play in climate adaptation, working with the public sector to find solutions to serve our communities in the face of climate change.</p><p>27. Conferences like C4I help draw out the key questions and issues, while providing a safe space for the insurance industry, supervisors, public sector leaders and academics to debate and find collective solutions.</p><p>28. Thank you very much, and I wish you all a most fruitful conference ahead.</p><p>[Category: Insurance, Property &amp; Casualty Insurance, Events]</p><p>Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063184086</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69P4-8RG1-DXMP-K191-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2029\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 15, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N926150GC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

But the greatest loss of mangrove forests has also occurred in this region, largely due to factors such as the expansion of aquaculture and oil palm plantations.</p><p> With support from the Economic Development Board, the International Blue Carbon Institute will serve as a knowledge hub to build capacity, expertise and standards to develop and scale these blue carbon projects.</p><p> The institute will work with governments across South-east Asia and the Pacific to integrate the use of blue carbon into policies for mitigating climate change, and expand education for policymakers and communities on blue carbon projects.</p><p> Dr Emily Pidgeon, who is vice-president of ocean science and innovation at Conservation International, told The Straits Times that a mangrove forest stores about 10 times the carbon per unit area compared with terrestrial forests, but these projects can be difficult to measure and track over time.</p><p> They are also often difficult to scale, as many blue carbon projects are often built around local communities. Therefore, scaling up conservation or restoration of a particular mangrove area would often have to involve working with different communities, she added.</p><p> Key to the institute would be to help people understand how important mangroves are for climate adaptation and mitigation. </p><p> Amazon will be providing the institute with a grant of up to US$3 million (S$4.1 million) to establish and fund its operations for the first three years, to help the region build and scale credible blue carbon projects.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-3HTEDL</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66VV-DJP1-JCF2-84FN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

For the engineering innovations behind the Tuas Port Phase 1 (TPP1) Reclamation, Wharf Construction &amp; Dredging Project, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and project partners were awarded the 2022 World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO) H.J. Sabbagh Prize for Excellence in Engineering Construction. The ceremony for the WFEO award will be held later this year.</p><p>2. Key design innovations included large-scale reuse of recyclable materials such as dredged seabed material and land-excavated materials, which accounted for more than half of the reclamation fill for TPP1. The reclamation filling, which included clay, was treated to ensure stability of the reclaimed land is within the stringent limits for operating the driverless automated guided vehicles.</p><p>3. The stability of the reclamation fill is maintained using 10 storey-high caissons as earth-retaining walls. These caissons also form the foundations of Tuas port and wharf structures for vessels to berth alongside. The caissons were fabricated at a nearby casting yard, towed out to sea, and submerged on the prepared foundation in the seabed.</p><p>4. 221 caissons were used for the reclamation of TPP1 and the deep-water berths will be capable of accommodating future container ships with a draught of up to 21 metres. In addition, MPA, as the port planner, designed Tuas Port as finger-piers so that the linear wharf layout maximises the land-sea space while providing flexibility for ships with different lengths to berth.</p><p>5. TPP1 was built five metres above mean sea level to adapt to rising sea levels. Dredged hard rocks beneath the seabed were reused for shore protection and reclamation fill to enhance resource circularity.</p><p>6. The TPP1 project was also awarded the Prestigious Engineering Achievement Award 2022 by The Institution of Engineers, Singapore (IES) at the IES 56th Annual Dinner on 17 January 2023, and the ASEAN Outstanding Engineering Achievement Awards 2022 by the ASEAN Federation of Engineering Organisations (AFEO) at the 40th Conference of the ASEAN Federation of Engineering Organisations (CAFEO40) on 7 December 2022.</p><p>7. These accolades recognise and celebrate the outstanding achievements of MPA's engineering teams, amidst the challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, in driving innovation, adoption of state-of-art technologies to improve efficiency and construction safety and incorporating environmental sustainability and climate adaptation engineering in the design and construction of TPP1.</p><p>8. \"Developed in four phases, Tuas Port will be a fully automated port. These awards affirm the commitment to engineering excellence and the dedication of the entire MPA team. As a greenfield site, Tuas Port offers opportunities for innovation, enhancing energy and operational efficiency so that we can deliver a port which will continue to secure Singapore's connectivity to the world and its future as global trading hub port,\" said Mr Teo Eng Dih, Chief Executive of MPA.</p><p>9. The WFEO's H.J. Sabbagh Prize for Excellence in Engineering Construction aims to promote the important role of engineering in sustainable development, especially in the construction and infrastructure fields. The ASEAN Outstanding Engineering Achievement Awards and the IES Prestigious Engineering Awards recognise exceptional engineering achievements that demonstrate outstanding engineering skills which have made a significant contribution to the engineering progress and quality of life in ASEAN and Singapore, respectively.</p><p>10.

According to the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 43% in the next 7 years to reach net zero by 2050.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Original Press Release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">May 31 -- Monetary Authority of Singapore issued the following speech by Ravi Menon, Managing Director, Monetary Authority of Singapore:</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to join you again at the Green Swan Conference.</p><p>On behalf of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), I would like to express our gratitude for the opportunity to co-host this conference with the Bank for International Settlements, the Central Bank of Chile, and the South African Reserve Bank.</p><p>The world is still not on a transition path that is aligned with the goals of the Paris agreement. According to the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 43% in the next 7 years to reach net zero by 2050. We are now one third of the way through this \"critical decade\" and nowhere near this target. Emissions are still rising, not falling.</p><p>We need to convert commitments to plans and plans to outcomes. More countries and corporations are committing to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 so as to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But few have drawn up concrete plans to do so. Without credible transition plans and financing strategies to support them, climate action will be sporadic and ineffective.</p><p>Green and transition financing is nowhere near what is required to get to net-zero by 2050. The financial sector can play a key role in catalysing transition towards a low carbon, climate-resilient economy. But we are more than 35% short of the annual investment of US$9.2 trillion that would be required to get to net-zero by 2050.</p><p>The NGFS aims to promote the financial sector as a catalyst for the transition to a net-zero world. Through our diverse membership of 125 central banks and financial regulators from more than 90 advanced, emerging, and developing economies, we are well-positioned to do this. Our work programme is multi-faceted. We are:</p><p>* enhancing supervisory practices on managing climate risks;</p><p>* designing actionable climate scenarios;</p><p>* assessing the implications of climate change for monetary policy;</p><p>* providing guidance for central banks' own net-zero transition;</p><p>* analysing nature-related financial risks; and</p><p>* building skills and capabilities among the NGFS membership</p><p>Today, I want to talk about two relatively new areas where the NGFS is making a determined push:</p><p>* transition planning</p><p>* blended finance</p><p>SUPPORTING TRANSITION PLANNING</p><p>To achieve net zero, every economic sector will need to decarbonise. Different sectors will have different transition pathways. In hard-to-abate sectors, the transition could be quite disorderly. Those firms or industries that fail to adequately decarbonise may risk being left with non-viable businesses or stranded assets.</p><p>To support every sector to decarbonise, financial institutions need to fund activities supporting transition and not just green projects. This means channelling funds to:</p><p>* pivot business models for firms in economic sectors that are not so green to become greener; and</p><p>* invest in technologies with a lower carbon footprint or higher energy efficiency.</p><p>Transition finance in turn needs credible transition plans - by both financial institutions and their customers - as well as good transition planning.</p><p>* Many financial institutions have made net-zero commitments and set decarbonisation targets.</p><p>* However, when they finance their customers' own transition to net zero through loans or investments in cleaner technologies, they may see a short-term increase in their financed emissions.This would particularly be the case in hard-to-abate sectors like steel, cement and chemical production.</p><p>* The increase in financed emissions will likely draw pressure and criticism from investors and stakeholders.</p><p>* Only with credible transition plans will financial institutions be able to explain how their transition financing is consistent with their net-zero commitments and decarbonisation targets.</p><p>Financial regulators can set supervisory expectations for financial institutions on their transition plans in several ways.</p><p>* They can provide guidance to financial institutions on having a sound transition planning process that supports the credible transition efforts of their clients rather than divestment as the first choice.</p><p>* They can set expectations that financial institutions should engage their clients on climate risks and nudge them to draw up their own transition plans to mitigate these risks.</p><p>* They can signal to financial institutions the importance of referencing appropriate science-based sectoral pathways with meaningful intermediate targets for decarbonisation.</p><p>* They can adopt a multi-year approach when engaging financial institutions on their transition efforts. This includes acknowledging that there may be short-term increases in their financed emissions from supporting the transition of higher emissions clients towards climate positive outcomes.</p><p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore intends to do all of the above.</p><p>The NGFS is providing thought leadership on the role of financial regulators with respect to financial institutions' transition plans and transition planning process.</p><p>* We are exploring the extent to which financial institutions' transition plans should be considered within the supervisory toolkit and overall prudential framework.</p><p>* While most financial institutions' transition plans have a climate focus, they have different nuances in objectives, ranging from climate risk mitigation to reducing financed emissions to supporting the real economy's transition to net-zero.</p><p>* But there are some common elements to all transition plans which are relevant to supervisors for assessing safety and soundness.</p><p>The NGFS has completed a stock-take of supervisory frameworks with respect to financial institutions' transition plans.</p><p>* We are sharing the results of the stock-take with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board, to facilitate greater coordination in the development of transition planning standards.</p><p>* We will publish a report on key findings and next steps that will provide a basis for further work on the role of transition plans in greening the financial system.</p><p>The next phase of the NGFS' work will develop guidance on transition planning to cater to different supervisors' mandates, toolkits, and prudential frameworks. Recognising that there is a spectrum of supervisory mandates, such guidance will be based on a building block approach to aid financial regulators with varying approaches in their review of financial institutions' transition plans or planning process.</p><p>SCALING BLENDED FINANCE</p><p>To move the needle on global emissions, we need to facilitate the decarbonisation of emerging markets and developing economies.</p><p>* Emerging markets and developing economies account for more than half of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>* They are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their economic development and energy needs.</p><p>* Their energy needs are expected to grow significantly in the coming years alongside economic growth and development.</p><p>* It is not right to hold back their economic growth. Rather, we need transition finance to help decouple growth from emissions - through cleaner energy, greater energy efficiency, more electrification, and production processes with a lower carbon footprint.</p><p>But emerging economies and developing countries face several challenges in mobilising the transition financing necessary for decarbonisation.</p><p>* First, they have fiscal constraints . Public debt remains the main source of funding for transition in these economies. But there are tight limits to how much debt these governments can sustainably raise, especially in foreign currencies.</p><p>* Second, they have limited access to private capital . They lack depth in their domestic capital markets; they lack large corporations, and a broad investor base.</p><p>* Third, many of their transition projects are only marginally bankable. Regulatory and political risks heighten the likelihood of default, transaction lead times are long, projects require prohibitively large amounts of start-up capital, and there is limited access to expertise in project development and financing.</p><p>The current model of multilateral bank lending is inadequate to mobilise the capital that countries need for their transition. A good part of multilateral bank lending goes to bankable projects that could well have been financed by private capital. Multilateral banks tend to prioritise projects with lower risks to support their mandates of macroeconomic stability and growth. But in truth, their capital is most needed for riskier projects that are only marginally bankable but can support the transition.</p><p>What we need is public-private partnership in financing that is synergistic not duplicative. We need to make every dollar of public capital count. We need blended finance. Catalytic and concessional funding from the public sector, multilateral development banks, and philanthropic sources can potentially enhance project bankability and help to crowd in private capital. They can:</p><p>* mitigate a portion of project risks to improve the risk-return profile and attract a broader set of private investors;</p><p>* provide technical assistance at the project design stage to increase the pipeline of investable projects; and</p><p>* facilitate the development of a mature climate blended finance ecosystem in emerging markets and developing economies.</p><p>Blended finance is not new but we need to scale it up and this requires a collective effort. Central banks and financial supervisors can support this effort to varying degrees, depending on their mandates.</p><p>The NGFS has launched a Blended Finance Initiative to contribute to this collective effort in two ways.</p><p>* We will use our convening power to raise awareness of blended finance for climate action and help to bring the relevant parties into the room.</p><p>* We will identify any potential market, policy or regulatory barriers that hamper the scaling up of blended finance.</p><p>The NGFS aims to launch at COP28 a Handbook on Blended Finance. We will release next month a conceptual note on the Handbook which will serve as a preamble. The Handbook will be organised around three key themes.</p><p>First, identify key elements needed to build a climate blended finance ecosystem.</p><p>* To scale up blended finance for climate adaptation and mitigation, we need financial instruments and vehicles that can align incentives in both the public and private sector and entice private capital with varying appetite for risk.</p><p> For example, green bond funds or outcome-based debt instruments such as sustainability-linked bonds can attract various types of private sector actors if key contractual terms are appropriately set.</p><p>* To attract investors with different expected returns, risk profiles, investment horizons and objectives, the investor base should be expanded.</p><p> For example, we can aim for a higher level of participation by institutional and private equity investors as well as philanthropic capital.</p><p>Second, highlight best practices and principles to scale up blended finance for climate adaptation and mitigation. These include factors like:</p><p>* an appropriate institutional, legal and policy framework, and regulatory clarity;</p><p>* a robust climate information architecture for investment and performance risk assessment, comprising reliable and comparable climate data, internationally interoperable taxonomies, and climate disclosures; and</p><p>* some form of common finance reporting standards that can be used to measure, monitor, verify, and assess impact.</p><p>Third, identify demonstrative projects that showcase good mechanisms available to scale blended finance. Our scan of such projects has surfaced some preliminary observations on the key mechanisms to scale blended finance;</p><p>* standardised documentation to streamline due diligence and project preparation processes and to lower origination costs;</p><p>* effective currency hedging solutions to address local currency risks;</p><p>* effective currency hedging solutions to address local currency risks; pooling of investors at the fund or facility level and taking a portfolio rather than individual project approach; and</p><p>* leveraging on the significant catalytic effect of grants in the upstream project preparation phase.</p><p>We will study these observations further and present them in detail in the Handbook.</p><p>We must take an ecosystem approach to resolve the climate crisis. Getting to net-zero requires the real economy and the financial sector to move in lockstep. This requires applying the collective knowledge and resources of governments, central banks, and financial regulators and financial institutions, corporates and individuals. In a small way, this third edition of the Green Swan Conference contributes to this collective effort. Let us harness our strengths and coordinate our action across the ecosystem. Thank you, and I wish you all a fruitful conference.</p><p>[Category: Banks, Investment Banking &amp; Brokerage, Diversified Bank, Business Expansion, Events, ESG]</p><p>Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0060853626</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68C6-H7J1-DXMP-K0BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2255\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 31, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00079I2</classCode><className>SOUTH AFRICAN RESERVE BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001Z8E</classCode><className>BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

It's expected these sectors could be employing one million workers by 2030, it added, noting that the Indian government also established the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://sscgj.in/\">Skills Council for Green Jobs</url>, which has so far trained 500,000 workers across green business.</p><p>Following feedback from policy, finance, investment and non-governmental organisation stakeholders, the report outlined ten recommendations for action mobilising private investment for a just transition in India and upscaling green job opportunities. These include incorporating just transition principles into sustainable finance policy, encouraging just transition financial innovation and undertaking pilots for place-based investment in coal-dependent regions, and calling on multilateral development banks (MDBs) and development finance institutes (DFIs) to \"crowd in private capital for the just transition\".</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steps to a just transition\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Speaking at a webinar this week launching the report, Nick Robins, LSE GRI Professor in Practice on Sustainable Finance, added that it is \"imperative\" private investors prioritise five steps: incorporate just transition into their transition plans, engage with companies on just transition, allocate capital specifically to activities promoting a just transition, engage with policymakers on social dimensions, and report on their impact across social themes.</p><p>The just transition is \"a very multifaceted issue\", said Amal Lee Amin, Managing Director of Climate, Diversity and Advisory at BII.</p><p>\"There's always going to be a role for governments, whether that's central, state or municipal, but there are also going to be many private sector opportunities that can be unlocked through a specific focus on the just transition,\" she said.</p><p>To reach net zero by 2070, India's Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) has\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ceew.in/press-releases/india-will-require-investments-worth-over-usd-10-trillion-achieve-net-zero-2070-ceew\">estimated</url>\u00a0that US$10 trillion in investment is needed between 2020-2070.</p><p>Amin noted that just transition forms one of the core pillars of BII's approach to aligning its investments with the Paris Agreement, alongside a commitment to be net zero by 2050 and \"to invest more for climate adaptation and resilience\".</p><p>\"We see the just transition agenda as central to both those pillars,\" she said.</p><p>The report added that, in order to make \"substantive progress\", investors efforts to finance the just transition in India should be \"sector-specific\", such as tailoring investments to address the social challenges of phasing down coal and phasing-up renewables.</p><p>\"A place-based approach will be essential, adjusting financial responses to the needs of different districts and states across India,\" the report said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Upping the ante\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>India's government, central bank and regulators are installing a host of sustainability-focused rules to encourage a nationwide transition to net zero.</p><p>At the beginning of this year, the Indian government\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-01/india-to-invest-4-3-billion-for-energy-transition-and-security#xj4y7vzkg\">earmarked</url>\u00a0US$4.3 billion to invest in low carbon solutions like hydrogen and renewables.

So I guess (this fear) is a good thing,\" said the 45-year-old scientist, who is the first Singaporean to take up the role.</p><p> As a developing country co-chair for Working Group II, Prof Chow will be working alongside fellow co-chair Bart van den Hurk from the Netherlands -- the only candidate for the role from a developed country -- to lead a group of top climate scientists in updating the latest science on climate change impacts and adaptation. </p><p> The IPCC is divided into three working groups and a task force, and publishes reports every six to seven years to ensure that the scientific aspects of climate change are continually updated according to the latest available data. </p><p> It is now in the seventh assessment cycle, and Prof Chow's appointment will be for its entire duration.  </p><p> Professor van den Hurk, who is a scientific adviser at Dutch university Deltares, has contributed to its research in sea-level rise and coastal flooding.  </p><p> This is an area where both Singapore and the Netherlands have existing partnerships, and a collaboration together on the global stage would be beneficial for the countries, both low-lying coastal nations, said Prof Chow.  </p><p> Prof Chow, who specialises in urban climate at the Singapore Management University's College of Integrative Studies, beat four other candidates from the Bahamas, Gambia, Iran and Mexico to the co-chair role. </p><p> A lot of work went into preparing for his new role, said the climate scientist, who is in his 10th year of working with the IPCC, likening it to a presidential run in the climate change space. </p><p> \"I spent a lot of time campaigning -- knocking on the doors of other countries to tell them about my strengths, what I do for the IPCC, my agenda in ensuring more inclusivity and bringing more voices into the IPCC assessment so that extremely vulnerable countries who are in need of climate adaptation are also accounted for in the report.\"</p><p> His credentials at the IPCC had been earned through countless nights of ploughing through thousands of research papers, and writing chapters for its report -- all of it unpaid labour. </p><p> Prof Chow began as an expert reviewer for the IPCC, providing feedback and suggestions for certain chapters in the IPCC reports. </p><p> He was later a lead author for the chapters on \"Cities, Settlements and Key Infrastructure\" and \"Cities and Settlements by the Sea\" as part of the IPCC Working Group II's sixth assessment reports (AR6) from 2017, which looked into the impact of climate change on urban infrastructure and coastal cities. </p><p> As co-chair, Prof Chow's role is to identify research areas in climate impacts and adaptation which could benefit from greater scientific expertise, and encourage climate scientists to delve into these areas.</p><p> One potential area could be more focused assessments on how climate change affects the financial and tourism sectors, he said.</p><p> Reflecting on his election in a post on LinkedIn last week, Prof Chow said he felt \"humbled\" that a boy from Bedok -- where he has lived all his life -- can be Singapore's first elected member of the IPCC Bureau.</p><p> He said he is taking on the role in order to do his part in a way he finds most meaningful, to create a more sustainable world for his two daughters.</p><p> The world is careening towards new climate extremes as the 1.5 deg C warming threshold comes closer into view.</p><p> Parts of Europe and China are now grappling with devastating floods and torrential rain, while rivers are drying up in drought-stricken Spain. Punishing heatwaves in the United States have set new temperature records, and catastrophic wildfires are ravaging Hawaii.</p><p> To do his part to live sustainably, Prof Chow often opts for batik shirts instead of a suit, as they have an \"air of formality\" but are more comfortable.</p><p> This allows him to set his air-conditioning at 25 deg C, compared with the usual 22 deg C at events or conferences, which would, in turn, help to reduce energy use for cooling, and hence reduce carbon emissions from electricity use. </p><p> This is particularly important as 95 per cent of Singapore's electricity use is powered by natural gas, he added. </p><p> In addition, the multi-institute Cooling Singapore initiative -- which Prof Chow helms as its co-principal investigator -- will look into local heat adaptation and mitigation measures for sizzling Singapore, such as reducing the waste heat expelled from air-conditioning. The research project will also look at developing a digital urban climate twin to assess urban cooling scenarios for Singapore.</p><p> The initiative also has synergies with the IPCC's upcoming Special Report on Cities and Climate Change -- a key priority of governments around the world, said Prof Chow. </p><p> The report is extremely timely as cities are consistently becoming larger, and about 70 per cent of the world's population will be living in cities by the middle of the century, he noted.</p><p> About 65 per cent to 70 per cent of current global greenhouse gas emissions come from these urban areas, and coastal cities in particular are incredibly vulnerable to a wide range of climate impacts, such as rising sea levels. </p><p> As those in densely built-up areas generally experience higher air temperatures, a larger segment of the population could experience heat stress during a heatwave, for instance.</p><p> While cities generally have the infrastructure to cope with this, they would need to invest in more expertise as heat stress could become more complicated with an ageing population, he added.</p><p> Likewise, with their immense knowledge base, and financial and social capital, cities are also well equipped to effectively mitigate climate change, said Prof Chow.</p><p> The special report hopes to bring together all these different aspects of climate change and its links to urban cities, which would help governments take the necessary action, he added. </p><p> \"Then, half my battle would already be won,\" said Prof Chow.</p><p>Singapore's Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment said in April that it had nominated Prof Chow as he is well-qualified to contribute to advancing the science of climate change, particularly in relation to cities. </p><p> Supporting Prof Chow in Nairobi, Mr Hazri Hassan, divisional director of the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment's International Policy Division, recalled that the atmosphere was \"tense with anticipation\" during the series of elections from July 25 to July 28 for numerous positions in the IPCC Bureau. </p><p> \"Despite the tension, I was quietly confident that Winston stood a good chance of being elected, given his credentials and the extensive preparatory work done ahead of the elections. However, we knew we could never take anything for granted.</p><p> \"That was why we continued to campaign for him right up to the elections for the Working Group II co-chair position. I was elated when he was successfully elected, and the first thing I did was to release a huge sigh of relief,\" said Mr Hazri.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Built-up areas generally experience higher temperatures.

Foreign investment in the United States will be more strictly reviewed for evolving risks to national security, as per an executive order from President Joe Biden.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Closer scrutiny will be paid to \"where investments are coming from and who the investors are\", a senior administration official told journalists on Wednesday.</p><p> The order directs the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS) to assess, in particular, risks related to supply chain resilience, leading-edge technology and cyber security.</p><p> A fact sheet released by the White House said: \"The order explicitly recognises that some countries use foreign investment to obtain access to sensitive data and technologies for purposes that are detrimental to US national security, and seeks to ensure that CFIUS remains an effective tool to combat these threats now and in future.\"</p><p> It added: \"More broadly, this order explicitly ties CFIUS' role, actions and capabilities with the administration's overall national security priorities.\"</p><p> These include preserving the US' technological leadership, protecting Americans' sensitive data, and enhancing the country's supply chain resilience.</p><p> The executive order instructs the inter-agency committee to review investments \"both within and outside the defence industrial base\" for their impact on supply chain resilience and security.</p><p> Besides scrutinising the concentration of ownership or control by the foreign person in a particular supply chain, CFIUS will consider the extent of alternative suppliers across the supply chain, including suppliers located in allied or partner countries, and supply relationships with the US government.</p><p> The committee, which is chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, will ensure \"robust review\", particularly of investment proposals from \"competitor or adversarial nations\", senior officials said on Wednesday.</p><p> Asked if the tightened scrutiny was aimed at investments from China, an official insisted that \"there's nothing that's China-specific about this order, or CFIUS\".</p><p> CFIUS conducts reviews on a transaction-by-transaction basis, \"but (it) can also look at those cases with respect to systemic threats, systemic vulnerabilities, particularly with a focus on technology issues, supply chain issues\".</p><p> The committee has been the target of criticism, most recently by Republican Senator Marco Rubio over its clearance of the sale of US-based semiconductor design company OpenFive to Toronto-based but apparently Chinese-funded company Alphawave.</p><p> \"China is making an aggressive play to buy and steal US intellectual property,\" Senator Rubio warned last month.</p><p> In a statement, Dr Yellen said: \"Among other things, the executive order enumerates sectors in which supply chain resiliency and US technological leadership face an increasing national security risk -

At least, that is how Adani Group's Robbie Singh is feeling.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The chief financial officer of the Indian diversified conglomerate on Tuesday (May 2) complained about a lack of courage among European banks to fund the transition of energy systems at coal-fired power plants, towards ones that rely on lower fossil fuel usage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Speaking at a seminar held at the 56th Asian Development Bank (ADB) Annual Meeting in Incheon, South Korea, he said such projects, including ones that can halve coal-fired power plants' coal usage from 81 per cent to 40 per cent, are ready to take off. </p><p> But \"not a single\" European bank the group had approached has the courage to fund such a transition \"simply because it has an element of coal in it\", he said. </p><p> \"If we fundamentally believe that (climate change) is a massively important issue, then a mechanism to transition to lower fossil fuel usage in energy systems should be the first step we can take, because it would resolve the issue of bankability in and of itself,\" Singh said.</p><p> Otherwise, the rhetoric around climate change ends off being \"a lot of talk but very little action compared to what we need\", he added.</p><p> Singh was commenting off a point made by fellow panellist Kavita Sinha, director of private sector facility at Green Climate Fund (GCF), who built a case around why transition finance or products should not be viewed as a \"niche product\". </p><p> GCF is a fund established within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as an operating entity to assist developing countries in climate adaptation and mitigation practices.</p><p> Sinha said climate risks are not adequately reflected in the risk and bankability appraisals of conventional businesses today, so a lot of capital reallocation that would otherwise have happened are not flowing to where \"good opportunities\" are.</p><p> \"There are new sunrise opportunities which are not being invested in because of this lag,\" she said, adding: \"That's why I would call upon the financial sector (including intermediaries like rating agencies) to take a real hard look at this.\" </p><p> Her view is \"all finance is transition finance\" and should be given the same measure.</p><p> Also in the panel was Fumitaka Nakahama, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group's (MUFG) managing corporate executive and group head of global corporate and investment banking. </p><p> Nakahama said the lack of transition mechanisms is precisely why the bank had stepped in.</p><p> \"Japanese are usually known for being very quiet, but this time we have been very vocal,\" he said, as he referenced the bank's involvement in two sets of South-east Asian transition finance guidelines. </p><p> The panel later took questions from two members of civil society organisations. </p><p>Pakistan's Fiza Qureshi, a manager of programme implementation at Indus Consortium, asked why MUFG had not announced plans to steer clear of liquefied natural gas (LNG) financing, to free up capital for solar and wind.</p><p> In response, Nakahama said it was \"ideal\" to move wholesale to renewables, but there is \"no one-size-fits-all solution\" for everybody. \"Some countries still need oil and gas and coal, so depending on the needs of the countries and the realities of the countries, we need to carefully think about the imports of the gas and LNG,\" he stressed.</p><p> \"When we talk about transition, we also have to think about just and orderly transition, and we should think about those who would be impacted because of the introduction of solar and renewable energy,\" he went on to say.</p><p> Singh chimed in, using the example of how shifting a cotton-producing Indian town's reliance from coal boilers to piped gas had sparked conversations that might never occur, if his company had argued with them to adopt wind and solar.</p><p> Plant owners started attracting customers from Europe, and the results helped businesses there realise what the \"game\" with sustainability was, he said. </p><p> \"We could have argued with (a cotton plant owner) 'go to solar, go to wind'... but if you now show a transition path, then it is possible that people buy into it,\" Singh added.</p><p> He said a mechanism to raise incomes would have to be established. </p><p> Privilege might be available in Europe, but it is not available in India, he said.</p><p> Singh said companies could be kept accountable through ratings, even as they take the transition route. \"The disruption risk you face (if you have) coal assets is sufficiently large that you have a massive stranded assets risk... It won't be a zero-sum game.\"</p><p> Petra Kjell Wright, a campaigns manager at Recourse, which monitors the actions of multilateral development banks such as ADB, followed up by asking how public finance can help with the switch away from fossil fuels.</p><p> Singh said that public finance can afford to steer clear of fossil fuels when the country reaches a certain level of gross domestic product per capita, but India is not there. </p><p> To demonstrate the point, he said: \"We are not talking about a fossil fuel car becoming an electric vehicle. We are talking about a woman who has to go (and) sell fresh vegetables on foot (for) 25 kilometres a day. So if she has a pushbike, her life changes.\"</p><p> In conclusion, Singh cautioned against putting \"artificial barriers\" in the way of the energy transition.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>From left: Morgan Davis, editor of IFR Asia Bonds, moderating a panel comprising Green Climate Fund's Kavita Sinha, Adani Group's Robbie Singh, Sustainable Fitch's Aurelia Britsch and MUFG's Fumitaka Nakahama.

Elections will be held in July.</p><p> \"Given his extensive experience in this field, Prof Chow is well qualified to contribute to advancing the science of climate change, and shape practical recommendations on how governments and societies can effectively adapt to climate risks and enhance climate resilience,\" said MSE.</p><p> This is particularly so \"given that the IPCC has decided to include a Special Report on Cities and Climate Change in the AR7 cycle, which is an area in which he has done much research and field work\", it added.</p><p> Prof Chow said: \"If elected, I will do my utmost to build on the work of past IPCC reports and contribute to strengthening climate action over the next climate assessment cycle.\"</p><p> IPCC reports are published every six to seven years, to ensure that the scientific aspects of climate change are continuously updated according to the latest available data. This would also ensure more accurate predictions of future climate scenarios, such as expected temperature rise from global warming, for example.</p><p> Each report comprises content from three working groups.

He is nominated as developing country Co-Chair for IPCC Working Group (WG) II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability for the upcoming Seventh Assessment Report (AR7) Cycle commencing in July 2023.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Highlight:</p><p>* 34-member IPCC Bureau advises on management and strategic issues.</p><p>Original Press Release:</p><p>Singapore, April 10 -- Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore issued the following news release:</p><p>1. Singapore has nominated Associate Professor Winston Chow to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Bureau as the developing country Co-Chair for IPCC Working Group (WG) II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability for the upcoming Seventh Assessment Report (AR7) Cycle commencing in July 2023. Elections to the IPCC Bureau will be held in July this year.</p><p>2. The IPCC is the United Nations' body for assessing the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for mitigation and adaptation. IPCC assessments provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies and contribute to global climate action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p><p>3. The 34-member IPCC Bureau guides the IPCC on the scientific and technical aspects of its work, advises on management and strategic issues, and takes decisions on specific issues within its mandate. More information about the Bureau can be found at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/bureau/\">https://www.ipcc.ch/bureau/</url>.</p><p>4. Winston Chow is Associate Professor of Urban Climate at the Singapore Management University's College of Integrative Studies, as well as a Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow. His main research interests and publications focus on urban climate change risk and vulnerability, and on urban climatology with a focus on heat island adaptation and mitigation. Since 2017, he has been a Principal Investigator for the multi-institute Cooling Singapore Initiative, which develops climate-resilient solutions to address the urban heat challenge in Singapore.</p><p>5. Associate Professor Chow has been actively involved in the IPCC. Under the Sixth Assessment Report Cycle (AR6), he served as the IPCC Lead Author for the chapters on \"Cities, Settlements and Key Infrastructure,\" and \"Cities and Settlements by the Sea\" in WG II, and contributed significantly on the urban aspects of climate change in the other WGs. He is also a member of the Task Group on Data Support for Climate Change Assessments (TG-Data), which provides guidance to ensure that the climate change data and scenarios used in the IPCC's work are available, transparent, consistent and of high quality. Given his extensive experience in this field, Associate Professor Chow is well-qualified to contribute to advancing the science of climate change, and shape practical recommendations on how governments and societies can effectively adapt to climate risks and enhance climate resilience. This is particularly given that the IPCC has decided to include a Special Report on Cities and Climate Change in the AR7 cycle, which is an area in which he has done much research and field work.</p><p>6. Associate Professor Chow said: \"I am honoured to be nominated by the Singapore Government for the important role of Co-Chair of IPCC's WG II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability. In this Assessment Cycle (AR6), my IPCC colleagues and I have worked tirelessly to ensure that the assessment reports accurately reflect the escalating risks to lives and livelihoods if we exceed the 1.5 C threshold. However, the climate challenges for the next assessment cycle are manifold and complex, and we need to take urgent actions to combat climate change, enhance climate adaptation, and minimise the impacts and risks to our societies. If elected, I will do my utmost to build on the work of past IPCC reports and contribute to strengthening climate action over the next climate assessment cycle.\"</p><p>7. This is Singapore's first nomination to the IPCC Bureau. Having Associate Professor Chow play a leadership role in the IPCC Bureau is part of Singapore's efforts to contribute to global cooperation to advance international climate science. Singapore has been contributing actively to the work of the IPCC. In addition to participating at the IPCC plenary sessions, Singapore hosted the IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report Scoping Meeting and the 57th Session of the IPCC Bureau Meeting in October 2019. Singapore also hosted senior IPCC officials and authors in 2014 to present and discuss key findings and implications for Southeast Asia.</p><p>8. Singapore's Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, Ms Grace Fu, said: \"The IPCC Bureau plays an important global role by advising the IPCC on the scientific and technical aspects of its work. Associate Professor Chow is an exceptional candidate with a strong track record. If elected, I am confident that he will serve the IPCC well, and contribute to increasing global understanding of the impacts of climate change, the importance of adaptation and implications of vulnerability, particularly for developing countries.\"</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Management Changes, ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0060551866</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:680B-0VR1-DXMP-K3GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 10, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

All eyes will be on COP26, the global climate summit which begins this weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The conference has a number of objectives: to get countries to step up their \"nationally determined contributions\" (NDCs) which set out interim emission targets for 2030; to mobilise finance for emerging and developing countries; and to strengthen climate adaptation strategies. To date, the goal of raising US$100 billion a year in climate finance for developing countries, set in 2009, has not been met. So far the prognosis seems bleak.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The latest report by the United Nations Environment Programme states that new and updated NDCs reduce the predicted 2030 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by only 7.5 per cent. But the world needs a reduction of 55 per cent to be able to cap the global temperature rise at 1.5 degree Celsius, and 30 per cent for a cap of 2 degrees. At the current pace, the world is on track for a global temperature rise of at least 2.7 degrees in this century.</p><p>To spur the net-zero transition, it has become urgent that countries address the issue of carbon pricing. Setting a price on carbon quantifies the costs of emissions to economies and societies. It enables governments to penalise emitters and the tax collected may be used to fund climate adaptation needs. Singapore is one of around 40 nations and over 20 cities and states with a carbon tax, but its tax rate at S$5 per tonne is among the lowest in the world. A revised carbon tax for 2024 is expected to be announced in the next Budget. The International Monetary Fund has recommended a global average carbon price of US$75 per tonne, but a recent poll of climate economists by Reuters puts an even higher price of at least US$100 per tonne.</p><p>Carbon pricing mechanisms mainly take one of two forms: a direct carbon tax or an emissions trading system (ETS), also called cap-and-trade, which establishes a market price for emissions. To date, the World Bank estimates that 21.5 per cent of global GHG emissions are covered by carbon pricing instruments, compared to 15 per cent in 2020. Carbon prices set by the various jurisdictions vary widely from less than US$1 to as high as US$137 in Sweden. China, the world's largest emitter, launched its carbon market in July and prices have held steady at between US$7 and over US$8. But critics believe the system does not go far enough. Benchmark carbon prices in Europe breached 60 euros (S$94) in September and October.</p><p>To be sure, there are challenges in carbon pricing and taxation. An aggressive push for a green transition will penalise poorer countries disproportionately and raise the spectre of high inflation. Quite apart from the inflationary impact, voluntary carbon markets are also fragmented and the quality of carbon credits, as pointed out by S&amp;P Global Platts, varies.</p><p>Singapore, which grapples with its own transition challenges, is stepping up to play a key role through the establishment of Temasek-backed Climate Impact X, a global carbon exchange and marketplace, later this year. CIX aims to bring transparency and confidence to carbon markets, using technology to ascertain the integrity of carbon credits. Carbon credits are arguably not a panacea for climate change. But Singapore's bid for a central role in carbon price discovery will surely be a helpful stepping stone towards decarbonisation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-372878</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63Y5-K871-JCF2-81SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 28, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Business &amp;

MAS, Asian Development Bank, and FIs will participate in the initiative.</p><p>The initiative will seek to help address the challenges involved in responsibly decommissioning the 5,500 coal plants that are currently operational in Asia - including the fiduciary and reputation risks that FIs may face as a result of the initial spike in financed emissions from investments in early phase-out projects.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2022/blended-finance-for-the-net-zero-transition\">Speaking</url> at the conference, MAS managing director Ravi Menon said that blended finance programmes are too few and too small. \"We need a more systematic and coordinated approach to mainstream blended finance,\" he said, noting that global annual flows of blended finance have averaged less than USD 10 billion since 2015.</p><p>To promote blended finance, Menon said there is a need to build a pipeline of \"shovel-ready\" transition projects which would be more attractive to the private sector. He noted that many projects, especially in emerging markets, face regulatory and political risks and long transaction lead times, while requiring prohibitively large amounts of start-up capital.</p><p>In addition, more catalytic and concessional funding is needed from the public sector, multilateral development banks, and philanthropic sources\u00a0 - to reduce the risks of transition projects, improve their \"bankability\", and crowd in more private sector funding.</p><p>Menon also said the financial ecosystem also needs to work more synergistically. \"Banks play a key role as lead managers for financing sustainability projects. However, with limited balance sheets and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, banks need to offload these loans to institutional investors who have more absorptive capacity,\" he said.</p><p>\"But institutional investors prefer larger deal sizes with a diversified pool of assets to reduce concentration risk. We need to shift towards a portfolio approach to blended finance deals, through the structuring and securitisation of typically illiquid green and transition assets.\"</p><p>He noted that</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">REGSIA-91029</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">REGSIA2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66J6-7JX1-JB24-N0KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470594</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><timeReceived>12:49 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 inAsia Media Pte Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Regulation Asia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 5, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002F32</classCode><className>MCKINSEY &amp;

The board is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system.</p><p> \"We need a globally coordinated approach to tackle associated risks - while allowing innovation to take place safely and responsibly,\" he said.</p><p> Regarding taxation, Mr Wong said that Singapore will continue to support the work on a two-pillar solution that achieves international consensus, promotes innovation and growth, and delivers fair and consistent outcomes for all jurisdictions.</p><p> The two-pillar solution by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development addresses tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy.</p><p> The proposed solution includes introducing a global minimum effective corporate tax rate of at least 15 per cent for big multinational enterprises.</p><p> Mr Wong said: \"The private sector also plays a key role in infrastructure, including sustainable infrastructure investment.</p><p> \"We can fill funding gaps through innovative approaches and partnerships with multilateral development banks, private and philanthropic sources.\"</p><p> He added: \"Despite challenges in our global environment, there are still bright spots for cooperation as we work towards a brighter future for all.\"</p><p> He said he spent the last few days speaking with his counterparts on ways to build bridges and navigate global uncertainty.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1068017</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65Y1-YD01-DYX4-04YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"466\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

At the end, everyone will agree that this year's climate disasters show how little time is left to get on with the urgent task of keeping global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Every delegate will be reminded of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' earlier warning: \"A third of Pakistan flooded. Europe's hottest summer in 500 years. The Philippines hammered. The whole of Cuba in blackout.\" And Hurricane Ian delivered a reminder that climate science is ignored at one's peril.</p><p> Yet, will all that hard bargaining that will go into a carefully crafted communique at meeting's end on Nov 28 really do anything? There's little room for optimism if past COP meeting outcomes are any guide. For instance, COP21 in 2015 delivered the Paris Agreement. It was hailed as the first legally binding treaty on climate change that committed 196 signatories to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels. The rich countries promised to provide developing countries with US$100 billion a year for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2020.</p><p> COP26 produced pledges on phasing out subsidies for coal and other fossil fuels. There was an agreement to halt clearing of the world's remaining forests and reverse land degradation. Even Brazil, home of the Amazon rainforest, signed on. The US and the European Union solemnly pledged to cut methane gas emissions, mostly from animal farming, by 30 per cent by 2030. The US and China, the world's top emitters of greenhouse gases, agreed to work in tandem to fight climate change over this decade. They vowed to work together on increasing the use of renewable energy. They also agreed to further develop and deploy carbon capture technology.</p><p> Looking back, these pledges look more like a catalogue of failures rather than milestones of progress. According to the Climate Action Tracker website, the world is still on track to hit 2.4 deg C of warming by 2100, which will not come as a surprise to any climate scientist. The annual US$100 billion promised for climate mitigation has never been met. Forests are still being cleared at an alarming rate. The outgoing Bolsonaro government in Brazil actually encouraged ranchers to clear the Amazon forests for cattle pasture during its time in office. Washington and Beijing are no longer talking to each other on climate matters (or on anything else, for that matter). And European priorities changed drastically once war broke out in Ukraine.</p><p> This is not to say that it is all for show. Last week the Climate Investment Funds, a partnership that channels concessional loans from the World Bank and other development banks, launched a US$2.5 billion coal transition investment programme. South Africa, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, representing over 15 per cent of coal-related emissions globally, have been selected as the first beneficiaries. But against the scale of what needs to be done, efforts like these are puny.</p><p> So, the real message out of COP27 would seem to be: Each country will have to work out its own strategy for climate adaptation. The collective will to act together is simply not there.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-5RS1KC</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66TB-MHN1-DYX4-01TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Singapore is clear-eyed about the risks of climate change and takes the recent IPCC findings seriously. The Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) has started work on the Third National Climate Change Study, which will contextualise the IPCC findings and derive localised projections for Singapore.</p><p>2. The latest IPCC findings underscore the urgency to press ahead with our climate adaptation plans outlined under the 'Resilient Future' pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030.</p><p>3. To address rising temperatures and the urban heat island effect, the Government has been developing a heat mitigation action plan, informed by science. This includes increasing urban greenery and green buildings and scaling up the use of cool materials. For example, the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB), together with the Tampines Town Council, have launched a pilot project to paint some 130 HDB blocks with cool paint to reduce ambient temperature. We are also intensifying greenery in our urban environment as part of our City in Nature efforts under the Singapore Green Plan 2030. For example, as part of our OneMillionTrees movement, we are planting 170,000 more trees in our industrial estates over the next 10 years, nearly tripling the current tree population. This can help to cool these industrial estates and create a more conducive work environment.</p><p>4. Climate change can also affect Singapore's biodiversity and natural ecosystem processes. Under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Plan 2025, NParks will lead research on the impact of climate change on terrestrial, coastal, and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Such research can guide our nature conservation efforts.</p><p>5. Another key area is strengthening Singapore's coastal protection and flood resilience. Site-specific studies to determine feasible measures for coastal protection are being carried out progressively, beginning with more critical and vulnerable regions such as the City-East Coast. PUB is also developing a Coastal-Inland Flood Model that can assess the combined flooding effects from extreme sea levels and intense rainfall.</p><p>5. To enhance flood resilience, PUB has invested almost $2 billion on drainage works in the last decade and will invest another $1.4 billion over the next five years. Drainage design standards were raised in 2011, which called for an increase in drain capacities by up to 50% to cater for more intense rainfall.</p><p>6. The Government will take a science-based and proactive approach to climate adaptation. The Government will review and update Singapore's long-term coastal protection plans based on the latest data, by adopting a flexible approach in planning protection measures and evaluating the plans across a range of scenarios. However, it will not be prudent or feasible to build infrastructure to accommodate every extreme climate scenario. The recent extreme climate events worldwide have highlighted that the collective response to such occurrences is just as important. We will seek to strengthen community resilience, in partnership with our local communities and stakeholders.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0056966913</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63MK-SVC1-JB5M-W2GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"638\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 13, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A warm welcome to all.</p><p>2. I am delighted to see so many individuals here today. This underscores the importance of the topics that we are going to be discussing today, and the importance that you ascribe to sharing thought leadership, experience, ideas and innovation with one another.</p><p>3. I'd like to start by making a few words of thanks.</p><p>4. First to David and his team from Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (SIAS) for supporting and co-organising this year's conference with the Charity Council.</p><p>(a) Your team has helped us to reach out to a much wider audience, with more than 700 charity representatives here with us today.</p><p>(b) Some of your board members have also stepped up to become moderators and panelists for the Conference. The charities will benefit greatly from your very practical insights and experiences, bringing greater impact to the community and charity sector.</p><p>5. I want to also make a special thanks to the speakers and panelists for so generously coming forward to share your experience and to share your thought leadership.</p><p>6. This is really going to be an important and impactful conference.</p><p>7. I would also like to thank Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) for continuing to be this year's conference knowledge partner.</p><p>(a) Your expertise and commitment to education have been a tremendous asset to our charity sector.</p><p>(b) I think we need to make education a bedrock and a lifelong endeavour. We need to think of how we can constantly upgrade ourselves, how we keep ourselves knowledgeable and plugged into developments around the world.</p><p>8. Finally, I would also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the 9th Charity Council for your efforts in promoting good governance and accountability in the charity sector.</p><p>Currencies of Trust</p><p>9. I think it really goes without saying that openness, transparency, strong governance, accountability, these are all not just good to have concepts, but they are really the currencies of trust.</p><p>10. And without these currencies of trust, it will be very difficult for charities to have a good, open, working, beneficial relationship with the public.</p><p>11. It is really important that we stand by these principles and as we think about the different issues that we are confronted with today, and look at how we can remodel ourselves and improve, we must always keep these concepts as the foundational bedrock of what we want to achieve.</p><p>12. This morning I will speak on a few changes that we would like to see that will enhance our framework for good governance.</p><p>13. As I speak about them, you will see that what we are trying to do over the years as our charity sector matures, with more self-governance, with more rules of regulation, with lifting the standards overall of charities, we hope to be able to see a little bit of flexibility at the margins, so that the charities can be innovative and have a little bit of working room to start thinking of what they want to do out of the box.</p><p>14. I wanted to end my thanking section by also acknowledging the many who have stepped forward - stakeholders in the sector, those who have more experience or different experiences in the sector - to share ideas with us on how to strengthen Singapore's role as a philanthropy hub.</p><p>Achieving the highest governance standards is essential for charities to build trust and credibility with their stakeholders</p><p>15. Let me first start with the fundamental point about achieving high governance standards.</p><p>16. With a maturing charity landscape and coupled with our efforts over the years to strengthen trust and promote good governance in the charity sector, the Government has moved towards a more balanced disclosure regime for house-to-house and street collections for registered and exempt charities.</p><p>(a) This new regime aims to strike a balance between the need for transparency and accountability, and the need to minimise the administrative burden on charities.</p><p>(b) We recognize that sometimes in trying to put top-down rules governing charities, while it is very good, but at the same time it can cause a big burden on smaller charities. We are very mindful of this, very conscious, and what we want to do is to try to strike a very good balance achieving both at the same time.</p><p>(c) Therefore, it is important that there are still safeguards to help members of the public make informed decisions about their donations.</p><p>(d) Remember that I said that trust with the public is one of the key foundational pillars of a charity's relationship with the public</p><p>(e) Charities are self-encouraged to put in place adequate processes and internal controls to ensure compliance with the disclosure regime when conducting public fund-raising appeals.</p><p>(f) By working together, we can ensure that charities will be able to operate effectively and efficiently, while also maintaining the trust and confidence of the public.</p><p>Philanthropists seek to contribute more as they see opportunities to create meaningful change</p><p>17. Second, the philanthropy landscape in Singapore has been evolving over the years.</p><p>(a) There is a growing interest in impact investing and social entrepreneurship, with an emphasis on greater collaboration and deeper partnerships and an increasing focus on diversity, sustainability, and inclusivity.</p><p>18. In this landscape, grantmakers play a significant role in the overall philanthropic sphere and contribute to the national drive to build a more caring and inclusive Singapore.</p><p>19. They support charities by providing financial support, advocating for change, and providing guidance and expertise in many cases.</p><p>(a) For example, Quantedge Advancement Initiative, has supported our local university to conduct research on climate adaptation and develop essential tools that enable organisations to make informed decisions on when and how nature-based adaptation measures are important in mitigating the upcoming and ongoing climate threats.</p><p>20. As part of developing Singapore as a regional Philanthropy Hub, the COC's office will be making changes to the existing Guidance on Regulation of Grantmakers that includes the following:</p><p>(a) Retaining the current guideline of requiring Grantmakers to \"apply some of their funds in Singapore\", without hardcoding a minimum percentage.</p><p>(b) Allowing the conduct of non-grantmaking activities, limited to 10% of the Grantmaker's activities and subject to certain safeguards; and</p><p>(c) Allowing disbursements through non-grant instruments (e.g., social impact bonds, loans), limited to 10% of the Grantmaker's activities and subject to certain safeguards.</p><p>21. These changes help to promote the good work of grantmakers, giving them a little bit of flexibility, as I mentioned at the outset, but still fundamentally maintaining the core principle of transparency, governance, and strong sense of accountability.</p><p>22. These changes will clarify the parameters of the scheme and ensure that our regulatory framework remains relevant and effective in supporting the good work of our Grantmakers.</p><p>23. These changes will come in force at the start of next year.</p><p>Launch of the revised Risk Management Toolkit</p><p>24. Second, let me talk a little bit about the Risk Management Toolkit, which I am sure many of you are familiar with, or if not, you should be familiar with.</p><p>25. All innovation, all change, and whenever you try to push the envelope or try to be out of the box, they do come with a little bit of risk and because you are doing something differently from before, there is sometimes no precedent for it.</p><p>26. Such change in innovation should not be stifled, and we should be looking at how we can promote change in innovation from a ground-up perspective.</p><p>(a) Charities that are willing to innovate, push the boundary, push the envelope, try new things are often better positioned to address evolving social issues and thereafter make a positive impact on them.</p><p>(b) However, it is also important at the same time to strike a balance, to manage these risks carefully and effectively, at the same time keeping in mind the fundamental ethos that charities must all subscribe to.</p><p>27. Having a strong risk management framework can empower charities to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks that could impact their own operations, reputation, and also their financial performance.</p><p>28. A Risk Management Toolkit for charities was first developed in 2016 to guide charities on their journey towards better risk management.</p><p>29. With challenges from COVID-19, economic uncertainty, and ongoing and increasing geopolitical conflict, charities are themselves facing more demanding risks that require a broader and more effective risk management strategy, which also looks at some of the evolving paradigms that we see the sector is facing today.</p><p>30. An extensive Risk Management Survey for Charities was conducted early this year.</p><p>(a) I want to thank all respondents who participated so positively and actively in the survey.</p><p>(b) The findings tell us that there has been a significant improvement in the sector as compared to the 2016 survey.</p><p>(c) However, most charities are still establishing the foundations of a sustainable risk management programme and need more guidance on their journey.</p><p>31. As such, the Charity Council, KPMG Singapore, and Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) have developed a supplementary risk management toolkit for the charities.</p><p>(a) It provides the 'next steps' guidance to improve and mature charities' Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) practices.</p><p>(b) It is designed as a supplement to the 2016 Risk Management Toolkit for charities, and additional templates have also been included.</p><p>32. The toolkit looks specifically at lessons learnt from COVID-19. We also deal with new and emerging risks such as ESG and climate risks which charities are now increasingly more concerned with.</p><p>33. Charities have to be constantly updated and evolved so that we can also understand and meet the needs of society's challenges today.</p><p>34. This toolkit will be put in place, but at the same time, this is not the end of the toolkit. We will continue to keep an eye out for such emerging trends and consequently new risks that may arise, and from time to time, we might continue to update this toolkit.</p><p>35. At the same time, with the toolkit in place, charities need make their own business continuity management programmes (BCP) . We need to look at this more seriously, because the pandemic, if there is one lesson from that, has shown us that we could be faced with an unexpected crisis of all sorts.</p><p>(a) What we need in such times of crisis is for a strong BCP to be in place so that there is assured continuity and stable platform for the programmes to continue.</p><p>(b) Our beneficiaries won't be affected adversely, and there will be a lot more stability. It should be framed in peacetime like now, so that when we are hit with an unexpected crisis, we will be able to confidently rely on an established protocol and a framework in the BCP that we can immediately trigger.</p><p>Charities' best qualities are exemplified by their dedication to service and kindness</p><p>36. Finally, before I conclude, I want to say a few words about Forward SG.</p><p>37. For the past year, Singaporeans have been actively, proactively in many cases, sharing their vision of what a future Singapore would look like, not just a future Singapore that they want to see because of policy, but how can they participate proactively in making a future Singapore go from an aspiration to a reality.</p><p>38. That really is the core of the Forward Singapore exercise.</p><p>39. A couple of weeks ago, we finalised our report, we launched it, we explained what the six pillars of Forward SG stand for, how they interact with one another, and how they become the foundational pieces of a new Singapore and the plans for a new social compact in Singapore.</p><p>40. At the heart of the social compact is the idea or the notion that we all have a responsibility to contribute to the well-being of our communities.</p><p>41. It is the idea that no one exists as an island, that we are all interconnected, that we all can and should contribute to the well-being of one another. And the fundamental idea is that in order for us to make Singapore truly inclusive and accessible, all of us have a role in doing that.</p><p>42. This concept applies, if not equally, much more strongly in the charity sector.</p><p>43. The charities embody this idea entirely, each and every one of you, in the work that you do, and in the beneficiaries that you touch daily. Your work complements the government's efforts to help foster greater social cohesion, a sense of belonging, a sense of community through volunteerism and community service.</p><p>44. All of you run organisations that in itself might be small or large, but collectively the social impact is tremendous, creating a very positive societal impact.</p><p>(a) The Government will commit to continuing to provide opportunities and assurances for charities and communities to contribute in your own way. We recognise that we want you to contribute in your own way, because each of your charities, each of your beneficiaries, you are all serving a different sector of society, and collectively we can become greater than the sum of our parts.</p><p>45. We want to do this to nurture a stronger culture of giving, especially among those who have done well in our society, better connect donors and volunteers to local community needs, thereby strengthening our multiracialism, our intrinsic quality of diversity, and greater interaction between different groups because charity knows no colour, creed or religion.</p><p>46. As a result of doing all this, to create a lot more avenues for ground-up participation, opportunities for us to step up to contribute and to make a greater impact than we can do on our own.</p><p>47. I hope that we can all think about what you do, the work that you do in the context of the Forward Singapore ideals and philosophy, and think of how we can come together to really build a truly caring, inclusive, resilient society for Singaporeans.</p><p>48. On that note, I want to just underscore the point I made right at the start, much as we want to move forward, evolve, look at developing trends in Singapore, at the core of what we need to get right is openness, accountability, and I would say, utmost scruples when it comes to scrutiny.</p><p>49. When we can assure the public of this, we will have a tremendous foundation on which to move forward with our programmes. Let us not shy away from scrutiny, but welcome it as an opportunity to learn, to improve, to innovate and to do better.</p><p>Closing: Together, we can make a positive impact through greater governance and accountability.</p><p>50. In closing, I hope this conference will give you some exposure to different learning, different experiences, thought leadership, and share ideas.</p><p>51. I think what is most important too, if you look around the room today, we come from different and diverse sectors, and a range of different experiences.</p><p>52. I hope that you also walk away from today with more networks, more friendships, more connections, because when we can do that and we can bring our charity sector together, then I think we will really be in a strong position to make a real positive impact.</p><p>53. Collectively, this charity sector will rise up in terms of the quality, uplifting each and every one of the charities to be able to serve Singapore and Singaporeans much better.</p><p>54. Thank you very much.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Professional Services, ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063241304</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69S8-0HK1-JB5M-W53M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2685\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 21, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00097CE</classCode><className>CULTURE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000278</classCode><className>CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000404</classCode><className>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000194</classCode><className>BOARDS OF DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009U56</classCode><className>HUMANITIES &amp; SOCIAL SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001976</classCode><className>SECURITIES &amp; OTHER INVESTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009P1Y</classCode><className>SOCIAL SCIENCE EDUCATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001976</classCode><className>SECURITIES &amp; OTHER INVESTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>PE000A0WL</classCode><className>SELLAPAN RAMA NATHAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It is a great privilege to join you at the World Sustainability Forum. I would also like to say a big hello to all the friends who are joining us virtually.</p><p>2. This year's World Sustainability Forum is held in Singapore for the first time, and also in Basel and Toronto. This global focus is appropriate because the effects of climate change can be felt worldwide, and presents an existential threat to all of humanity.</p><p>3. Indeed, Switzerland, Canada and Singapore have all experienced the impacts of rising global temperature. A Swiss weather balloon had to climb to an unprecedented 5,300 metres before temperatures fell to 0 degrees Celsius. This surpassed the previous record of 5,184 metres, which was set just a year ago. Since surveys began, the zero-degree line has risen between 200 to 700 metres, depending on the season. The zero-degree line is a key meteorological marker. Its rise demonstrates how the global water cycle has been impacted by climate change. Canada has been affected by an ongoing, record-setting series of wildfires beginning in March. According to scientists, these fires were made at least twice as likely by climate change. Singapore, too, has not been spared. In fact, we experienced the highest recorded temperature of 37 degrees Celsius in the last 40 years in May this year. And this decade is the warmest decade that we are experiencing.</p><p>4. What this shows is that climate change does not impact us in silos. Rather, it impacts all of us, which underscores the importance of partnerships, both domestically and internationally, to tackle climate change.</p><p>Supporting Climate Science</p><p>5. As a global community, we must continue to support the science of climate change, so that we can better understand its effects, and how we can mitigate or adapt. We are happy to have Associate Professor Winston Chow elected to the IPCC, or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This is just one way to show how Singaporeans are making an impact globally, and also having that connection to the rest of the global community. The IPCC prepares the Assessment Reports about the latest state of scientific, technical and socio-economic knowledge on climate change, its impacts and risks, as well as options for mitigating the pace of climate change. As IPCC's Co-Chair for Working Group II, Prof Chow will contribute towards international efforts to assessing the impacts, adaptation and vulnerabilities related to climate change.</p><p>6. The work that the IPCC does helps us with knowledge accumulation, to understand the regional and local impacts of climate change. In Singapore, this has been the focus of the Centre of Climate Change ResearchSingapore (CCRS) since it was established in 2013. More recently, CCRS is completing our Third National Climate Change Study (or V3), incorporating the latest findings from the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report.</p><p>7. These findings will produce an updated set of localised projections of key climate variables, such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, winds and sea level, for Singapore and the Southeast Asia region up to 2100 and beyond. This will be used to guide Singapore in many important areas, such as understanding the localised impact of climate change, as well as developing and reviewing our climate adaptation policies and plans. Internationally, Singapore will also be progressively sharing V3 data through platforms such as the climate impacts assessment tools of the UN Food &amp; Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to enable users to conduct more detailed assessments of the impact of climate change on agriculture. Countries in the region can share information and equip themselves better in understanding the effects of climate change. We have been offering these data through various ASEAN platforms and many of our counterparts have indicated interest to understand the impact of climate change from the IPCC, brought down to the Southeast Asia region.</p><p>Developing Climate Strategies</p><p>8. Understanding the impacts of climate change informs our climate strategies for areas such as heat stress and coastal protection.</p><p>9. As temperatures rise, it is important that Singaporeans are well equipped to protect ourselves and our loved ones. My Ministry launched the Heat Stress Advisory to help our general population make more informed decisions on undertaking prolonged outdoor activities, so that they can minimise the risk of heat stress and heat-related illnesses. For our attendees from Singapore, I encourage you to check the myENV app for the Heat Stress levels when planning for outdoor activities. Please share with your friends and family about the Heat Stress Advisory, and encourage them to download the myENV app! Sometimes in Singapore, we take our weather for granted because we are always in the tropics and the range of temperatures is consistent. But there are new factors that require us to be more sensitive to the weather, and we need to have the humility to acknowledge what the weather can do to our well-being. It is good to be more sensitive, to read up about weather forecasts, and to have that sense of awareness that can help us navigate through different weather conditions. Make it a habit, as you do in other countries, to pay attention to weather forecasts before you go out in Singapore.</p><p>10. Last week, I attended the launch of our Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute, or CFI. We had earlier announced PUB, Singapore's Water Agency's, new $125 million Coastal Protection &amp; Flood Management Research Programme and establishment of a Centre of Excellence to conduct coastal science research. CFI Singapore will facilitate the development of knowledge to support the various workstreams that PUB has embarked on to protect our coastlines, and harness expertise from our Institutes of Higher Learning.</p><p>Driving Sustainable Solutions through Partnerships</p><p>11. You may ask, does SUSS have a role? You definitely have a role, because when you look at adaptation, community and societal responses are absolutely important. Engineering solutions will not be effective unless communities embrace it, unless societies are able to live with the new adapted environments. In this process of change and getting ourselves ready, it is important for us to look at issues such as behavioural change for heat stress. We want this adaptation to be an inclusive one, and the societal aspect of it - to study the impact of all these adaptations on society, on humans, on communities, is an important part of our research programme.</p><p>12. Now that I have shared about the \"brainy\" topic of climate science, we need to go to the \"heart\" of the issue - how can we rally the community to work together to drive sustainable solutions?</p><p>Rallying the Community</p><p>13. In Singapore, we recognise the need for a Whole-of-Nation approach to rally the community and promote sustainability. To this end, my Ministry launched Go Green SG in July this year to strengthen partnerships and galvanise collective action for environmental sustainability. More than 160 partners organised over 300 activities, programmes and experiences for over 70,000 participants.</p><p>14. And it is not just the Government that decides how Singapore tackles climate change. Our people, too, have a say, and we need all hands on deck. As part of our Forward SG movement, we have engaged over 2,200 Singaporeans from businesses, non-governmental organisations, schools and the community. A key theme of the conversations was the challenges and trade-offs that Singapore must balance when it comes to environmental sustainability.</p><p>Partnerships to drive sustainable solutions</p><p>15. Besides rallying the community, partnerships are key to drive sustainable solutions that will have social and community impact - the focus of our forum today. For example, we have partnered with researchers to advance science-based solutions, to issues such as urban heat in Singapore, more closely. The Cooling Singapore 2.0 project led by the Singapore-ETH Centre is developing a digital model to simulate our urban climate and assess the effectiveness of various heat mitigation strategies. This enables us to understand urban heat in Singapore better and identify cost-effective heat mitigation strategies.</p><p>16. Our SG Eco Fund supports ground-up solutions for a greener and more sustainable Singapore. For the most recent grant call, about 80 sustainability projects were awarded $2.4 million.</p><p>17. The broad range of projects will help us to move towards our climate and Green Plan goals. Carolin Barr, who will be speaking next, is the founder of susGain, a recipient of the SG Eco Fund. The SG Eco Fund supported susGain to develop a 6-week gamified app challenge to champion schools to act on their commitment to reduce, recycle, reuse, and repurpose. I hear that the school communities have learnt a lot and had much fun through the activities, both in school and through the app. It is heartening to see many others like susGain, coming forward to go green in their own ways. If you have an idea for a project that supports environment sustainability and involves the community, I encourage you to apply for the SG Eco Fund, and be a part of Singapore's growing sustainability movement. This is really a good space for SUSS, where the science has to meet the people. We need a very fundamental change in mindset when it comes to protecting the environment. SUSS, through your faculty and students, has the ability to impact in getting the ground to be ready for this movement, to get mindset change and behavioural change.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>18. In conclusion, we can all make important contributions for sustainability. As individuals, we can encourage our friends and families to make simple changes to our everyday habits, such as by setting the air conditioning temperature to 25 degrees Celsius. Researchers can consider how to communicate your findings to the public more effectively, and pay greater attention to engaging the community. The example of susGain is really about communication and through gamification, causing change in behaviour. Businesses can lead the way by adopting more sustainable practices, tracking your carbon footprint and even setting a net zero target year.</p><p>19. In embracing sustainability as a core tenet of our collective vision, we can catalyse profound social and community impacts. Just as the challenge posed by climate change is multi-faceted, we need everyone on board to tackle it together. Forums like this one today can pave the way forward by sparking solutions for tomorrow.</p><p>20. I wish you all a very fruitful conference. Thank you.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Professional Services, Events, ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0062329567</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6962-2BF1-DXMP-K0V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1965\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 14, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Business &amp;

(but) I am hopeful the Anwar government can be much more proactive on the climate and biodiversity agenda,\" said Ms Meena Raman, president of Friends of the Earth Malaysia.</p><p> \"Recognising the climate emergency, recognising the importance of adaptation and loss and damage -- there is a lot that can be done.\"</p><p> She urged the new government, for example, to curb flooding not just by building grey infrastructure such as drainage tunnels, but also by channelling money into conservation and restoration of upstream forests and wetlands.</p><p> Like many countries in the region, Malaysia is regularly hit by the impacts of extreme weather and rising temperatures -- such as choking haze linked to regional forest fires, water shortages, droughts or severe floods.</p><p> Flooding that started in late 2021 caused nearly US$1.5 billion (S$1.98 billion) in losses and displaced more than 120,000 people.</p><p> Meanwhile, despite being one of the world's 17 countries with mega-rich biodiversity, Malaysia is also a major producer of palm oil, timber and timber products, which many environmentalists have blamed for high deforestation rates.</p><p> While chalking up a fifth year of declines in forest losses in 2021, Malaysia still ranked ninth among the top nations for tropical deforestation, according to Global Forest Watch.</p><p> Mr Henry Chan, head of conservation at WWF-Malaysia, said the government should seek to develop the country's natural resources sustainably -- or risk losing them.</p><p> \"Let's strengthen current political resolve and commit to meet our net-zero and other climate and biodiversity targets,\" he urged.</p><p> Although Malaysia often suffers monsoon season flooding -- which forests can help mitigate -- the issues of climate change and the environment were largely absent in the 2022 election. Voters were more concerned with the economy, healthcare, political stability, corruption and the cost of living.</p><p> Ms Raman said budget pressures from the economic impacts of the pandemic and inflation mean Malaysia should make a bigger push to access international green funding to help bankroll its climate action.</p><p> After the severe floods in late 2021, for example, Malaysia sought US$3 million from the donor-backed Green Climate Fund to develop a national plan to adapt to climate change.</p><p>Malaysia has a goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, and the previous government's 2022 budget earmarked RM100 million (S$30.8 million) to help states protect forests and marine areas, up from RM70 million previously.</p><p> Ms Raman said greater financial incentives were needed for states whose economies largely rely on plantations of crops like durian, to help them stem forest loss.</p><p> The Prime Minister's Office did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p> Mr Renard Siew, a climate change adviser at Malaysian think-tank Centre for Governance and Political Studies, said many local green groups welcomed the quick decision to merge the natural resources and environment ministries. The move will consolidate work and make handling environmental issues easier, he noted.</p><p> Many environmentalists also now hope the government will bring in a \"Climate Change Act\", along with a national strategy for climate adaptation, first proposed in 2018 but sidelined amid political turmoil after 2020.</p><p> Ms Nur Sakeenah Omar, a campaigner at Greenpeace Malaysia, said Mr Anwar, who in January visited neighbouring Indonesia on his first overseas trip as leader, should also introduce a clean air or transboundary haze pollution act.</p><p> As an opposition leader since the 1990s, Mr Anwar had a record of highlighting issues linked to climate change, including flooding, deforestation and air pollution, in both the media and Parliament, according to Greenpeace Malaysia.</p><p> In mid-2021, he pointed to illegal logging in protected areas as a factor contributing to flooding in rural Kedah state, calling for better monitoring.</p><p> WWF-Malaysia's Mr Chan urged the new government to focus on protecting nature and implementing commitments made at international climate and biodiversity summits.</p><p> The coalition's political parties must also fulfil their election promises on the environment, he said.

These meetings address progress on global efforts to battle climate change, and are attended by heads of state, ministers, climate activists, civil society representatives and business leaders. Cop27, which will be the 27th such conference, will be held from Nov 6 to 18 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Why it mattersThe conference is arguably the highest-level gathering focused on combating climate change, and throws a spotlight on governments' commitments on this front.</p><p> Such commitments are coming under ever-greater scrutiny as the world's climate crisis grows more dire. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body for assessing the science related to climate change, said earlier this year that the world is headed towards unavoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two decades and stressed the necessity of urgent action.</p><p> Given the attention surrounding the conference, many private-sector organisations use the opportunity to announce new developments at the event.</p><p> What Cop27 hopes to achieveEgypt has declared its aim to make this year's conference an \"implementation Cop\" by urging action across prior agreements through all areas of climate change needs and dealing with the issue of how the world will pay for the estimated US$125 trillion bill to tackle climate change by 2050. </p><p> This, while keeping the focus on enabling a just and managed transition to a sustainable economic model, and \"ensuring that no country or group is left behind\" -- a pronouncement that will be tested as the world observes how and if richer nations will come to the aid of their poorer counterparts.</p><p> Much of the focus will also be on countries' efforts to deliver on the landmark Paris Agreement that came out of Cop21 in 2015. Then, 196 parties agreed to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels, by cutting their greenhouse gas emissions until they reach net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p> The Paris Agreement is a legally binding agreement that works on a five-year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action carried out by signatories. These plans are known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).</p><p> What to expect from AsiaThe Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) recently published a report that analysed the NDCs of most major Asian countries and found that many still lack details in terms of how they intend to reach their emission-reduction targets.</p><p> EIU is expecting a softening in ambition from Asia as the region deals with energy costs and security in the fallout of the war in Ukraine:</p><p> EIU said it foresees that developing Asian countries such as India and Indonesia will find it difficult to secure meaningful commitments at Cop27 from the developed world to finance their energy transition, given the volatile economic and geopolitical environment.</p><p> \"The lack of sufficient mitigation finance, a monetary tightening cycle in major Western economies and high material costs for renewable projects will make energy transition costlier. This will result in countries showing greater resistance to wean themselves off dirty fuels such as coal, and could weaken the climate policy stance taken by developing Asia at the conference,\" it added.</p><p> It also expects that recent extreme weather events in Europe and the US will shift domestic public sentiment in these countries towards channelling climate adaptation funds towards domestic needs before committing to assist other countries, which will be detrimental to negotiations on providing financial support for developing Asian countries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Drought-stricken Lake Mead in Nevada; the Cop27 conference is arguably the highest-level gathering focused on combating climate change, and throws a spotlight on governments' commitments on this front.

But abroad it is a different story. </p><p> \"He talked about the things America accomplished, but he made it feel like they've done enough -- and there's so much more to be done,\" 15-year-old Nigerian activist Amara Nwuneli told The New York Times. </p><p> Climate activists insist the US needs to own up to its role in climate change, put a hard stop to fossil fuel development and channel funds to developing countries to help them cope with devastating losses from climate disasters. </p><p> Mr Ani Dasgupta, president and chief executive of research non-profit World Resources Institute, said \"the inconvenient truth is that the US is grossly underperforming on its international climate finance commitments\". </p><p> Poorer countries bear the brunt of a climate crisis they have only had a bit part in creating but are among the least equipped to deal with, he noted.</p><p> Mr Joseph Sikulu, Pacific managing director at global climate advocacy organisation 350.org, added: \"While the Pacific is heartened to hear that the US is on track to reach its goals for the Paris Agreement by 2030, we need to see action. </p><p> \"Small island states cannot afford to waver on the commitment to 1.5 deg C of warming, and the US is complicit in our devastation unless they phase out fossil fuels. </p><p> \"This means redirecting the billions of dollars of fossil fuel subsidies into genuine climate finance. Not insurance schemes and not minor investments in climate adaptation, but finance that is sufficient and accessible to the communities that need it most.\"</p><p> Mr Dasgupta acknowledged that Mr Biden is advancing \"the boldest climate agenda of any American president by far\", but added: \"Ambitious actions at home now need to be matched by equally robust investments to advance climate action abroad.\"</p><p> \"While the Biden administration has consistently reiterated its US$11.4 billion annual climate pledge, US officials have yet to outline a credible pathway to deliver on that promise,\" he said. </p><p> Developing country negotiators are looking for the US to put real weight into creating a collective funding stream to help them recover from devastating losses from climate disasters. </p><p> \"If the United States continues to resist real progress on financing for loss and damage, it could put the entire proceedings of this climate summit in jeopardy,\" Mr Dasgupta warned. </p><p>Pakistan, still reeling from the most devastating floods in the nation's modern history, is among those urging the unlocking of emergency financing. </p><p> Its Climate Change Minister Sherry Rehman said the pace of climate diplomacy does not meet the needs of the country, as it struggles to recover from an estimated US$30 billion in economic losses from the floods. </p><p> \"The political advances we make here will have very little meaning on the ground unless there is a transfer of resources that shifts the needle on how people face the future,\" she told Reuters on the sidelines of the COP27 summit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>US President Joe Biden after delivering his speech during the COP27 climate conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.

She expressed Singapore's commitment to support the LDCs' progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and called on the international community to support the LDCs in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by: (a) supporting climate resilience; (b) closing the financing gap; (c) accelerating digital transformation; and (d) strengthening global partnerships. She also shared about Singapore's partnership with fellow developing countries to enhance capacity building under the Singapore Cooperation Programme. The transcript of SMS Sim's speech is appended.</p><p>National Statement by Senior Minister of State For Foreign Affairs and National Development of Singapore Sim Ann at the Second Part of the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries</p><p>Mr President, Excellencies,</p><p>1. Let me first convey Singapore's appreciation to the Government of Qatar and the United Nations for organising this important meeting.</p><p>2. When we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, we made the fundamental commitment to \"leave no one behind\". We have now reached the critical mid-point of our journey. There is great urgency to reaffirm this core commitment and step up our efforts to address the needs and priorities of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs).</p><p>3. In May last year, the UN Secretary-General warned that the \"very viability of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030\" is at risk. The LDCs are among those facing the greatest difficulties. They have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.</p><p>4. But there are also opportunities to \"rescue\" the SDGs as highlighted by the Secretary-General. This Conference is one such opportunity. We need to fulfil our commitment to the LDCs through concrete and collective action. Allow me to highlight four areas where we should focus our efforts: First, supporting climate resilience. The LDCs are the least responsible for climate change but are among the hardest hit. To help the LDCs build long-term resilience against the impact of climate change, we need to significantly scale up technical and financial support from the international community. In this regard, we strongly support the target of allocating 50 percent of climate financing to climate adaptation.</p><p>5. Second, closing the financing gap. Widening fiscal deficits and increased debt burden are hampering the ability of LDCs to eradicate poverty, respond to external shocks, invest in their people, and build inclusive societies. We must reform the global financial architecture to provide the scale and reliability of financing required to achieve the SDGs.</p><p>6. Third, accelerating digital transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of digital technology worldwide, but it has also laid bare the huge digital divide among and within countries. Only 25 percent of people in the LDCs use the Internet, compared to 80 percent in advanced economies. If we are serious about closing the digital divide, we will need to step up efforts to promote universal connectivity, enhance digital skills and training, and invest in digital infrastructure.</p><p>7. Fourth, strengthening global partnerships. Our experience with COVID-19 has shown that multilateral cooperation is the best way forward. Singapore strongly supports the Doha Programme of Action's call for a renewed and strengthened global partnership with South-South cooperation as an important pillar. Since 1992, the Singapore Cooperation Programme or SCP has been our platform for technical cooperation with developing countries. It originated as a way for Singapore to share our development experience and pay forward the assistance that we had received during our formative years. We have cooperated with UN agencies to deliver programmes in the Asia-Pacific and Africa. Our Third Country partnerships, including those with Chile, Japan, Qatar, Thailand, Trkiye, and the US, have facilitated North-South and South-South Cooperation. To date, we have welcomed close to 150,000 government officials as part of our SCP programmes, with more than 40 percent from the LDCs. This year, we will launch a three-year Sustainability Action Package to support capacity-building for all developing countries, focusing on resilience building strategies, green project management and financing, as well as carbon market development. We will continue to work with our partners to pool resources and expertise to better meet the needs of LDCs.</p><p>Excellencies,</p><p>8. As a global community, we must not leave anyone behind in our collective journey towards the SDGs. In line with the theme of this conference, \"From Potential to Prosperity\", let us work together to support the LDCs to realise their vast potential and achieve a prosperous future.</p><p>9. Thank you.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Events]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0060345552</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67PW-6061-DXMP-K1HK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"971\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 6, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>N928120MM</classCode><className>STATE DEPARTMENTS &amp;

I am happy to join you today to kickstart an exchange of views on sustainability, a topic of great resonance and importance not only to Singapore, but also the wider world</p><p>As we just heard from Kaylee, GAIL stands for \"Greening ASEAN: Initiatives and Leadership\".</p><p>This theme, of greening ASEAN, is relevant to countries both in the region and the world.</p><p>Climate change is an existential challenge of our times.</p><p>Today, all 10 ASEAN Member States are feeling the acute impact of a changing climate, be it through heatwaves and drought, or tropical storms and floods.</p><p>These extreme weather events are destroying infrastructure, disrupting economic activity, upending livelihoods, or worse taking lives.</p><p>So I commend the ONERHT Foundation for convening this Forum for the sixth time, to raise awareness and build momentum on putting sustainability into practice among your network of partners, stakeholders and clients.</p><p>The focus of this year's Forum - on energy, strategy and finance - is especially timely.</p><p>A study by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in 2022 identified insufficient financial resources, lack of R&amp;D, technology and expertise, and insufficient alternative energy resources as the top three obstacles to decarbonisation in ASEAN.</p><p>Even so, given the scale and depth of the climate challenge in our region, and indeed globally, we have no time to waste.</p><p>While we may not yet fully understand the effects of climate change, nor can we foretell the future, we must do what we can, now.</p><p>Left unchecked, the cumulative effects of climate change and rising sea levels could be even more severely damaging to all life on Earth.</p><p>I am glad that citizens in ASEAN recognise this.</p><p>In a survey conducted earlier this year across ASEAN, more than 57 percent of respondents ranked climate change as the region's second biggest challenge, after unemployment and economic recession.</p><p>As societies, we should collectively invest in sustainability as a priority, not just because it is fashionable or generates good returns today, but out of a sense of responsibility to future generations.</p><p>Indeed, we are but temporary custodians of this planet.</p><p>Let us be responsible stewards in the way we live, work, produce and consume, so as to hand over a healthy and functioning ecosystem to those who come after us.</p><p>To be effective and responsible stewards requires taking an all-hands-on-deck approach to sustainability, with the public, private and people sectors each playing our part and working together.</p><p>I am glad that you have brought together a diverse group - topical experts, regional practitioners, advocacy groups, businesses and investors - to discuss how we can work together to build a more sustainable world and a better future.</p><p>Now, how then should we think about stewarding a more sustainable future for ASEAN, and for the world?</p><p>Let me suggest four interlinking dimensions, using the \"GAIL\" acronym.</p><p>First, Galvanise.</p><p>In 2015, governments around the world negotiated the UN Paris Agreement and committed to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>8 years on, we are working diligently to deliver on this commitment. But there remains much to be done.</p><p>As a first step, governments should lay out a clear and deliberate vision to rally public support for a more sustainable future.</p><p>In Singapore, for example, we have published our Green Plan 2030 as a whole-of-nation sustainability roadmap, with clearly defined and concrete targets across sectors including energy, transport and infrastructure.</p><p>Several ASEAN governments have also outlined explicit targets for the achievement of net-zero emissions.</p><p>It will also be useful to have the world's two largest economies, the US and China, cooperate in leading the world in this green transition.</p><p>Now, in tandem, the private sector can also help to mobilise greater momentum for sustainability.</p><p>Businesses are increasingly setting out their own net-zero targets, to support national sustainability goals.</p><p>I understand that ONERHT, for instance, has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030.</p><p>As Environment and Social Governance, or ESG, metrics gain greater prominence in investment and risk assessments, corporates will need to clearly articulate their core principles and metrics.</p><p>The ONERHT Foundation's G.R.A.C.E principles - Governance, Risk management, Anti-money laundering, Compliance and Ethics - are one such good example.</p><p>Such frameworks give businesses a common base understanding from which to map out their sustainability strategies, assess the progress they have made over time, and redeploy resources and expertise if necessary.</p><p>So that's the first \"G\", Galvanise.</p><p>Second, Accelerate.</p><p>As a region, ASEAN will need an estimated US$3.1 trillion in infrastructure investment alone between 2023 and 2030 to sustain economic growth, reduce poverty and respond to climate change.</p><p>It is unlikely that governments on their own can meet such high investment demands, especially amid prevailing global economic uncertainties.</p><p>The private sector and philanthropies can therefore help to unlock new green transition opportunities by crowding in private and other forms of capital to augment public expenditure.</p><p>Philanthropic capital, in particular, can be deployed via blended finance instruments to support high-risk investments and make projects more commercially viable.</p><p>This can have a powerful demonstrative effect that sustainability can be a profitable investment theme.</p><p>And in turn, this could draw more investment for sustainability-related projects.</p><p>Third, Innovate.</p><p>Stewarding ASEAN towards a more sustainable future will require significant innovation and technological breakthroughs, to lower the costs and raise the benefits of the green transitions required.</p><p>Within ASEAN, we can explore suitable options in renewable energy, reusable plastics, nature-based solutions and other innovations.</p><p>Besides mitigation and reducing emissions, we can also explore solutions for climate adaptation - to tackle problems relating to rising sea levels and food system disruptions.</p><p>ASEAN Member States should invest in R&amp;D and build closer cross-border scientific and research collaborations to harness one another's strengths.</p><p>For example, the National Research Foundation that I chair supports the Singapore Academies Southeast Asia Fellowship.</p><p>We have seen postgraduate researchers from the region do interesting work on emissions reduction, hydrogen storage and carbon capture.</p><p>But there is much more that we can do to meet ASEAN's collective climate aspirations.</p><p>And this brings me to the fourth dimension, Leap.</p><p>In particular, innovations and breakthroughs must be deployed at scale to achieve tangible impact over the long-term.</p><p>ASEAN currently has a combined population of 665 million people, and this is expected to grow to 717 million by 2030 and 741 million by 2035.</p><p>As a region, there is great potential for any new breakthroughs to be scaled up to achieve impact.</p><p>Over the years, we have made good progress on economic integration within ASEAN, to form a single production base and market.</p><p>By making it easier for businesses to test-bed solutions and to scale up, ASEAN not only has a better chance to make the green transition but can also serve as a pathfinder. In this regard, ONERHT's work in the region in providing a whole range of services will be valuable.</p><p>And we must also learn from and collaborate with partners around the world, to make the green transition together.</p><p>So, the ONERHT Foundation has taken a similar collaborative approach, bringing together different stakeholders and partners to work together.</p><p>Today, you are taking a further step by launching the ethBe (eth-bee) platform.</p><p>This platform will build awareness and grow a community of ethical leaders under the G.R.A.C.E framework.</p><p>Podcasts, curated content and capacity building programmes will help lay the foundation for a culture of sustainability stewardship by building greater expertise in relevant areas like carbon accounting and the assessment of domain risk.</p><p>By tapping on the ONERHT Foundation's network of partners and clients, ethBe will also help to build a sustainability ecosystem to foster closer collaboration and amplify the impact of individual initiatives.</p><p>Such ground-up initiatives by the private sector will be useful in reinforcing efforts by ASEAN governments to mobilise greater climate and sustainability action.</p><p>In conclusion, let me reiterate the importance of treating sustainability not only as a priority for the present, but as part of the legacy that we will bequeath to future generations.</p><p>Building and preserving this legacy rests on all our shoulders - government, business, and the people sectors alike.</p><p>It is the actions we take today, individually and collectively, that will determine the kind of world we hand over to our children, and their children.</p><p>Forums like this one today are important to bring interested stakeholders from different backgrounds and expertise to exchange experiences, cross-pollinate ideas, and to seed fruitful collaborations.</p><p>So I encourage all of us here today to make the most of the presentations and panel discussions that follow, and may you leave today with fresh inspiration on how we can be responsible stewards for the planet to build a better world and a better future.</p><p>So I wish you all a fruitful Forum. Thank you.</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office Singapore</p><p>[Category: Professional Services, Accounting/ Audit/ Tax, Events, ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0061399766</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68RP-77S1-DXMP-K32F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1789\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 20, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIYD</classCode><className>ASEAN COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000278</classCode><className>CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000552</classCode><className>ECONOMIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

The first, published in August, detailed the underlying science of climate change; the third will look at ways of reducing those impacts.</p><p> \"This (second part of the report) recognises the interdependence of climate, biodiversity and people and integrates natural, social and economic sciences more strongly than earlier IPCC assessments,\" Lee said. \"It emphasises the urgency of immediate and more ambitious action to address climate risks. Half measures are no longer an option.\"</p><p>Urgent action required</p><p> Claire Aubertin-Noel, Growth Markets Corporate Strategy and Sustainability Centre of Excellence lead at global professional services company Accenture, said the IPCC report is \"the ultimate wake-up call for global climate action\".</p><p> \"There has to be a sense of urgency; the time to act is now. While a multitude of companies have been publishing net-zero targets - which is a good first step, as they did not even exist a year ago - what will now drive progress is the pace of implementation.</p><p> \"Businesses need to walk the talk in addressing climate change, executing on their public commitments.\"</p><p> Aubertin-Noel pointed out that funding is available - US$130 trillion of assets, which the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) has committed to being net zero by 2050 - while efforts are being made to harmonise global reporting standards for environment, social and governance (ESG)-related disclosures, which will bring transparency into what has traditionally been an opaque market.</p><p> \"So the challenge is now execution. Given the mounting pressure from all stakeholders - including regulators - ESG measurement is undeniably a top priority for all companies, and has moved from a CSR (corporate social responsibility) topic to a CEO (chief executive officer) agenda,\" she said.</p><p> Arjun Sethi, head of global management consulting firm Kearney's Apac region and vice-chair of Kearney's Digital Transformation Practice, feels the same sense of urgency; he said the IPCC's stark warning for all stakeholders reiterates the importance of direct and immediate action.</p><p> \"Businesses can no longer write off climate change as a problem for the next CEO; the status quo is falling away and there is a real cost to inaction, whether you are a government, global multinational or an SME (small and medium-sized enterprise),\" he said.</p><p> Jo Feng, senior vice-president, Asia area, at global biopharmaceutical business AstraZeneca, points out that \"the good news is that change is still within our grasp - but only if we all act swiftly and in every way we can\".</p><p> \"What we need to do now is focus on what changes can be made, through taking a science-driven approach, and how we mitigate the impact of climate change. Building resilience is key,\" she added.</p><p> Manish Pant, zone president, East Asia &amp; Japan, Schneider Electric, a global specialist in energy management and automation, believes climate change is a true challenge for humanity, and consumers, governments, and corporates all have a role to play in tackling climate change.</p><p> \"This includes rethinking approaches to energy and reducing carbon emissions drastically by establishing more sustainable practices,\" he said.</p><p>Efforts to adapt</p><p> But just as important as addressing the cause of climate change, through mitigation efforts such as decarbonisation, is the need to adapt to the effect of climate change - by changing the way we live.</p><p> Examples of climate adaptation include strengthening sea walls to brace for rising sea levels, managing forests to reduce the risk of forest fires and to prevent landslides, and planting crops that would be more resilient to weather extremes.</p><p> Adaptation solutions also abound in urban planning - an area in which governments and corporations can unite their efforts; these can take the form of climate-proofing infrastructure or greening buildings.</p><p> Climate adaptation efforts are crucial because weather extremes - such as increased heatwaves, droughts and floods - are already exceeding plants' and animals' tolerance thresholds, according to the IPCC's latest report; such events have also exposed millions of people to acute food and water insecurity.</p><p> Ambitious, accelerated action is therefore needed to adapt to climate change - at the same time as making rapid, deep cuts in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions - to avoid mounting loss of life, biodiversity and infrastructure, the IPCC added.</p><p> Feng says this means that scaling up investment in adaptation is no longer optional, given that the ability of nature and humanity to adapt to it will be outpaced without urgent action. \"There is no doubt climate change and our adaptation to it is one of the most complex issues that we face today.\"</p><p> Sethi agrees. \"We can't meet 2022 conditions and reach 2030 targets with a business model from 2015, whether you are a government or a private company,\" he said.</p><p> \"Scaling up investment in adaptation efforts will be useful to fund more effective initiatives in full, rather than half-measures, but without modernising climate strategies and incorporating effective metrics, these investments may have a limited impact.\"</p><p> Pant believes that governments worldwide must make a strong commitment to such efforts and take the lead in laying out the plans, implementing the relevant policy changes and regulations, and putting in place funding support to fuel the relevant adaptation strategies.</p><p> \"As the size and value of climate-related risks increase, corporates must also look at strategies to transform their business to adjust to the changing climate,\" he added.</p><p> Adaptation will be critical here in Asia, says Aubertin-Noel, given the region's contribution to GHG emissions, its population size - with the Asia-Pacific region representing 60 per cent of the world's population - and its growing economic heft.</p><p>COP27 and financing</p><p> So far, progress in adaptation has been uneven, says the IPCC: most observed adaptation is fragmented, small in scale, designed to respond to current impacts or near-term risks, and focused more on planning rather than implementation, with the largest adaptation gaps existing among the lower-income population groups.</p><p> Many will therefore be looking to this year's UN Climate Change Conference, COP27, to be held in Egypt in November, for governments' policy stances in this regard - and for indications on how poorer nations will be aided in their efforts.</p><p> Aubertin-Noel, citing a 2021 United Nations Global Compact-Accenture CEO Study on Sustainability, said the UN Environment Programme has estimated that adaptation costs will keep rising - reaching US$140 billion to US$300 billion a year in 2030, and US$280 billion to US$500 billion in 2050.</p><p> COP27 is likely to see financing efforts continue to push for adaptation strategies and solutions, especially to support those countries most at risk from climate change, Sethi said.</p><p> In Feng's view, the conference will be a welcome opportunity to build on commitments to achieve shared goals of reducing emissions and the impact of climate change, while also bringing a focus on funding for developing nations.</p><p>Partnerships</p><p> Pundits agree that concerted and coordinated action by various stakeholders will be needed to push through what has been deemed necessary by the IPCC to save the planet.</p><p> \"At every level of action,\" Sethi says, \"collaboration and cross-regional support hold the power to drive mutually beneficial sustainable efforts and create lucrative partnerships that benefit the environment, the people, and help a company survive the coming changes ... Regulation, technologies and initiatives must be implemented quickly for maximum impact.\"</p><p> Feng says greater collaboration through public-private partnerships is needed, along with genuine representation from developing countries most at risk of the consequences of climate change, to drive forward efforts to decarbonise. \"Science tells us it's time for everyone to do their part to limit the impacts of the climate crisis on our planet, and global partnership-driven initiatives play a crucial role in ensuring a secure future. No organisation, government, or institution can do it alone.\"</p><p> Pant believes that transformative policy change across more economies is urgently needed in order to decarbonise at the speed and scale required to achieve net-zero by 2050. \"This is because action from governments can accelerate even more action from companies,\" he said.</p><p> Aubertin-Noel agrees: \"Global companies can make an impact not only on the countries where they operate, but also on their ecosystem, such as the social and economic fabric, to influence consumers to make smarter, more eco-conscious choices.\"</p><p> Pant adds that technology will play a key role in aiding such efforts: digitisation, powered by the Internet of Things, can help companies create achievable targets for a greener future and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, while technological solutions can also help rural communities to become more productive, efficient and increase their local revenues. \"Apart from efforts by local governments, corporates too have a vital role to play in enabling access to energy and allowing energy-poor populations to develop in a sustainable way,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A farmer walking among orange trees dried out by drought in Morocco's agricultural heartland in 2020.

The Alliance of Small Island States was set to propose a loss and damage response fund after the failure to establish a similar facility at COP26 in Glasgow. </p><p>Germany's proposal for an insurance fund like Global Shield to allow a rapid financial response to climate impacts has been dismissed by climate campaigners as not extensive enough.</p><p> There appears to be good reason for developing nations to force this issue -- developed nations' pledge to provide a baseline of US$100 billion of climate finance annually by 2020 to assist decarbonisation efforts has still not been met, with the funding gap caused by richer nations' failure to act expected to be closed only next year or in 2024.</p><p> What a just transition means for investorsFor the conference to be a success, it is key that COP27 delivers meaningful progress on loss and damage. As climate disasters such as Pakistan's catastrophic flooding wreak havoc, we believe developing nations are right to demand reparations and climate justice.</p><p> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) this year highlighted the importance of accelerating progress towards a just transition, stating that sustainable development is concurrently able to enhance social inclusion.</p><p> The private sector can play a large role in financing a just transition and climate adaptation in communities that need it. </p><p> For investors, this means, among other actions, ensuring social factors are integrated into capital allocation and stewardship activities or investing in social bonds.</p><p> What else is on the COP agenda'Progress also needs to be made on climate change adaptation and resilience, given the fact that 3.3 billion people already live in climatically vulnerable areas, according to IPCC estimates. </p><p> Even if we manage to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, we are still likely to see risks to human health, livelihoods, water supplies, and food security.</p><p> Mitigation as ever would have played its part in the discussions, and again we believe there is work to do here. Nations agreed at COP26 to bolster their climate pledges, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), before COP27 as analyses in Glasgow (and more detailed calculations since) indicated that more needs to be done collectively to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 deg C.</p><p> A recently published NDC synthesis report from the United Nations shows that only 24 countries have updated their pledges since COP26, leaving many opportunities for improvement in Egypt. </p><p> After NDC enhancement, we believe it's important that the conversation moves on to actual implementation. </p><p> Indeed, India, which raised the issue of climate finance at COP27, has said its updated NDC is conditional on technology and finance transfer from developed nations.</p><p> Enabling a just transition to net zero can be seen as essential if we are to optimally address climate change, since allowing inequities to persist will likely impede climate action. </p><p> Moreover, even if we were able to resolve climate change while allowing inequities to persevere, we would just be trading an environmental catastrophe for a social one.</p><p> We believe just transition principles will be key for developing nations to be able to implement the pledges made in their NDCs. If fossil fuels are to be leapfrogged in favour of low-carbon alternatives, developed nations need to provide adequate support. </p><p> Here, as with loss and damage, there is much for the Global North and private sector investors to do.</p><p> The writer is global head of sustainability research, BNP Paribas Asset Management.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>As climate disasters such as Pakistan's catastrophic flooding wreak havoc, developing nations are right to demand reparations and climate justice.

As the ferocity of climate change becomes starker, it makes sense to confront immediate climate risks. The combination of climate adaptation and mitigation can allow us to prepare for the worst and achieve our sustainability ambitions. Singapore has set a vision to become a leading centre for sustainable finance and carbon solutions in Asia and globally. While we have made headway, what more can Singapore do to stand out as a regional hub'</p><p> Sustainable finance: a vital part of the region's decarbonisation and transition storyVarious measures under the Monetary Authority of Singapore's Green Finance Action Plan have helped lay a strong foundation for the development of a sustainable finance ecosystem here. Singapore itself has committed to issuing up to S$35 billion sovereign green bonds by 2030. The city state can seek to deepen its sustainable financing capabilities by fostering an enabling environment to scale sustainable finance in the region. This can include developing and implementing credible transition finance frameworks and taxonomies, two areas which the financial services industry is currently grappling with. Refinements to capital risk charges with respect to green and sustainable finance may also help move the needle to deepen the market, including benefiting more small and medium enterprises (SMEs). </p><p>Singapore is also well-placed to be a regional blended finance hub bringing different stakeholders from the private and public sector together to fund and participate in climate-related projects, such as through means of risk-absorbing capital, guarantees, viability gap grants, and project development funds. To bring this into play, the Republic can continue to double down on opportunities to work with neighbouring governments, and be part of their sustainability value chain -- for example, by supporting their renewable energy developments which in turn can help address Singapore's rising energy demands. Expanding our role in blended finance can also help support the region in much-needed adaptation measures. </p><p> Opportunities to lead in climate techTechnology solutions, such as those centred on carbon capture, removal, utilisation, and storage, can help accelerate the energy transition. Offering incentives for early-stage investments into climate tech solutions can create value and impact where it matters most.</p><p> The newly introduced Enterprise Innovation Scheme offers a 400 per cent tax deduction for the first S$400,000 of qualifying costs such as R&amp;D, IP acquisition, registration and licensing, and training costs. Businesses may opt to convert the tax deductions into cash, with the cash payout capped at S$20,000 a year. Encouraging early-stage investments into climate tech solutions can strengthen Singapore's global relevance in sustainability.</p><p> To further encourage ESG-linked businesses large and small throughout the environmental, social and governance (ESG) value chain to set up shop in Singapore while nudging local companies towards greener solutions, Singapore can consider an ESG-conducive tax incentives and grants regime. </p><p> Currently, tax incentives such as the Development and Expansion incentive (DEI) and Global Trader Programme (GTP) offer concessionary tax rates of 5 per cent or 10 per cent to qualifying companies. While these incentives are broad enough to cater to ESG businesses, in many cases ESG firms may not fit squarely within these schemes due to their business model and size. These tax incentives could be more flexible. Their eligibility thresholds should be suitably adjusted to support desired ESG businesses such as carbon credits/offsets traders, exchanges, brokers and other sustainable solutions providers.</p><p> Furthermore, while grants relating to ESG businesses are already available, these tend to be focused on encouraging investments to improve energy efficiency. It would be helpful if the grants could be expanded to support broader ESG ecosystem development such as ESG measurement, reporting and training. While there is good support through the Enterprise Sustainability Programme to help organisations kick-start their sustainability efforts, businesses need more support to develop capabilities related to carbon measurement, decarbonisation and sustainability reporting. </p><p> Given the complex nature of sustainability issues, including the sector specificities, it would be timely to introduce more granular and tailored training to help build capabilities across sectors, enabling new jobs and roles. </p><p> With the ambiguities in navigating the ESG space, businesses would welcome certainty and stability in the tax environment, which Singapore can offer. For example, the amendment made to the GST treatment of a sale of carbon credits (from 7 per cent GST to no GST) in November 2022, and the related clarifications published by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras), provide certainty and clarity which businesses appreciate (notwithstanding that many had hopes for a zero-rated GST treatment which would allow GST on expenses to be fully claimable). Meanwhile, there remains ambiguity on the GST treatment of other ESG-related instruments such as Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and the related Contract for Differences. To this end, there remains scope for further policy and legislative review to fine-tune the GST treatment.</p><p> While companies may find it hard to navigate tax incentives and grants, the good news is studies have proven that these schemes can lead to a win-win of decarbonisation plus the added bonus of improving profits. They should also help to improve the overall bankability of green projects.</p><p> Amid the international push towards a global minimum tax, ESG-related grants are particularly relevant as there is potentially less scope to use tax incentives to attract new ESG-linked investments and strengthen the city's ESG ecosystem.</p><p>Singapore has been ambitious in its sustainability efforts despite the pandemic crisis. To continue to maintain its leadership in sustainability, continual policy calibrations will be needed to respond to changing environmental, societal and economic needs. Maintaining our sustainability hub leadership is key, and so we look forward to further details during the Committee of Supply debates. </p><p> The writers are from PwC Singapore.

There is therefore a greater need to determine how this should be shared with local communities so that they benefit fairly from the sale of credits from their area. </p><p> Benefits include sustainable jobs for the local people, contributions to their economy, improved health and livelihoods, and the empowerment of women and indigenous people.</p><p> Ben Scheelk is programme officer of The Ocean Foundation, which is dedicated to reversing the destruction of ocean environments around the world. He said that his organisation deliberately avoids thinking of their projects as carbon-credit projects: \"These are community habitat restoration conservation projects, and projects centred around engaging the local community and providing support. And they are not just about climate mitigation -- they're about climate adaptation and climate resilience.\"</p><p> He said his foundation makes the extra effort to identify related ecotourism opportunities and other benefits such as coral reef restoration in its blue-carbon projects. Blue carbon refers to the carbon captured and sequestered in ocean and coastal ecosystems.</p><p> And they are working to ensure that, in projects currently being pursued in Puerto Rico and Mexico, the ownership of the credits will go to the local governments. \"I want to drive the financing directly to them. I don't necessarily want a return on investment per se, but rather a source of financing that is long-term and provides the resources needed to ensure the monitoring of these projects and other kinds of community benefits,\" Scheelk said.</p><p> Leah Glass, technical advisor for mangroves and blue carbon at social enterprise Blue Ventures, said access to data is critical. Her firm focuses on nurturing and sustaining locally led marine conservation.</p><p> \"The very foundation of ocean governance and high integrity carbon credits is transparency. Carbon credits require monitoring, evaluation, learning and reporting. So does adaptive resource management,\" she said.</p><p> \"So, if local people get engaged in its monitoring and have access to the data, they're able to make decisions and more effectively manage their resources. I do think that kind of transparency in the carbon sector is one of the key kind of weapons that we have against the potential for poorly designed products that don't safeguard the rights of communities.\"</p><p> Natalia Arango, chief executive of Fondo Accion, a Colombian private fund focused on sustainable investments in the environment and children, added that it is also important that jurisdictions establish quality standards for such projects and ensure that they are enforced. \"Colombia, for example, has a scheme of safeguards, but they're not really enforcing it. Enforcement is really crucial to ensure the quality of the standards that are being used.  \"The other very important thing to effectively channel benefits to communities is to have transparent benefit-sharing mechanisms that have been built by the communities. And these have to be audited periodically.\"</p><p> And the voice and views of local and indigenous communities have to be considered. \"They are much more engaged and thoughtful than has been reported,\" said Mike Korchinsky, founder of Wildlife Works, which aims to bring innovative market-based solutions to the challenges of conserving biodiversity.</p><p> \"Many of them do understand that they are part of this global society, and that they do need help and investment. (But), there aren't enough voices from these communities in (environmental) conversations.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-7EMBFD</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66K5-G0P1-DYX4-01Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

These meetings address progress on global efforts to battle climate change, and are attended by heads of state, ministers, climate activists, civil society representatives and business leaders. Cop27, which will be the 27th such conference, will be held from Nov 6 to 18 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Why it matters The conference is arguably the highest-level gathering focused on combatting climate change, and throws a spotlight on governments' commitments on this front. Such commitments are coming under ever-greater scrutiny as the world's climate crisis grows more dire. </p><p>The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body for assessing the science related to climate change, said earlier this year that the world is headed towards unavoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two decades and stressed the necessity of urgent action. Given the attention surrounding the conference, many private-sector organisations use the opportunity to announce new developments at the event. What Cop27 hopes to achieve Egypt has declared its aim to make this year's conference an \"implementation Cop\" by urging action across prior agreements through all areas of climate change needs and dealing with the issue of how the world will pay for the estimated US$125 trillion bill to tackle climate change by 2050. This, while keeping the focus on enabling a just and managed transition to a sustainable economic model, and \"ensuring that no country or group is left behind\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a pronouncement that will be tested as the world observes how and if richer nations will come to the aid of their poorer counterparts. Much of the focus will also be on countries' efforts to deliver on the landmark Paris Agreement that came out of Cop21 in 2015. Then, 196 parties agreed to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels, by cutting their greenhouse gas emissions until they reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding agreement that works on a five-year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action carried out by signatories. These plans are known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). What to expect from Asia The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) recently published a report that analysed the NDCs of most major Asian countries and found that many still lack details in terms of how they intend to reach their emission-reduction targets. EIU is expecting a softening in ambition from Asia as the region deals with energy costs and security in the fallout of the war in Ukraine: China, despite being the global leader in renewable energy investments, will likely maintain a soft approach towards the fossil fuels needed to fuel its massive economy in the short to medium term; the mainland has in recent months encouraged higher domestic coal production to ensure energy security and stable economic growth; India and Indonesia will remain major coal consumers in the next decade, while pushing for greater funding from the developed world for supporting their clean-energy transition; Japan and South Korea will remain committed to transitioning to a low-carbon economy, but recent energy market turbulence has renewed their governments' focus on energy security, which is likely to mean more support for nuclear energy in both countries. EIU said it foresees that developing Asian countries such as India and Indonesia will find it difficult to secure meaningful commitments at Cop27 from the developed world to finance their energy transition, given the volatile economic and geopolitical environment. \"The lack of sufficient mitigation finance, a monetary tightening cycle in major Western economies and high material costs for renewable projects will make energy transition costlier. This will result in countries showing greater resistance to wean themselves off dirty fuels such as coal, and could weaken the climate policy stance taken by developing Asia at the conference,\" it added. It also expects that recent extreme weather events in Europe and the US will shift domestic public sentiment in these countries towards channelling climate adaptation funds towards domestic needs before committing to assist other countries, which will be detrimental to negotiations on providing financial support for developing Asian countries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The world is headed towards unavoidable multiple climate hazards in the coming years; can a global climate conference make a difference?</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66K5-G0P1-DYX4-01WR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

There is therefore a greater need to determine how this should be shared with local communities so that they benefit fairly from the sale of credits from their area. Benefits include sustainable jobs for the local people, contributions to their economy, improved health and livelihoods, and the empowerment of women and indigenous people.Ben Scheelk is programme officer of The Ocean Foundation, which is dedicated to reversing the destruction of ocean environments around the world. </p><p>He said that his organisation deliberately avoids thinking of their projects as carbon-credit projects: \"These are community habitat restoration conservation projects, and projects centred around engaging the local community and providing support. And they are not just about climate mitigation - they're about climate adaptation and climate resilience.\"He said his foundation makes the extra effort to identify related ecotourism opportunities and other benefits such as coral reef restoration in its blue-carbon projects. Blue carbon refers to the carbon captured and sequestered in ocean and coastal ecosystems.And they are working to ensure that, in projects currently being pursued in Puerto Rico and Mexico, the ownership of the credits will go to the local governments. \"I want to drive the financing directly to them. I don't necessarily want a return on investment per se, but rather a source of financing that is long-term and provides the resources needed to ensure the monitoring of these projects and other kinds of community benefits,\" Scheelk said.Leah Glass, technical advisor for mangroves and blue carbon at social enterprise Blue Ventures, said access to data is critical. Her firm focuses on nurturing and sustaining locally led marine conservation.\"The very foundation of ocean governance and high integrity carbon credits is transparency. Carbon credits require monitoring, evaluation, learning and reporting. So does adaptive resource management,\" she said.\"So, if local people get engaged in its monitoring and have access to the data, they're able to make decisions and more effectively manage their resources. I do think that kind of transparency in the carbon sector is one of the key kind of weapons that we have against the potential for poorly designed products that don't safeguard the rights of communities.\"Natalia Arango, chief executive of Fondo Accion, a Colombian private fund focused on sustainable investments in the environment and children, added that it is also important that jurisdictions establish quality standards for such projects and ensure that they are enforced. \"Colombia, for example, has a scheme of safeguards, but they're not really enforcing it. Enforcement is really crucial to ensure the quality of the standards that are being used.\"The other very important thing to effectively channel benefits to communities is to have transparent benefit-sharing mechanisms that have been built by the communities. And these have to be audited periodically.\"And the voice and views of local and indigenous communities have to be considered. \"They are much more engaged and thoughtful than has been reported,\" said Mike Korchinsky, founder of Wildlife Works, which aims to bring innovative market-based solutions to the challenges of conserving biodiversity.\"Many of them do understand that they are part of this global society, and that they do need help and investment. (But), there aren't enough voices from these communities in (environmental) conversations.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Efforts to capture carbon, such as in this facility in Shanghai, need to take in the views of and weigh the impact on the communities that will be affected by them.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66K5-G0P1-DYX4-01WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"769\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

A map of the world with countries scaled to match their annual CO2 emissions betrays a bloated Global North and a squeezed South. Unlike a mirror at a funfair that makes us laugh at some impossibly distorted version of reality, this reflection speaks a sobering truth -- of global inequity, of haves and have-nots.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Faced with the wicked problem of tackling climate breakdown -- detailed in the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) -- and reducing carbon emissions, we could see the challenge as one primarily confronting the Global North. Indeed, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the Paris Agreement's central mechanism for facilitating national commitments to reducing emissions, frame decarbonisation of the global economy as a task mostly for countries with high emissions. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But even if NDCs were ambitious enough to deliver net-zero emissions by 2050, they would still only address the half of the problem that is already manifest -- but not the half that lies ahead.</p><p> Small today, big tomorrowWhile the Global South may be a small emitter today, it is also where most projected increases in the global population will occur, with millions aspiring to better lives. No one can rightly deny this aspiration -- \"leave no one behind\" is the transformative promise of the UN Sustainable Development Goals -- but historically, income growth has been strongly connected with higher per capita carbon emissions.</p><p> Substantial fossil fuel reserves and vast carbon storage in virgin forests in the Global South mean the potential for increased emissions is huge, and the Amazon has already become a source of carbon emissions rather than a sink for CO2. </p><p> Yet for the world to limit global heating to 1.5 deg C or even 2 deg C, most of the forests must be conserved, and fossil fuel reserves must remain untouched. This makes the challenge for the South -- of not \"carbonising\" while developing -- one at least as significant as decarbonising the North.</p><p> Countries in the South are also more vulnerable to climate risks. They will experience increased drought and flooding even if global warming is limited to 1.5 deg C, and need significant climate adaptation finance -- estimated to be between US$160 billion and US$340 billion by 2030, going up to US$565 billion by 2050 -- that enables them to face already inevitable climate impacts. In addition, realising the transition to net zero will rely on large capital flows from North to South, including through a range of incentives such as debt-for-nature swaps that help protect natural carbon sinks.</p><p> Optimistic technologists believe that emerging and developing economies in the Global South will be able to avoid the \"brown road\" to prosperity and leapfrog directly to a clean energy, net-zero future. This would magically eliminate any trade-off between growth and emissions, but it relies on richer countries quickly scaling clean technology, making it cheaper, and eliminating sizeable green premiums. </p><p> If technology does not eliminate these, the alternative is an approach long-favoured by economists: carbon pricing. But unfortunately, carbon taxes are deeply unpopular and have been taken off the table in key countries such as the United States.</p><p> How then can we reconcile and deliver on both decarbonising the North and forging a clean development path in the South'</p><p> The starting point lies in shifting from price-based solutions (carbon taxes) to quantity-based solutions (the remaining carbon budget). In terms of economic thinking, this means shifting from Pigou (pricing externalities) to Coase (cap, allocate rights and trade). </p><p> In practice, it means establishing a functioning and feasible global carbon credit market, as explored in Climate and Debt, the latest Geneva report on the world economy. This will not be easy, given that current markets are fragmented and embryonic, and participation is voluntary.</p><p> Firstly, to improve market functioning, mandatory carbon emissions reduction requirements must be put in place for all large emitters. Carbon credits must also be shown to be credible so that markets scale and prices rise to levels that reward countries and companies for preserving carbon sinks, developing nature-based solutions, and engaging in nature-positive business. There are various competing initiatives trying to bring transparency and accountability to the voluntary carbon markets.</p><p> Secondly, and more importantly, the world must squarely face the rapidly shrinking but increasingly alarming elephant in the room. According to the IPCC, if the average global temperature rise is to remain below 1.5 deg C with more than 80 per cent certainty, the world has a carbon emissions budget of just 300 gigatonnes of CO2. And with 50 per cent certainty, only 500 gigatonnes. </p><p> At current emissions levels, the budget will be exhausted in less than a decade. To be feasible, any system for allocating remaining emissions rights must be perceived as equitable. And so the question is, who should be allowed to \"use up\" the remaining budget'</p><p> NDCs implicitly suggest allocating the bulk of the remaining carbon budget to the biggest emitters in the North. At the other extreme, countries that have emitted the most in the past might receive only a small part of the remaining budget, which would immediately create a large carbon market. But neither of these approaches balances ethics with political realism in a way that is fair and effective.</p><p> A more balanced approach would be to distribute remaining emissions rights equally per capita across the globe, and then adjust them to account for past and future emissions opportunities. </p><p> For poor countries with large carbon sinks, for example, the opportunity costs of low future emissions are high, while those endowed with a wealth of natural renewable resources can more easily avoid future emissions. A robust global carbon market would then deliver the efficient use of the world's remaining emissions budget through global \"cap and trade\".</p><p> 'Just' dealingsAchieving global consensus for and establishing such an approach will take time, of which we have very little. A less ambitious -- but similar and more achievable -- approach is to greatly expand \"just energy transition partnerships\", in which rich countries cut a deal with poorer countries to pay for green technology in return for phasing out coal and leaving remaining reserves untouched.</p><p>Indonesia, for example, recently received US$20 billion from a coalition of rich countries through such a deal. Securing further timely deals like this would usefully complement a global deal through targeting priority emissions mitigation \"hot spots\" such as the Amazon rainforest.</p><p> President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil has called for the COP30 climate summit in 2025 to be held in the Amazon rainforest, an ecosystem vital for global climate stability. What better place for the world to turn things around, and what better milestone towards which our leaders might work to secure a step change on the road to net zero? </p><p> The writer is visiting professor at Insead and distinguished research fellow at Insead's Hoffmann Global Institute for Business and Society.

When the weather is most variable, as in autumn in the US, temperature changes may be masked, resulting in a relatively quiet map. </p><p> By contrast, during heat waves, the story of climate change becomes much more apparent, as it was in Europe and China this summer. If you were to zoom over to Mauritania, Morocco or Saudi Arabia on the CSI map, you would see climate fingerprints today. </p><p> Just this week, climate change continued to influence temperatures in the equatorial region, particularly small island states and coastal regions, which border the warming ocean. </p><p> Over the past year, from Oct 1, 2021 to Sept 30, 2022, climate change shifted temperatures to the greatest extent in the Malay archipelago, Brazil, Mexico, the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa, according to a Climate Central analysis. The cities of Apia, Samoa and Ngerulmud, Palau scored highest overall, each with 90 per cent of their days unusually out of sync with what their temperatures would have been before the climate crisis. </p><p> The researchers also adjusted their analysis to represent population centres, multiplying the number of days with relative climate impacts by the number of people in a place. Whereas small island states appeared most affected overall -- a key finding for both climate adaptation and conservation -- African cities, particularly Lagos, Nairobi, Dar es Salaam and Mogadishu, jumped to the fore for greatest total human exposure to rising local temperatures. </p><p> Dr Victoria Keener, senior research fellow at the non-profit East-West Center in Honolulu, said that Climate Central's findings are consistent with those of the 2021 Pacific Climate Change Monitor, an international collaboration that analysed observed data from the Pacific Islands. </p><p> Over the past decade, heat waves have increased in length across the Pacific, and states including the Marshall Islands have seen a significant rise in the number of hot days and hot nights. </p><p> Particularly in the context of the approaching COP27 climate talks, where \"loss and damage\" is expected to be a focus, coalitions of island nations could use the map to argue in broad strokes the toll of climate change and the need for greater climate finance from rich nations. </p><p> \"I see this as another tool to quantify how much they didn't contribute (to climate change) and are now experiencing it at the greatest levels,\" said Dr Keener. \"It's the same story that we see again.\" BLOOMBERG</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>With the launch of a global version of the Climate Shift Index, people from Jakarta (above) to Addis Ababa can track how much human-induced climate change is making their days hotter or colder.

This will help build a pipeline of investable projects, said Mr Menon.</p><p> Blended finance refers to the combination of concessional financing or loans that are extended on more generous terms than market loans and commercial funding.</p><p> MAS and the Asian Development Bank will also develop guidance for financial institutions on how they can gradually phase out coal power generation in Asia-Pacific.</p><p> This is an initiative of the Asia-Pacific network of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a global body that coordinates efforts across all sectors of the financial system to accelerate the net-zero transition.</p><p> Speaking at the inaugural conference on blended finance, Mr Menon noted that there are about 5,500 coal plants in Asia, responsible for more than 4.5 gigatonnes of carbon emissions each year.</p><p> Many of these plants have decades left to operate, and GFANZ will help to responsibly decommission them.</p><p> Currently, about 85 per cent of the energy consumed in Asia comes from fossil fuels, and demand for energy is projected to double by 2030.</p><p> The region is most vulnerable to climate change, with large populations living close to areas prone to floods, droughts and rising sea levels. This is why the ability to successfully help Asia's transition to net zero will \"go a long way to getting the world to net zero\", Mr Menon said.</p><p> This can be achieved through inclusive transition, which is about decarbonising without compromising social and economic development, he said.</p><p> So far, the United Nations has convened a high level advisory board that will look at reforms to the global financial architecture to channel more public and private funding to developing countries.</p><p> Ms Joan Larrea, chief executive of Convergence, noted that blended finance, through strategic use of catalytic funding, can provide critical de-risking for private sector investment and improve project bankability, and play an impactful role in addressing the financing gap for net-zero transition.</p><p> To promote transition and blended finance, MAS and Enterprise Singapore launched Infrastructure Asia to give technical assistance to enhance project bankability that would attract finance.</p><p> Infrastructure Asia has facilitated a number of sustainable projects, including waste management and waste-to-energy.</p><p> Clifford Capital, whose borrowings are guaranteed by the Singapore Government, has so far catalysed a total of US$330 million (S$472 million) for sustainable infrastructure from institutional investors through its Bayfront Infrastructure Management.</p><p> To reach net zero by 2050, the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent by 2030, relative to 2010 baseline levels.</p><p> But emissions today are still rising. Based on current policies in place, the world is 55 per cent short of the emissions reduction target for 2030, according to a UN report.</p><p> \"The transformation of the global economy in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 would need US$9.2 trillion in annual capital spending on physical assets until 2050,\" said Mr Oliver Tonby, senior partner at McKinsey Singapore. But only about US$5.7 trillion is now being invested per year.</p><p> This means the world is more than 35 per cent short of the annual investment required for net zero.</p><p> Mr Menon noted in his opening address that investing in green technologies and renewable energy is important, but such green activities are estimated to make up less than 8 per cent of global gross domestic product.</p><p> \"To move the needle towards net zero, we must progressively decarbonise across all sectors of the economy, including hard-to-abate sectors such as cement, steel and maritime transport,\" he said.</p><p> This means the world needs transition finance to provide funding and support for businesses and sectors that are not so green to adopt cleaner technologies, raise energy efficiency and progressively become greener over time.</p><p> About 500 participants, including Dr Rania Al-Mashat, Egypt's Minister of International Cooperation, as well as Ms Kristalina Georgieva, managing director at the International Monetary Fund, attended the one-day conference.</p><p> The inaugural conference, organised by MAS, McKinsey and Convergence, discussed ways the public and private sectors can mobilise capital and push the use of blended finance to support global net-zero transition.</p><p>     &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;5,500&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Number of coal plants in Asia.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;4.5 gigatonnes&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Amount of carbon emissions they produce each year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1091892</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66J3-M261-DYX4-01BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Good morning. I am pleased to join you for the tenth edition of the Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources (SDSWR). SDSWR has become one of the region's premier platforms for a discourse on current and pressing issues in the agribusiness and forestry sectors.</p><p>2. When the SDSWR debuted in 2014, there were questions raised about the environmental and sustainability practices in ASEAN. Over the years, our discussions at SDSWR have helped to catalyse action and cooperation towards making the agribusiness and forestry sectors in our region more sustainable. This year we will focus on the growing opportunities that come with a green transition in climate action.</p><p>El Nio Looms</p><p>3. Climate change has brought about more extreme and unpredictable weather patterns. Since April, Asia has experienced blistering heatwaves and historic high temperatures. Temperatures in China, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos broke new records. Likewise in Singapore, we experienced the highest recorded temperature of 37 degree Celsius in the last 40 years in May. According to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), global temperatures will likely reach new highs in the next five years, with a 98 percent chance that at least one of the next five years will be the warmest ever.</p><p>4. How will these sweltering conditions impact us?</p><p>We can expect disruptions in food production due to erratic yields, including outbreak of diseases such as the ongoing outbreak of bird flu and swine flu in parts of the world. This will have knock-on impacts on food prices, and livelihoods of people who are dependent on food and agricultural production.</p><p>We can expect more frequent power and water shortages. This will disrupt our social and economic activities. And lead to a vicious cycle of higher power needs due to greater use of air conditioners and water treatment equipment.</p><p>We can expect more forest fires from prolonged dry spells, and air quality impacted by these fires.</p><p>We can expect more cases of personal injury and loss of lives due to heat injuries. To help Singaporeans better protect themselves and their loved ones, my Ministry will implement a Heat Stress Advisory framework in the near future to guide us on how to plan our activities, what actions to take to protect ourselves and what attire to wear for outdoor activities for the forecasted weather conditions. Details on this advisory will be made available in the coming weeks.</p><p>5. Whilst we adapt and adjust to the warmer conditions to come in the next few months, we must not take our feet off the pedal of climate action. Staying within the 1.5 degree limit of global temperature rise is nothing short of an existential priority as time, tide and temperature await for no one. All of us can and must contribute to climate action.</p><p>6 Beyond heat, we must also remain vigilant against the risk of a return of transboundary haze. We have been lucky to enjoy haze-free conditions in Singapore for the past few years, partly due to favourable weather condition. But this condition is not expected to continue.</p><p>7. Last week, the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) announced the start of the dry season for the Southern ASEAN region, which notably began much earlier compared to previous years. The Meteorological ServiceSingapore also announced that there is a 70 to 80 percent chance of an El Nio event occurring this year. Similar forecasts have been issued by the meteorological agencies in the region.</p><p>8. As a region, we need to be extra vigilant against the widespread outbreak of land and forest fires, such as those experienced in Northern ASEAN earlier this year. The threat of transboundary haze is not an ASEAN challenge alone. Since Tuesday, northeastern United States and parts of eastern Canada have been experiencing transboundary haze as a result of wildfires in Northern Quebec.</p><p>Certainty in Uncertain Times</p><p>9. How do we address these challenges that lie ahead? I will make three suggestions: knowledge, leadership and partnership.</p><p>Knowledge</p><p>10. First, knowledge acquisition. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a global scientific panel that helps us understand climate change projections and impacts, and on the pathways and solutions to mitigate and adapt to the change. Through good research and scientific evidence, we can find ways and means to address the climatic challenges that we face in the years ahead.</p><p>11. Singapore has been contributing to the IPCC process and is prepared to do more. We have nominated Associate Professor Winston Chow from the Singapore Management University to serve as the developing country Co-Chair for IPCC Working Group II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, for the upcoming Seventh Assessment Report (AR7) Cycle that will commence this July. Having spent more than fifteen years researching climate adaptation and urban vulnerabilities, and contributing to the IPCC as the editor of AR6 report, Professor Chow is no stranger to the international scientific arena on climate. We are also collaborating closely with the WMO and its members. Our Director-General for Meteorological Services Ms. Wong Chin Ling has been successfully re-elected to the WMO Executive Council, as a representative of the South-West Pacific region.</p><p>12. Another area where climatic data and science is of interest to us is in food production, as part of our target to produce 30% of our nutritional needs locally by 2030. The 30X30 Food Story aims to bolster our food security as we develop capacity and capability in climate-resilient agriculture practices in Singapore. We are rethinking and reshaping food production in Singapore through technologies such as climate resilient seed varieties, resource-efficient and circular urban farming concepts, biosecurity and disease management, and novel foods trials and regulations. Local companies such as GoFarm, ComCrop and Sustenir Agriculture are pushing the boundaries of nutrition and sustainability through hydroponics technology, use of solar energy and energy efficient technology, and water conservation technology.</p><p>Leadership</p><p>13. While knowledge and science help us frame issues, leadership requires us to act, particularly in making the hard decisions, dealing with trade-offs, and having the courage to do what is right, in a timely manner.</p><p>14. ASEAN has been doing this as part of its commitment to a haze-free region. Yesterday, I hosted colleagues from Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand for the Twenty-Fourth Meeting of the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee on Transboundary Haze Pollution. We have been convening this meeting annually to prepare for the dry season in our ASEAN subregion. We had a good discussion and recognised the various measures that have been put in place across the region to prevent and respond to the threat of land and forest fires.</p><p>15. As Chairman of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, Singapore has worked with ASEAN colleagues on developing the New Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation for Transboundary Haze Pollution, the New ASEAN Peatlands Management System, and the ASEAN Investment Framework. These will help guide the region to develop strategies and partnerships, as well as demonstrate our resolve to achieve our vision of a haze-free ASEAN region.</p><p>16. As ASEAN Chairman, Indonesia has also led the way in taking steps to transform the region. Initiatives such as the Forestry and Other Land Use Net Sink 2030 testify to Indonesia's continued resolve in combating deforestation and climate change. Singapore appreciates the strong leadership demonstrated by Indonesia as ASEAN Chair. We will work closely with Indonesia at all levels to prevent an outbreak of fires in our region, and stand ready to provide technical support if required.</p><p>Partnership</p><p>17. Finally, the green transition requires global and regional partnerships, notably in operationalizing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to set up high-integrity carbon markets, and introduce needle-moving low-carbon technologies and solutions, such as hydrogen.</p><p>18. Singapore is actively establishing partnerships to enhance our adoption of renewable energy. We signed an agreement to import renewable hydropower from Laos - our first renewable energy import - through Thailand and Malaysia. This is the first multilateral cross-border electricity trade involving four ASEAN countries. We hope that it serves as a pathfinder to more of such regional cooperation initiatives to support the global energy transition.</p><p>19. Green and transition finance is another dimension that will benefit from partnership. We must do more to reduce the barriers of capital flow to facilitate investments in this direction. One of such ways is in aligning our green taxonomies. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is working with its regional counterparts to progressively develop an ASEAN Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance to define and facilitate sustainable and transition activities in six focus sectors as a start, which include the agriculture and forestry sector. Version 2 of the ASEAN Taxonomy was recently published in March 2023 and include new features such as a coal-phase-out criteria - a global first for a regional taxonomy.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>20. This week has been an exciting series of sustainability and climate dialogues in Singapore, starting with the Singapore International Water Week Spotlight, Ecosperity, followed by the ASEAN Sub-Regional Meetings on Transboundary Haze Pollution, and rounding up with today's Dialogue.</p><p>21. Allow me to share two personal reflections. We are certain of climate change.</p><p>We are certain that human activity is the main cause of climate change. We are also certain that collaborative action is needed. This is why dialogue with global and regional partners, such as this, is pertinent in forging consensus and cooperation.</p><p>In order to have meaningful, long-lasting and impactful collaboration, we need to build trust and confidence among all stakeholders, so that we can better understand and accommodate the differing national contexts, perspectives and views from different segments of society. Only then can we forge global and regional agreements that can effectively address a global commons problem.</p><p>22. Allow me to leave the stage with an encouragement to all of us here. We know we have a serious problem, and that we are already late in addressing it. This is the time where human creativity, ingenuity and wisdom must not fail us as the livelihoods of our future generation is at stake. Therefore, we have act now.</p><p>23. With that, I thank Professor Tay and his team at the SIIA for convening the 10th edition of the SDSWR and look forward to hearing from our speakers and panellists on their perspectives.</p><p>24.
