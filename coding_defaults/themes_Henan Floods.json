[{"bodytext": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>2024 JUN 21 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily China News -- New research on Mental Health Diseases and Conditions is the subject of a report. According to news originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"A heavy rainstorm struck Henan, China, in July 2021. Previous studies have indicated that natural disasters have a wide range of psychological sequelae, but little research has been done on the psychological effects of floods specifically.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from National Social Science Fund of China. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Peking University, \"This study aimed to track the mental health trajectories of flood victims over time and identify associated protective and risk factors. People living in the areas most impacted by the flood (N = 376) were surveyed at four different time points: 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months post-flood. Latent growth mixture modeling was utilized to delineate longitudinal patterns of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression, a supervised machine-learning approach, was employed to discern predictors among 49 assessed variables at both contextual and personal levels. Results revealed three classes of PTSD (resilience, recovery, moderate symptoms) and anxiety (resilience, chronicity, recovery) trajectories, along with two classes of depression trajectories (resilience, chronicity). Key factors predicting resilience in mental health included personality traits, media consumption habits, pre-existing health conditions at the individual level, and asset loss and ongoing adversities at the contextual level. In spite of the widespread impact of the flood, most victims displayed resilience in the face of adversity.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Identifying critical factors across various psychological symptoms offers valuable insights for both pre-disaster preparation and post-disaster trans-diagnostic psychological interventions.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: A longitudinal investigation of mental health outcomes after the Henan floods in China: Examining predictors of resilience trajectories.

[Photo/Xinhua]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With videos of common people helping those in distress during the Henan floods going viral on Chinese social media, a new type of hero has emerged. No cape, no flashy symbols and no mask \u2013 the everyday hero saved lives with the power of his hands and the intellect of his mind.</p><p>Although rescue authorities did a commendable job of mitigating the overall impact of the flood, first responders in many emergency situations were the bystanders who could think of only one thing: Save as many people as possible.</p><p>When the flood struck, urban areas inundated so quickly that people found themselves caught in their commutes. Some got stuck in subway trains, some in buses, and some in their cars. The citizens who came to their aid hardly had any training in life-saving techniques. What they were equipped with, instead, was compassion for humanity.</p><p>There were doctors pulling people out of the water after being pulled out themselves, roadside shop owners who had been salvaging their stock and mechanics, hairdressers and students who just happened to be in the area. Many times, a chain reaction was triggered where the rescued joined in to extricate others who had been trapped with them.</p><p>These everyday heroes took to saving lives without any heed to their own safety or belongings. Unlike heroes in the movies, they did get hurt. Sharp objects flowing in the water and the breaking of glass panes in cars, buses, and subway trains left them bruised, with some getting their bones fractured. Many lost their phones and wallets.</p><p>And these heroes plunged into raging waters instinctively. They saw people would drown if not helped because many in need did not know how to swim. Those who knew were stranded in places they could not get out from without assistance. Sometimes even the volunteers did not know how to swim. But the sight of misfortune forced them to put their own lives on the line.</p><p>Many of the rescuers had received help in the past as well. A person who saved 71 people in Gongyi city was once rescued along with his mother and children by fellow villagers in an earlier flood. With incidents like that at the back of their minds, their reciprocal spirit sprang to action and pushed them to pay back what society had done for them. Some had suffered losses in this very flood, and when they saw others at the same risk, they immediately stepped forward.</p><p>A remarkable role was also played by volunteers of nonprofits and civilian rescue teams. Members of these organizations are regular citizens with private jobs and businesses but when natural disasters strike, they leave their lives of comfort forthwith. Working extended hours every day at the Henan floods likewise, they immensely augmented the efforts of government agencies.</p><p>Some of these volunteers coordinated the on-ground activities of their teams from their homes. They assisted local authorities in monitoring the flood water situation, identifying people in distress and managing the distribution of relief materials. This was no easy task either. With operations going on round-the-clock, their work schedule was extremely hectic with little time for rest or sleep.</p><p>From behind computer screens, another group of people put technology to another use. Employing collaborative spreadsheet documents, they formed \"a bridge over troubled waters.\" Reports of trapped people were categorized and put into the documents with varying degrees of urgency. Volunteers and temporary shelters also were mentioned with contact numbers and specific locations.</p><p>The death toll remained strikingly low, owing to these innovative ideas of common people who wanted to serve their community. Time is the most crucial resource in such emergencies. By making full use of the rapid speed of technology, damage to life and property was significantly reduced. Many tech-savvy students are now considering taking up careers through which they can continue contributing to society.</p><p>On social media, \"civilian heroes\" remained one of the most commonly seen tags. Through videos and stories of the everyday heroes, tributes from all over the country poured in under the tag. The humanitarian spirit went instantly viral, inspiring more and more people from far-off areas to join the relief efforts physically, through online assistance or donations.</p><p>The Chinese way of thinking in collective terms is a major factor behind the rise of everyday heroes. The country's unique societal culture first thinks of the overall good and service to others before serving the self.</p><p>The people seen doing selfless acts never did so in the hope of being known as heroes. They just happened to be at the right place at the right time. By putting their lives at risk for worthy reasons, they have certainly made their families and their nation proud. The flood might have caused some financial loss but it has reinforced the common man's trust in the community.</p><p>Hayat Bangash is a freelance columnist on international affairs with degrees in business administration and war studies.</p><p>The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.</p><p>If you have a specific expertise, or would like to share your thought about our stories, then send us your writings at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:opinion@chinadaily.com.cn\">opinion@chinadaily.com.cn</email> , and <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:comment@chinadaily.com.cn\">comment@chinadaily.com.cn</email></p>", "model_coding": "Label: Reaction, Moving Forward"}, {"bodytext": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">By XIN WEN | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2024-03-28 07:14</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The temperature gauge registers an unseasonably warm 5 C, yet the frozen expanse of water in northeastern Beijing feels significantly colder.</p><p>In the distance, the sky is clear and blue and ice fishermen quietly tend to their lines.

The deluge drowned some and left others gasping for breath in chest-high water until emergency crews could reach them. </p><p>\"I'm filled with grief,\" said Zhengzhou resident Zhang Shuai, 35, who bowed three times in front of the entrance after laying a bouquet of chrysanthemums. \"I hope that their relatives can recover from this tragedy as soon as possible.\" At least 71 people perished in the floods, according to an updated death toll yesterday. Zhengzhou authorities said 14 had died in the subway station, up from 12 reported earlier. A crowd of about 50 people stood outside under partly cloudy blue skies as streams of mourners and delivery drivers left bouquets wrapped in black paper in a rectangular area extending from the shuttered station entrance. Some relatives of the deceased have criticized the Zhengzhou subway authority, accusing them of continuing to operate the trains even when it became clear it would be dangerous to do so. They said subway officials had obstructed the search for missing relatives. \"I no longer have a husband, my daughter no longer has a father,\" the wife of Sha Tao, a Zhengzhou resident who drowned in the subway, wrote on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. \"If they had prepared contingency plans ahead of time, the number of deaths could have been minimized.

What people should learn from the floods is the importance of nature's adjustments together with man-made facilities in dealing with extreme situations, experts said.</p><p><br/><br/>As Henan reported at least 25 deaths in unprecedented rainfall and floods, the AFP on Tuesday highlighted a collapsing dam in Luoyang, saying the threat of floods has risen in China because of the construction of dams and levees, which \"cut connections between the river and adjacent lakes and disrupted floodplains that had helped absorb the summer surge.\"<br/><br/>Experts reached by the Global Times said the building of dams and \"worsening threat\" do not have direct links, especially in this case of Henan, which was more like a sudden act of nature.\u00a0<br/><br/>Overseas outlets are exaggerating the issue, as in fact the construction of dams and reservoirs will enhance regional disaster prevention and mitigation, rather than reduce it, Fu Zongfu, a professor from College of Water Conservancy and Hydropower Engineering at Hehai University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.<br/><br/>Most countries build dams, which greatly improve flood control and disaster reduction capacity, so the construction of dams should not be denied because of a rare disaster, Fu said.\u00a0<br/><br/>Due to the unprecedented heavy rain, the state flood control and drought relief bureau dispatched a work group to Henan and initiated a level III emergency response rescue work. About 849 people have been rescued.<br/><br/>Henan Province is located in Central China's plains, spanning four major river basins of Haihe River, Yellow River, Huaihe River and Yangtze River, and has 1,030 rivers each with a drainage area of at least 50 square kilometers.<br/><br/>The expert said floods may be caused by many factors, such as topography (Henan is low and vulnerable) and rapid urbanization, which makes the ground susceptible to water. However, the most important one is extreme climate, as drainage systems are not designed for such rare downpours.\u00a0<br/><br/>Ma Jun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the construction of dams will have some impact on the floodplain's ecology, but has no direct connection to flooding.\u00a0<br/><br/>Chinese dam projects usually make ecological compensation, which requires that the water discharge of hydropower stations should not be lower than the normal ecological water discharge, meaning it has little impact on the ecology, Fu said.\u00a0<br/><br/>Experts also stressed that lakes adjacent to rivers and floodplains represent nature's \"regulating power,\" while the dam represents artificial regulation, and the two should work together for flood control.<br/><br/>While artificial regulation can play a role, the dangers of sudden extreme weather cannot be totally eliminated, so the importance of natural regulation cannot be ignored, Ma said.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>He explained that the dams often serve a combination of functions, including power generation, irrigation, and tourism.\u00a0<br/><br/>After the disastrous 1998 floods, China asked local governments to gradually \"return farmlands to the lakes,\" in a bid to restore natural regulating ability, and stop excessive development.\u00a0<br/><br/>Following the 1975 Banqiao Dam failure, which led to the collapse of 62 dams in Henan Province, China has strengthened the design, construction, operation and management of dams. China's dam technology and safety are world class, experts said.\u00a0<br/><br/>The collapsed dam in Luoyang on Wednesday is probably old and earth-made, dating back to the 1950s to 1970s. Despite constant reinforcement and maintenance, the fatal flaw of such levees is that they are prone to failure when heavy rainfall causes the water to overflow above the peak level, Ma said.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>", "model_coding": "Label: None"}, {"bodytext": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zhengzhou photo:IC</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The heavy rainfall in Central China's Henan Province has once again shocked the Chinese people's previous understanding of meteorological disasters and pushed us to rethink how to prevent such disasters from causing tragic consequences.<br/><br/>First, the intensity of the weather disaster exceeds our previous experience. For example, this time, the extremely strong rainfall in Zhengzhou, the capital city of Henan Province, with over 200 mm of precipitation in an hour, was beyond imagination. From tornadoes in northern China to the torrential rain in Henan, these disasters are telling us that extreme weather and its intensity are increasing significantly. In the future we can no longer use vague phrases, such as \"once in a thousand years\" or \"once in a hundred years,\" to guide the fight against disasters. We must be ready to encounter and contend with catastrophic weather more often.</p><p><br/><br/>It is not realistic to have our cities, as well as the rural areas, build the infrastructure that can effectively cope with heavy rainfall like in Zhengzhou in the past few days. It was absolutely impossible to keep Zhengzhou from flooding on Tuesday. Such a standard in the fight against disasters means unaffordable costs, and our cities are unlikely to take that extreme safety route.<br/><br/>However, we should seriously consider and implement measures, including enhancing cities' drainage so that they can provide valuable time for deployment and response for urban disaster relief in emergency situations.<br/><br/>We need to set a target for extreme disaster resistance: the most important thing under such a situation is to reduce or even avoid deaths. In other words, we cannot build super infrastructure for every city to get prepared for a so-called \"once in a thousand years\" flood. However, we must build the real ability of danger avoidance for every city, village, and town when facing meteorological disasters.<br/><br/>Situations around the world have repeatedly proven that despite human beings' continuous advancement in science and technology, nature is still the most powerful. Human beings cannot build a completely safe city. The most fundamental guarantee on disaster resistance lies in human beings' wisdom and measures to fight nature based on the increasingly solid infrastructure. After all, extreme meteorological disasters are of low probability, and it is difficult to avoid unexpected situations. However, our preparations should be able to quickly coordinate with the emergency response at critical moments, to jointly make up for the risks caused by unexpected situations, and reach the goal of reducing or even eliminating deaths.<br/><br/>For this reason, Chinese society needs to pay more for preventive response to early warnings for meteorological disasters. Such a cost is not too large when it is split into different areas, yet it can effectively reduce the probability of major human and property losses caused by meteorological disasters. This is worthwhile from the perspective of society. For this reason, all cities and towns should form relatively consistent standards for precautionary preparations.<br/><br/>It is also vital to ensure correct command in emergencies. Society should form a high degree of consensus to follow the command and fight floods at critical moments. There must be no hesitation or delay when evacuation and flood diversion are required. The implementation must be resolute and effective. Public opinion should support such an anti-disaster order.<br/><br/>It was reported that the floods had caused 25 deaths and 7 missing in Henan this time. This is the first human toll from the province since the floods began. The final deaths in the province will be a key indicator of the effectiveness of disaster relief.<br/><br/>Henan fought a huge battle this time. The People's Liberation Army and People's Armed Police Force were quickly mobilized and deployed to the most dangerous areas, and measures including flood diversions were used in time to effectively reduce some disaster risks. But the biggest loss of life took place in the Zhengzhou subway. China's Ministry of Transportation has already asked local authorities to learn from the lessons of the incident.<br/><br/>As the disaster-relief work continues in Henan, there is strong support for the province, the birthplace of Chinese civilization, to respond fully to the disaster. We hope that no new deaths will occur when the first wave of the disaster passes. It is believed that Henan's resilience to the floods has been quickly developed in the fast-paced disaster response and will not fail to meet public expectations.<br/><br/>Stay safe, Henan!

A person waiting to be rescued in the South China Sea can survive for around 30 hours, but during the depths of a northern winter, they may lose consciousness in just 20 minutes.</p><p>\"Our mission is to rescue people trapped in the water, but in most cases, their vital signs are absent when we find them,\" said Zheng Haiyang, a 26-year-old firefighter from Dezhou, Shandong province, who has trained as a water rescuer with the Miyun team for about eight years. The reality of ice-diving rescues is often recovering a body trapped under the ice and taking it back to loved ones, he added.</p><p>Every winter, there are about five incidents in Beijing requiring ice-diving rescues.</p><p>\"We can't use our common sense to understand why people fall through the ice,\" said Zheng. \"On some occasions, people in danger of drowning after falling into the water may have simply wanted to take a shortcut across an ice surface or to retrieve some items from where they were ice fishing.\"</p><p>The team of 16 firefighters is always in a race against time and has implemented a 24-hour on-call system.</p><p>\"The time window for such rescue operations is limited,\" said Zheng. \"From receiving the alarm to dispatching our firefighting team to the rescue site, at least 15 minutes are required. A person cannot endure that long in the frigid waters of Beijing.\"</p><p>In 2012, a practical diving skills training program was introduced to enhance the professional skills of the team's firefighters. The Beijing Municipal Public Security Fire Corps, which became the Beijing Fire Rescue Corps in 2018 as part of a reshuffle, also supplied high-quality equipment to the diving firefighters.</p><p>Ice-diving rescue operations require up to five people working together to ensure safe procedures. A pair of divers is supported by two safety buddies on the ice as well as an emergency backup diver. A large tent is also pitched near the ice hole to keep the divers warm after they leave the water.</p><p>Zhao Qiang, the rescue team's deputy head and chief diving instructor, said the ice hole is triangular as the shape makes it easier for the divers to exit the water.</p><p>\"However, it is still a challenging task, and the divers require assistance from their safety buddies to navigate the slippery ice surrounding the hole,\" he said.</p><p>Zhao said ice diving is more dangerous than free diving in the sea, but it can be a safe operation if procedures are properly followed.</p><p>The primary danger in ice diving is the submerged diver not being able to locate the exit hole.</p><p>\"In the summer, we divers can naturally surface from any water body,\" Zhao explained. \"However, during the cold of winter, if we get lost under the ice or the tank runs out of compressed air, the situation becomes perilous due to the enclosed nature of the space under the ice. The only escape from such danger is to find the triangular ice hole.\"</p><p>Hypothermia \u2014 long exposure to cold that causes body temperature to dangerously drop \u2014 is another major threat to ice divers. However, this risk has been greatly reduced thanks to the use of dry diving suits.</p><p>Zhao said that unlike wet suits, which allow water to enter and be trapped and heated by the body's temperature, a dry suit prevents any water from getting in. Compressed air is pumped into the suit to create a thin layer of air that insulates the diver from the cold.</p><p>Zhao said that he recommends to the divers they also wear cotton clothing under their suits to stay warmer. \"Otherwise, if the divers don't wear thermal clothing, the cold will reach their bodies more quickly,\" he said.</p><p>Before the divers enter the icy water, the chief instructor usually conducts a final check of all the diving equipment. He inspects the guide ropes for the divers and notes down all the pre-dive checks. Once these operations are completed, the divers can go under the ice.</p><p>Two divers in diving suits loaded with equipment then move to the ice hole and with the help of two of their teammates slide into the water. After inserting their mouthpieces, the divers then slowly submerge beneath the icy surface.</p><p>\"The visibility of the water in winter is the best of all the seasons,\" said Zhao. \"The activities of microorganisms, algae, and fish in cold water are not that frequent,\" he said, adding there is also less plankton, which means the water is not as muddy.</p><p>\"In addition, beneath the ice ceiling the sunlight filters down and is gently diffused to bathe the scene in a soft and even glow of light,\" he said.</p><p>Han Hongliang, a 29-year-old senior diver from Suqian, Jiangsu province, was responsible for ice safety during this year's ice-diving training session in northeastern Beijing. He said that a drag signal made via a yellow hemp rope is the most important \"language\" used by ice divers in deep water.</p><p>\"For instance, when I pull the rope slightly, I'm signaling to the diver to check if everything is OK underwater. When the diver tugs the rope in response, I understand that everything is going well beneath the ice,\" he said.</p><p>\"However, if the diver continuously shakes the rope, it indicates that there may be an underwater emergency. This suggests that the diver is experiencing difficulties or facing an emergency from which they cannot easily escape.\"</p><p>Part of the divers' training involves each team member becoming aware of their responsibilities, Han said.</p><p>\"When two of our teammates are diving, they are each secured by a yellow hemp rope to their signal buddies on the ice's surface, who manage the line. The third diver serves as a standby diver, fully suited up and ready to intervene at any sign of trouble from below.\"</p><p>This simple yet effective system of rope signals has become a vital means of communication between the divers and their colleagues on the ice.</p><p>Zhao, the chief diving instructor, said the duration of each ice-diving training session is meticulously calculated to ensure the safety and health of every diver.</p><p>\"Generally speaking, underwater operations typically last about 20 minutes,\" said Zhao. \"If a diver has not resurfaced after this time under the ice, the signal firefighter will use rope tugs to inquire about the diver's physical condition, sending him a signal and asking if he feels all right underwater.</p><p>\"The diver can pull back on the rope to indicate that he is fine,\" he said. \"But only the diver himself truly knows what is exactly taking place underwater.\"</p><p>All diving equipment must be treated with antifreeze to ensure it works in icy water.</p><p>\"Unexpected things happen during ice diving,\" Zhao said. \"Your air supply might be cut off due to your regulator freezing in the cold water, or you could get the shivers, or you might become entangled in a large fishing net and struggle to free yourself.</p><p>\"In our training process, we simulate all possible extreme conditions that come to mind, ensuring that our firefighters will not panic when they dive to save people in real situations and have ways to deal with the complications.\"</p><p>During this year's training session, Lu Bingxin, 25, from Tai'an, Shandong, in addition to carrying a 15-kilogram air tank, was weighted down with 12 kgs of lead to help offset the buoyancy of his suit.</p><p>He was teamed with diver Hu Yazhuo, 29, from Shenyang, Liaoning province.</p><p>Despite all the meticulous preparation, engaging in a diving rescue operation for the first time is far different from the training process.</p><p>Han clearly remembers his first rescue operation when he had to dive 18 meters to rescue someone.</p><p>\"I was very scared the first time I went into the water for a mission. Though my former instructor was diving with me, I couldn't stop clenching my fists and gripping the rope,\" he said.</p><p>Thankfully, his instructor helped him to relax. \"Suddenly I calmed down and began to swim slowly in search of the person needing rescue,\" Han recalled.</p><p>Despite the complexity and variability of the underwater environment, and the need to master techniques related to scuba and ice diving, Zhao said saving lives is the top priority on every mission.</p><p>\"Many Chinese people believe in the importance of seeing a loved one again, regardless of whether they are alive or dead,\" said Zhao. \"In every rescue mission, our utmost effort is to provide answers to the families of the victims, and that's what we strive to achieve.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:xinwen@chinadaily.com.cn\">xinwen@chinadaily.com.cn</email></p>", "model_coding": "Label: None"}, {"bodytext": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Little-heralded outfit braves aquatic depths in Beijing for intensive training</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The temperature gauge registers an unseasonably warm 5 C, yet the frozen expanse of water in northeastern Beijing feels significantly colder.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the distance, the sky is clear and blue and ice fishermen quietly tend to their lines.

Beijing authorities have been in full preparations for the heavy rainstorms that have swept across the city. Photo: Li Hao/GT</p><p><br/>The extreme rainstorm witnessed in Beijing on July 21, 2012, the heaviest rainfall in six decades that left 79 people dead and caused widespread havoc in the capital city over a weekend, left deep scars in many people's hearts. Fortunately, when Beijing broke a 140-year-old rainfall record in the days between July 29 and August 2, the nightmare witnessed by Beijing residents over a decade ago were not replayed.<br/><br/>Based on flood prevention experience and lessons learned from previous rainfall disasters, including the catastrophic Henan floods in July 2021, Beijing appears to have made quantifiable to the city's disaster forecasting, relief, and response programs.\u00a0 There have been no major recorded roof collapses, backlash on the internet, damage of power lines, or flooded highway underpasses, scenes that were widely seen in the tragedy 11 years ago.\u00a0<br/><br/>New technology and digital networks have become an important force in averting tragedy. The Beijing Haidian District Water Affairs Bureau utilized a cutting-edge smart system to direct emergency rescue operations throughout the district, as the system can map out the most optimal rescue route in record time.\u00a0<br/><br/>The system utilizes visualization, integrated analysis of big data, and other technologies to understand the distribution and anomalies of approximately 3,000 water facilities and sensors across the entire Haidian area, and can provide real-time monitoring of the status of water channels, gates, and dams, and respond to warnings and forecasts speedily, the Beijing News reported.<br/><br/>Moreover, technologies such as the \"Sky Eye\" telescope, radar maps, and satellite cloud images have also played a significant role in this round of rainstorm warning. Since the start of the current round of rainfall on July 29, the \"Sky Eye\" smart system installed in some streets has remained vigilant. High-definition cameras installed on flood prevention emergency vehicles and rescue team helmets can monitor precipitation in real time, greatly improving the efficiency of flood responses.<br/><br/>\"Early assessment, early warning, and early deployment\" are the most significant forms of progress that the Global Times witnessed amid the slate of heavy rain that hit Beijing.<br/><br/>While visiting and reporting in waterlogged Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan Province, in July 2021, Global Times reporters found that the consensus among the public was they received warning notifications \"too late.\" While other areas in Henan Province had already been hit by heavy downpours, Zhengzhou city government did not decisively put measures in place to stop gatherings, suspend classes, and require the closure of businesses, wasting critical time in flood prevention and missing a key rescue window.\u00a0<br/><br/>The official investigation report on the severe rainstorm disaster in Zhengzhou which caused at least 398 deaths and missing, exposed serious misconducts in the city's response deployment, including inadequate warning, significant delays in emergency responses, and a lack of unified command at critical moments. These issues led to the highest disaster-related casualties seen in recent years, particularly with regard to the subway system and tunnel, which should not have occurred.<br/><br/>This time in Beijing, Global Times reporters found residents in the capital city received multiple flood prevention reminders via text from relevant departments before the heavy rain actually fell down. Beijing successively issued red rainstorm warnings, yellow lightning warnings, and blue wind warnings, reminding citizens to refrain from outdoor activities. Many organizations immediately issued directives for their employees to work from home.<br/><br/>News sources reported that in preparation, the Beijing Drainage Group initiated a top-level flood early-warning protocol, requiring all pump station personnel to be on duty. At the same time, a re-inspection and re-treatment of drainage facilities in key areas such as 155 depressed bridges and 249 subway stations, as well as a re-inspection of water pumps, backup power sources, flood control emergency equipment, and various monitoring systems in 87 rainwater pump stations across the city were conducted.\u00a0<br/><br/>Power system companies also deployed emergency teams in advance. The State Grid Corporation of China (Beijing), for example, had 22 rescue teams with 510 personnel on standby, ready to transport power generation vehicles, small generators, lighting vehicles, and other flood control emergency supplies and equipment to be stationed in areas with strong rainfall forecasted by meteorological bodies.\u00a0<br/><br/>Beijing's main cultural and tourism venues issued temporary closure notices soon after the Beijing city government temporarily asked to shut down access to all scenic spots on July 30.<br/><br/>All mountainous and water-related scenic spots and rural homestays in the heavily affected area of Fangshan district were temporarily closed and have stopped receiving visitors since then. All 17 tourist attractions in Huairou district were closed, and all homestays and folk accommodations were temporarily suspended to minimize risk.<br/><br/>Amid the heavy downpour sweeping through many parts of China, local authorities have stepped up efforts to counter flooding and power cuts. After days of search and evacuation efforts, disinfection work has begun in residential and commercial areas in the city over this weekend.<br/><br/>Throughout three major rainstorms, nonstop rescue missions have been executed with countless heartwarming stories. In the last decade, what has changed is our continuously honed ability to respond to floods, while what remains unchanged is the resilience exemplified by every individual, an essence of the Chinese civilization.\u00a0<br/><br/>We believe that in the future, we will face floods and other natural disasters with even greater composure and unite together to withstand the tests they bring.</p>", "model_coding": "Label: Reaction, Moving Forward"}, {"bodytext": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">While supporting a good cause helps \"wang hong\" or red-hot internet celebrities burnish their own image, it must be acknowledged that their support has also given much-needed comfort and aid to flood victims</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3142144/whole-town-was-submerged-central-china-prepares-more-flooding\">heavy rainfall</url> in central China's Henan province has inflicted huge loss of life and property.

The official death toll from the flooding has risen to at least 58, and local authorities said more than 9.3 million people had been affected.<br/>Ip Kwok-him, who sits on the Disaster Relief Fund's advisory committee, said the panel \u00addiscussed the situation in Henan during a regular meeting on Thursday and agreed to contact the city government's liaison unit in the province to keep an eye out for any NGOs requiring \u00adassistance.<br/>\"I think we should show \u00adsupport. If any group needs help, the committee will deal with their applications accordingly,\" Ip said.<br/>Chan Kin-por, chairman of the Legislative Council's Finance Committee, said he understood that the fund had a reserve of about HK$100 million. Donations could be initiated by either the government or NGOs, and funding requests exceeding HK$8 million would require approval from the committee, Chan added.<br/>In 2015, the Legco approved HK$50 million in aid, through the fund, after thousands were killed in an earthquake in Nepal.<br/>The fund was also used for disaster relief on the mainland last September, when the government accepted the committee's advice and approved a grant of HK$1.7 million for an agency, known as the Amity Foundation, to help flood victims in Jiangxi province.<br/>A government spokesman said the administration extended its deepest sympathy to the victims of the Henan floods.<br/>\"We believe that under the efforts of the central, provincial and municipal governments, they will be well taken care of,\" he added.<br/>In a joint letter to Henan authorities, all 36 deputies from the city to the nation's top legislature said they would donate HK$1 million to the families of those killed by the flood.<br/>Irons Sze Wing-wai, a Hong Kong delegate to the mainland's top political advisory body, said a similar drive among other members from the city had raised HK$6 million so far.<br/>The city's pro-establishment political parties also extended support to the flood victims.<br/>The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong launched a fundraising drive and urged residents to donate to its community service branch's bank account by July 30.<br/>The Federation of Trade Unions said it had donated HK$300,000 from its own disaster relief and charity fund to Henan authorities. Its president Stanley Ng Chau-pei and chairman Kingsley Wong Kwok had met He Jing, a deputy director of the central government's liaison office in the city, on Thursday to hand over a cheque to him.<br/>\"The situation in Henan is very serious,\" Ng said. \"The federation will continue to raise funds; we hope that our members and residents can lend support, and show that Hong Kong and mainland compatriots are helping and looking after each other.\"<br/>The city's retail and entertainment conglomerate Emperor Group said on Wednesday that it would donate at least 13.6 million yuan for mainland authorities to tackle the disaster.<br/></p>", "model_coding": "Label: Reaction, Moving Forward"}, {"bodytext": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">ZHENGZHOU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- At 5:00 p.m. on July 20, Zhao Jiaqi and her roommate Lou Yikun, two juniors at Beijing Technology and Business University completed a mock test for the postgraduate entrance examination and started to read news online. At the same time, 27-year-old Zhang Jingshu, a Chinese student at Columbia University, was at a hotel in San Francisco and preparing for her return to China. She habitually checked her phone before going to bed. \"Record rains hit central China's Henan Province.\" </p><p>\"Rainstorms in Henan cause massive disruptions.\" The news feed was roaring with information on the Henan floods. They were unaware that they would soon throw themselves into the same invisible battlefield. The record downpour showed no signs of abating, with requests for help popping up on China's social media platforms. The death toll from torrential rain in Henan had risen to 99 as of Thursday noon. More than 13.91 million people in 150 county-level regions had been affected by the latest round of downpours since July 16. The more information they got, the more desperate Zhao and Lou, both 21, were to go to the front line to render help. On July 21, they searched online and joined dozens of WeChat and QQ groups focusing on disaster relief. Zhang Jingshu was also a member of these groups. One of the admins of these online groups was a post-1995 generation netizen called Hezi from the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu. Hezi swung into action on July 20 and launched an online rescue campaign. \"We classify and verify the online messages before inputting the data on shared documents. Then, we connect those in need of help with the rescue forces,\" said Hezi. As more young people got involved in different online rescue groups, an anti-disaster fight by China's Generation Z soon started at the fingertips. The fight has rallied thousands of volunteers from home and abroad who are working in shifts 24 hours a day to offer help through the internet. On July 24, Hezi announced on his official WeChat account that he had founded 10 online rescue groups of more than 3,000 people. His teams had collected over 10,000 messages and assisted the rescue of thousands of people. The original aim of his online teams was simply to collect information calling for help, Hezi said. The situation, however, demanded more. \"With plenty of information pouring in, it is far from enough. The urgent messages might be washed away by the highly repetitive and scattered ones,\" Hezi added. To ensure targeted rescue, the teams were divided into several groups tasked with different responsibilities like searching and verifying information, and contacting rescuers. During her long-haul international flight back to China, Zhang Jingshu, majoring in education data analysis, was busy tapping on the laptop to filter critical information using her professional tech skills. As soon as she arrived, Zhang shared the information with other group members through Wechat. Zhao and Lou were part of another group to check whether the information source was reliable and if people were still awaiting help. They distinguished the information by marking them with different colors. For instance, green meant saved, red indicated very urgent, orange meant urgent while gray suggested the information sender lost contact or even possibly died. The two girls ate one hamburger, which was the only food they had after joining the volunteer team for two days. \"We didn't dare to sleep. One-minute delay may leave one trapped person dead,\" Zhao said.

Get the answers with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge\">SCMP Knowledge</url>, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. </p><p>I'm a Hongkonger. I take pride in being part of a city that refuses to sleep - where you can commute between lush, green forests and swanky skyscrapers in minutes; where you can see the ideals and values of East and West converging, pushing back against ideologues who seem to see the Chinese identity as antithetically opposed to internationalism. </p><p>We cherish the common law jurisdiction that has long served as a pillar to our financial vibrancy and prosperity, which in turn undergirds a rule of law that renders us highly compatible and integrated with the world. It also helps that our location and infrastructural sophistication makes us a nexus for aviation, logistics, trade and tourism. </p><p>Admittedly, much of Hong Kong's shine has dulled in recent years. For some, the city's \"decline\" has to do with the political turmoil induced by deeply rooted civic antagonism. For others, it's to do with our intransigent and unresponsive governance, dearth of industrial diversification and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3161139/my-wish-new-year-hong-kong-finally-embrace-change-and-innovation\">innovation</url>, and self-imposed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/hong-kong/article/3181960/end-covid-19-hysteria-reopen-hong-kong-and-give-us-back\">isolation</url>, epitomised by the city's approach to Covid-19. </p><p>Yet I am no fatalist - I do not believe these \"facts\" are set in stone; that all reparative efforts are thus futile. To think that would be to perpetuate the continued decline in our city's fortunes. </p><p>I'm also a Chinese national. To the north of Hong Kong rests 1.4 billion compatriots - with individual ambitions and opinions, talents and skills. After the sociopolitical upheaval induced by the radical pursuit of select ideology, China under Deng Xiaoping turned to reform and opening up - a visionary move that lifted hundreds of millions out of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3173471/chinas-lockdowns-put-working-class-poor-provinces-risk\">poverty</url>, released the potential and creativity of the Chinese workforce, and enabled China's astronomical rise to become one of the world's two largest economies. </p><p>I admire the perseverance of businessmen and innovators who worked ceaselessly to support our country's opening up and reforms, just as I respect the sagacious acumen of theorists and thinkers who seek to provide a different, yet equally powerful account of how China uniquely governs. I was awestruck by Beijing's hosting of the Olympics in 2008, as much as I mourned the deaths of fellow citizens lost to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2145744/sichuan-earthquake-10-years-how-tragedy-changed-china\">Sichuan earthquake</url> that year and <url normalizedValue=\"https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/china/article/3142519/index.html\">Henan floods</url> last year. </p><p>No country is perfect. China has many problems to address with urgency. Some of them are fixable soon; others less so. We must be cognisant of such contextual nuances. One cannot fix problems by sweeping them under a carpet. Nor can one address structurally embedded problems by engaging in extensive, relentless criticism for the sake of virtue signalling. </p><p>I have attracted much flak for this line - but I will say it again: the responsible thing to do is to offer objective critique and put forth constructive reform, within and stretching the limits of what is possible. Chinese intellectual <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3160972/remarkable-life-intellectual-and-language-reformer-hu-shih\">Hu Shih</url> espoused this ethos of critical reformism. To him I am most indebted in my thinking. </p><p>I am deeply aware that I come from a position of relative privilege. Brought up through a British education system, I witnessed first-hand the appeal of an international education, one with free-flowing information and diverse ideals. </p><p>Yet through subsequent, critical reflection, I also came to see the darker underbelly of the enduring colonial legacy in our city, where English remains fetishised and the relics of the British Empire's rule worshipped, often with minimal heed paid to the hefty costs and racialised injustices pre-handover. </p><p>I had the fortune of receiving seven years of exceptional education abroad - which informed me firmly of the value of rigorous debate and asking and answering any and all questions. Hong Kong is a city where hundreds of thousands live in abject poverty and cage homes, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3175343/hong-kongs-mental-health-crisis-nearly-half-residents-suffer\">mental health epidemic</url> runs rampant, where <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/hong-kong/article/3171111/omicron-crisis-how-lack-community-based-primary-health\">public health</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/hong-kong/article/3168528/forcing-early-summer-school-break-our-children-ruthless\">education systems</url> are ill-equipped for the challenges and opportunities presented by the 21st century, and where ethnic, religious and sexual minorities remain <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/hong-kong/article/3151976/hong-kongs-housing-crisis-discussion-must-home-struggles\">silenced</url>. </p><p>We have a deluge of problems to tackle - ranging from youth disillusionment to our faltering status as an international nexus. But I do not believe for a second - and will not, so long as I can - that we should give up and call it a day. </p><p>Social reform is an inherently collective process. Healing divides through dialogue and reconciliatory measures, empowering civil society to take on long-standing social problems such as poverty and discrimination, reconnecting Hong Kong with the rest of China, these are all priorities. Yet advancing them requires Arendt-style collective action - it requires a broad-church coalition ranging from young people, intellectuals and journalists, to social workers, teachers, financiers and, perhaps even, some of our politicians. </p><p>There are some who assert that Hong Kong is dead - that it's high time to leave. </p><p>Here's my rejoinder: this is my home, and it's not going anywhere.

In pursuit of the \"dual-carbon\"goals, the Group contributed to the smooth operation of nuclear operations, covering nearly 1 trillion yuan in assets and 24,000 front-line workers of all operating nuclear power units in China, and helped nuclear power companies reduce carbon emissions by 302 million tons.In serving the construction of national governance systems, the Group innovated the \"Shanghai model\" of inherent defects insurance (IDI) for construction quality and promoted it nationwide. Its IDI platforms have cumulatively achieved premiums of nearly 500 billion yuan, covering a total of nearly 140 million square meters. In serving the Belt and Road construction, the China Belt and Road Reinsurance Pool provided risk protection for 16.1 billion yuan in assets of 19 overseas interest projects in its first year of operation.</p><p>Publishing the\"Digital China Re 2.0\" Strategy to accelerate digital transformation</p><p>In 2021, China Re Group published the \"Digital China Re 2.0 Strategy\". Adhering to the development logic of \"gather resources, build platforms, and create ecosystems\" the strategy aims to build a new digital transformation landscape featuring \"internal intelligence, direct reinsurance, and platform ecosystem\". In terms of the more traditional framework, the Group's goal is to make leaps in basic capabilities and international capabilities, while on the innovation side, it will continue to promote the construction of external innovation platforms and ecosystem-based operations, and in terms of organizational transformation, China Re will upgrade its digital organization capabilities. In 2021, China Re Group's technology empowerment became increasingly prominent. As the first insurance technology company in China to focus on catastrophe risk management, the Group's subsidiary China Re Catastrophe Risk Management Co., Ltd. successfully developed the China Earthquake Catastrophe Model 3.5, which is the only scientific research project in China's insurance industry featured in the 13th Five-Year Plan Scientific and Technological Achievement Exhibition. It also released the commercial version of the China Typhoon Catastrophe Model 2.0, filling a void in the domestic market. In 2021, China Re Catastrophe Risk Management's revenue exceeded 23 million yuan, reaching profitability in its first year.</p><p>Continuous advancement of international footprint and continuous improvement in management capabilities</p><p>In 2021, China Re Group made great progress in its globalization efforts. First, it continued to advance its international footprint, expanding its overseas units to 11 countries and regions, becoming the Chinese insurance company with the widest overseas presence. In 2021, the Group's premium income from overseas business accounted for 18.9 percent, and overseas investment assets accounted for 25.9 percent. Second, the acquisition of Chaucer was a huge success. In the three years since the acquisition, China Re has achieved stability in terms of business, operations and teams, and Chaucer has consistently outperformed Lloyd's, with a return on economic capital of 14.8 percent. Third, China Re continued to enhance its management capabilities. It improved the functions of the overseas development and management committee, strengthened business planning and research, and realized underwriting profits in all of its three major overseas business platforms of P&amp;C reinsurance. Fourth, it comprehensively deepened international synergies. Utilizing the Belt and Road initiative as a bridge and leveraging Chaucer's technological advantages as a leader in the fields of political risk and nuclear risk, China Re strengthened coordinated development at home and abroad.</p><p>Improved risk management capabilities, laying a solid foundation for the headquarters</p><p>China Re Group continued to improve its risk management system and strengthened overall management and control in key areas such as major risks and international business. It strengthened penetrative management of key risks, with overall risks under control. The Group further promoted the construction of a strong headquarters, established an office to promote the implementation of the Group's plans, and carried out closed-loop management of major strategies. It established the China Reinsurance Research Institute, set up a new innovation incubation center, and strengthened prospective research and innovation management. It improved the operating performance assessment mechanism and improved the assessment system which focuses on the balanced growth of profits. It continued to build a strong base of reinsurance talent, with the Group's overseas reinsurance talent accounting for over 40 percent and its domestic reinsurance talent accounting for nearly a half in the industry.</p><p>Looking ahead, China Re Group will continue to prioritize stability, focus on its main responsibilities and strengthen its main businesses. China Re will take initiative, seize new development opportunities while strengthening service to national strategies, and steadily improve its operating performance by strengthening value creation.It will consolidate its industry status by strengthening product innovation and technological empowerment, and stick to the bottom line of safety while strengthening risk prevention and control.China Re Group will continue to adhere to the general tone of \"making progress while ensuring stability and value creation\", insist on the business strategy of \"stabilizing growth, adjusting structure, controlling risk and increasing profitability\", stabilize fundamentals, build up new momentum, and actively adapt to industry transformation to continually promote the high-quality development of the Group and create greater value for clients and shareholders.</p>", "model_coding": "None"}, {"bodytext": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By William Nee </emphasis></emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On July 20, in the central plains of Henan province, one of China\u2019s most important regional cities, Zhengzhou, received a record-shattering 622mm of <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/thierrygoosebc/status/1417603447923175424\">rainfall</url> within a 24-hour period.

In the face of severe flooding caused by record-breaking heavy rainfall in northern China, especially flash floods in Henan Province, major water conservancy projects along the Yangtze River in the south also put in place measures for flood control, and dam operators have been constantly on alert for possible sudden flood hazards.<br/><br/>Engineers and experts told the Global Times said that the dams built along the Yangtze River have all passed various tests and been playing a key role in combating seasonal floods. Despite the relatively low rainfall in the Yangtze basin this year, these cascade reservoirs have been a source of security for the life and property of people\u00a0 living along the river.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A robot inspects a 220kV GIS switchyard equipment at the Gezhouba Dam. Photo: Ma Yunyan/Three Gorges Corporation</p><p><br/><br/>Joint operation of 47 dams<br/><br/>According to China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG), in mid-July, the upper stream and tributaries of the Yangtze River experienced persistent heavy rainfall. Faced with two consecutive floods delivering over 40,000 cubic meters of water per second, the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest hydropower project, freed up 1.284 billion cubic meters of reservoir capacity in advance, controlling the discharge flow at about 31,300 cubic meters per second, cutting the peak rate by about 30 percent.<br/><br/>\"The Three Gorges Dam has changed the flood control across the Jingjiang reach of the Yangtze River, raising its flood control standard from once in 10 or 20 years to once in a hundred years,\" Li Shuai, senior engineer at Hub Operation and Management Center of Three Gorges Dam, told the Global Times.\u00a0<br/><br/>In 2020, the Yangtze River experienced several rounds of heavy flooding. The Three Gorges Dam opened 11 spillway tunnels and successfully confronted the largest-ever flood peak of 75,000 cubic meters per second, finally containing a total of 29.5 billion cubic meters of water, accounting for about 60 percent of the total floods prevented in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze.<br/><br/>Data shows that from 2003 to 2020, the Three Gorges Reservoir has been filled 61 times to prevent floods, among which three times were to contain mega-floods of more than 70,000 cubic meters per second.<br/><br/>Experts point out that in addition to the fully operational Three Gorges Dam, the cascade reservoir group in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has also assumed a vital task in resisting the threat of flooding.<br/><br/>In June, China's Ministry of Water Resources approved a conjunctive management plan saying that during this year's flood season, a total of 47 dams along the Yangtze River will be jointly operated for flood control and power generation purposes, with a total flood control storage capacity of 69.5 billion cubic meters. Among them, there are seven dams are under the jurisdiction management of the CTG, with a total regulating reservoir capacity of 47.3 billion cubic meters and 38.6 billion cubic meters flood control reservoir capacity, playing a key role in the flood control system of the Yangtze River Basin.<br/><br/>The Wudongde Reservoir on the upper Yangtze River, which came into full operation in June, is already capable of assisting in flood prevention, and the joint flood control operations will be carried out with its downstream reservoirs such as Baihetan, Xiluodu and Xiangjiaba to improve flood control standards in the Sichuan-Chongqing reach of the Yangtze, in combination with the Three Gorges Reservoir to hold back floodwaters in the middle and lower reaches of the river system, Li said. \"In the Yangtze River basin, there are 1,400 weather stations and more than 20,000 hydro-meteorological stations established for providing most real-time, accurate and comprehensive information for reservoirs' safe operation,\" a representative from the Three Gorges Cascade Dispatch and Communication Center told the Global Times.<br/><br/>The same representative noted that with technical support offered by the BeiDou Satellite Navigation System, the most advanced weather measurement equipment currently adopted by the CTG can issue and update refined weather forecasts every 10 minutes, and can accurately predict the precipitation situation of the entire Yangtze River basin within 10 days on a grid basis management.\u00a0<br/><br/>\"This precipitation and hydrological forecasting system divides upstream areas into more than 130 monitoring sections to measure the runoff into reservoirs through amount of precipitation, and on this basis to make a seven-day rolling operation plan for the terrace reservoir, with the forecast accuracy reaching 98 percent within 24 hours and 92 percent within one week,\" he added.\u00a0<br/><br/>At present, CTG is gradually strengthening inspection procedures for key equipment built into telemetry stations, and increasing the frequency of communication and information sharing with local governments in each reservoir area to ensure a rapid response to special and emergency situations.\u00a0<br/><br/>The Chinese government and many hydropower engineering companies have made an enormous effort to combat flooding, and over the years in a constant struggle against the forces of nature, Chinese people have become more humble, rigorous and respectful of science, forming a series of well-tested and regulated operations to deal with almost any contingency, He Wei, a deputy director of the Engineering and Construction Department of Baihetan Hydropower Station, the world's most technically challenging hydropower project under construction, told the Global Times.<br/><br/>\"The Yangtze River used to be a river that people couldn't harness, but now, the flood of the Yangtze is no longer a beast but a resource,\" He said.</p><p>A giant screen at the Three Gorges Cascade Dispatch and Communication Center\u00a0shows the flood peak shaving process.

As of July 29, the Three Gorges Reservoir has cleared around 20,000 cubic meters of floating material in the dam area.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>At the same times, in response to Western media outlets' claim that China's extensive construction of the dam triggered extreme weather such as heavy rainfall and drought and may even induce earthquakes, Xiang said that the dam may slightly change the local microclimate across the reservoir area, such as water storage makes the reservoir area more moist, more conducive to the growth of green vegetation, but is unlikely to influence the atmospheric circulation or affect the ecology and climate of the whole region.<br/><br/>\"We will proactively respond to critical periods of flood control that typically last until mid-September, ensuring the orderly control of flood storage throughout the cascade reservoirs, in addition to the integration of water resource management and power generation efficiency,\" Xiang said.</p>", "model_coding": "None"}, {"bodytext": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wendy Sherman photo:CFP</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a break from the past approach, when the Chinese side often released a goodwill gesture before a China-US meeting while the US exerted pressure on China, this time before the visit of US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, China announced it is sanctioning six individuals and one entity of the US, a move that Chinese observers said could become a new normal in China-US interaction.\u00a0<br/><br/>Sherman is scheduled to arrive in North China's Tianjin Municipality Sunday night for a meeting with the Chinese side that will draw intensive attention amid increasingly tense bilateral ties fueled recently by the US' moves to impose sanctions on several Chinese officials over Hong Kong and its groundless accusation that China is engaging in cyberattacks worldwide.\u00a0<br/><br/>Chinese experts expressed low expectations for this high-ranking, face-to-face interaction between the two world powers since the Alaska talks, saying it will be more of a gesture to keep in touch rather than yield any actual outcomes.\u00a0<br/><br/>Sherman posted two tweets Sunday night, saying that \"the Biden-Harris Administration is pushing for a level playing field for American companies in China,\" while expressing condolences to victims of the Henan floods.</p><p><br/><br/>The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed Sherman's visit on late Wednesday night, announcing that the senior US official will visit Tianjin from Sunday to Monday, a visit arranged after the US proposal to exchange views on China-US relations. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng, who is in charge of China-US relations at the Ministry, will hold talks with Sherman. Later, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet Sherman, according to the announcement.\u00a0<br/><br/>US no superior\u00a0<br/><br/>Prior to Sherman's China visit, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday warned that China will never accept the US talking with it in a condescending manner.\u00a0<br/><br/>\"The US has always put pressure on others with its self-claimed strengths in a condescending manner,\" Wang said. \"But I want to tell the US side that there is never a country that is superior to others, and there shouldn't be one.\" He also stressed that China will never accept any country who thinks this way.<br/><br/>The senior diplomat's statement was in response to US State Department spokesperson Ned Price's description of Sherman's trip to China as coming \"from a position of strength\" due to its consultations with its allies. The State Department also said in a press release on Wednesday that the meetings are \"part of ongoing US efforts to hold candid exchanges with PRC officials to advance US interests and values, and to responsibly manage the relationship.\"<br/><br/>If the US still has not learned how to treat other countries equally, then China, together with the international community, has a responsibility to teach the US, Wang noted.<br/><br/>Almost at the same time, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin started his trip to Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines on Friday and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will pay a visit to India.\u00a0<br/><br/>Given the overall situation of the China-US relationship, in addition to apparent tensions at the Alaska meeting, the most recent face-to-face interaction between senior officials of the two countries, Chinese officials are unlikely to hold high expectations toward the upcoming dialogue, Li Yan, deputy director of Institute of American Studies of China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Sunday.\u00a0<br/><br/>\"Especially as the US government has taken a series of measures to further suppress China, which has largely lowered the expectations of the Chinese side,\" he said.\u00a0<br/><br/>China said on Friday that it will impose sanctions against six individuals including the former US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Louis Ross and Chairman of US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) Carolyn Bartholomew, as well as one entity of the US, the Hong Kong Democratic Council, according to the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law.<br/><br/>The move is a reciprocal countermeasure against the recent erroneous practice of the US targeting Hong Kong, when the White House issued an advisory to warn US businesses about risks to their operations and activities in Hong Kong, and sanctioned seven Hong Kong liaison office officials, while adding them to the US Treasury's \"specially designated nationals\" list on July 16.<br/><br/>A shift in China policy?<br/><br/>\"Since US President Joe Biden took office, his administration has been following strategies from the Trump era featuring the heavy pressure and dealing with China in a cold way. However, such an approach has been less effective than he anticipated, and Biden is looking for another way around,\" Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Sunday.\u00a0<br/><br/>The US increasingly finds that it needs China's support and coordination on various fronts, including on international issues like Iran, Afghanistan, Myanmar, climate change and trade, experts noted.\u00a0<br/><br/>If the talks go well, the two sides could be setting the stage for higher level meetings as well as meetings on a larger scale. \"For now there have only been talks on the diplomatic front, but dialogues on trade and commerce and other fields could be expected in the future,\" Wu noted.\u00a0<br/><br/>However, Li Yan believes that the US' recent moves to seek interaction with China do not mean there will be a change in the Biden administration's China policy, but indicates that its overall China policy evaluation is close to an end. Also, it has been about six months since Biden took office emphasizing competition, cooperation and confrontation, however, the competition and confrontation have been largely amplified over the past few months, leading to a negative impact on overall China-US relationship which needs to be adjusted.\u00a0<br/><br/>Ways to manage competition<br/><br/>US officials said prior to Sherman's visit that there needs to be a level playing field and guardrails to ensure ties do not turn into conflict, and the world's two largest economies need responsible ways to manage competition, Reuters reported on Sunday.\u00a0<br/><br/>\"She's going to underscore that we do not want that stiff and sustained competition to veer into conflict,\" one senior US administration official noted.\u00a0<br/><br/>The US wants to ensure there are \"guardrails\" and \"parameters\" in place to responsibly manage the relationship,\" he said, adding that \"Everyone needs to play by the same rules,\" according to the Reuters report.\u00a0<br/><br/>However, Chinese observers see such remarks \"vague and far from enough,\" as the \"guardrails\" and \"parameters\" were only set to serve US interests.<br/><br/>\"When the US said it wants to ensure there are guardrails and parameters in place to responsibly manage the relationship, it's still very dangerous if there is no clear boundary, as the competition can evolve into conflict. The real guardrail should emphasize cooperation and explore solutions through cooperation,\" Diao Daming, associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday.\u00a0<br/><br/>Those so-called rules only serve the interests of the US, underscoring the West-defined value systems while attempting to cover a number of issues such as human rights and democracy, Diao noted.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>\"China won't reject playing by the rules, but they must be based on and widely accepted by the international community, in accordance with international law and the UN Charter, not designed by the US alone,\" he said.<br/><br/>Such rule-based international order has been advocated by the Biden administration since he took office in January, which is closer to rhetoric rather than a true standard the US adheres to, as it is unclear on what fundamental this rule is set or who designed it, leaving a lot to be discussed, noted Li Yan.<br/><br/>China has its own rules with which the US side must abide, Wu Xinbo added, including not interfering in China's internal affairs and not infringing on China's core interests. Meetings between Beijing and Washington are a constant process of adjusting and adapting to each other's rules, Wu added.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>", "model_coding": "None"}, {"bodytext": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club (FCC) scrapped <url normalizedValue=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2022/04/25/breaking-hong-kongs-human-rights-press-awards-cancelled/\">the 2022 Human Rights Press Awards</url>\u00a0after defunct outlet Stand News was slated to win a number of prizes.
