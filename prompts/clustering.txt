You are given a collection of text documents. Your task is to cluster these documents into 30 distinct topics. Each cluster should represent a unique theme or subject matter based on the content of the documents.

Please follow these steps:

Preprocess the Documents:

Remove any irrelevant or redundant information.

Handle any formatting issues (e.g., strip excessive whitespace, special characters, etc.).

Normalize text by converting it to lowercase (optional based on use case).

Cluster the Documents:

Analyze the documents and group them into 30 distinct topics.

For each topic, provide a brief summary that encapsulates the core idea of the cluster. This summary should describe the central theme or subject matter of the documents in that group.

Present the Results:

List each cluster and provide the following for each one:

The topic label (a brief title or description for the topic).

A brief summary of the content in that cluster (a 1-2 sentence summary of the main theme).

Example documents from that cluster (provide 1-2 short excerpts or the first few lines of representative documents).

Example Input:

You are given the following documents (you can assume the list will be much longer in real scenarios):

"Global warming is impacting the oceans and causing sea levels to rise."

"The economy is facing a recession due to global inflation and supply chain disruptions."

"Artificial intelligence in healthcare is improving patient diagnosis and treatment."

"Climate change is causing unprecedented wildfires across the globe."

"Machine learning models are revolutionizing industries by automating repetitive tasks."

"The economy is predicted to grow in the next quarter as demand for services rises."

Expected Output:

Cluster 1: Climate Change and Environmental Issues

Summary: This cluster contains documents related to climate change, global warming, and environmental crises like wildfires and rising sea levels.

Example Documents:
"Global warming is impacting the oceans and causing sea levels to rise."
"Climate change is causing unprecedented wildfires across the globe."

Cluster 2: Economic Issues and Recession

Summary: This cluster focuses on the economy, including topics like recessions, inflation, and market fluctuations.

Example Documents:
"The economy is facing a recession due to global inflation and supply chain disruptions."
"The economy is predicted to grow in the next quarter as demand for services rises."

Cluster 3: Technology and Innovation

Summary: This cluster includes topics related to technological advancements such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Example Documents:
"Artificial intelligence in healthcare is improving patient diagnosis and treatment."
"Machine learning models are revolutionizing industries by automating repetitive tasks."

Important Notes:

Ensure the clusters are distinct from one another and don't overlap.

If some documents could belong to multiple topics, categorize them based on their primary focus.

Provide coherent, readable summaries for each cluster.

Instructions:
Once the documents are clustered, please provide your output in a structured format as shown above.
