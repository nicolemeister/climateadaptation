Financial supporters for this research include Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, Through The Fundamental Research Grant Scheme; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Through Dana Padanan Kolaborasi-geran Pembiayaan Sepadan. The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia: "While satellite imagery and deep learning have advanced automated fire detection, many existing approaches remain limited in accurately segmenting small-scale and irregular fire patches. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate GSDABNet, a novel deep semantic segmentation architecture for improved delineation of wildfire regions using Landsat-8 imagery.
  Instance 3: The methodological workflow includes preprocessing Landsat-8 imagery by selecting SWIR-1, SWIR-2, and Blue bands, building the proposed encoder-decoder framework with GS and DAB modules, and training on a publicly available global wildfire dataset. Model evaluation was performed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), with additional ablation studies on GS placement, group size, and shuffle permutations to assess architectural contributions. Results show that the optimal configuration two groups with a (0,1,2,4,3) shuffle applied after the fifth DAB block achieved an mIoU of 0.6476, accuracy of 0.9957, and F1-score of 0.7201, outperforming multiple state-of-the-art benchmark models."  According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "These findings confirm GSDABNet as a highly accurate and computationally efficient framework for wildfire segmentation, contributing to improved early detection, effective risk mitigation, and sustainable forest management."

The units can only reach a certain part and from there they have to work as infantrymen (on foot) with hand tools only".Mayor Mario González expressed his concern for the electricity and telephone supply of Padre Las Casas, since the fire could affect the cables that supply the services."There is a creek where the fire got into.

Lightweight backbone network MobileNetV3 is used to replace the original backbone. Convolutional block attention module attention mechanism is added to make the model pay more attention to local information connection.
  Instance 5: Bidirectional feature pyramid network and small target layer are introduced to dynamically assign weights to identify small targets. Dynamic head is used to improve the flexibility of model inspection. Generalized intersection over union is used as a loss function to improve the accuracy of target positioning."  According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Compared with the benchmark model, the accuracy and average accuracy of YOLO-MC are increased by 4.3 and 3.6%, respectively, and the number of parameters is reduced by 2 x 104, which indicates that YOLO-MC can improve the identification efficiency of early forest fires and realize the early detection of forest fires at the same time. It helps in identifying forest fires as early as possible and has certain practical significance."

The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Northeast Forestry University: "Traditional monitoring approaches primarily rely on single-source satellite imagery and empirical threshold algorithms, and most forest fire monitoring tasks remain human-driven. Existing frameworks have yet to effectively integrate multiple data sources and detection algorithms, lacking the capability to provide continuous, automated, and generalizable fire monitoring across diverse fire scenarios. To address these challenges, this study first improves multiple monitoring algorithms for forest fire detection, including a statistically enhanced automatic thresholding method; data augmentation to expand the U-Net deep learning dataset; and the application of a freeze-unfreeze transfer learning strategy to the U-Net transfer model.

To address these challenges, this study first improves multiple monitoring algorithms for forest fire detection, including a statistically enhanced automatic thresholding method; data augmentation to expand the U-Net deep learning dataset; and the application of a freeze-unfreeze transfer learning strategy to the U-Net transfer model. Multiple algorithms are systematically evaluated across varying fire scales, showing that the improved automatic threshold method achieves the best performance on GF-4 imagery with an F-score of 0.915 (95% CI: 0.8725-0.9524), while the U-Net deep learning algorithm yields the highest F-score of 0.921 (95% CI: 0.8537-0.9739) on Landsat 8 imagery. All methods demonstrate robust performance and generalizability across diverse scenarios.
  Instance 5: All methods demonstrate robust performance and generalizability across diverse scenarios. Second, data-driven scheduling technology is developed to automatically initiate preprocessing and fire detection tasks, significantly reducing fire discovery time. Finally, an integrated framework of multi-source remote sensing data, advanced detection algorithms, and a user-friendly visualization interface is proposed."  According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "This framework enables all-weather, fully automated forest fire monitoring and early warning, facilitating dynamic tracking of fire evolution and precise fire line localization through the cross-application of heterogeneous data sources. The framework's effectiveness and practicality are validated through wildfire cases in two regions of Yunnan Province, offering scalable technical support for improving early detection of and rapid response to forest fires."

  Instance 4: WE RECOMMEND YOUSin Guión | Phillip Butters in LR In terms of fauna, the species affected are Andean foxes, partridges, eagles, small birds, lizards, wild guinea pigs and other rodents. It is worth mentioning that, although these animals have not been consumed by the fire, their habitat has been destroyed, so they end up displaced. The Serfor official pointed out that the exact number of hectares devastated by the forest fire on Saturday and Sunday has not yet been calculated. Only in the first hours of the fire, 47 hectares were estimated, but the figure increased as the hours went by. Invaders are suspected of causing the fire.
  Instance 5: The mayor asked the Regional Government of Arequipa to protect the slopes of the Misti volcano from human presence, remembering that they are high risk areas. At the moment, the encroachments continue to grow towards the volcano, some of them only 4 kilometers away. New forest fire   The Regional Government of Arequipa informed that this September 15 a new small forest fire was registered in the high part of the district of Cayma, around 11:00 am. According to the entity, the fire was controlled by midday, but it is still being monitored. •Arequipa•Forest fires•Misti Volcano•SerforCENFEN-73157264CENFEN2025urn:contentItem:6GRW-S8K3-RXVG-23BK-00000-004436072025-09-16Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 15, 2025 MondayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSST0009RTQMOUNTAINSSTX001009FOREST FIRESST0009FYFLIFE FORMSSTX000187BIRDSST0009OG7MAMMALSN920000CCGOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONST000CFERANIMALSST000DOX0WILDFIRESST0009FJKNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSSTX000726FIRESST0008ZJWRODENTSST0009G89REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTSGC353PERUEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Forest ManagementZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU

But on Saturday (Sunday AEST), he'll at long last be able to introduce himself to the Forest faithful at their City Ground citadel in Nottingham, and though he's not making a song and dance about his belated bow, he'll be quietly desperate for "home comforts" to finally help him break his duck at the fifth attempt. After an opening defeat at Arsenal in the Premier League and getting knocked out of the League Cup across the Welsh border in Swansea, he's since endured a draw at Burnley and, earlier this week, another with Real Betis on Forest's return to European competition after a three-decade absence.
  Instance 2: "The players - Igor [Jesus], Elliot [Anderson] - are growing all the time. The centre-backs are showing personality, the full-backs are adjusting."   But Forest will be without midfielder Douglas Luiz, who faces a scan on the hamstring injury suffered against Betis, while centre-back Murillo remains absent with a thigh injury as they seek to beat a Sunderland side who are three points ahead of them in the table in seventh.AAPNEW-AAPNEW2025urn:contentItem:6GV3-DWK3-RV39-204H-00000-001605862025-09-266:52 AM AESTCopyright 2025 Australian Associated Press Pty.

"FFMVic is working on agreements to secure additional emergency response vehicles from other states if required."The vehicles are used by FFMVic for accessing remote terrain and have been grounded because of cracking issues with the chassis on the G-wagons.Victorian Nationals leader Danny O'Brien slammed the Labor government for grounding the vehicles before fire season."It's only literally ...

The government needs to come out today and explain what the implications of that are, how they're dealing with it and how they're going to get those firefighting vehicles back on-stream."FFMVic reportedly brought additional vehicles online for bushfire season preparedness and in the event of an emergency.Mr O'Brien, who is also the opposition spokesperson for emergency services, said he was particularly concerned  the retirement of the fleet would mean a reliance on Country Fire Authority volunteers. A CFA spokesperson said the organisation has been working closely with partners to prepare for the summer."Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic) has been keeping CFA informed of the progress of the current fleet repairs, and we have assisted FFMV with the provision of fire vehicles that were due to go to disposal," the spokesperson said. "CFA will assist FFMV as we always have, in a joint and complementary manner."Mr O'Brien also pointed to the  emergency services and volunteers fund levy, which came into effect on July 1, 2025 ."Victorians are paying an additional $3 billion through Labor's new emergency services tax," he said. "Yet the CFA is relying on ageing vehicles and is now being asked to cover for FFMVic, an organisation now being funded by these additional taxes."A protest against the emergency services levy at Chesney Vale in the North East.

History lesson up in smoke [2]
  Instance 1: The government's own reports show the annual area of prescribed burns has halved under Labor's 10 years' in power. That cut has come amid a massive hike in government tax revenue, which has grown from $16.5bn in 2013-14 to an estimated $41.56bn in the 2025-26 Budget. But rather than increasing resources to Forest Fire Management Victoria to undertake more fuel reduction burns, the government has cut its funding.

State's frontline fire fleet crippled [4]

"When the Premier warns of a dangerous fire season, Victorians -deserve answers on how this failure was allowed to -happen and what steps will be taken to ensure community safety."Victorians are paying an additional $3bn through Labor's new emergency services tax, yet the CFA is relying on ageing vehicles and is now being asked to cover for FFMV, an organisation now being funded by these additional taxes." Opposition public land management spokeswoman Melina Bath slammed the government for leaving regional Victoria exposed."Grounding Victoria's frontline fleet weeks before fire season is an unacceptable failure, given nearly 40 per cent of the state is public land," Ms Bath said. "Victorians are paying more but getting less protection." A government spokesman confirmed safety checks had identified issues on almost 300 vehicles, with repairs to be "fast-tracked over the next two months"."The safety of our firefighters is paramount, that's why regular safety inspections of vehicles and equipment are so important," he said."FFMVic has already completed its bushfire preparedness work for the coming season and has the vehicle capacity to respond in a bushfire emergency." The spokesman said a contingency fleet was available as well as Landcruiser vehicles, Fire Tankers and bulldozers.

Missing man 'thought I was a dead duck' [2]
  Instance 1: What should have been a quick trip spiralled into a missing person case spanning a huge area in the state's east.Police issued a public appeal on October 12, citing "deep concerns" the insulin-dependent diabetic could be lost and confused. "I thought I was a dead duck in water ... I just drank lots of water," Mr Milne told 9News.He was found in remote bushland near Buchan on Thursday night after Forest Fire Management Victoria staff responded to a fire near Kirby Cross Track about 5pm."On arrival, fire crews spotted the Jeep Wrangler on the unmarked track adjacent to the fire and subsequently located Troy nearby," Victoria Police spokesman Acting Inspector Kris Hamilton said."Troy's vehicle had bottomed out on the terrain and was not drivable. As a result, the 61-year-old lit a fire in the hope emergency services would respond." Wellington Police Service Area Inspector Wayne Rothwell said finding Mr Milne alive was a "remarkable outcome". "We really feared the worst, so to be able to contact Troy's family and give them the fantastic news was a wonderful result," he said.

He said Troy was without his medication for a long period, "which left him disorientated and confused".DAITEL-33d8391aaae511f0bf8e487ecac5c70e516f158f7d63b3a08480d7d84d9f34e4DAITEL2025urn:contentItem:6H0N-K333-S3X8-J3TG-00000-002447862025-10-19Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights ReservedThe Daily Telegraph (Australia)Telegraph2 EditionOctober 18, 2025 SaturdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHSTX000486DIABETESSTX001009FOREST FIRESST000CA23CAMPINGSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX001151MISSING PERSONSST000DSN2INSULIN DRUGSST000DTIOFIRE MANAGEMENTN922120QMPOLICE FORCESST000DLZBEMERGENCY SERVICESST000DOX0WILDFIRESSTX000726FIRESST000DSVEOUTDOOR TOURISMST000DSN2INSULIN DRUGSGX015MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIAGS007VICTORIA, AUSTRALIACivil ProcedureZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzUxNjJDMEQ5N0YwNDMzM0JDMjEzM0UzOTYzMzI3OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Timing of AppealsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDY1Q0Q0MTcxOUVCNEFGNkE1MUJDQTI1OEUwMjBERkU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUE4NUFGMzRCNjZFNEI1ODlBRkI1MUFBNUFBNkI4QzYLower Court JurisdictionZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDEyQTlDQzVDQkYyNDFDMzhFRkMwRDhBN0Y1NTlEQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ1NzExM0JCM0M2NDU0NkE2NDk2QUYwNEQ5NzE4NjEConstitutional LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Scope of ProtectionZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzQ2QkNCOTE5MDgxNDNEQkI1MzNERUY0RjQxNUYzQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjA3NjVGQkZGQjgwNEJFM0FBM0FGMzlCN0Q4REJGNzQCriminal Law &amp; ProcedureZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Time LimitationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0ZGNTQxRjIxNzUwNDYyQ0IyNEQ2NUUxMTNFQjExMDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTc1RTJCQzAyOTFGNDE4MDg5NzhBNUMwMjQ3MjI5RjIEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Forest ManagementZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTUGovernmentsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Ordinances &amp; RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ1MzRDRUY1OTZBNDRDNTlDODQzRDRCMUFCNDc2RTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0QEmployees &amp; OfficialsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDNCMDQzRTY3RDY3NDNEOEE4RDg2OUFEOTRBNDREQzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q

He was found around 5pm on Thursday evening in Buchan in East Gippsland after an extensive nine-day search operation.Police had concerns for Mr Milne's health, as he is an insulin-dependent diabetic. He was discovered near his Jeep Wrangler close to the Kirby Cross Track after Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic) responded to reports of a fire. Wellington Police Service Area Inspector Wayne Rothwell said he was found dehydrated, but was OK. "His medical condition caused him to become confused," Inspector Rothwell said.
  Instance 2: "It appears Troy has lit a fire to bring attention to himself," Inspector Rothwell said. Mr Milne has been taken to hospital for treatment and observation.

Some scientists challenge logic of Victoria's fuel reduction burns [3]
  Instance 1: But some scientists are asking if fuel burns are the best way to reduce fire risk. Planned burns are a cornerstone of Australian bushfire preparedness. And a dry winter in regional Victoria throughout 2025 has presented forest fire management teams with opportunities for extra fuel load reduction burns. But as Victorians brace for heightened fire risks this summer, particularly in western and south-western regions of the state, a growing chorus of ecologists and environmentalists is challenging the planned burns methodology.Some say planned burns are causing more harm than good, with resources better directed to new technologies and a more bespoke approach to fuel reduction ahead of the fire season. Country Fire Authority (CFA) assistant chief fire officer Brian Russell said conditions, particularly in South Gippsland, had been dry during winter and into spring.
  Instance 2: He said while rain was on the way this spring, it was "not going to make a big difference". "The fire danger is still there," Mr Russell said. "As soon as we get a bit of sun and a bit of wind, we will have those fire conditions again."Peter Brick is a regional manager for Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic) in Gippsland. He said autumn and winter presented opportunities to undertake extra fuel reduction in the state. "We were able to treat nearly 40,000 hectares of public lands across 81 different planned burns," he said."They'll provide immediate benefit this summer to reduce the risk of bushfire to the community." Other fuel reduction works conducted throughout winter include fuel break maintenance, roadside slashing, and track maintenance.
  Instance 3: FFMVic chief fire officer Chris Hardman said its bushfire risk management program was underpinned by a significant body of evidence and the department continued to invest in research and the best science. "We use science and modelling tools to choose the right time and approach to deliver our bushfire risk management program, including planned burns, mowing, slashing and spraying," he said. "We know from both research and practical experience that fuel management slows the spread of fire, and helps firefighters reduce threats to communities, critical infrastructure and the environment."ABCPNW-105666680ABCPNW2025urn:contentItem:6H13-94M3-SJ80-B2RS-00000-003002242025-10-20Copyright 2025 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights ReservedABC Premium News (Australia)October 20, 2025 MondayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsENGLISHDisasters, Accidents and Emergency Incidents:Disasters and Hazards:Fires:BushfiresDisasters, Accidents and Emergency Incidents:Disaster and Emergency Response:Emergency ServicesDisasters, Accidents and Emergency Incidents:Disaster and Emergency ResponseGovernment and Politics:State and Territory GovernmentAustralia:VIC:SaleAustralia:VIC:WarragulST000DRETPRESCRIBED FIRESST000DT12TECHNOLOGYST000DTIOFIRE MANAGEMENTST0009SI7ENVIRONMENTALISMSTX001826WEATHERST000D1BYEXECUTIVESST000DSY2DISASTER RISK REDUCTIONST000DT1HNATURAL SCIENCESSTX001949LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENTSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESSTX001009FOREST FIRESST000DLX0PUBLIC LANDSSTX001964SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGYSTX001066MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORSST0009FY2ECOLOGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCEST000CEC1FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETYST000DOX0WILDFIRESSTX000726FIRESST0009JY5COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORSST000DOQLAUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRESST000DRETPRESCRIBED FIRESST0009JY5COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORSGS007VICTORIA, AUSTRALIAGC301AUSTRALIAEnergy &amp; Utilities LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUE5QTI3M0EzMzA2NERGRjk0NUM1RjBEMzNBMTJGMTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTY1MkM5NEQwRkY0NDEwNjgwM0JBNUQyNzNFM0QwNkYEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Forest ManagementZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU

The Australian has calculated that number was running at about 1.5 per cent in 2023-24, the estimation based on publicly available information.Mr Squires warned that NSW was also exposed and there was broad risk of another disaster in Victoria: "It just could go wrong." He said this meant the fire risk had soared and that heavily populated areas in Victoria including the Dandenongs, Yarra Valley, Otway Ranges and Mornington Peninsula were at high risk.Asked whether the Victorian government had done enough, he said: "It certainly has not." Fire safety is looming as a potentially major issue at the next Victorian election after Labor overhauled fire fighting services and imposed an unpopular fire services tax.Forest Fire Management Victoria is working in an environment of extreme budget pressure but with a growing population that continues to encroach on rural areas, especially in the interface zones outside Melbourne.The Black Saturday royal commission backed a then doubling of prescribed burn-offs to 5 per cent of public land but Victoria deemed in 2016 that the target was not achievable.Climate variability has also reduced the window of opportunity for burning off in the nearly nine million hectares of public land.Opposition public land spokeswoman Melina Bath said Labor's failure to manage fuel loads had been an act of "reckless -complacency"."Labor's neglect of Victoria's public forests is a disaster waiting to happen; its fuel reduction program has collapsed from around 200,000ha to barely 100,000ha," the Nationals MP said."Labor stopped fuel load mapping in 2020, leaving communities completely in the dark. Regional Victorians live with the consequences of Labor's mismanagement each and every fire season." The hardest hit areas on Black Saturday in 2009 included Marysville on the edge of the Yarra -Ranges, where 34 people died and hundreds of buildings, mainly houses, were wiped out .The fire season in Victoria, South Australian and Tasmania - typically the worst areas in Australia - tends to start later in the season compared with Queensland and NSW.The severity of the season will hinge on full loads, dryness of the fuel, temperature on any day, wind severity and topography.Victoria's Dandenong Ranges and Otway National Forest are well overdue for major fires, potentially affecting thousands of people.Acting FFMVic chief fire officer Scott Turner said emergency services were well-prepared "for all emerging risks" linked to an earlier bushfire season.He said FFMVic used every possible time to cut the risk through planned burns and other so-called mechanical means such as mowing, spraying, fuel breaks and maintaining road access."Reducing bushfire risk occurs throughout the year," he said. "Our long-term strategy focuses on building a strategic network of fuel-reduced areas across public land, not just through one burn or one year, but through ongoing planned action." Risk minimisation also focused on emergency warning systems and community engagement.A core issue in the royal commission report was the lack of proper communications systems, especially around fire locations.

"Our long-term strategy focuses on building a strategic network of fuel-reduced areas across public land, not just through one burn or one year, but through ongoing planned action.''Risk minimisation also focused on emergency warning systems and community engagement.A core issue in the royal commission report was the lack of proper communications systems, especially around fire locations.Since Black Saturday, an inevitable sense of complacency has hit some areas, especially among so-called tree changers, who have ­arrived in areas that are impossible to defend.AUSTOL-121c5fc7fc3856b361cba4a1d1eec240AUSTOL2025urn:contentItem:6H40-P1K3-RS22-J13R-00000-004723022025-11-0210:41 AM AEDTCopyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights ReservedWish Magazine OnlineNovember 2, 2025 SundayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsENGLISHemergency warning systemscommunity disastersBushfire expertsfire-prone areasNorth AmericaMelbournefire riskfire services taxbushfire seasonYarra Glenfire agencyReducing bushfire riskinterface zonesfuel loadsVictoriaTasmaniaHealesvilleCaliforniaexposed bushfire areasFERGUSONfire locationsroyal commission reportNorthern Americaroyal commission recommendationso-called tree changersScott Turnerfuel reduction programVic fire agencyUnited States of Americacommunications systemsMornington PeninsulaOceaniamitigation measuresHowitt SocietyClimate variabilityAmericaMelina Bathbushfire disasterfire seasonemergency servicesFire safetyroyal commission demandspublic landAustralia and New ZealandGarry Squiresroad accessproperty destructionbushfire disaster riskRisk minimisationbushfire disaster loomsextreme budgetroyal commissiontargets setLos Angelesunpopular fire servicesAustraliaprescribed burn offsQueenslandST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001511RURAL COMMUNITIESST000DRETPRESCRIBED FIRESST00095ADFOREST RESOURCES MANAGEMENTST000DTIOFIRE MANAGEMENTSTX002021SAFETYSTX001949LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENTSTX000453DEATH &amp; DYINGSTX001009FOREST FIRESST000DLX0PUBLIC LANDSSTX001987FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDSSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST0009QD4NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWSST000CEC1FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETYST000DOX0WILDFIRESSTX000726FIRESST000DRETPRESCRIBED FIRESST00095ADFOREST RESOURCES MANAGEMENTSTX000218BUDGETSGX015MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIAGX543LOS ANGELES, CA, USAGS008TASMANIA, AUSTRALIAGS007VICTORIA, AUSTRALIAGS002QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIAGS001NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIAGS120CALIFORNIA, USAGT116OCEANIAGR156AUSTRALIA &amp; NEW ZEALANDGC343UNITED STATESGC301AUSTRALIAGR120NORTH AMERICAGC351NEW ZEALANDAdministrative LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Public InspectionZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTA0REYwOTdDQzZBNDRGRThCN0Y3NENCNDk2NEFGNzQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgzODczMjc1N0UxNDFDNUJDNDc0Qzc1NzhCQkJCMzMBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Overtime &amp; Work PeriodsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDIyRUUyMjlBMjdCNEQ1QkFGMDIyNUIyRDc2QTYzNjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTZBOUIyNzU3RjkxNDQ1QUE3MUZDQjUxOTRENTUzMkQEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Forest ManagementZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTULabor &amp; Employment LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTE3QUQwOTA0MUYzNDlCMEFFMjUwRUNDM0RDRkM5QzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Overtime &amp; Work PeriodsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDIyRUUyMjlBMjdCNEQ1QkFGMDIyNUIyRDc2QTYzNjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTZBOUIyNzU3RjkxNDQ1QUE3MUZDQjUxOTRENTUzMkQ
Warnings issued as campers ignore bans [2]
  Instance 1: In addition to the fine, people are also liable for any damage their campfire causes if it becomes out of control. And with plantations worth approximately $140,000 per hectare, a simple weekend away could end up costly.But the biggest cost of all is the safety of forest users. Mr Robb said an out-of-control forest fire becomes very dangerous very quickly, to everyone in the forest at the time."People don't realise the danger they put themselves and other forest users in, let alone the damage to our business," he said. "We're responsible for all forest users, but we're also responsible to the business. It's a taxpayer business of pine plantation.

Page maintenance is at the discretion of the publisher.Timothy CoxA grassfire burnt out of control near Ballarat on Monday afternoon, prompting an unusually large emergency response for the pre-fire season period.A CFA spokesman said 27 crews and 90 personnel in total were called to tackle the grass and scrubfire that broke out near Berringa about 1.30pm."Crews discovered a large grassfire producing a significant amount of smoke,'' the spokesman said."The grassfire is located in difficult terrain."Air support and Forest Fire Management Victoria were called to the scene to assist.VicEmergency listed a watch and act for residents in Berringa, Cape Clear, Springdallah as the fire moved southeast from Moonlight Creek Rd towards Derwent Jacks and Staffordshire Reef Roads.Strong winds and dangerous trees slowed down firefighers' efforts early on.As of Monday afternoon, about 10ha had been burnt on the private parcel of land.The fire was deemed under control at 6.24pm and safe at 8.18pm.CFA incident controller and Grenville Group officer Greg Parker said investigations continued regarding the cause of the fire."Obviously at the moment there's a lot of people that are burning off in the area trying to clean up before the fire danger period and fire season takes effect, so people just need to be mindful and make sure that they black out their fires prior to leaving, especially if it is a weekender that lives elsewhere," he said."The number of appliances and the area that it's burnt is very unusual for this time of year, being so early."But the bush and areas are still quite dry because of the lack of rainfall across the area."CFA members have already begun preparations for the fire season.HERSOL-0ee09fdc93192a59f58aa99b3e5384efHERSOL2025urn:contentItem:6GVP-VXK3-RSRC-H4CY-00000-004722512025-09-3011:30 PM AEDTCopyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights ReservedThe Goulburn Valley News OnlineSeptember 29, 2025 MondayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsENGLISHCFASTX001009FOREST FIRESST000DLZBEMERGENCY SERVICESSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST000DOX0WILDFIRESSTX000726FIRESSTX001826WEATHERSTX000969INVESTIGATIONSST000DTIOFIRE MANAGEMENTGS007VICTORIA, AUSTRALIAEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Forest ManagementZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTUGovernmentsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Ordinances &amp; RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ1MzRDRUY1OTZBNDRDNTlDODQzRDRCMUFCNDc2RTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0QTortsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Creators of Foreseeable PerilZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkU1NDA5QUJDQjVCNDFBMEFDM0VDMTU5M0Q3NzlGQTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkMxMzk0RTFGNjRENDlFOEIzNTcwOTZGRTk2N0RBQTE

So we're responsible for looking after that asset for the taxpayer, and if it gets burnt, that's not a good thing."From October 1 until April 30 - subject to fire conditions - no solid fuel, wood fires or little ovens are permitted in state forests.Mr Paul said campers can only use gas appliances, and even then, cannot leave them unattended at any time.He asks that people enjoying the forests for their recreational activities simply follow the regulations, for the safety of themselves, others and the plantation.Forestry Corporation ranger Paul Robb reminds forest users the fire ban has commenced.

A Watch and Act, and Advice warning  was issued to the community to stay near shelter and stay Informed."A fire investigator has been called to the scene and investigations are still underway."The CFA said no assets were under threat and the scene was deemed under control at 6.24pm.It was the first major blaze of the season, coming just weeks after the  CFA urged residents in bushfire-prone areas  to get a bushfire plan in place and start preparing their properties for the summer.It also comes as the hay season begins in the western part of Victoria, with farmers being urged to take extra care to prevent haystack fires.Haystack fires are often caused by spontaneous combustion when hay is baled with excess moisture.High moisture levels, combined with the compact nature of hay bales, can create internal heat, leading to ignition.In the 2024/25 financial year, the CFA said it responded to 73 haystack and hay shed fires in regional areas, with 53 per cent occurring in the west and northwest of the state.A CFA truck near the scene of a grass and scrub fire in Berringa, south-west of Ballarat on September 29, 2025.

A Watch and Act, and Advice warning  was issued to the community to stay near shelter and stay Informed."A fire investigator has been called to the scene and investigations are still underway."The CFA said no assets were under threat and the scene was deemed under control at 6.24pm.It was the first major blaze of the season, coming just weeks after the  CFA urged residents in bushfire-prone areas  to get a bushfire plan in place and start preparing their properties for the summer.It also comes as the hay season begins in the western part of Victoria, with farmers being urged to take extra care to prevent haystack fires.Haystack fires are often caused by spontaneous combustion when hay is baled with excess moisture.High moisture levels, combined with the compact nature of hay bales, can create internal heat, leading to ignition.In the 2024/25 financial year, the CFA said it responded to 73 haystack and hay shed fires in regional areas, with 53 per cent occurring in the west and northwest of the state.A CFA truck near the scene of a grass and scrub fire in Berringa, south-west of Ballarat on September 29, 2025.

BREAKING BARRIERS [2]
  Instance 1: 7BREAKING BARRIERSTESSA HAYWARDTYSON NEAL-EDWARDS IS RUNNING IN THE NEW YORK CITY MARATHON TOMORROW, BUT HE TELLS TESSA HAYWARD THE REAL JOURNEY STARTS WHEN HE FINISHES IT The sound of his feet hitting the pavement is all that Tyson Neal-Edwards hears when he is running.There's no music blaring through headphones or any distractions. Instead, this is his time to think.Six months ago, the 23-year-old had never even considered running a marathon, let alone going on runs consistently.But his decision to apply for the Indigenous Marathon Project (IMP) Squad, and be selected first go, changed everything.The proud Gunditjmara, Wadawurrung and Arrernte man will take on the New York City Marathon tomorrow as part of the IMP Squad of inspiring First Nations runners and changemakers who are breaking barriers, building leadership and creating healthier futures through running.But as Tyson explains, being a part of the IMP Squad is so much more than just running a marathon."It is a leadership and development program at its core," he says. To apply for the six-month program, applicants must not have run a marathon before and be aged between 18 and30.Twelve Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people are then selected to train for the New York City Marathon.Education is a compulsory part of the program, which is run by the Indigenous Marathon Foundation, and includes education on leadership, first aid, mental health and media training.Physical and mental boundaries are pushed to a new level and the marathon is used to support members to realise that they can achieve anything.Tyson, who works in forest fire management, says he initially applied as he liked networking with mob and like-minded people."Being in the program has changed my why significantly, it has been a very emotional journey," he shares."I am the oldest of seven siblings and I want to lead by action. Action speaks louder than words so I want to do my best and show them that."You can be what you can't see, they don't have to run marathons, but you can do anything." Training for the marathon started six months ago and Tyson says they started with the Mother's Day Classic 10km in Canberra in May, followed by half marathons on the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast.The 30km election run in Alice Springs was their final challenge, It was the most emotional for Tyson, with both his nan and sister there supporting him.If all these runs are completed, you are selected to go to New York. "It's been pretty hard, challenging in a few aspects, not just physically but mentally.
  Instance 2: "I thoroughly enjoy that part of the day when I have no distractions, no phone," he says."I get to calm down and think about things I didn't want to think about and I love hearing my feet. You get in a flow state," he says."I'm so happy I can share my story, particularly for my mum and my nan. They made me who I am today."

ON THE BACKBURNER [2]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6H31-8523-RSR8-53TT-00000-00ON THE BACKBURNER2025-10-29T00:00:00Z2025-11-03T19:29:32ZLexisNexisNEWSPg. 1ON THE BACKBURNERPETER HUNT and DAVID JOHNSTONYears of neglect have left Victorians at risk, in what is shaping up to be one of the worst fire seasons in more than a decade.A lack of resources has meant a steady decline in fuel reduction burns, which state government records show have slumped from about 200,000ha annually, when Labor came to power in late 2014, to about 100,000ha in recent years.That decline comes despite the Allan government raking in an extra $540m in fire services tax this financial year.Howitt Society president Peter Flinn said fuel reduction burns now amounted to little more than 1 per cent of Victoria's public land each year, "just one fifth of the minimum recommended per annum by the royal commission into the horrendous 2009 Black Saturday fires, which claimed 173 lives"."We are frequently told by FFMV (Forest Fire Management Victoria) they would like to do more in terms of fuel management, but are constrained by a shortage of funds and/or manpower, objections from some sections of the community, and that climate change is 'narrowing the windows' for suitable weather conditions," he said. The government has admitted FFMV funding has fallen from $441.3m 2024-25 to $400.6m this financial year, but stated it was the result of specific project funding for emergency management reforms coming to an end.However Mr Flinn said the lack of resources meant fuel reduction burns that FFMVic promised to undertake in the Southern Grampians this spring had not occurred, as thousands of tonnes of fuel built up in the canopy and the forest floor.Further east FFMVic has cleared windblown trees from 1100ha of the 44,700ha Wombat-Lerderderg Forest, but has admitted there are large areas where thousands of logs remain lying on the forest floor from 2021 storms.Bush User Groups United representative Stephen Smitham said the situation could get a lot worse, once the government locked up 75,000ha of the forest in new parks and reserves, under legislation before Parliament's Upper House this week. "I'd already be worried about going into the forest if I was a CFA volunteer," Mr Smitham said.
  Instance 2: If it gets into that regrowth from the 2019-20 fires on the road between Ensay and Bruthen it would go off like a nuclear bomb." As FFMVic struggles to reduce fuel loads the Allan government has almost doubled fire service taxes on Victorian households and businesses, from $839m in 2023-24 to $1.54bn this financial year, with another hike to $1.8bn in 2026-27.Premier Jacinta Allan and her Treasurer Jaclyn Symes have repeatedly stated "every dollar" of the emergency services volunteer tax would be used to fund emergency services, but have repeatedly refused to detail how much extra is going to FFMVic and the CFA in 2025-26.When asked to provide details of the CFA's 2025-26 budget, Treasurer Symes office simply stated details would be released in the agency's annual report, which is unlikely to be released until after next year's November 28 state election.Meanwhile, Victorians have been left in the dark on just how much fuel has built up in forests that cover a third of the state. In 2020 the government stopped publishing fuel load maps for fear they could be used by arsonists, an argument the nation's leading bushfire scientists branded "ludicrous" and "a load of rubbish".Since then the government has simply reported on statewide and regional fuel-driven bushfire risk reduction targets.The government has set at a statewide target that equates to reducing the loss of life and property to 70 per cent of what would have occurred if no planned burning or major fires had occurred (100 per cent).But even then access to the latest 2024-25 risk report has been delayed until December.The most recent publicly available report for 2023-24 showed the bushfire risk at a regional level had reached 92 per cent in Melbourne's foothills, the Dandenongs and Mornington Peninsula, worse than in the lead-up to the 2009 Black Saturday fires.When asked to supply the 2024-25 risk reports FFMVic stated they would not be released until December.
