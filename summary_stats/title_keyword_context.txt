WMO: WEATHER DISASTERS UP FIVEFOLD IN 1970-2019 [2]
  Instance 1: It notes over 90 percent of the deaths occurred in developing countries.In Asia, more than 975,000 lives were lost through storms and floods, accounting for nearly half the casualties. One particularly deadly disaster was a cyclone that hit Myanmar in 2008, claiming over 130,000 lives.Africa accounts for 35 percent of weather-associated deaths reported globally. Droughts led to the highest number of fatalities, accounting for 95 percent of all lives lost in the continent.The report says economic losses, standing at 3.64 trillion dollars during the 50-year period, have jumped sevenfold.Notable examples are Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall in the southern United States in 2005, causing damages of nearly 164 billion dollars, and the 2017 Hurricane Harvey, which led to losses of almost 96 billion dollars.The report says improved multi-hazard early warning systems have significantly reduced mortality, but much more remains to be done, as only half of the 193 members of the WMO have such systems.Meeting reporters, WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said investment is needed both in the observation systems and early warning services of the countries.He stressed the need to assist developing countries, saying forecasting high-impact weather events such as flooding or storms can save lives and also prevent economic losses.

UPDATE1: U.S. seeks stronger ties with Africa in 3-day summit amid China clout [2]
  Instance 1: The accords also support activities of the Artemis project, a U.S.-led international effort aimed at advancing lunar exploration and eventually sending astronauts on missions to Mars. Other nations that have joined the accords include Japan, South Korea, Australia and France. A senior State Department official stressed the need for space cooperation, citing how a Nigerian satellite became the first to deliver urgently needed first images showing the scale of damage when Hurricane Katrina hit southeastern United States in 2005. Upon announcing its hosting of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, the White House said the gathering will "demonstrate the United States' enduring commitment to Africa, and will underscore the importance of U.S.-Africa relations and increased cooperation on shared global priorities." Biden also intends to announce during the event U.S. support for the AU to join the Group of 20 major economies as a permanent member, hoping to bring more voices from Africa into the international forum, according to White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.
  Instance 2: China has been holding the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation every three years since 2000, while other nations including Russia and Japan also hold Africa summits. The latest U.S.-Africa gathering, however, is only the second Africa summit held by the United States, with the first occurring in 2014, according to Sheehy. China's first overseas military base has been established in the East African nation of Djibouti on the Bab el Mandeb Strait, a chokepoint between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.==KyodoJEN-470ed29edc6b46408e379b9a8ae47c3820221214APJEN2022urn:contentItem:6733-R8G1-DYMD-63P9-00000-001447602022-12-1312:16 AM GMTCopyright 2022 Kyodo News Service All Rights ReservedJapan Economic NewswireDecember 14, 2022 WednesdayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHAFRICAN UNIONAfrican UnionChina governmentUnited States governmentChinaAfricaHurricanes and typhoonsPoliticsST0008WTASPACE EXPLORATIONN928000CCINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp; NATIONAL SECURITYST00097CUINTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONSST000A4QFCOLD WARST000DLOJGOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERSSTX001669TALKS &amp; MEETINGSN928120MMSTATE DEPARTMENTS &amp; FOREIGN SERVICESST000DS9HARTEMIS PROGRAMSTX001996NATIONAL SECURITYST0008YVRASTRONOMY &amp; SPACEST0009F7UHURRICANESST00097CPDEFENSE DEPARTMENTSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST0008WTASPACE EXPLORATIONST000DS9HARTEMIS PROGRAMSTX001914TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTUREST00097CPDEFENSE DEPARTMENTSSTX000851HIGHWAYS &amp; STREETSPE0009TJKJOE BIDENST000A28MMARSGR215SOUTHEAST USAGT111AFRICAGC302CHINAGC343UNITED STATESGC306JAPANGC334NIGERIAGC578RUSSIAN FEDERATIONGC307KOREA, REPUBLIC OFGC554RWANDAGC317FRANCE

How Will the Covid-19 Pandemic Change the New International Order? [1]
  Instance 1: Henry Kissinger came up with the idea of creating the International Energy Agency (IEA) to create a strategic reserve system, to promote alternative energy sources such as coal and natural gas, and also to geographically diversify oil supply sources. He thought that national security and energy security were two sides of the same coin, and therefore selfreliance should not be a solution. This proved to be a boon following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when US domestic supplies of refinery products saw a shortage, and the IEA mechanism and imports help to calm the market. Following the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak and then the antiJapanese demonstrations in China in 2012, Japanese enterprises launched a 'China+1' strategy to diversify their supply chains. Similarly, after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 a European automaker that had been sourcing key equipment solely from a Japanese component maker decided to go back to traditional dual sourcing, as the sole supplier could not establish factories outside of Japan and guarantee replacement supplies without delay.The lesson from these experiences is 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket.' By diversification, a more resilient supply system can be built and strengthened through international cooperation.

Of an estimated $380 billion in economic losses, almost two-thirds stemmed from the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, the German reinsurer said.The March earthquake and tsunami in Japan was the most destructive of the around 820 natural disasters last year, resulting in $35 billion to $40 billion in insurance claims. Even excluding the consequences of the subsequent nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, the quake and tsunami in northeastern Japan caused $210 billion in economic losses, the company estimated.The Christchurch earthquake in February was the second costliest natural disaster for insurers with $13 billion in claims, followed by the massive flooding in Thailand with $10 billion.

IEA members to release oil reserves to control rising oil prices [2]

Bush's most trusted advisers and his longest-serving aide, said Friday he is resigning to begin a career outside of government, the Associated Press reported.Bartlett has been with Bush for nearly 14 years, from Bush's first campaign as governor of Texas, through two races for the White House and more than six years of a presidency marked by costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and an ongoing battle against terrorism.As counselor to the president, Bartlett has been at the center of White House decision-making, stepping into the public eye in times of trouble to defend Bush on everything from the unpopular war in Iraq to the government's bungled response to Hurricane Katrina and the Republicans' loss of Congress."He can talk to the president in a candid way, in sort of a family way, that almost nobody else can," White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten told AP.With the exception of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's resignation last November, Bartlett's departure marks the first major turnover in Bush's senior staff since a major reshuffling a year ago to reinvigorate the administration and overcome low poll ratings.Bartlett's resignation is effective around July 4, Bolten was quoted as saying.JEN-US Bush Aide_Top Bush aide Bartlett leaving White House: APJEN2007urn:contentItem:4NW5-PJM0-TWB6-G2KT-00000-001447602015-10-201:47 PM GMTCopyright 2007 Kyodo News Service All Rights ReservedJapan Economic NewswireJune 1, 2007 FridayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHUS Bush AideBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Criminal ProsecutionsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTg2RTcxODhDMDhENDU5Qzg5QUM3MzlCNjcwMENCNzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzhCMDE0NzExMjEyNEY0QjgyQkI0QzM1Mjk3NDIyMEEPublic Health &amp; Welfare LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwRTY1MDg3MTk5NDUyNkFFRDI1RjJBRERGQ0UxNzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Criminal ProsecutionsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTg2RTcxODhDMDhENDU5Qzg5QUM3MzlCNjcwMENCNzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzhCMDE0NzExMjEyNEY0QjgyQkI0QzM1Mjk3NDIyMEESTX001480RESIGNATIONSST0009YM7IRAQ WARST0009TD5US REPUBLICAN PARTYST000DLOJGOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001710TERRORISMST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST000DRDOPRESS AGENCY RELEASESPE0009U6FGEORGE W BUSHGS159TEXAS, USAGC358IRAQGC343UNITED STATESGC508AFGHANISTAN

Indian Foreign Minister Hopes to Strengthen Partnership With Japan [2]
  Instance 1: It seeks to amplify both its own influence and the collective voice of the Global South.Reflecting on India's global responsibilities, the foreign minister said: "It is important that countries speak up on their behalf. India is trusted by many of them to do so. This is particularly in regard to debt, inflation, trade disruptions, climate justice, SDG [Sustainable Development Goals] progress, and food and health security.""Given the recent changes in Japanese defense and security policy, I see a lot of potential to enhance our security cooperation," Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said in a written interview, which was followed by an in-person interview on Friday with The Yomiuri Shimbun and The Japan News.As this year is the 10th anniversary of the upgrade of India-Japan relations to a "Special Strategic and Global Partnership" -- initiated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- the foreign minister said, "I think it would be a right moment to add new content and new agenda to our partnership to make it contemporary."The partnership already includes defense, security, trade, and people-to-people exchanges."India and Japan have shared interest for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and beyond," Jaishankar said.India, whose population of 1.4 billion is the world's largest, presents itself as a leading power among the emerging and developing countries known as the Global South. It seeks to amplify both its own influence and the collective voice of the Global South.Reflecting on India's global responsibilities, the foreign minister said: "It is important that countries speak up on their behalf.

This is particularly in regard to debt, inflation, trade disruptions, climate justice, SDG [Sustainable Development Goals] progress, and food and health security."China's military build-up in the South China Sea and East China Sea indicates that Beijing is attempting to unilaterally change the status quo in the Indo-Pacific region. India accuses China of attempting to change the status quo along its borders in the Himalayan region as well."India believes in the observance of international law and respect for agreements concluded between nations," the foreign minister said, adding that "peace and tranquility in our border areas with China has been disturbed because China has not observed relevant agreements. Our endeavor is to resolve the resulting situation through direct discussions, which are in fact under way."In the in-person interview, Jaishankar explained that bilateral efforts, including several meetings of military commanders, have been made since the two countries' militaries clashed on the border in 2020.

"Nonetheless, our commitment lies in nurturing dialogue and finding common ground among the G-20 member nations.""We maintain an optimistic outlook," he said.While respecting the perspectives of Western countries that condemn Russia, Kant said India's primary objective as the G-20 president is to "promote initiatives that foster equitable and sustainable growth on a global scale."Kant said that during India's presidency, the G-20 members have already produced results, such as setting up a working group to discuss disaster risk reduction, unanimously adopting an action plan to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals at the development ministers' meeting in June and launching a new group to promote entrepreneurship and innovation.He said complex discussions await the G-20 members on topics related to climate change, sustainable development and geopolitical issues.India's proposal to add the African Union as the 21st member of the group is "in line with our greater conviction that global forums should be more inclusive and representative, especially for emerging economies and developing countries," Kant said."We are optimistic that that members will agree" on the African Union's membership, he said.India has also stressed "the need for significant flows of finance and technology from the Global North to the Global South" to ensure climate justice and equity and has revitalized discussion on U.N. reform, he said."We look forward to working closely with Japan to achieve positive outcomes at the G-20 summit," Kant said."Given our partnership in the Indo-Pacific and shared vision for a 'free and open Indo-Pacific,' India is confident in Japan's support in advancing discussions related to sustainable development, innovation, inclusive growth, fostering North-South cooperation and strengthening multilateral mechanisms for the benefit of all nations," Kant said.JIJI-JIJI2023urn:contentItem:693Y-9W81-JCF4-K1WR-00000-0080032023-09-0610:30 AM JSTCopyright 2023 Jiji Press Ltd.

Australian court overturns ruling on gov't climate change duty of care [1]
  Instance 1: He also cited the tiny contribution the approval of one mine extension would make to the overall increased risk caused by climate change. The eight teenagers involved in the case expressed disappointment at the decision but vowed to keep battling for stronger climate action in Australia. "Today's ruling leaves us devastated, but it will not deter us in our flight for climate justice," said Anjali Sharma, 17, one of the students. "Climate change is already wreaking havoc on the lives of Australians." "Two years ago, Australia was on fire; today, it's underwater.

Philippines ratifies Paris accord on climate change [1]
  Instance 1: The Philippines will officially become a party after its submission to the United Nations of the Instruments of Accession.The pact aims to hold global average temperature rises this century to "well below" 2 C above preindustrial levels to avoid the serious consequences scientists say will be caused by climate change. It entered into force on Nov. 4 last year."The Paris Agreement shows that developing nations and the developed countries could pursue climate action and uphold climate justice together," Legarda said.Duterte had initially expressed opposition to the Paris Agreement, saying that imposing a limit to his country's carbon emissions could also stymie development. He also noted the lack of a mechanism to punish parties who violate the provisions of the pact.==KyodoJEN-674ff2329efe4d3fb157654e63d49841JEN2017urn:contentItem:5N39-H1D1-JC65-52TH-00000-001447602017-06-0511:00 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Kyodo News Service All Rights ReservedJapan Economic NewswireMarch 14, 2017 TuesdayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHRodrigo Duterte, POLITICIANPhilippinesSoutheast AsiaAsiaClimate changeEnvironmental concernsEnvironmentEnvironment and natureClimateST000DNUOCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICYST000DH0QAGREEMENTSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYSTX000796GLOBAL WARMINGN921120CCLEGISLATIVE BODIESSTX001758TREATIES &amp; AGREEMENTSST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX000591EMERGING MARKETSST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTX000813GRANTS &amp; GIFTSST0009QUDTYPHOONSSTX000594EMISSIONSST000D8B1GREENHOUSE GASESST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSST000DE4PTYPHOON HAIYANST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSSTX001964SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGYSTX000796GLOBAL WARMINGST000DSEZFINANCIAL INCLUSIONSTX000594EMISSIONSPE000DL66RODRIGO DUTERTEGX257MANILA, PHILIPPINESGC310PHILIPPINESGT113ASIAGR138SOUTH-EASTERN ASIA

But adaptation efforts are not enough. We need to also make sure that the carbon majors or the big polluters must address mitigation measures as well."While there are still no definite plans to litigate against the identified companies, lawyer Zelda Soriano of Greenpeace Southeast Asia said, "We are seriously considering legal action.""There is interest and there are ideas and suggestions that we should all come together for a liability claim.

The EU must stay true to its climate commitments [2]
  Instance 1: This is why many European businesses and investors support the target. It would also substantially reduce household energy bills and toxic air pollution, improving financial and human health across the continent.Maintaining an ambitious climate policy would also offer the EU an opportunity to rebuild trust with Global South governments, many of which have grown disillusioned with the Western liberal order after broken climate-finance promises, foreign-aid cuts, vaccine hoarding during the COVID-19 pandemic, and limited support for the newly operationalized loss and damage fund. African countries, in particular, are closely following the EU’s actions, wondering whether years of lofty rhetoric about climate justice will finally translate into decisive action.The signs are not promising. France, despite playing a crucial role in the ratification of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, is now leading efforts to weaken the 2040 target. Instead of displaying climate vision and leadership when they are needed most, Emmanuel Macron’s government has argued for “outsourcing” up to 7 percent of the emissions reduction to non-EU countries by incorporating carbon credits into the target proposal.Such indifference has a high cost.
  Instance 2: If the EU fails to submit an ambitious NDC, it risks undermining the global fight against climate change. Other countries may follow the bloc’s example and water down their own commitments. The chance to set bold collective goals ahead of COP30 will be lost, and Europe’s credibility, especially among climate-vulnerable countries, will take another hit.Climate justice cannot be postponed any longer. The EU’s decision on the 2040 target will shape the outcome of COP30 and, by extension, the crucial next phase of climate action. The world is watching to see if Europe will take responsibility for its historic role in the climate crisis and invest in a safe and dignified future for everyone.

(EDITORIAL from Korea Times on May 16) [3]
  Instance 1: This battle is not waged with weapons or political rhetoric, but with the weight of legal arguments and the fervent determination of climate-concerned citizens, passionate activists and lawyers.At the center of this struggle is Korea's Constitutional Court, which held the first public hearing of Asia's first climate lawsuit against the government's climate target on April 23, with the next hearing scheduled for May 21, a watershed moment in the global fight against the climate crisis.The genesis of this legal saga dates back to 2020, when the first climate lawsuit was filed in Korea. Now, four consolidated lawsuits stand before the court, each representing a diverse array of plaintiffs united by a common cause: To hold the government accountable for its inadequate climate policies. From infants to children, teens, citizens and civil society activists, the plaintiffs represent a unified voice demanding climate justice and liability.The crux of the plaintiffs' argument rests on a fundamental premise: That climate change is not just an environmental issue, but a matter of constitutional rights. They contend that the government's failure to address the climate crisis effectively in a timely manner infringes upon their right to life and a clean environment - an assertion bolstered by the Korean National Human Rights Commission's declaration that climate change constitutes a human rights issue of paramount importance.Central to the plaintiffs' case is the disparity between Korea's national greenhouse gas emission reduction goal and those of other industrialized nations. They argue that the government's current policies fall woefully short of what is required to mitigate the catastrophic effects of climate change, citing scientific evidence and international legal precedents to support their claims.
  Instance 2: While acknowledging the urgency of climate change, government officials argue that the judiciary should not encroach upon matters of policy and governance -- a stance that sets the stage for a clash of legal doctrines and raises fundamental questions about the separation of powers.As the courtroom drama unfolds, the eyes of the world are fixed upon Korea, recognizing the profound implications of this historic legal battle. The outcome of these lawsuits will reverberate across continents, shaping the future of climate action and holding governments accountable for their climate commitments. Indeed, Korea's climate litigation is not just a domestic affair; it is a global rallying cry for climate justice and a testament to the power of grassroots activism in effecting change.In recent years, climate litigation has emerged as a powerful tool for holding governments and corporations accountable for their contributions to climate change. From landmark rulings in Europe to groundbreaking lawsuits in the United States, courts around the world have increasingly recognized the urgent need for climate action and the legal obligations of governments to protect the environment and uphold human rights.Korea's climate litigation represents a significant milestone in this global movement for environmental justice. By challenging the government's climate policies in court, plaintiffs are not only seeking redress for past injustices but also demanding systemic change to ensure a sustainable and equitable future for all.
  Instance 3: It is a truth embodied by the faces of the youth activists who stand as plaintiffs in this historic case -- a generation that refuses to inherit a world ravaged by the climate crisis. Their voices echo a universal call to action, reminding us of our collective responsibility to protect humanity and our planet.In the end, Korea's climate litigation is not just about winning a legal battle; it is about winning the fight for humanity's future. It is about affirming our commitment to climate justice and ensuring that the voices of the marginalized and the disenfranchised are heard and heeded. As the judges of the Constitutional Court deliberate and the plaintiffs await their verdict, one thing remains abundantly clear: The world is watching, and the time for action is now.KORNGA-KOREANEWSG1605202400010074KORNGA2024urn:contentItem:6C22-MSK1-F00C-60T6-00000-004341432024-05-17Copyright 2024 Korea News Gazette All Rights ReservedKorea News GazetteMay 16, 2024 ThursdayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsEnglish USEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUyRkJDQzI5NkU3NDY1NUJEMENGMkUwRTBDNDBENjk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTQ2RTNCMEZCMTYwNENFRkJDRjkwQkIzNkVDMEIxQzcGovernmentsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Relations With GovernmentsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDISTX000556EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGESTX001040LITIGATIONST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001648SUITS &amp; CLAIMSST000DTNMACTIVISMST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTX001941ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION &amp; POLICYSTX001960PUBLIC POLICYSTX000594EMISSIONSST0008X12POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp; REMEDIATIONN813311MMHUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONSSTX001429PUBLIC HEARINGSN920000CCGOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONN921000CCGOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICESST0008ZBXINTERNATIONAL LAWST000DM7FNEGATIVE POLITICAL NEWSSTX001965SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLEST000DNUOCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICYST000CZNYCOMMUNITY ACTIVISMST0008XOTCONSTITUTIONAL LAWSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESST0008XMRLAW &amp; LEGAL SYSTEMST00000572SEPARATION OF POWERSST000DN6RPUBLIC OFFICIALSST000D8B1GREENHOUSE GASESSTX000873HUMAN RIGHTSSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSN924110GJAIR QUALITY REGULATIONSTX000594EMISSIONSSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESST000DTLQHIGH RISE BUILDINGSST000DSGIFOSSIL FUELSGT113ASIAGC307SOUTH KOREA

The march was organized by Action for Climate Justice, a coalition of more than 600 civic, environment, labor, regional and trade union movements.Lee Sae-un, a 16-year-old student from Bakdal Middle School in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province, felt the urgency to march with her four classmates in the nation's capital when she realized that the climate crisis has become a reality.'During the first year of middle school, we vaguely imagined what would happen if the glaciers in the North Pole disappear, as what our textbook warns. It was a wake up call to learn that in just the span of two years, this is already happening in places like Greenland. We, too, are no more free from this crisis on the warming planet.
  Instance 5: That is why we march today,' Lee said.'School taught us to shift focus to big polluters, who are the enablers of the climate crisis, like corporations and governments. Joined by thousands of people today, we urge them to beef up climate action because all of us are watching. Regardless of age, everyone has an obligation to stop the climate crisis,' Lee added.Students and teachers from Bakdal Middle School in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province, hold signs calling for climate action for the future during 923 Climate Justice March in central Seoul, Sept. 23. Korea Times photo by Cho Hye-yoonBaek Jong-soo, a 37-year-old farmer from Wanju, North Jeolla Province, was one of many people who came to the march with their children.'Organic farmers like me, who rely heavily on honeybees to fertilize and pollinate crops, experience the climate crisis firsthand.
  Instance 6: Rising temperatures are detrimental to bees' survival. If bees cannot pollinate, crop cultivation and farmers' livelihood are severely impacted,' Baek said.'Along with 90 residents of Wanju who came a long way to attend the march, we no longer believe in the government's false pledge to curb the climate crisis. Rather, we believe in people's power to pressure the government to do what ought to be done,' he added.Lee and Baek were among the many protesters who expressed their frustration with the inaction of those responsible for curbing the climate crisis.Kwon Woo-hyun, head of the 923 Climate Justice March organizing committee, denounced the government's climate policies as being regressive.'While the climate crisis has been threatening job security, housing and people's rights to safe lives, the government has abandoned its responsibility to protect the people. We are here to overcome the crisis through our own efforts. In this time of crisis, let's use our solidarity to move forward,' he said.That is why this year, under the slogan, 'People Power to Overcome the Crisis,' the committee prepared specific demands to fight for.
  Instance 7: I apologize as one of the Japanese people,' Daisuke Sato, Japan Secretary General of the Anti-Nuclear Asia Forum, said. 'Nuclear power, with its incident risks and waste problems, cannot be a sustainable energy source. We call on you to stand in solidarity with the anti-nuclear movement in Asia,' Sato said.The 923 Climate Justice March protesters perform a die-in action in Gwanghwamun area, Seoul, Sept. 23. Korea Times photo by Cho Hye-yoonStarting around 3 p.m., the participants split into two directions and marched through downtown Seoul.
  Instance 8: One group marched toward the SK Group headquarters building in Jongno, the Japanese Embassy, and to the Gwanghwamun Government Complex, while the other marched from Seoul Station to the presidential office in Yongsan District.Kim Eun-yeong, an activist from NGO group Green Asia, which fights desertification in Mongolia through community-based reforestration projects, said people have the power to nudge governments to gradually phase out emission-intensive energy sources like fossil fuels.'Although it will inevitably take time for transition to cleaner energy, communities can pressure those in higher-level positions to implement robust climate policies,' Kim said.Linus Bauer, a 27-year-old student from Germany currently studying at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, is a climate activist from Fridays For Future, an international movement of students striking for climate begun by Greta Thunberg.'The climate is changing rapidly, politics is changing as well, but not fast enough,' Bauer said.'The German government invests a lot of money in energy transition and 60 percent of electricity produced in Germany is from renewable energy. And I am actually surprised that there are few mitigative measures put in place in Korea, because it's such a technologically advanced country. Every country has to act, but especially rich countries like Germany, the U.S., and Korea have the means to ramp up climate action first.'Protestors march down the street of central Seoul near the Seoul Station during 923 Climate Justice March, Sept. 23. Korea Times photo by Cho Hye-yoonJee Hyun-young, a lawyer from Seoul-based Institute of Green Transition, said, 'Despite Korea's pledge to go carbon-neutral by 2050, Korea's renewable power generation lags behind G20 members.' Jee emphasized that on a governmental level, 'phasing out subsidies to the production and consumption of coal, and incentivizing the generation and use of renewable energy are the first steps to change.'She added, 'Nuclear energy cannot be a sustainable alternative to pursue since there are no measures put in place to handle its nuclear waste problems.

Globally speaking, countries phase down nuclear energy and expand renewable energy.'Kim Bo-mi, one of the 14 lawyers participating in Climate Justice March, said, 'The court is the last line of defense for the rights of people. A proactive judicial response to the climate crisis, such as recognizing the responsibility of governments and corporations to reduce carbon emissions, will protect people's fundamental rights and also the animals and ecosystems with which we coexist.'Pointing to how the judiciary ought to reflect public interest, Kim added, 'The judiciary system should think about what values are more important to the people in the era of the climate crisis. The interpretation and judgment of law have been changing in tandem with the changing climate of the society and perceptions of the people.'Cho Hye-yoon (hyeyoon.cho@mail.mcgill.ca) is an intern reporter of The Korea Times.KTIMES-360021KTIMES2023urn:contentItem:69B2-13C1-JCBN-51WP-00000-001740452023-10-05Copyright 2023 The Korea Times All Rights ReservedKorea TimesOctober 1, 2023 SundayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHNationGovernmentsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Relations With GovernmentsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDIST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSST000DRDXNEGATIVE MISC NEWSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001421PROTESTS &amp; DEMONSTRATIONSST000D5IAINSECTS &amp; ARACHNIDSST000D7G9MIDDLE &amp; JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLSST000DO3VPOLLINATIONST0009HPZSTUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFESTX001960PUBLIC POLICYSTX001021GLACIERS &amp; ICEBERGSST0009OZRPRIMARY &amp; SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERSST0009F8MCROP &amp; LIVESTOCK ALLOCATIONSSTX001348POLLUTIONN813930MMLABOR UNIONSSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSST000DNUOCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICYSTX000796GLOBAL WARMINGST000D7G9MIDDLE &amp; JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLSSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESST0009F8MCROP &amp; LIVESTOCK ALLOCATIONSSTX000796GLOBAL WARMINGGC307SOUTH KOREA
(EDITORIAL from Korea Times on Sept. 21) [4]
  Instance 1: secretary-general delivered his address to the 78th U.N. General Assembly in New York. The full speech is worth a read if you are concerned about "the most immediate threat to our future: our overheating planet" as the UNSG said.From the perspective of climate justice, I greatly sympathized with the following parts of the speech. "Thousands of people in Derna, Libya lost their lives in epic, unprecedented flooding. Even now, as we speak, bodies are washing ashore from the same Mediterranean Sea where billionaires sunbathe on their super yachts."s the chief administrative officer of the U.N.
  Instance 2: fossil fuel phase-out is our utmost priority. It should be full, fast and fair. In other words, it should include all fossil fuels with no new investment, it should be fast enough to avoid irreversible climate disaster and it should reflect the principles of just transition.We need to ensure climate justice both globally and locally. Those countries that are hit hardest by the devastating climate impact are often the countries that contributed the least to the disaster. Those more vulnerable to climate impacts in our society also tend to share the least direct responsibility.We often say climate action is every country's responsibility.
  Instance 3: In fact, Yoon promised to strengthen the K-ETS, but the carbon pricing recently hit its lowest level, 7,000 won equivalent to $5 per ton of carbon. The K-ETS is failing to serve its purpose and the Yoon administration is responsible for it. We need to either fix or replace it with a more effective carbon reduction policy.To demand not climate change but systemic change based on climate justice, more than 450 civil organizations together with tens of thousands of people will organize a massive climate march this Saturday, Sept. 23, near Seoul City Hall.long with the other inspiring climate movements around the world in recent years, there were two major climate protests held in Korea in 2019 and 2022. However, the promised carbon reduction is far from being met, and the growing issue of climate injustice is becoming more prominent.
  Instance 4: 23, near Seoul City Hall.long with the other inspiring climate movements around the world in recent years, there were two major climate protests held in Korea in 2019 and 2022. However, the promised carbon reduction is far from being met, and the growing issue of climate injustice is becoming more prominent. Since September is a month of global climate action, please join the 923 Climate Justice March and raise your voices together because we all deserve a sustainable, just and joyful future.Source: Yonhap News AgencyKORNGA-KOREANEWSG21092023026780KORNGA2023urn:contentItem:697C-20F1-F00C-63NP-00000-004341432023-09-22Copyright 2023 Korea News Gazette All Rights ReservedKorea News GazetteSeptember 21, 2023 ThursdayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsEnglish USCC000DRDRSEA LTDCC0002PMRPOSCOCC00086Y6LG CHEM LTDCC0004OLYSAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTDNAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICESNAICS331222 STEEL WIRE DRAWINGNAICS331221 ROLLED STEEL SHAPE MANUFACTURINGNAICS331110 IRON &amp; STEEL MILLS &amp; FERROALLOY MANUFACTURINGNAICS321918 OTHER MILLWORK (INCLUDING FLOORING)NAICS325211 PLASTICS MATERIAL &amp; RESIN MANUFACTURINGNAICS335910 BATTERY MANUFACTURINGNAICS334310 AUDIO &amp; VIDEO EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURINGNAICS334220 RADIO &amp; TELEVISION BROADCASTING &amp; WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURINGNAICS334112 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICE MANUFACTURINGSE (NYSE)PKX (NYSE)PIDD (LSE)5412 (TSE)005490 (KSE)051910 (KSE)LGCD (LSE)SMSN (LSE)005930 (KSE)STX000556EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONSST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGESTX000594EMISSIONSST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSST000D8B1GREENHOUSE GASESST000DEUISEVERE WEATHERSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX000631ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST000DLY1MONSOONSSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSSTX001348POLLUTIONST000DF9MSEVERE SUMMER WEATHERST000D1BYEXECUTIVESSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSST0009FYFLIFE FORMSSTX001822WEALTHY PEOPLEST000DOX0WILDFIRESST000DI3LELECTRONICS SECTOR PERFORMANCESTX000593EMISSIONS CREDITSSTX000594EMISSIONSSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESSTX000584ELECTRONICSST0009S4QST000DSGIFOSSIL FUELSN334413MKSEMICONDUCTOR MFGST0009FBKPETROCHEMICALSST000DI3LELECTRONICS SECTOR PERFORMANCESTX000593EMISSIONS CREDITSSTX001549SEMICONDUCTORSST000A2L6ATLANTIC OCEANGS148NEW YORK, USAST000A3VFMEDITERRANEAN SEAGC307SOUTH KOREA
[Nani Jansen Reventlow] Righting imperialism's wrongs [1]
  Instance 1: So far, European governments and institutions have been more than eager to blur the distinction between the two.As Esther Stanford-Xosei and the Pan-Afrikan Reparations Coalition in Europe have argued, the financial aspect of reparations ï¿½ï¿½will be meaningful only if it serves the holistic purpose and strengthens the integral whole of our self-repair process.ï¿½ï¿½ In other words, any form of reparations must enable communities to reclaim power, dignity and stewardship over their shared wealth and resources. If reparations are solely focused on the past, we risk neglecting the present and weakening their emancipatory potential. A more historically informed approach would view reparations as part of a larger project.Much like the broader struggle for racial, social, economic, and climate justice, the purpose of reparations is to help build a more equitable world. The transition to such a world will not be costless and will undoubtedly require sacrifices. Reparations should ensure that these costs are distributed fairly rather than provide a monetary band-aid.To bring about a more just future, we must first meet the most urgent needs of communities grappling with the lasting legacies of colonialism.
'Celebrity forests' emerge as new K-pop trend in Seoul [1]
  Instance 1: 'The forests definitely help raise public awareness of the climate crisis and the need for people to expand climate activities. We also hope the forests will become another tourism hotspot in the city.'Cho said that their initiatives are purely voluntary. He said the fans were motivated by their idols who somehow advocated for climate justice in one way or another. 'As their idols are irreplaceable, the fans believe that so is the earth,' Cho said.Celebrity forests stem from the city government's urban development project around the river which began in 2013. It allowed members of the public, companies or celebrity fandoms to donate money and plant trees under their names to improve the landscape of the riverside environment and improve the city's air quality.
[Mary Robinson] Supplying the Green Transition Must Be Fast and Fair [1]
  Instance 1: Board members of mining companies should ensure that these firmsï¿½ï¿½ corporate cultures and practices reflect the human-rights principles that most of them claim to endorse. These include deep engagement with affected communities and respect for their prior informed consent, due diligence in reporting on supply chains, and access to remedies when harm occurs.Ahead of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt this November, I will be calling on governments, mining companies, investors, financial regulators, and civil-society organizations to agree on a shared agenda for a low-carbon transition that is both fast and fair. While increased supplies of transition minerals can greatly accelerate emission-reduction efforts, protecting human rights is an essential condition for climate justice.Mary RobinsonMary Robinson, a former president of Ireland and former UN high commissioner for human rights, is the chair of The Elders and chair of the Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centreï¿½ï¿½s Advisory Board.(Project Syndicate)KHERLD-KHERLD2022urn:contentItem:65G1-N9J1-DYX6-B001-00000-001582082022-05-16Copyright 2022 The Korea Herald All Rights ReservedTHE KOREA HERALDMay 16, 2022 MondayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHCC0002FD0RIO TINTO GROUPCC000D2U3TALLGRASS ENERGY CORPCC0009U47CHINA MINMETALS CORPINTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCYNAICS212221 GOLD ORE MININGNAICS212210 IRON ORE MININGNAICS212112 BITUMINOUS COAL UNDERGROUND MININGSIC1041 GOLD ORESNAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTIONNAICS211120 CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTIONSIC1321 NATURAL GAS LIQUIDSSIC1311 CRUDE PETROLEUM &amp; NATURAL GASNAICS523140 COMMODITY CONTRACTS BROKERAGENAICS523130 COMMODITY CONTRACTS DEALINGRIO (NYSE)RIO (LSE)RIO (ASX)Business &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Greenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjACivil Rights LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Protected RightsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUQ4OUEwREY0NzU2NDIwQTlDQ0VDMjJDNTJERjA3QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Greenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQSecurities LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Due CareZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDhDQUFERTQ4RUZBNDJGOThGQzBGNTY5REEwNDNBNUI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjhBMTIyMEJFNDE5NDBFM0IxQjkyRkU1MDBFOTY4NzMST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX000594EMISSIONSSTX000873HUMAN RIGHTSST0008ZBZHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSST000D1BYEXECUTIVESSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSSTX000900TSUNAMISST0008ZAIENERGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTST000DH0QAGREEMENTSST000A7ISASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGESTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESSTX000631ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST000DPKLENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYST0009OO3MINING &amp; ENVIRONMENTST0008XH6NATURAL RESOURCESST000DIJWPRICESST000DPLVRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYST000DR18SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATIONST000D0TNWATER CRISES &amp; SHORTAGESST000DPLOWIND ENERGY INDUSTRYST000CA1XENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGYSTX000796GLOBAL WARMINGSTX001348POLLUTIONST000DKUIWATER RESOURCESST000DNUOCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICYST000DDGJCOMMODITIES SHORTAGESST000DPVHELECTRIC MOBILITYSTX000565ELECTRIC VEHICLESST000D8B1GREENHOUSE GASESST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSST00090NPMULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONSSTX000830HAZARDOUS WASTESTX001736TOXIC &amp; HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCESSTX001817WATER QUALITYSTX000594EMISSIONSSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESST0008X7VMINES &amp; MININGSTX001466ALTERNATIVE &amp; RENEWABLE ENERGYN210000CCMINING &amp; EXTRACTIONST0008ZAIENERGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTST000DPKLENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYST0009OO3MINING &amp; ENVIRONMENTST000DPLVRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYST000DR18SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATIONSTX001842WIND ENERGYST000DPLOWIND ENERGY INDUSTRYST000DNNABATTERIESSTX000796GLOBAL WARMINGST000DPVHELECTRIC MOBILITYSTX000565ELECTRIC VEHICLESSTX001878SOLAR ENERGYN221120CCELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION &amp; DISTRIBUTIONSTX000830HAZARDOUS WASTESTX001736TOXIC &amp; HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCESPE000A4IBLAURENCE D FINKGX454GLASGOW, SCOTLANDGC343UNITED STATES
K-pop stars launch Kstars4Climate campaign to save Earth [1]
  Instance 1: They are the latest addition to a list of K-pop sensations that have raised their voice for climate action. Others include Blackpink, official advocates for the COP26, and Red Velvet, ambassadors of the UN International Day of Clean Air for blue skies. Heeding their favorite starsï¿½ï¿½ calls, like-minded K-pop fans around the world have created their own platform --Kpop4Planet -- to cheer on the global movement for climate justice. Momentum for climate action seems to be building around the globe, with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic triggering soul-searching on human relationships with nature and other species. This year is also marked by significant events to address the climate emergency -- from the P4G summit in Seoul to the UN COP26 in Glasgow.
Global K-pop fans unite forces at Kpop4Planet for climate action ' [1]
  Instance 1: The site will also harness K-pop's unique crowd-driven activism to persuade businesses and governments to take climate action.â€œClimate change is the crisis of our generation,â€ said Sarifah. â€œWith K-pop fans mostly consisting of Generation Z (those born between mid-1990s and early 2010s) and millennials, we are the ones who will be most severely affected by decisions taken or not taken today. Fighting for climate justice means fighting for our future.â€The site features artists engaging in action against climate change as inspiration for visitors, including BLACKPINK, who in February called for action as the official advocates for COP26, and Red Velvet, who in August 2020 called for clean air as an ambassador of the UN International Day of Clean Air for blue skies. The honor roll also includes Paul Kim, Park Ji-hoon, Eric Nam, Minzy and VIXX who either donated to the cause or raised awareness in real-time online discussions.Red Velvet members released a video campaigning for clean air in September 2020 as the ambassadors of the UN International Day of Clean Air for blue skies.

[ROUNDTABLE] Guest countries to bring diversity to G7 Summit [1]
  Instance 1: administration. I think it provides a unique opportunity for the G7 to reassert its solidarity and leadership in addressing global challenges.'Korea certainly welcomes the invitation. We think that participating in this year's G7 Summit will provide a valuable opportunity to discuss with the leading democracies on how to deal with global challenges."Ranganathan of India showed how guest countries can enliven the discussion by bringing in diverse perspectives."I think there are a lot of areas in which our approach and Korean's approach are very much alike, but there are nuances in our understanding and appreciation from your perspective,' Ranganathan said."We have to make sure that we all have climate justice. But I guess this is an area where the Indian position is somewhat different from that of some of the developed countries, because we do see the need for developed countries to play their part in bringing about responsible consumption and production."The global community is battling an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic situation in which more than 150 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty. We believe that now is the time for the global community to come together and review its commitments to pledge tangible support in achieving these goals," Ranganathan added.Among the many agenda points on the table, Australian Ambassador Raper emphasized gender equality and women's empowerment."This is based on a long-standing view that unless we have full and equal participation by women in our economies and our societies, we're not achieving gender equality or our societies' or economies' full potential.

What new forms of governance and approaches to living will be demanded in such difficult times?And what can we do now and during the climate chaos to improve the chances that eco-civilizational and climate justice models emerge victorious rather than the 'vultures' of disaster capitalism?The event starts at 7 p.m. on Feb. 18 at Commons Ground in Itaewon.
POSCO's Carbon Footprinting Big [1]
  Instance 1: Industrial emissions in Gwangyang took up 97 percent of the total.Pohang, home to POSCO's main plant, was second with 33.3 million tons.The sum of the emission amounts of the two cities exceeds that of Seoul and makes up 12 percent of the nation's total.The Gwangyang branch of Korea Headquarters of Environmental Movement (KHEM) said POSCO consumes a great deal of coal, which is to blame for the high concentration of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere."Reducing CO2 emissions by turning to low-carbon energy sources is now a necessity, not an option," said a representative of KHEM. "The POSCO plant in Gwangyang has emitted greenhouse gas and other air-polluting materials for some 20 years - it has not fulfilled its environmental responsibility."The non-government organization demanded POSCO show how hard it has tried to reduce CO2 emissions, if it has done so at all.Lee Yoo-Jin, an activist of the non-profit environmental civic group Green Korea United, criticized the government for turning a blind eye to its responsibility in CO2 reduction, fearing adverse effects on industry."This is unethical and violates the U.N. Principles of Climate Justice which states the responsibility is in proportion to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions," Lee said.The government plans to cut greenhouse gas by 4 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels.The Ministry of Environment estimated greenhouse gas emissions by region and industrial field as preliminary data to establish reduction plans.The move comes ahead of U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark from Dec. 7 to 18, which has the goal of preparing a framework to replace Kyoto Protocol for a sounder environment.KTIMES-KTIMES2009urn:contentItem:7X5V-0CW0-Y9NY-R3TM-00000-001740452015-08-22Copyright 2009 The Korea Times All Rights ReservedKorea TimesNovember 25, 2009 WednesdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHCC0002PMRPOSCONAICS331222 STEEL WIRE DRAWINGNAICS331221 ROLLED STEEL SHAPE MANUFACTURINGNAICS331110 IRON &amp; STEEL MILLS &amp; FERROALLOY MANUFACTURINGPKX (NYSE)PIDD (LSE)5412 (TSE)005490 (KSE)Business &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Greenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQGreenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAST000D8B1GREENHOUSE GASESSTX000594EMISSIONSSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESST000D5BMENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINTST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST0008X12POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp; REMEDIATIONST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSSTX000056AIR POLLUTIONST000DRNRCARBON NEUTRAL ENERGYST000DLONCORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITYSTX000654ETHICSST000DQZRLOW CARBON ECONOMYSTX001348POLLUTIONST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYSTX000406CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITYST00097CHENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTSST0009SI7ENVIRONMENTALISMST000DKNKINDUSTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENTSTX001218NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONSSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSST000DAKSINDUSTRIAL POLLUTIONST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTX000632ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES &amp; AGREEMENTSST00097R4ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCHSTX001220NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONSST000A7ISASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONSN813400CCCIVIC &amp; SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONSSTX000594EMISSIONSN331111MMIRON &amp; STEEL MILLSST000DRNRCARBON NEUTRAL ENERGYST000DQZRLOW CARBON ECONOMYGX096COPENHAGEN, DENMARKGC307SOUTH KOREAGC315DENMARK
No Delay to New Climate Change Treaty [2]
  Instance 1: But please remember that we are not asking the same commitments from developing countries."He urged developing countries, especially the economically advanced ones, to act to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.He added, "They do not need to deliver binding targets necessarily, but we need them to translate their domestic actions into an overall agreement."Former U.N. chief Annan urged developed countries to take the lead making the most dramatic cuts, although he said all countries need to take steps to reduce emissions. He called for the principle of fairness and "climate justice.""Climate justice demands that the industrialized countries meet their historic responsibility for the accumulation of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere," Annan said. He urged industrialized nations to commit themselves to reduce emissions by between 25 and 40 percent by 2020.Annan also stressed that fast-emerging economies such as Brazil, China, India and South Africa need to engage themselves in a meaningful way but one which does not prevent them from improving the standards of living through economic growth.Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said his country would take nationally accountable mitigation actions that would be domestically binding, clarifying that India would not agree to legally binding reduction targets.However, he said while India was going to Copenhagen as "a deal-maker, not a deal-breaker," delegates should not allow the conference to be derailed by exaggerated expectations.There was also a debate about a global cap-and-trade system, which is a market-based approach to controlling carbon emissions that allows corporations and governments to trade emissions allowances under an overall cap on those emissions.Professor Joseph Stiglitz and former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo argued that the cap-and-trade scheme would not work. Zedillo said that it is a useless system as it would force developing nations to give up their emission rights to developed countries.
Copenhagen Conference [1]
  Instance 1: But it is disappointing that the U.S. is still preoccupied with other priorities such as healthcare reform and the war in Afghanistan, putting climate change on the backburner.Industrialized nations are also urged to transfer technology and provide financial support to help poor countries in their mitigation and adaptation efforts. This is often called climate justice in which wealthy economies should account for their historical responsibility for having polluted the atmosphere with greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution.The World Bank said in a recent study that developing countries would need $75 billion to $100 billion a year over the next four decades to adapt to climate change. Further delay would increase not only the cost but also the risks of climate related disasters. And time is rapidly running out.
Inconvenient parallels between responses to Holocaust and to climate change ' [1]
  Instance 1: Yet the totalitarian system could never have been established if citizens had not practiced psychological denial for long enough to allow totalitarian rule to take root. The willingness of educated Germans to ignore the Nazi Party's actions from 1933 on allowed that organization to establish a system that would eventually make criticism impossible.Eventually those who tried to help Jews, homosexuals, dissidents, disabled people, Jehovah's Witnesses, communists, POWs, critical authors, Sinti and Romanies were charged with crimes that demanded immediate and brutal punishment.Although the Trump administration has made climate change a topic that government officials are not allowed to discuss, let alone respond to, discussing the topic is not illegal yet. Nevertheless, the brutal suppression of the protests against the Keystone SL tar sands pipeline last year, including ridiculously long prison sentences, suggests that it is entirely possible that the debate on climate itself will be criminalized in the years ahead, forcing us to make even more difficult decisions at even greater sacrifice.We who fight for climate justice must recognize that we may not have much time before not only is radical climate change unavoidable, but also before the discussion of the topic is made impossible. Creating a sustainable future may require profound sacrifice and moral courage that goes beyond any 'carbon trading' schemes that have been floated by multinational investment banks.Climate change is already killing millions around the world, and will kill hundreds of millions in the years ahead. Yet the vast majority of the well-off (and well-off means those who make more than $US40,000 a year) are indifferent to the relationship between their overheated homes, their minivans, their imported cheap products, or their offices with ridiculously high ceilings in the lobbies and glass and steel exteriors that require vast amounts of energy to keep at a comfortable temperature, and climate change.
[JEAN-MICHEL SEVERINO] Rendezvous with Africa on climate [1]
  Instance 1: Up to now, Africa has missed out on the benefits of CDMs: to date, less than 2 percent of these projects take place in Africa, compared to 73 percent for Asia. Africa ought to be the global carbon market's new frontier.The second track is official recognition of the carbon storage of African lands and forests, as well as rewards for "avoided deforestation." At a time when humanity is coming to measure the value of biodiversity and the importance of land and forests in climate control, Africa has much to gain by making itself the guardian of a heritage that is essential to humanity's survival. This is worth several billion dollars annually, which could constitute one of the essential stepping-stones to sustained economic growth in Africa in a post-petroleum era.Finally, the 'climate justice" plan sponsored by France and others in Copenhagen, which aims to increase Africans' access to clean energy, is crucial at a time when three of ten sub-Saharan Africans have no access to electricity. It is a question not only of justice, but also of climate regulation. Linking public and private efforts to provide two billion Africans with renewable energy will therefore be one of the major challenges of the coming decades.In the past, African countries found it difficult to make their voices heard in major international negotiations.

In a bold initiative to combat the escalating climate crisis, BYN Blackyak Group unveiled the 'Himalayan Climate Charter 2025' in Kathmandu, Nepal, emphasizing the urgent need for international collaboration. Partnering with the Nepal Mountaineering Association, Blackyak hosted the 'Summit for Earth' to address the severe environmental challenges faced by the Himalayan region, culminating in a signed declaration committed to climate justice. The Himalayas are experiencing drastic environmental changes, such as glacier melting and increased flooding of farmlands due to global warming, highlighting the necessity for coordinated global action. The charter sets out a framework focusing on several critical areas: advancing global climate initiatives, sustaining Himalayan cleanup operations, fostering technology and community partnerships, ensuring transparent environmental reporting, and strengthening global alliances.
  Instance 2: Central to the declaration is a commitment to reducing global carbon emissions, drawing on the experiences of Himalayan communities and leveraging drone and satellite technology for environmental monitoring. The initiative seeks active participation from governments and international bodies and outlines a plan to establish the Himalayan Climate Committee by 2026. Kang Tae-sun, Chairman of Blackyak, stated, "The climate crisis affecting the Himalayas is a universal challenge that demands a collective response." He further remarked, "This declaration is an urgent appeal for climate justice, and we aspire for this initiative to resonate worldwide, driving concrete actions for change."WBNKOR-57154594663WBNKOR2025urn:contentItem:6G6S-2P13-S0N8-F34N-00000-004367602025-07-07No Copyright - MoreoverKorea PostWebNews - KoreanJuly 7, 2025 MondayWeb PublicationWebLinksKOREANKOREANGeneralSouth KoreaAsiaEastern AsiaEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQCleanupZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDE5RjBBMzRDQjE1NDk3QjkwNDAxOTAzQ0FENUNCNTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQGovernmentsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Initiative &amp; ReferendumZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0Y2REExMDg3NTBBNDJDNDk0MzcwNDc1RTNEMUIyQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0M3QUYzNjlBN0UzNEVBMDk4OEIyMzdBMDlGQzA2RjIST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONST0009RTQMOUNTAINSST000CFNHMOUNTAIN CLIMBINGST0008X12POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp; REMEDIATIONST000A7ISASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONSSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESSTX000639ENVIRONMENTAL LAWST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001348POLLUTIONSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEN928000CCINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp; NATIONAL SECURITYSTX001021GLACIERS &amp; ICEBERGSSTX000796GLOBAL WARMINGST00097CTINTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS &amp; BODIESSTX000594EMISSIONSSTX000640ENVIRONMENTAL TESTINGST000D8B1GREENHOUSE GASESSTX002286SPACE TECHNOLOGYSTX001990SATELLITE TECHNOLOGYSTX000796GLOBAL WARMINGSTX000594EMISSIONSSTX002286SPACE TECHNOLOGYSTX001990SATELLITE TECHNOLOGYGX229KATHMANDU, NEPALST000A32THIMALAYASGC378NEPALGT113ASIAGR128EASTERN ASIAGC307SOUTH KOREA

  Instance 4: 미국에 기반을 둔 여성 환경 기후 행동 네트워크(Women’s Earth and Climate Action Network, WECAN)의 설립자이자 상임이사인 오스프리 오리엘 레이크(Osprey Orielle Lake)는 “우리가 지금 이 기후 혼돈의 순간에 갑자기 도달한 것이 아니다”라고 말했다. “우리가 자연과 조화를 이루며 살아가는 대신 지구에 맞서 전쟁을 벌이게 만든 조건들을 창출한 체계 위에 지금 이 순간이 세워졌다.”  2009년에 설립된 WECAN은 이러한 문제의식을 중심으로 여러 운동과 국경을 넘어 여성들을 연결하는 조직 중 하나다. 이 단체는 6월 23일부터 28일까지 제7회 ‘기후 정의를 위한 여성 총회(Women’s Assembly for Climate Justice)’를 개최한다. 이 화상 정상회의에는 50개국에서 125명 이상의 여성 리더가 참여할 예정이다. 연사로는 과학자, 정책 입안자, 원주민 지도자, 풀뿌리 조직가 등이 참여하며, 총 24개 패널에서 식량 주권, 산림 보호, 토지 권리, 기후 정의, 대안 경제, 자연의 권리 등 다양한 주제를 다룰 예정이다.
  Instance 5: 연사로는 과학자, 정책 입안자, 원주민 지도자, 풀뿌리 조직가 등이 참여하며, 총 24개 패널에서 식량 주권, 산림 보호, 토지 권리, 기후 정의, 대안 경제, 자연의 권리 등 다양한 주제를 다룰 예정이다. 대중은 WECAN 웹사이트를 통해 등록하면 참여할 수 있다. 오스프리 오리엘 레이크(Osprey Orielle Lake, 왼쪽에서 두 번째)가 샌프란시스코에서 열린 ‘기후를 위한 봉기 행진(Rise For Climate March)’에서 ‘기후 정의를 위한 여성(Women for Climate Justice)’ 대열과 함께 행진하고 있다. 출처 : 에밀리 아라심(Emily Arasim) / WECAN  과거 참가자들에는 제인 구달(Jane Goodall)과 반다나 시바(Vandana Shiva)가 있었다. 올해 연사 명단에는 아일랜드 전 대통령 메리 로빈슨(Mary Robinson), 파리협정이 체결될 당시 유엔기후변화협약(UNFCCC) 사무총장이었던 크리스티아나 피게레스(Christiana Figueres), 그리고 전 세계의 다양한 원주민 및 풀뿌리 운동 지도자들이 포함되어 있다.
  Instance 6: 하지만 수백, 수천, 아니 수백만 개의 작고 지역적인 해법이 있다는 사실은 대부분 언급하지 않는다. 그런데 그들이야말로 해답이다.”  WECAN 상임이사 오스프리 오리엘 레이크(Osprey Orielle Lake)가 2024년 11월 아제르바이잔 바쿠에서 열린 유엔 기후 회담에서 언론을 상대로 발언하고 있다. 출처 : 캐서린 콰이드(Katherine Quaid) / WECAN  다음 주 열릴 ‘기후 정의를 위한 여성 총회(Women’s Assembly for Climate Justice)’는 여성의 권리와 환경 보호가 세계적으로 후퇴하고 있는 상황 속에서 개최된다. 3월, 유엔은 전 세계 4개국 중 1곳에서 성차별이 증가하고 있으며, 여성에 대한 법적 보호가 약화하고, 성평등 관련 프로그램에 대한 예산이 삭감되고 있다고 보고했다. 혹은 이 세 가지 모두가 동시에 일어나고 있다고 밝혔다.
기후 재난 반복되면, '돌봄 여성 노동자'가 착취당한다... 왜? [1]
  Instance 1: 이제 막 출범한 한국의 새 정부가 진정한 기후위기 대응을 말하려 한다면, 더 이상 기술과 시장, 성장과 수출에 기댄 '친환경적 개발주의'에 머물러서는 안 된다. 녹색 전환이 단지 신산업 육성과 온실가스 감축 수치에 그칠 때, 그 비용은 다시금 사회적 약자와 돌봄노동자, 여성의 몫으로 귀결된다. 새 정부는 기후정의(climate justice)의 이름 아래 사회적 재생산의 회복력, 돌봄노동의 존중, 젠더 기반의 불평등 해소를 기후 정책의 중심 원칙으로 삼아야 한다. ▲윤자영본인 제공  필자 소개 : 윤자영은 충남대학교 경제학과에서 노동경제학과 젠더경제학을 가르치고 있습니다. 자문위원이기도 합니다.
트럼프 "AI에 마르크스주의 광기 원치 않아"…연방 조달서 'Woke AI' 배제 [1]
  Instance 1: 업계에서는 'AI 편향성'의 기준이 모호해 자의적 해석 가능성이 제기되고 있으며, 실질적 집행 방안과 구체적 가이드라인에 주목하고 있다. 기술업계 일부에서는 규제 완화를 환영하는 분위기지만, 시민단체들은 강력히 비판했다. 퍼블릭 시티즌(Public Citizen)은 이를 "매각 행위"라고 비난했고, 기후정의연합(Climate Justice Alliance)은 "빅테크와 화석연료 기업들이 감독 없이 활동하도록 문을 열 것"이라고 경고했다. 반면 일론 머스크 같은 "반-Woke AI" 지지자들은 이번 조치로부터 이익을 얻을 가능성이 높다. 머스크의 xAI와 그록(Grok) 챗봇은 정치적 중립성을 강조해온 만큼 정부 계약에서 유리한 위치를 점할 수 있다.

Hair salon, death drop and hurricane: How Mark Bradford keeps abstraction tethered to life [1]
  Instance 1: The “hurricane,” he explains, is a metaphor for an uncontrollable force, both natural disaster and social reckoning.The room hums with palpably dense surfaces: oxidized textures, bursts of color suggestive of flood, fire and wind. Here, different histories of marginalization converge ? the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and the defiant legacy of William Dorsey Swann, the formerly enslaved man who became the first known self-proclaimed drag queen in American history.“I almost wanted to create my own ballroom in a way, where there is the potential for something new to happen,” he said.And all he asks of us, in the world he’s shaped through abstraction, is to keep walking ? through the storm, across shifting patchwork, toward whatever comes next.Because in the end, it’s the act of moving forward that carries us through.“Keep Walking” runs through Jan. 25, 2026, at the Amorepacific Museum of Art.KTIMES-075e2e6323664d29b4595efa32e9a049KTIMES2025urn:contentItem:6GFN-1J33-RSRF-B33Y-00000-001740452025-08-08Copyright 2025 The Korea Times All Rights ReservedKorea TimesAugust 9, 2025 SaturdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHCC000C5P4AMOREPACIFIC CORPNAICS325620 TOILET PREPARATION MANUFACTURINGSIC2844 PERFUMES, COSMETICS, &amp; OTHER TOILET PREPARATIONS090430 (KSE)CultureSTX000300CITY LIFEST0008XAAVISUAL ARTISTSST000DRN1NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWSST0009UDIART HISTORYST0009VC0ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERSSTX001346POLITICSST000DNDUHEMPSTX001543WALKING &amp; JOGGINGST0009U58HISTORYST000D7R3GENDER EQUALITYSTX000297CITIESST000DRDXNEGATIVE MISC NEWSST000DIEGGENDER &amp; SEX DISCRIMINATIONST000DPKDSYSTEMIC RACISMST0009JXSARTS &amp; HUMANITIES EDUCATIONN712110MMMUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIESST0008XAAVISUAL ARTISTSN812112MMHAIR STYLING SERVICESST0009VC0ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERSST000DNDUHEMPN812100CCPERSONAL CARE SERVICESPE000DS56MARK BRADFORDBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0DeterminationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUVBMzVCNjM3QjZFNEU2REI5MzE5Qzg1REE0QzQxRjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTZFM0Y0REZFRUQ1NEFDMTlFQTFGRDY1MDkwNDcwQTcCopyright LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzM3NEE0Qjk0NzRCNDhFM0E0NjM2RTE4M0QzNTczMTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Dramatic WorksZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEM5NTVFQUFDRDYyNDQ4RkE2RTE2Njk0NjMwRUNEQUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkZGRDI1MUIzRjk2NEY3OThDMTE0OEI3REJDMEJFODgEducation LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0MuseumsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA2Q0M0NzJERDUwNDE0OEE2QjYzQTc0NUFFRDJFMjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTYResidency RequirementsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzNGRTQxOThBNUMyNDFCN0I5QjU4MEZERTY3OERCRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDQxNkZCNUM0Nzc0NEYwQkEwNDc5QUQxRTUzODEyNjEEvidenceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUVGQkU0QjJFMTIzNDNBM0FCNTVEQjAxQTM3RDcwOTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Fibers &amp; HairsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUE3MjlDODQzREU3NDg2QUJGOUI4MDMyQjMyQzMyRTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUwRTEwMjI0QjZDNDc5NkJERkJGNTlEMTA2QUE0REEAIDS &amp; HIVZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUI5MTU2QjM3ODNDNDBBQkJENUQ1QTY3MUE5RUYxMjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0RBNTc0MjA0QTAwNERDNEJGQjhCQkIxMjVGNzQ3NDgRefreshing RecollectionZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTIwOUIzNzBENDdBNEU0RDk0Qzc5RUMxNEJDNTY2QTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjAxMkVDRTlBNkZFNDk4MEJENzlBMTFEODVGRjNCMDQAllocationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkE0QjVFMTA5QkNGNDIzOTlCNUFGMTYwMjc1QUFDMTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkM1QzY2Q0E0NUNFNDBEMDg5QjUzRDIwM0UxQ0QxRTEBurden ShiftingZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzdDNjM5RTg5MjNCNDQ2RTkxOTgwODgxMDQwMDY1RjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkM1QzY2Q0E0NUNFNDBEMDg5QjUzRDIwM0UxQ0QxRTEReal Property LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTE4MTZBRjUxMjlENDI0RUFFNkE2NUIwRDA3OTQ0RUI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTdGQjZDMTAyQjUwNDg4NUFCRDQyMjVFMkFDQjAyMjQTrade Secrets LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkE5RkIzRDg2MDIzNDY1Mjg0OURCRDlFNTQ3NkE0NDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Misappropriation by MemoryZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTk2Qzc0RDE0NkFDNEUzQ0I5RTQxNzVCRjdGRkZGNkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REFGMkM4NTA5Q0M5NEIwMjhEMEQyRjA3RTk3NEU5QzMTrademark LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUY4QzQ2QTdDQjY1NEFGMjlGQjMwMTYzM0FDN0IxRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0DeterminationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUVBMzVCNjM3QjZFNEU2REI5MzE5Qzg1REE0QzQxRjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTZFM0Y0REZFRUQ1NEFDMTlFQTFGRDY1MDkwNDcwQTc
S.Korean firms offer aid to earthquake-stricken Turkey [2]
  Instance 1: Doosan plans to quickly deliver the equipment through a local dealer."We hope this equipment will make a direct impact on the disaster site and aid in relief activities, as well as be used for future damage recovery," a Doosan official stated.Hyundai Motor Co.'s Turkish subsidiary is providing $500,000 worth of rescue equipment and relief supplies to the affected region. The company plans to donate $50,000 for rescue operations and $450,000 for supplies in collaboration with the Turkey Disaster and Emergency Management Authority.HD Hyundai Group will supply 10 medium-sized excavators for restoration work and urgently transport them through local dealers to the areas in need in coordination with the local government, which are produced by Hyundai Construction Equipment Co. and Hyundai Doosan Infracore Co.Korean companies have a history of supporting disaster-stricken areas, having previously provided construction equipment and donations in the aftermath of natural disasters such as the 2005 Hurricane Katrina in the US, the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2011 East Japan earthquake, the 2013 Philippine typhoon, the 2015 Nepal earthquake, and the 2018 Indonesian earthquake.By Jae-Fu Kimhu@hankyung.comKEDENG-ked202302080019KEDENG2023urn:contentItem:67H3-9VP1-JB6R-04V1-00000-004764262023-02-084:33 PM GMTCopyright 2023 KED Global News Network All Rights ReservedThe Korea Economic Daily Global Edition- EnglishFebruary 8, 2023 WednesdayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsENGLISHCC000DLS7DOOSAN BOBCAT INCCC0001W5PHYUNDAI MOTOR COCC0003GC4HYUNDAI GROUPCC000CVOODOOSAN INFRACORE CO LTDCC00073W1HYUNDAI CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENTNAICS333120 CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY MANUFACTURINGNAICS336110 AUTOMOBILE AND LIGHT DUTY MOTOR VEHICLE MANUFACTURINGNAICS336211 MOTOR VEHICLE BODY MANUFACTURINGSIC3569 GENERAL INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY &amp; EQUIPMENTSIC3711 MOTOR VEHICLES &amp; PASSENGER CAR BODIESSIC3531 CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY &amp; EQUIPMENT241560 (KSE)005380 (KSE)HYUD (LSE)042670 (KSE)GovernmentsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Relations With GovernmentsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDISTX000546EARTHQUAKESSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSN624230GCDISASTER RELIEFST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST000DI7XAPRIL 2015 NEPAL EARTHQUAKEST0008X0PBRUSH &amp; RUBBLE COLLECTIONN624230EGDISASTER &amp; EMERGENCY AGENCIESN624230CCDISASTER &amp; EMERGENCY RELIEFST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINASTX001463RELIEF ORGANIZATIONSST0009QUDTYPHOONSST0009G89REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTSN920000CCGOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONST0009F7UHURRICANESST000C9U3JANUARY 2010 HAITI EARTHQUAKEST000A0I4SICHUAN EARTHQUAKEST0008X0PBRUSH &amp; RUBBLE COLLECTIONGS045SICHUAN, CHINAGR207SOUTHWEST CHINAGC328TURKEYGC307KOREA, REPUBLIC OFGC302CHINAGC365HAITIGC343UNITED STATES
Disasters Like Ian Pose Extra Risk for Fragile Older People [2]
  Instance 1: Ron DeSantis has recognized the disproportionate effect Ian had on the state's older residents, and the need for local groups to help their recovery."It hit in areas that have a lot of elderly residents, and I've met a lot of the folks," DeSantis said at a news conference Thursday. "So you're somebody who's maybe 85 years old. You may not be able to do the same home repair that you used to be able to do when you were younger."While the death toll of over 100 and property damage from Ian was catastrophic, Hurricane Katrina caused far more deaths and destruction in August 2005.Researchers have concluded that nearly half of those killed by Katrina in Louisiana were 75 or older. A 2006 Senate Committee report noted a failure by all levels of government to effectively evacuate thousands of older, sick and disabled people from New Orleans as neighbors with cars fled the city.Older people are also at risk from heat in the days and weeks after major storms.After Hurricane Ida slammed Louisiana in 2021, of nine New Orleans residents killed by heat and 10 for whom heat was a contributing cause of death, only four -- two in each group -- were under the age of 60, according to information provided by the Orleans Parish Coroner's Office.The aftereffects of Hurricane Irma in 2017 took an especially large toll. The direct impacts of the storm killed more than 90 people in the U.S., but researchers at the University of South Florida and Brown University found 433 additional residents at Florida nursing homes died within 90 days of the storm, compared to the same period in 2015, when there were no hurricanes.The study was prompted by the heat-related deaths of 12 residents at a Broward County nursing home that occurred when the storm knocked out air conditioning and staff didn't move them to another facility.

  Instance 1: The fire was extinguished in the evening, eight hours after the blaze began.'We talked to several local residents to understand the scale of damage and locate the animals in need of help,' KAWA activist Choi Min-jung, who participated in Wednesday's rescue, told The Korea Times, Friday.'We were told that firefighters cut the leashes of dogs tied to their homes in order to allow them to escape while extinguishing the fire,' Choi said, adding that her team has observed cut leashes in the area.Amid the mounds of ashes, companion animals, including cats and dogs wearing identification tags, were found wandering in the vicinity of their burned homes, fortunately without any major injuries.KAWA reported that three dogs were found dead ― one hit by a car after being cut free and two that were burned to death while still leashed ― while some farm animals, including goats and dozens of caged chickens, were found dead.A total of 10 companion animals, including nine pet dogs and a cat, were moved to a city-run animal shelter after the rescue operation and most of them have since been reunited with their owners, the group said.According to Choi, the city's emergency shelter was also operated in a more animal-friendly way compared to previous disasters. Some companion animals were allowed to stay with their displaced owners, raising awareness among townspeople of the need for emergency shelters that can take in animals.When the revised Animal Protection Act takes effect on April 27, companion animals will be able to stay with their owners in emergency shelters legally, the activist added.The measures come amid growing calls for animal evacuation and sheltering guidelines, after over 100 domestic and farm animals were left behind and found dead during giant wildfires in Uljin, North Gyeongsang Province, in March last year. As Korea has been seeing a growing number of disasters, such as wildfires and floods, animal welfare advocates have been voicing the need for improved government preparations for animal protection during such emergencies.'Even if we have such laws, we still need to raise people's awareness on animal protection in disaster situations,' Choi said, underlining the need for evacuation education for domestic and farm animal owners.In the U.S., the PETS Act was passed in 2006 in response to criticism of the failure to protect animals during Hurricane Katrina. The legislation led to the building of animal-friendly shelters in areas affected by hurricanes, and state governments included animals in their emergency plans to receive a subsidy from the federal government.Japan also established domesticated animal rescue guidelines for disasters in 2013 and encouraged people to seek refuge with their animals. The country's previous evacuation experiences led to a consensus that animals left behind during evacuations could eventually inflict greater social costs, as they may become wild.KAWA plans to work on establishing a comprehensive manual for animal evacuation and sheltering while seeking solutions to rescue farm animals during disasters.Link to ImageA cat eats food provided by activists from the Korean Animal Welfare Association in Gangneung, Gangwon Province, Tuesday, in an area damaged by a massive forest fire the previous day.
S. Korea sends 2 million face masks to U.S. to help fight COVID-19 [2]
  Instance 1: The supplies will be distributed to medical institutions at the vanguard of the anti-virus campaign."The provision followed comprehensive considerations, such as our country's domestic COVID-19 situation and the local supply and demand for masks, and the need for support for our ally, the U.S.," the ministry said in a press release."We hope that South Korea and the U.S. will quickly overcome the shared challenge of the COVID-19 disease through this support, and this can contribute to sharing Korea's quarantine experience with the international community," it added.It is not the first time that Korea has offered humanitarian aid to the U.S.Seoul sent US$5 million to the U.S. when the country was hit by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

What Australia's wildfires can ― and can't ― teach a smoky US [1]
  Instance 1: (In one famous if contested study, a wave of shark attacks in New Jersey in 1916 damaged President Woodrow Wilson's re-election campaign, despite the manifest absence of policy implications.) That was bad for the climate-denialist government in Australia in 2019, but might also be bad for the climate-focused government in the US in 2023. An inept response would be likelier to do damage to the Biden administration than to its opponents, as President George W. Bush found after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.The effects of disasters can also be limited and perverse. Although support for new coal mines in Australia fell from 45.3 percent to 37 percent after the bushfires, those who had backed the industry beforehand and were subsequently directly affected by smoke and fire were more, rather than less likely, to favor them.

Animal evacuation, sheltering guidelines needed for wildfires [2]
  Instance 1: Some residents denied the group's animal rescue assistance and even threatened activists with force, shouting, 'Will you compensate us for the lost animals?'The activist explained that the lack of government guidelines for the evacuation and sheltering of domestic and farm animals in disasters led to such confusion.Meanwhile, Korean Animal Rights Advocates (KARA) evacuated over 80 animals from a rescue shelter run by the local government of Uljin, Saturday. The shelter was in chaos as the flames approached, as it had neither equipment nor manuals for animal evacuation in emergencies, a KARA activist said.'These animals in the public shelters are under the protection of the government, but the local authority was not prepared for their evacuation at all,' a KARA activist told The Korea Times, Monday. The local government belatedly designated a temporary evacuation spot in response to the group's request.Several other animal rescue groups, including Life, Korean Animal Welfare Association, Reverse and We Act, have been rescuing animals from the flames.In the U.S., the PETS Act was passed in 2006 in response to criticism of the failure to protect animals during Hurricane Katrina. The legislation led to building animal-friendly shelters in areas affected by hurricanes, and state governments included animals in their emergency plans to receive a subsidy from the federal government.Also, Japan established domesticated animal rescue guidelines for disasters in 2013 and encourages people to take refuge with their animals. The country's previous evacuation experiences led to a consensus that animals left behind during disaster evacuation could eventually cause greater social costs, as they may become wild.As Korea has been seeing a growing number of disasters, such as wildfires and floods, animal activists are voicing the need for the government's disaster preparedness for animals.'Nothing has changed since the wildfire in Goseong three years ago when the calls grew for animal evacuation guidelines.

[Nicholas Goldberg] Was George W. Bush worst president? [2]
  Instance 1: Nixon, who was driven out of office during the Watergate scandal, was more popular by the time he died in 1994 than when he resigned 20 years earlier. Bill Clinton climbed back from his Lewinsky lows. Americans forget their history quickly.But the main thing that happened, Iï¿½ï¿½m afraid, was that someone even worse and more terrifying came along: Donald Trump, a president so utterly transgressive that Bush began to look almost OK in the rearview mirror.Yes, it was Bush not Trump who signed the Patriot Act into law and mishandled Hurricane Katrina and presided over the start of Great Recession and championed the privatization of Social Security. He was the doofus who extolled Americans who were ï¿½ï¿½working hard to put food on your familyï¿½ï¿½' and asked ï¿½ï¿½Is your children learning?ï¿½ï¿½ and then dared to insist heï¿½ï¿½d been ï¿½ï¿½misunderestimated.ï¿½ï¿½ His policies led to a lot more deaths than Trumpï¿½ï¿½s did.But at the end of the day, thereï¿½ï¿½s a meaningful distinction in my mind between the wrongs perpetrated by Bush and those attributable to Trump, who for my money really was the worst president, certainly of my lifetime.Trump wasnï¿½ï¿½t just any old bad president.What made Trump unfit wasnï¿½ï¿½t his policies or even his beliefs, to the extent he had any. It was his character.
  Instance 2: Iï¿½ï¿½m just saying that Donald Trump is a special case and poses a unique threat.

'Gun-hoarding,' racism: what COVID-19 brought to world [VIDEO] [1]
  Instance 1: The U.S. also offers hand sanitizers for public use like Korea, but some Americans steal them or even drink them because they contain alcohol. Some people even hoard guns and bullets for 'self-defense.' In 2004, when Hurricane Katrina hit the U.S., there was a huge rise in the number of robberies. People today fear that the same thing will recur following the life-affecting pandemic, so as a mean to fight against the robbers who might trespass on their properties to steal their 'survival products,' they are buying firearms.This is the second in a two-part series on what it is like to live with the coronavirus (COVID-19) in and out of Korea. - ED.Three foreign TV personalities in Korea, Elody Anais Alice (France), left, Cameron Lee Word (U.S.), center, and Sorensen Joakim Bjorn (Sweden), had a group interview with The Korea Times on April 2 at a studio in Sangam-dong, Seoul, to discuss what it is like to live with the coronavirus (COVID-19) in and out of Korea.
Managing fears crucial in Korea's COVID-19 fight - [1]
  Instance 1: 'How this might relate to a crisis is that in an individualistic country people believe that they must rely on themselves to take care of themselves and their immediate family. In collectivist societies people believe that they can rely on their community to assist them in times of trouble,' he said.?'So it follows that Americans would buy goods for immediate use (e.g. hand sanitizers, toilet paper, water, etc) believing that no outside agencies will provide these goods.'Brady commented on the American agency responsible for emergency preparedness, FEMA, and its response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster, in order to compare the role of government in disaster relief in Korea and the United States.According to him, FEMA said that people should plan on being without help for several weeks as it would take that long for charities and government to respond.? 'My own observation is that Americans tend to be less trusting of institutions to come to their aid. Events like Katrina and the Puerto Rico hurricanes have left Americans with the feeling that they cannot trust or rely on institutions such as government or aid organizations in an emergency,' he said.In Japan, panic buying is a reflection of Japanese people's fear learned from previous disasters.'Japanese people have bad memories of disasters, including the 2011 tsunami-driven nuclear crisis and the recent Kumamoto mountain eruptions,' said Oh In-gyu, a professor of Kansai Gaidai University in Osaka, Japan.

Mexican food trucks were everywhere in New Orleans. What caused this transformation of the food scene?

[Graphic News] What is a Category 5 storm? [1]
  Instance 1: ã€€Here are some facts about what makes a Category 5 storm and what to expect as climate change supercharges our weather.What is a Category 5 storm? ã€€Scientists rank hurricanes from one to five on what is called the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Category 5 storms sustain winds of at least 252 kilometers per hour.ã€€In addition to devastating winds, Category 5 storms unleash catastrophic storm surge -- tsunami-like flooding -- when they make landfall.ã€€Hurricane Dorian's sustained winds reached 185 miles per hour, tying the top speed at landfall ever recorded in the Atlantic, according to the National Hurricane Center.Storms big and small ã€€Hurricane Matthew in 2016 was the first Category 5 storm in the Atlantic since 2007.ã€€Other recent Category 5 storm's include Hurricane Irma, which battered the Caribbean and the southern United States in September 2017.ã€€Hurricane Katrina, which killed over 1,800 people across the US Gulf Coast in 2005, was also a Category 5. ã€€In contrast, Hurricane Florence in 2018 weakened to a Category 1 event before touching down in the Carolinas, though it was still extremely dangerous.Violent times ã€€In 2018, a string of catastrophic storms -- including Florence and Hurricane Michael, in September and October -- killed dozens of people and caused a total of $32 billion in damage in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida.ã€€Michael was the strongest storm to hit the continental United States since 1969.ã€€In May, the NOAA forecasting service predicted a 'near-normal' Atlantic hurricane season for 2019. But authorities encouraged Americans to prepare, as more than 80 million people live in high-risk areas, even if they aren't actually on the coast.Worse to come?

That's wrong,' Michael Brown, former first undersecretary of Emergency Preparedness and Response of the U.S. Homeland Security, said last week.'People want to know.
  Instance 2: Homeland Security, said last week.'People want to know. Even if the story is bad, they want to hear the bad story. ¡®Tell me what's really happening, so I can plan accordingly and so I can react accordingly.''Brown was in charge of responding to an unprecedented disaster in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina devastated the southeast region of the United States. One of the deadliest natural disasters in U.S. history, the storm took the lives of more than 1,800 people.Brown resigned in September 2005 after coming under fire for what critics called a bungled response to Katrina's destruction.Currently the host of a radio talk show on NewsRadio 850 KOA in Denver, Brown arrived in Seoul Wednesday for a five-day seminar on global cooperation for disaster management, nuclear safety and pandemic diseases held at a Seoul hotel.
  Instance 3: And if any one of those doesn't do what they were supposed to do, that will have dominant effects.'Because of the tremendous pressure, Brown recalled his job in the wake of Katrina 'the biggest challenge' of his life.'What happened in Katrina was that, figuratively speaking, I pushed the buttons to make something happen, but nothing happened,' he said.'Of course when you are the guy in charge when all things are going on, the pressure is absolutely tremendous. ... You just can't control what happens in the middle of the disaster,' he said.KTIMES-KTIMES2011urn:contentItem:53MD-MXG1-DYTP-W366-00000-001740452015-08-22Copyright 2011 The Korea Times All Rights ReservedKorea TimesAugust 23, 2011 TuesdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHUS DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITYST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINASTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSST0009F7UHURRICANESST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX002003ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICSST000C4CRPARALYSISSTX002021SAFETYSTX000506DISASTER PLANNINGN624230GCDISASTER RELIEFSTX001003LANDSLIDESSTX001880PUBLIC HEALTHSTX001996NATIONAL SECURITYSTX001864WORKPLACE HEALTH &amp; SAFETYST0008X9ICITY GOVERNMENTST0009U58HISTORYSTX002064EPIDEMICSST000DOXWPANDEMICSN721110GMHOTELS &amp; MOTELSGC307SOUTH KOREAGC343UNITED STATES

  Instance 1: His infamous 1988 campaign ad - Google 'Willie Horton' if you must - was racial demagoguery. And his role in the Iran-Contra scandal will always be suspicious. But his lifetime of good outweighs his mistakes.In an era of cutthroat partisanship, it was inspirational to see Bush's eager willingness in 2005 to partner with the Democrat who beat him - Bill Clinton - on humanitarian relief campaigns after the devastating Southeast Asia tsunami and the heartbreaking destruction of Hurricane Katrina.'41 got what he wanted without bullying, coercion or threats,' former aide Larry Thomas wrote in the San Diego Union-Tribune.

But the ladies and gentlemen of the press were not about to let a technicality like a constitutional amendment trump their loyalty to an institution that had uncritically offered fellowship, conviviality and, at times, solace.Now dark clouds are gathering over the traditional newspaper. The "business model" - and one of the industry's problems may be employing people who use flat-footed phrases like that - is broken, we are told.The archetypal reporters and editors, never particularly well paid to begin with, are being replaced by even worse paid - in some cases, unpaid - youngsters who can turn out great gigabytes of electronic ephemera that people seem even less inclined to pay for than a newspaper delivered to their doorstep daily.Thus, the corporate owners of newspapers in New Orleans, Birmingham, Mobile, Huntsville and Detroit are cutting back, or already have, to publication three days a week, produced by smaller staffs.The decision was received especially badly in New Orleans where the city and the Times-Picayune have a 175-year history plus the shared trauma of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, for which the paper won two Pulitzer prizes and failed to print for only three days although it posted the full pages online.Now the Ralph Brennan Restaurant Group, owner of some of the city's top saloons and restaurants, says 20 percent of each $8 special "Save the Picayune" cocktail will go to a fund to help "adversely affected" employees of the newspaper.One drink, the "Picayune Punch," features absinthe, rum, lime juice and pomegranate liqueur. (Hey, this is New Orleans, after all.)Turnabout is only fair play for the liquor business to come to the aid of the newspaper business. We'll drink to that.Dale McFeatters is an editorial writer for Scripps Howard News Service (www.scrippsnews.com).KTIMES-KTIMES2012urn:contentItem:55W3-SJ41-JCBN-553R-00000-001740452015-08-22Copyright 2012 The Korea Times All Rights ReservedKorea TimesJune 12, 2012 TuesdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHSTX001905JOURNALISMSTX001865WRITERSSTX001928COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp; MANAGEMENTSTX001213NEWS REPORTINGST0009IR9ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST000DM83CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTSN722400CCDRINKING PLACESSTX001865WRITERSSTX001482RESTAURANTSSTX001894BEVERAGE INDUSTRYST000DSE4COCKTAILSSTX001213NEWS REPORTINGN519110MMNEWS SYNDICATIONST000DGSBRESTAURANTS &amp; FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRYST0009IR9ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDSGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGX624BIRMINGHAM, AL, USAGS134LOUISIANA, USA

Harvey and American presidential tradition for relief [2]
  Instance 1: The Internet and increasingly visual as well as audio cell phones carry the process further.Simultaneously, Americans have steadily raised the bar regarding expectations of government. President George W. Bush suffered serious political damage from public perception that he seemed both ineffective and uncaring in reaction to the Hurricane Katrina devastation.One very widely distributed photo showed Bush in Air Force One, gazing down at the floodwaters far, far below. Combined with news that an unqualified socialite friend was in charge of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the image of Bush far above the fray proved costly.Teddy Roosevelt also involved the military in humanitarian relief. The USS Chicago rescued 20,000 people, still one of the largest amphibious evacuations in history.
  Instance 2: Follow-up federal relief was comprehensive.U.S. Presidents for more than a century have developed this tradition as a leadership test.Arthur I.

Williams' lost credibility harms other journalists - [2]

Now, more of his public statements - including some he made about covering Hurricane Katrina - are attracting media scrutiny, prompting NBC News to launch an internal investigation. His travails are the latest illustration of the perils of celebrity journalism, in which the story takes a back seat to the person telling it. Williams' stature as the country's most-watched journalist means that his plunge in believability harms not only himself, but potentially all serious journalists who rely on the trust of their audiences.Williams' troubles began the year before he became the face of NBC News' flagship program, when he traveled to Iraq to provide some in-person coverage of the newly launched invasion.
  Instance 2: That blowback led Williams to apologize on air Wednesday, but he made matters worse by continuing to suggest he'd been in grave danger.The Internet gives the public a wide range of information sources, and people have an alarming tendency to gravitate to the ones that reinforce their views. Mainstream outlets such as NBC News are counting on the credibility they've gained over years of reporting to lift them above the bellowing crowds online. That credibility is something that Williams should have taken more care to protect.This article was published and distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.KTIMES-KTIMES2015urn:contentItem:5F8V-CK21-DYTP-W1XV-00000-001740452016-07-03Copyright 2015 The Korea Times All Rights ReservedKorea TimesFebruary 11, 2015 WednesdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHCC0002JR3NBC UNIVERSAL INCCC0009VRAFACEBOOK INCNAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTINGSIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONSNAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALSFB (NASDAQ)Transportation LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0RotorcraftZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDI1Rjc4RTRCNEEyNEFEMjlCMTVGODg5OTg3NTZFQzE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkEyRTREQTdBRjkzNDE5OTk4ODAzMEY5MDkzRjlGRTEST0009YM7IRAQ WARSTX001905JOURNALISMSTX001814WAR &amp; CONFLICTSTX001865WRITERSSTX000268CELEBRITIESSTX000969INVESTIGATIONSSTX000195BOMBS &amp; EXPLOSIVE DEVICESST000DL89GRENADESST0009RD1INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKINGST0009F7UHURRICANESST000DRDXNEGATIVE MISC NEWSSTX001141MILITARY WEAPONSST000D0VJSOCIAL MEDIAST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST000DB1XINTERNAL INVESTIGATIONSST000D0L8TELEVISION NEWS SHOWSSTX001865WRITERSSTX002247HELICOPTERSSTX000268CELEBRITIESST0009RD1INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKINGSTX001141MILITARY WEAPONSST000D0VJSOCIAL MEDIAGC358IRAQ

  Instance 1: A number of patients and their parents want to meet Wie.''According to Kim, the two hospitals evenly split the donation and have already performed surgeries on four patients.He said the recipients are intractable epilepsy patients and those suffering pathological growth deficiencies. At least 26 more patients will receive surgery as a result of the donation.``She wanted to help patients who could be easily cured with an operation but couldn't afford it.

When the citizens of Joplin, Mo., suffered a deadly tornado, people on the West Coast were there for them. When terrorists attacked on 9/11, we were all there for New York City.

Oil release maybe more political than economic [2]

Republicans denounced it as a political gimmick.The United States acted in concert as part of the 28-nation International Energy Agency, formed in 1974 as a counterweight to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The U.S.
  Instance 2: However, if the release succeeds in re-firing the economy, Obama will get a pass, just this once, from the proposition that the reserve should be tapped only in a genuine emergency.The administration should also address the supply side by approving expanded drilling and exploration off America's coasts. Alternative energy only nibbles at the margin of the problem. We need oil.KTIMES-KTIMES2011urn:contentItem:5367-WY71-DYTP-W3VR-00000-001740452015-08-22Copyright 2011 The Korea Times All Rights ReservedKorea TimesJune 27, 2011 MondayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHORGANIZATION OF THE PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIESINTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCYST0009GJTCRUDE OIL PRICESSTX000619ENERGY &amp; UTILITY POLICYST00097CUINTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONSSTX001242OIL &amp; GAS PRICESST0009GJQSTRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVESSTX000551ECONOMIC NEWSST000DSD5ENERGY PRICESST0009GJUGASOLINE PRICESST000DIJWPRICESN921110MMUS PRESIDENTSST000DJQCCONSUMERSSTX001937ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORSST0009G80ENERGY &amp; UTILITY SECTOR PERFORMANCEN928000CCINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp; NATIONAL SECURITYN813940MMPOLITICAL PARTIESSTX000432CRUDE OIL MARKETSST000CNUKUS LABOR DAYST0009TS6ENERGY DEMANDSTX000949INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONSST000DEILCOMMODITIES PRICESST0009F7UHURRICANESST0009X46DESERT STORMST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINASTX000679EXPORT TRADEST000DGXVECONOMIC STIMULUSST0009FBJPETROLEUM PRODUCTSST0009GJTCRUDE OIL PRICESSTX000619ENERGY &amp; UTILITY POLICYSTX001240OIL &amp; GAS INDUSTRYSTX001242OIL &amp; GAS PRICESST0009GJQSTRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVESSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESST000DSD5ENERGY PRICESST0009GJUGASOLINE PRICESST0009G80ENERGY &amp; UTILITY SECTOR PERFORMANCEN211000CCOIL &amp; GAS EXTRACTIONSTX000432CRUDE OIL MARKETSN324110CCPETROLEUM REFINERIESST0009TS6ENERGY DEMANDST000DEILCOMMODITIES PRICESPE0009TJPBARACK OBAMAGC307SOUTH KOREAGC343UNITED STATESGT115EUROPEGC350LIBYAGC306JAPANGC335SAUDI ARABIA

The first involves gathering resources needed during an emergency, such as food and medical supplies ¡© items that eventually become obsolete.The second model, which Hamre called 'superior,' focuses on the ability to quickly redirect resources in the private sector during emergencies. 'It is far better to use the peacetime system rather than to rely on a parallel response system that is only used in a time of emergency,' he said.'Two days after the terrorist attack in New York City on 9/11, the local electric utility had power back to south Manhattan City because they were experienced in rapid response to natural outages.
  Instance 2: Federal Emergency Response Agency doesn't have its own helicopters and transport trucks, it has an advance agreement to use those of the Department of Defense.Hamre said the 'best way' to honor the people who perished in the sinking was to bolster response capabilities.'The ferry sinking was a terrible disaster. But Korea has suffered many disasters through the years, some worse than this. I have always been impressed by the great resilience of the Korean people.'The goal now is to design a government system that will function more effectively when the next crisis comes.'KTIMES-KTIMES2014urn:contentItem:5CG8-NRM1-DYTP-W19T-00000-001740452015-08-22Copyright 2014 The Korea Times All Rights ReservedKorea TimesJune 18, 2014 WednesdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHN624230GMEMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICESSTX002173MARINE TRANSPORTATION ACCIDENTSSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSN624230EGDISASTER &amp; EMERGENCY AGENCIESSTX001938EDUCATION &amp; TRAININGN920000CCGOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONSTX001473RESCUE OPERATIONSN928120MMSTATE DEPARTMENTS &amp; FOREIGN SERVICESST000DLZBEMERGENCY SERVICESST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAN921100MMUS FEDERAL GOVERNMENTST000DLOJGOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERSSTX000950INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSST0009RLPRESEARCH INSTITUTESST0009HPZSTUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFEST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001710TERRORISMSTX002018TERRORISM &amp; COUNTERTERRORISMST00097CPDEFENSE DEPARTMENTSST000D0T5TERRORIST ATTACKSST0009JZHHIGH SCHOOLSN624230GMEMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICESN483055OMFERRIESSTX002173MARINE TRANSPORTATION ACCIDENTSST00095AJMARINE ACCIDENTS &amp; SAFETYSTX001359POWER FAILURESN221100CCELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRYN220000CCUTILITIES INDUSTRYSTX000775NATURAL GAS &amp; ELECTRIC UTILITIESST00097CPDEFENSE DEPARTMENTSSTX002247HELICOPTERSST0009JZHHIGH SCHOOLSGX601NEW YORK, NY, USAGS148NEW YORK, USAGC343UNITED STATESGC307SOUTH KOREA

Bitchat use cases, explained            Bitchat is more than just a gimmicky messaging app or attempt to avoid surveillance. Dorsey outlines several important use cases, including:Disaster coordinationIn scenarios where cell towers fail, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Bluetooth-style mesh networks could allow for maintained community connection and emergency services connection during disasters. Particularly for emergency responders, the value of mesh networking could be critical when traditional networks collapse.Event overflowsWhen there are large gatherings such as festivals or protests, cell networks can often be overwhelmed or even be nonexistent in places with poor coverage. Mesh expansion helps extend the range of communication, effectively stretching networks across an entire event space.
LA wildfire crisis fuels disinformation, conspiracy theories [2]
  Instance 1: It's not," Newsom wrote. "It's illegal – as it always has been."   "There is an astonishing amount of mis- and dis-information being spread online – much of it by so-called leaders and partisan media outlets who seek to divide this country for their own political gain," said Newsom in a statement issued on the same day. "It breaks my heart that families in Los Angeles don't just have to worry about the fires but also this malicious disinformation as well."   Unlike earlier disasters like Hurricane Katrina, where accountability dominated discussions, this time those narratives are wild and divisive. Social media platforms fuel these rumors by spreading disinformation, removing safeguards against harmful narratives, and using falsehoods to exploit fear, anger or grief, making it harder to correct them with facts alone. Lucy Walker, a documentarian who studied wildfire survivors, observed how shock and grief make people more susceptible to conspiratorial thinking.
  Instance 2: FEMA's rumor response website, reactivated during recent disasters, clarifies misconceptions, while LAFD actively refuted misinformation on social media. This proactive approach countered the rapid dissemination of AI-generated or manipulated visuals, which often exploit chaotic disaster imagery to deceive viewers.

Hurricane Helene death toll tops 200 in U.S. [2]
  Instance 1: At least 204 people are known to have died across six states as a result of the destruction wrought by Hurricane Helene since it made landfall in Florida a week ago, reported the news outlet, adding that hundreds are still missing and nearly a million customers remain without power. Helene has become the deadliest hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than half of the fatalities were confirmed in storm-ravaged North Carolina, with at least 98 deaths. In particular, Buncombe County, which located in western North Carolina, reported 61 deaths.
  Instance 2: The White House said in a news release that Biden will further survey damage caused by Helene and meet with state and local leaders regarding ongoing response efforts. "The president and his entire administration will continue to do everything in our power to help the people of Florida, Georgia, and every community affected by this storm," said the White House.

Roundup: Experts warn climate change makes hurricanes more ferocious [2]
  Instance 1: Helene brought high winds, extreme rainfall and storm surges to coastal areas. The death toll from Helene has climbed to at least 232 people across six states, making it the second-deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in the past 50 years, only ranking behind Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The influence of climate change on tropical cyclones is more complex compared to other types of extreme weather events as impacts are driven by both heavy rainfall and extreme winds, according to experts. In addition, the surrounding conditions, in particular the sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and wider basin, are crucial for the formation of hurricanes.
  Instance 2: Currently a Category 4 hurricane, Milton is growing in size as it is expected to make landfall Wednesday night. As warming continues, storms like Helene and Milton will become more common, researchers warned, urging communities to prepare for more intense storms in the future.

Western democracy now finds itself in a parlous state [1]
  Instance 1: Others rate obedience to manipulative external influencers as a primary virtue. Armchair warlords are also developing greater, malign influence within these warped political systems. Western leaders who combine a robust political backbone with a forceful, independent understanding of the public interest have become a vanishing species.Consider, for example, how Western democracies have regularly dealt ineffectually, at the outset, with natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans or, more recently, the terrible flooding in Spain, compared to typically rapid and effective disaster responsiveness in far less wealthy China.This brings to mind certain comments by the US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns. He recently told NBC News, with trademark American hubris and partiality, that the US will judge China "on its actions, not just its words". In fact, this is a conclusive, universal measure of political performance — not one that just applies to China.

Intensifying Hurricane Ida expected to slam U.S. state of Louisiana [3]
  Instance 1: 28 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Ida, which the U.S. National Hurricane Center has warned could grow to an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm, is expected to slam ashore southern U.S. stateLouisiana on Sunday, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's destructive landfalls in Louisiana and Mississippi. The U.S. weather channel said late Saturday night that Ida is forecast to grow into a major hurricane as it tracks toward the northern Gulf Coast, where it will bring life-threatening storm surge, dangerous rainfall flooding, potentially catastrophic winds and tornadoes.
  Instance 2: The city's authorities were preparing to open shelters for anyone displaced by the storm, according to a NPR report. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards told reporters on Saturday that Ida "will be one of the strongest hurricanes that hit anywhere in Louisiana since at least the 1850s." Edwards said Ida could span about 150 miles (241 km) east and west from the storm's center. Category 3 Hurricane Katrina was blamed for some 1,800 deaths and caused catastrophic flooding in New Orleans in 2005.

New Orleans has U.S. No. 1 murder rate: WSJ [2]
  Instance 1: Meanwhile, this year to date, the New Orleans homicide rate is up 141 percent compared with the same period in 2019, according to the Metropolitan Crime Commission Inc., a nonprofit that works to reduce crime in the city.

Explainer: What are typhoons, and how are they linked to climate change? [1]
  Instance 1: The immense damage they can cause stems from high winds, heavy rainfall, flooding, and storm surges, which can devastate infrastructure, homes, and agriculture. They can cause billions of dollars in damages, loss of life, and long-term recovery costs.The world’s top-ten costliest tropical cyclones all occurred in the Atlantic Ocean. Topping the ranking is Hurricane Katrina, which in 2005 hit the US city of New Orleans and surrounding areas, killing 1,392. Damage was estimated at US$186.3 billion. In the Pacific, the most expensive tropical cyclone to date was Typhoon Doksuri in 2023, which caused over US$28 billion in damages, mainly in China.
2nd LD Writethru: Whole city of New Orleans loses power due to Hurricane Ida [3]
  Instance 1: 29 (Xinhua) -- The whole city of New Orleans, the biggest one in southern U.S. stateLouisiana, is now without power after powerful Hurricane Ida made a landfall in the state earlier on Sunday, city officials said. The day also marks the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's destructive landfalls in Louisiana and Mississippi, "New Orleans has no power. The only power in the city is coming from generators," NOLA Ready, New Orleans' emergency preparedness campaign, tweeted on Sunday night. Across the coastal state, nearly 870,000 customers have lost power after Ida's landfall, according to latest data from the tracking website poweroutage.us.
  Instance 2: Experts are especially worried about the storm's current slow movement, sustained power and direction, according to local media reports. New Orleans has spent 14 billion U.S. dollars to upgrade its flood protection system after heavy suffering from Hurricane Katrina 16 years ago, according to a USA Today report. However, facing the threat of Ida, Deputy City Administrator Officer Ramsey Green has warned that "it's an incredibly fragile system. That system can change at any point." Ida made landfall in Louisiana on Sunday noon time and was downgraded to a Category three as evening fell.
  Instance 3: The so-called "rapid intensification" is typically defined to be a tropical cyclone intensifying by at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period, according to Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach. That can happen when a storm encounters an extremely conducive environment such as very warm water, low vertical wind shear and high levels of mid-level moisture, Klotzbach told local media.

Flooding forecast to worsen in Brazil's south, where many who remain are poor [1]
  Instance 1: In Brazil, El Niño has historically caused droughts in the north and intense rainfall in the south, and this year the effects have been particularly severe.Scientists say extreme weather is happening more frequently because of climate change, caused by the burning of fossil fuels that emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, and overwhelmingly agree the world needs to drastically cut the burning of coal, oil and gas to limit global warming.But there is also a need for social policy responses, said Natalie Unterstell, president of Talanoa Institute, a Rio de Janeiro-based climate policy think tank."Providing an effective response to climate change in Brazil requires us to combat inequalities," Unterstell said.In Brazil, the poor often live in houses built from less resilient materials such as wood and in unregulated areas more vulnerable to damage from extreme weather, such as low-lying areas or on steep hillsides."We cannot say that the worst is over," Rio Grande do Sul Gov. Eduardo Leite said on social media Friday. The day before, he estimated that 19 billion reais ($3.7 billion) will be needed to rebuild the state.The scale of devastation may be most comparable to Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005, Sergio Vale, chief economist at MB Associates, wrote in a note Friday.Rio Grande do Sul has the sixth-highest gross domestic product per capita among Brazil's 26 states and the federal district, according to the national statistics institute. Many of the state's inhabitants descend from Italian and German immigrants."In the popular imagination, the population of Rio Grande do Sul is seen as white and well-off, but this is not the reality," said Marília Closs, a researcher at the CIPO Platform, a climate think tank. "It's very important to dispel this fiction, because it's constructed with a political objective" to erase Black and poor residents, she said.In Canoas, one of the hardest-hit cities in the state, Paulo Cezar Wolf's small wooden house has been fully submerged, along with all his belongings.
Over a third of urban Chinese live in sinking cities [1]
  Instance 1: The weight of the fill used to reclaim new land from the sea can cause the land to sink.Cities often sink unevenly, and this differential subsidence is a much greater challenge than when an entire city sinks at a uniform rate. For instance, traffic vibration and tunneling are also contributing factors in certain areas – the new study found that Beijing is sinking much faster near subways and highways, up to 45mm a year.Subsidence is often attributed to the weight of buildings, but this is probably overstated as modern foundation design aims to minimize the effect to avoid building damage.Coastal cities such as Tianjin are especially affected as sinking land reinforces the problem of climate change-driven sea-level rise. The sinking of sea defenses is one reason why Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005.China’s biggest city, Shangha, has subsided up to three meters over the last 100 years. Built on already low-lying land where the Yangtze Delta meets the ocean, much of the city is barely above sea level, greatly increasing the consequences if flooding occurs.The authors of the new study combined rates of subsidence with projected sea-level rise to estimate that the urban area in China below sea level could triple in size by 2120, affecting between 55 million and 128 million residents. This could be catastrophic without massive adaptation.How to stop sinkingParts of Japan’s two largest cities, Tokyo and Osaka, sank by several meters during the 20th century.

US.The loss of power was due to catastrophic transmission damage from the powerful Category 4 hurricane, said power company Entergy.President Joe Biden described Ida as a life-threatening storm and declared it a major disaster for Louisiana, which allows the state access to federal aid.One person was killed by a falling tree in Prairieville, about 100 kilometers northwest of New Orleans, the Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office said.The National Weather Service issued warnings of storm surges and flash floods for several areas, including the town of Jean Lafitte just south of New Orleans, where Mayor Tim Kerner said the levees had been breached by rapidly rising waters.The storm, though greatly diminished as it churned inland toward western Mississippi early on Monday, was expected to continue unleashing heavy downpours "likely to result in life-threatening" flooding, said the National Hurricane Center.Throughout the morning, showers and strong wind swept the city's deserted streets, buffeting boarded-up windows at businesses and homes surrounded by sandbags.Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said Ida could be the most powerful storm to hit the state since 1850.Storm surges flooded Grand Isle town and low-lying highways in the area were covered in water.Catastrophic damageMost residents heeded warnings of catastrophic damage and the authorities' instructions to flee.Roads leading out of New Orleans had bumper-to-bumper traffic in the days preceding Ida's arrival.With a low vaccination rate, Louisiana is among the states hit hardest by the pandemic, severely stressing hospitals. As of Saturday, hospitalizations at 2,700 were near their pandemic high.

  Instance 1: The remake Original writer David Seltzer returned for this rather pointless, straight-up remake of the film he wrote, scripting it for Irish filmmaker John Moore (Behind Enemy Lines) to direct. No question Moore found a classy cast, with Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles playing the Thorns and Mia Farrow hired for the role of the nanny Mrs Baylock - a nice allusion to the actress' turn in Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. There were nods to Hurricane Katrina and the 9/11 terror attacks, but these contemporary updates added little to the story. Surprisingly, it did reasonably at the box office, taking US$119 million worldwide, but the critics were less than impressed by this humdrum retread. "It amounts to a kind of cinematic karaoke," remarked The Guardian.

  Instance 1: Power and water outages affected hundreds of thousands of people, with many of them unable to get immediate relief. The death toll from the hurricane climbed to at least four in Louisiana and Mississippi. The two states are still taking stock of the disaster inflicted by the Category 4 storm that hit 16 years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the area.

Roundup: 13 dead, 500,000 customers out of power in U.S. Louisiana week after Ida's landfall [2]
  Instance 1: states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. In the Northeast, Ida's remnants dumped record-breaking rain and killed at least 50 people in Virginia, New York and Connecticut. Ida landed on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's destructive strike, tying with 2020's Hurricane Laura and the Last Island Hurricane of 1856 as the strongest ever to hit Louisiana. Up to now, Ida is the deadliest hurricane the United States has seen in four years and the deadliest storm in the Northeast since 2012's Superstorm Sandy, which killed more than 100 people, according to local media reports.

Debate fueled as Biden taps key petroleum stockpile [2]
  Instance 1: It was established in 1975 by President Gerald Ford after the 1973-74 oil embargo by Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC.The embargo was aimed at nations that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War in October 1973. The countries initially targeted were the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and the Netherlands. By the end of the embargo in March 1974, the price of oil had risen by nearly 300 percent.In those days, and in the second oil shock of 1979 amid the Iranian revolution, drivers in the US had to wait in long lines for rationed gasoline－sometimes based on their vehicle license plate or days of the week.The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, has been used in emergencies such as the buildup to the Gulf War in 1991 and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which was centered on the New Orleans area. Much of the oil infrastructure along the Gulf of Mexico was damaged in the devastating storm.The SPR accommodates more than 700 million barrels to be used "to counter a disruption in commercial oil supplies which could threaten the US economy", according to the Department of Energy, or DoE, which manages the stockpile. The oil can be sold to other countries and used to pump more supply into the market.The SPR inventory as of April 1 was 564.6 million barrels, comprising 249.8 million barrels of sweet crude and 314.8 million barrels of sour crude, according to the DoE.As of August 2020, the four SPR storage locations were connected by government pipelines and commercially owned pipelines and terminals to 28 refineries on the Gulf of Mexico coast and a total of six refineries in Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky.

Hong Kong copes with stress remarkably well [1]
  Instance 1: That legacy, which is excellent, has been well-maintained since 1997. But this recent, exceptional level of extreme weather has stress-tested these coping systems in ways that signal rethinking is needed to deal with likely similar episodes in the future.When natural disasters strike, unsurprisingly, criticism focused on governance follows. Think of how people responded after witnessing Australia's prime minister taking a secret vacation in 2019 as a major natural disaster unfolded; the American government responses to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005; and the terrible recent fires in Hawaii, for example.We are seeing a repeat of this phenomenon here in Hong Kong. These weather events have severely tested our installed, bad weather infrastructure and our bad weather response mechanisms. There has, thus, been a good deal of critical commentary related to both of these aspects, focused on the government.

Roundup: At least 1 killed, multiple injured after tornado hits U.S. New Orleans area [2]
  Instance 1: "Although the tornado has passed, we're still experiencing heavy rain &amp; gusty winds in the New Orleans area," the mayor tweeted on Wednesday. Another tornado was confirmed north of Lake Pontchartrain in the coastal state, according to local media reports. It's rare that a tornado moves through New Orleans, the city pummeled by Hurricane Katrina 17 years ago, according to local media reports. A 2017 tornado caused widespread damage when it touched down in the eastern part of the city. Homes were damaged in a dozen Mississippi counties as the storms moved through Tuesday, the state's emergency management agency tweeted on Wednesday.

Roundup: Study shows climate change makes Hurricane Harvey more destructive [2]
  Instance 1: The hurricane caused roughly 125 billion U.S. dollars in damage, more than every natural disaster in U.S. history except Hurricane Katrina 17 years ago. Parts of the metropolitan area still have not fully recovered five years after its landfall. "We already know that climate change is increasing the severity and frequency of extreme weather events," said the study's lead author Kevin Smiley, an assistant sociology professor at Louisiana State University (LSU).
  Instance 2: The study is "a first of its kind investigation into potential disparities between those impacted by the climate change-induced flooding, finds patterns of racial and economic disparities", said the ScienceDaily report. Climate change attribution, which ascertains the connection between climate change and extreme weather events, involves running computational models to estimate how much these changes in climate make extreme weather events, like hurricanes, more severe.

US bracing for ‘powerful, dangerous’ Hurricane Ida [2]
  Instance 1: The state also has the nation’s third-highest incidence of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people over the past seven days.By early yesterday, Ida was a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, the National Hurricane Center said. At 7am it was located about 85 kilometers southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River, carrying top sustained winds of up to 240km per hour.Rain gusted through New Orleans yesterday morning, where Robert Ruffin, a retired 68-year-old man, had evacuated with his family to a downtown hotel from their home in the city’s east.“I thought it was safer,” he said. “It’s double trouble this time because of COVID.”Ida’s landfall was only a few hours away, according to the NHC, which warned of life-threatening storm surges, potentially catastrophic wind damage and flooding rainfall.Louisiana was devastated 16 years ago this week by Hurricane Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people.The state is not planning to evacuate hospitals now strained by an influx of COVID-19 patients, Edwards said.“The implications of having a Category 4 storm while hospitals are full are beyond what we normally contemplate,” Edwards said.There were more than 3,400 new COVID-19 cases reported on Friday, and about 2,700 people are hospitalized with the virus.Officials ordered widespread evacuations of low-lying and coastal areas, jamming highways and leading some gasoline stations to run dry as residents and vacationers fled the seashore.“This is a powerful and dangerous storm,” said Joseph Kanter, Louisiana’s chief medical official.“It is moving faster than we had thought it would be, so we have a little less time to prepare.”SHADLY-9342176SHADLY2021urn:contentItem:63GN-NXJ1-DYMS-S393-00000-003839712021-08-29Copyright 2021 Benchmark Information LimitedAll Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 Shanghai Daily Publishing HouseShanghai Daily (Benchmark)August 30, 2021 MondayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001763TROPICAL STORMSST000DQGECOVID CORONAVIRUSST000DOTHCOVID-19 CORONAVIRUSSTX000912INFECTIOUS DISEASESTX001826WEATHERSTX000317COASTAL AREASST000DIIQSEVERE WINDST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST000DPS4HURRICANE LAURASTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSN924120QCOCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICESST000DEUISEVERE WEATHERN622000CCHOSPITALSN511000CCPUBLISHINGN721110GMHOTELS &amp; MOTELSN447000CCGAS STATIONSPE000DOG1JOHN BEL EDWARDSGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGS134LOUISIANA, USAST000A2VVMISSISSIPPI RIVERGR215SOUTHEAST USAGC343UNITED STATES

  Instance 1: Other residents have launched their own fundraising efforts such as the "Help Maui Rise" Google spreadsheet created by locals. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said it has deployed some 300 employees to Maui, while the Red Cross has sent 250 disaster workers, CBS News reported. The agency has been criticized in the past for its responses to major disasters, like Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017. In many cases, the criticism centered around accusations that it was not adequately prepared or slow to respond. At least a few Maui residents have questioned why the agency was not already present.
New Orleans in darkness as Hurricane Ida strikes [2]

UN calls for eliminating violence against women, girls [2]
  Instance 1: Furthermore, global emergencies, crises, and conflicts have further intensified VAWG and exacerbated its drivers and risks. "Since the start of COVID-19, 45 percent of women reported that they or a woman they know has experienced a form of VAWG," according to the statement. All types of gender-based violence are also aggravated by natural disasters, as witnessed in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina, in 2010 during the Haiti earthquake, in 2011 during the tropical cyclones in Vanuatu, and in 2019 through 2022 during the Australian bush fires. Meanwhile, existing forms of gender-based violence have grown online as anti-rights movements have flourished. According to the UN entities, these factors have resulted in a shrinking space for civil society, a backlash against women's rights organizations, and increased attacks against women human rights advocates.
  Instance 2: Finally, on Feb. 7, 2000, the General Assembly adopted Resolution 54/134, officially designating Nov. 25 as the International day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and in doing so, inviting governments, international organizations as well as non-government organizations to join together and organize activities designed to raise public awareness of the issue every year on that date.PDOENG-9686112PDOENG2022urn:contentItem:66Y9-8DK1-JC5R-20R2-00000-004203032022-11-26Copyright 2022 Benchmark Information LimitedAll Rights ReservedCopyright 2022 People's DailyPeople's Daily Online - EnglishNovember 26, 2022 SaturdayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsENGLISHST000DNALGENDER BASED VIOLENCEST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSST000D89FFEMINISM &amp; WOMEN'S RIGHTSST000D7R3GENDER EQUALITYST000DRDXNEGATIVE MISC NEWSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST00098X6SEX &amp; GENDER ISSUESST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSSTX001851WOMENST000A7ISASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONSST000DIEGGENDER &amp; SEX DISCRIMINATIONSTX000873HUMAN RIGHTSN813311MMHUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONSSTX001965SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLESTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSST0008ZBZHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSST000DRN1NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWSN525000CCFUNDS &amp; INVESTMENT TRUSTSST000C9U3JANUARY 2010 HAITI EARTHQUAKEST000D1BYEXECUTIVESSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSN525920MMTRUST ARRANGEMENTSST000DOX0WILDFIRESST000DOQLAUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRESST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINASTX001763TROPICAL STORMSST000DQGECOVID CORONAVIRUSST000DOTHCOVID-19 CORONAVIRUSN525000CCFUNDS &amp; INVESTMENT TRUSTSPE000DM6VANTONIO GUTERRESGC365HAITIGC564VANUATU

'Sponge cities' offer answers for NZ after devastating floods [1]
  Instance 1: Green infrastructure includes public green spaces, parks, lakes, and wetlands.Dahiya said that none of this will come cheaply, and that it calls for "strong political will" and significant investment in grey and green infrastructure."How cities, including their communities and leaders, will be able to bring these multiple approaches together will go a long way in effectively tackling the evolving challenges posed by climate change," he said.Tom Logan, senior lecturer in risk and civil systems analysis at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, however, said creating sponge cities will only go so far."Auckland communities affected by flooding are going to have to make some hard choices," he said."When you get that much water, it's going to overwhelm your systems. We don't design our systems for the worst possible event because it'd be so expensive."In a commentary for the academic website The Conversation in January, Welch said, "In a way, we should do less building and let nature do what it was meant to do."Auckland's flooding was, to a large extent, "of our own making", he said. "We've built a supercity covered in impervious surfaces, expanded the built environment across sensitive (and flood-prone) areas, and created massive greenhouse gas emissions destabilising the climate."Logan said building flood walls or barriers is an option, but these can actually make flooding worse, citing New Orleans' experience in 2005 following Hurricane Katrina."We have to decide our risk tolerance and how regularly we are willing to accept some amount of damage," Logan said.Some of the hard choices, he said, could include giving Auckland Council the power to stop building in flood prone areas and relocating communities."This constant cycle of insurance, rebuilding, another hazard, rebuilding, isn't sustainable. Insurance companies are going to move out and make us unprotected," Logan said.karlwilson@chinadailyapac.comCHIDHK-114406041CHIDHK2023urn:contentItem:67TD-VS51-F11P-X39R-00000-004123022023-03-19Copyright 2023 China Daily Information.

Roundup: At least 2 dead as powerful Ida wreaks havoc across U.S. Louisiana [2]
  Instance 1: I can't tell you when all the debris is going to be cleaned up and repairs made," the governor told a news conference on Monday, promising to work hard to help power grid recover. "The full extent of damage is yet to be seen," Louisiana state police said in a Facebook post on Monday, noting that search and rescue workers are still not able to access certain impacted areas. Ida landed on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's destructive strike, tying with 2020's Hurricane Laura and the Last Island Hurricane of 1856 as the strongest ever to hit Louisiana.

'Global NATO' and the long-term precedent [2]
  Instance 1: According to this idea, NATO and its members would have the mission of ensuring peace and security globally. Indeed, it has been moving in that direction. In recent years, NATO has intervened in Afghanistan, trained security forces in Iraq, provided logistical support to the African Union mission in Darfur, assisted in tsunami relief efforts in Indonesia, transported supplies to victims of Hurricane Katrina in the United States, and to victims of a major earthquake in Pakistan. NATO already has nine "global partners" with whom the Alliance cooperates on an individual basis - Afghanistan, Australia, Colombia, Iraq, Japan, South Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand, and Pakistan. As stated on , "NATO's engagement with global partners is becoming increasingly important in a complex security environment, where many of the challenges the Alliance faces are global and not bound by geography." NATO's practical cooperation with its global partners includes cross-cutting global challenges such as cyber defense, maritime security, humanitarian aid and disaster relief, non-proliferation, and defense science and technology.
  Instance 2: Their interests prevail even though it is clear that the world does not need so many weapons; on the contrary, it needs fewer. The willingness of the major Western powers to use their military hard power to coerce other parts of the world is invoked by Russia on its unlawful aggression of Ukraine and sets a dangerous precedent for the future. If in two or three decades we see squadrons in the South Atlantic under the aegis of the Shanghai Organization - or another organization that has been formed in the meantime by new emerging powers, particularly Asian ones - let us remember the precedent set by NATO at the beginning of the 21st century.Link to ImageJorge Costa OliveiraMACDTM-153923MACDTM2022urn:contentItem:65F3-54J1-DY2H-61WJ-00000-004683452022-05-12Copyright 2022 Macau Daily Times All Rights ReservedMacau Daily TimesMay 10, 2022 TuesdayNewspaperNewspapersEnglishAFRICAN UNIONMultipolar WorldMultipolar WorldOpinionN624230GCDISASTER RELIEFST000A7YOGEOGRAPHYST00097CUINTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONSSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001982WEAPONS &amp; ARMSSTX002208ARMS CONTROL &amp; DISARMAMENTST000D73FEUROPEAN UNIONSTX001141MILITARY WEAPONSST000DRSLRUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICTSSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX002018TERRORISM &amp; COUNTERTERRORISMSTX001759TRENDSN624230CCDISASTER &amp; EMERGENCY RELIEFST000DS47HUMANITARIAN AIDSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYST000DRQVHUMANITARIAN CRISESST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST0009R6CINDIAN OCEAN TSUNAMIN928120KMINTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCESTX001463RELIEF ORGANIZATIONSSTX000900TSUNAMISSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGESTX000950INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSSTX002210ARMS RACESTX000546EARTHQUAKESST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001710TERRORISMSTX000556EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONSSTX001763TROPICAL STORMSSTX001141MILITARY WEAPONSSTX000462DEFENSE ELECTRONICSSTX000463DEFENSE INDUSTRYPE0009TJPBARACK OBAMAGC508AFGHANISTANGT115EUROPEGC358IRAQGC309PAKISTANGC343UNITED STATESGT111AFRICAGC301AUSTRALIAST00099QFEUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATESGC305INDONESIAGC306JAPANGC307KOREA, REPUBLIC OFGC549MONGOLIAGC351NEW ZEALANDGC325SPAINGC382SUDANGR152WESTERN EUROPEGC581UKRAINE

[Photo/Xinhua]Extreme weather events and natural disasters take their toll in past year.Threats from climate change and to biodiversity appeared to be overshadowed last year as the COVID-19 pandemic raged around the world, along with regional conflicts and political differences.Although not every natural disaster or extreme weather event is caused by or related to climate change, more evidence emerged of a strong connection.In August, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published the first part of its sixth assessment report, which stated that evidence of human influence has strengthened in relation to hurricanes and tropical cyclones.According to the report, the number of intense tropical cyclones, average wind speeds of peak tropical cyclones, and peak wind speeds for the most intense cyclones will rise worldwide due to increased global warming.Also in August, the deadly and destructive Hurricane Ida swept the United States, the second-most-damaging and intense hurricane on record to make landfall in the state of Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Ida headed north and caused extensive flooding in New York City and the surrounding area.The National Centers for Environmental Information, or NCEI, said the hurricane caused damage estimated at least $75.25 billion, the costliest disaster in the US and worldwide last year.According to reinsurance company Munich Re's annual report, economic losses from natural disasters globally last year reached $280 billion, the fourth-highest total after 2011, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck Japan.Floods, storms and drought also displaced millions of people across the world, and the report said nearly 10,000 died as a result of natural disasters last year, comparable to such death tolls in recent years. The company warned that studies showed a link between global warming and natural disasters.Widespread flooding in Europe took the second-highest financial toll after Hurricane Ida last year.In July, a dozen European countries experienced severe flooding, with deaths and widespread damage reported in some nations.

Photo: VCGOwners were boarding up their shops and evacuations were underway Saturday as Hurricane Ida was on a path to hit New Orleans 16 years to the day the southern US city was devastated by Hurricane Katrina.A handful of people were still on New Orleans streets, but many businesses had closed up ahead of what the National Weather Service called "an extremely dangerous major hurricane.""Everybody is scared because it's the anniversary of Katrina and people didn't take it seriously at the time," said Austin Suriano, who was helping board up the windows of his father's watch repair shop.Sunday, when Ida is due to make landfall, marks 16 years since Katrina, the devastating hurricane that flooded 80 percent of New Orleans, left 1,800 people dead and caused billions of dollars in damage.President Joe Biden warned Saturday that "Ida is turning into a very, very dangerous storm" as it built to a Category 2 hurricane, packing 100 miles (160 kilometers) per hour sustained winds and heavy rain.Earlier in the day, people evacuating from New Orleans and other cities clogged roads heading north as officials warned locals to leave immediately or hunker down to ride out the storm.All Sunday flights were canceled at New Orleans airport.Tropical storm-force winds are expected to hit the area late Saturday, while Ida was forecast to slam into the coast as a powerful Category Four hurricane - with winds up to 140 miles (225 kilometers) per hour - Sunday afternoon or evening.Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said Ida would be one of the most powerful storms to hit the state since the 1850s.In New Orleans, Mayor LaToya Cantrell warned residents to take Ida with utmost seriousness."Time is not on our side," she told a briefing. "It's rapidly growing, it's intensifying."Southern Louisiana was bracing for massive damage and flooding as the storm roared northward after pummeling western Cuba."Extended power loss is almost certain," New Orleans homeland security director Collin Arnold told reporters Saturday. "I'm imploring you to take this storm seriously."Biden said hundreds of emergency personnel had been sent to the region, along with food, water and electric generators.
  Instance 2: Shelters were being prepared around the region, but Louisiana has been one of the hardest-hit states by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Biden urged anyone heading to a shelter to wear a mask and take precautions.The National Weather Service is forecasting a "life-threatening storm surge" - as high as 11 feet (3.3 meters) near New Orleans and 15 feet around the mouth of the Mississippi River - when the hurricane makes landfall.It warned of "catastrophic wind damage."AFPGTMCHI-238442901GTMCHI2021urn:contentItem:63GP-5YW1-JDJN-60HG-00000-004113892021-08-30Copyright 2021 Global Times.

DEVASTATING FLOODS SHINE SPOTLIGHT ON PROTECTION MEASURES [1]
  Instance 1: The guidelines aim to create cities with the ability to adapt to environmental changes and effectively respond to natural disasters, functioning in a way similar to sponges.Government departments, including urban planning, drainage, transportation and landscaping, are involved in guiding the process.The guideline states that to build such cities, efforts should be made to prevent urban areas sprawling rapidly, and adequate areas of green space, along with footpaths made from permeable materials should be provided.Other efforts should include connecting water systems such as rivers, lakes, wetlands, ponds and canals with urban rainwater pipe networks and excess rainwater discharge systems, the guideline states.The ministry said that over the years problems have arisen, with some cities misunderstanding sponge city construction. These problems could hamper efforts to bolster resilience against disasters, according to a statement released by the ministry last year.There are problems in building water filtration systems regardless of geological conditions, drawing drainage zoning boundaries based solely on administrative divisions, and adding drainage hurriedly after the completion of design plans for buildings, roads and gardens.She Nian, head of the Smart Sponge City Planning and Construction Research Institute at the Tsinghua Innovation Center in Zhuhai, Guangdong province, told Southern Weekly on Wednesday that the carrying capacity of northern sponge cities is lower than that of southern cities."Northern cities need to improve awareness of how sponge cities tackle urban flooding, as in the past, northern regions have not experienced frequent rainfall or heavy storms like southern areas," She said.During construction of sponge cities, attention should be paid to building green belts, rather than relying solely on traditional rainwater drainage systems, he was quoted as saying.In 2021, the UN Office for Project Services, the UN Environment Programme and the University of Oxford co-published a report titled Infrastructure for Climate Action.The report emphasizes the importance of treating infrastructure as a key area for addressing climate change — urging governments to reassess how to deliver and manage infrastructure to ensure it is suitable for a resilient future.In recent years, cities worldwide have sought ways to enhance their resilience to climate change. However, implementing such measures often comes at a high financial cost.One example is the case of New Orleans in the United States, and the city's suburbs located south of Lake Pontchartrain.Following the destructive Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the federal government invested $14.5 billion on installing levees, pumps, seawalls, floodgates and drainage systems to carry massive amount of water away from houses and into wetlands.This infrastructure has since protected the area from damage caused by storms, the Associated Press reported in 2021.lihongyang@chinadaily.com.cn Link to ImageA view of the Yongding River in western Beijing on Tuesday taken from the New Shougang Bridge, with a venue for the 2022 Winter Olympics in the background.

Some areas outside New Orleans also suffered major flooding and structure damage.At least two people have been confirmed dead as of Monday night, about 36 hours after Ida's powerful landfall.The two victims were reportedly a man who drowned in his car after trying to drive through floodwater in New Orleans and a 60-year-old man who was hit by a tree that fell on his home near Baton Rouge, the state's capital city.Search effortsLouisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said earlier on Monday that he "fully expects" the death toll to jump as search and rescue efforts get underway.At least 671 people stranded in Ida-hit areas had been rescued by Monday afternoon, said Edwards later in the day.Four Louisiana hospitals were damaged and 39 medical facilities were operating on generator power, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Dozens of streets in New Orleans were flooded, and some levees failed or were overtopped. However, Edwards said the system of flood walls, levees, canals and barriers constructed by the US Army Corps of Engineers spared New Orleans and the immediate area from devastation, which Hurricane Katrina caused. Katrina devastated the city and caused 1,800 deaths in 2005.Edwards said 22 nursing homes and 18 assisted living facilities have been evacuated, though evacuating the largest hospitals was not an option because he said there are no other places to send residents.The Environmental Protection Agency issued emergency fuel waivers for Louisiana and Mississippi due to Hurricane Ida.The storm is the latest in what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has forecast will be a busier than average season. It forecasts between 15 and 21 named storms, and three to five of those becoming major hurricanes.Xinhua and agencies contributed to this story.aiheping@chinadailyusa.comLink to ImageThe flooded scene on Monday in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida in Lafitte, Louisiana.

EIU Democracy Index shows misleading picture of China [1]
  Instance 1: Under universal suffrage and the secret ballot, people are supposed to be able to express their true preferences through the vote. But politicians, in order to gain an election, will lure votes by offering their constituents benefits that may be attractive in the short term but that may cost them dearly over the long term. The tragedy of Hurricane Katrina, which killed 1,392 people, mostly in New Orleans and the surrounding area, can be traced to funds originally intended for the maintenance of the levees being diverted to other uses. The ballot box is only a means to bring about equality. In China, although the government is not returned via direct election, all civil servants and government leaders have to compete fairly based on their merits for the opportunity to serve the country.
Roundup: Ida-driven rain, flooding claim over 40 lives in U.S. Northeast [1]
  Instance 1: Northeast, Ida had already wrecked widespread havoc in southern U.S. states Louisiana and Mississippi, leaving four people dead and hundreds of thousands of people with power outages. Ida landed on Sunday, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's destructive strike, tying with 2020's Hurricane Laura and the Last Island Hurricane of 1856 as the strongest ever to hit Louisiana. It was downgraded to a tropical depression on Monday afternoon and moved inland with torrential rain.

Roundup: Hurricane Ida grows into Category 4, nears projected landfall in U.S. Louisiana [1]
  Instance 1: Meanwhile, city officials said Ida was strengthening so quickly that there was no time to organize a mandatory evacuation of the city's 390,000 residents. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards told reporters on Saturday that Ida "will be one of the strongest hurricanes that hit anywhere in Louisiana since at least the 1850s." If Ida makes landfall in Louisiana as forecast, it would be the fourth hurricane to slam the state since last August and Louisiana's third major hurricane landfall in that time span, according to the CNN report. The hurricane has quickly increased in intensity since striking Cuba on Friday, threatening to be an "extremely dangerous major hurricane." Sunday is the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's destructive landfalls in Louisiana and Mississippi, which killed more than 1,800 people in the region.

Chinese netizens concerned over slow rescue at US condo ruins, compare emergency responses of two countries [2]
  Instance 1: In meetings with the authorities, the family members repeatedly pushed rescuers to do more. Some Chinese netizens have also commented that the slow rescue work exposes the loopholes of the US emergency rescue system and shows how the US treats lives with indifference. Many of them remembered the rescue work of the Hurricane Katrina, in which Director Michael Brown of the Federal Emergency Management Agency dispatched 1,000 Homeland Security workers into the region five hours after a landslide.Some netizens compared the rescue pace of China and the US during accidents, urging the US authorities to take effective measures to save lives and conduct an immediate investigation into what caused the tragedy and who is responsible as soon as possible.For example, in a recent gas explosion accident in Shiyan, Central China's Hubei Province, more than 2,000 personnel including government workers, soldiers and firefighters, together with large equipment and life detection instruments were quickly deployed to the site. The accident happened around 6:40 am on June 13, and by afternoon on the same day, 12 victims had been found dead with 37 others seriously injured. On June 14 afternoon, 13 more bodies were found in the debris.
  Instance 2: In response, netizens urged the US to focus on the rescue work and digging into the reasons behind the tragedy, rather than questioning the international community's concerns.Global TimesGTMCHI-220726199GTMCHI2021urn:contentItem:631N-YRH1-JDJN-61V2-00000-004113892021-06-30Copyright 2021 Global Times.

The court's non-binding ruling, which says that countries must comply with climate treaties, has been hailed as a great victory for youth activism from small island nations facing the brunt of the climate crisis. The triumph at the ICJ is the culmination of a unique university project started by a group of law students at the University of the South Pacific's law school in Vanuatu in 2019.
  Instance 3: They wanted to test whether international law could save them from the impacts of climate change. Their initial efforts focused on persuading the Pacific Island Forum - of which Australia and New Zealand are members - to take the issue to the world's top court. Undeterred by the lack of traction, the student group was eventually joined by the World's Youth for Climate Justice, which helped the campaign go global. Thanks to this campaign, in March 2023, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution supported by over 130 countries requesting that the ICJ give an advisory opinion that clarifies the obligations of countries under international law in respect of climate change. The ICJ has handed down a ruling that vindicates the efforts of young activists from the Pacific region and around the world.
  Instance 4: Naturally, climate campaigners around the world are rejoicing in the hope that the ruling will put pressure on nations that are polluting our planet's environment. Advocates also hope the ruling will provide the legal means to sue developed countries that fail to deliver on compensation commitments. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described the ICJ ruling as a "victory for our planet, for climate justice and for the power of young people to make a difference". The task for the activists behind the campaign was to find a legal connection between human rights and the devastation of their communities caused by the climate crisis.

The court's non-binding ruling, which says that countries must comply with climate treaties, has been hailed as a great victory for youth activism from small island nations facing the brunt of the climate crisis. The triumph at the ICJ is the culmination of a unique university project started by a group of law students at the University of the South Pacific's law school in Vanuatu in 2019.

Their initial efforts focused on persuading the Pacific Island Forum - of which Australia and New Zealand are members - to take the issue to the world's top court. Undeterred by the lack of traction, the student group was eventually joined by the World's Youth for Climate Justice, which helped the campaign go global. Thanks to this campaign, in March 2023, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution supported by over 130 countries requesting that the ICJ give an advisory opinion that clarifies the obligations of countries under international law in respect of climate change. The ICJ has handed down a ruling that vindicates the efforts of young activists from the Pacific region and around the world.
  Instance 3: Naturally, climate campaigners around the world are rejoicing in the hope that the ruling will put pressure on nations that are polluting our planet's environment. Advocates also hope the ruling will provide the legal means to sue developed countries that fail to deliver on compensation commitments. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the ICJ ruling as a "victory for our planet, for climate justice and for the power of young people to make a difference". The task for the activists behind the campaign was to find a legal connection between human rights and the devastation of their communities caused by the climate crisis. The ruling may be a boost for countries in the Global South, led in some respects by China, which have emphasised the importance of development rights as human rights.
Zambia seeks 34.7 bln USD for climate adaptation blueprint: minister [1]
  Instance 1: "We are also mobilizing resources from multilateral development banks, including the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and the International Finance Corporation," Mposha said at the opening of the 2025 Global National Adaptation Plan Expo in Lusaka, the country's capital. He added that the government is also deploying innovative financing tools, such as green bonds, to secure the resources needed for the plan's implementation. Mposha called on the global community to uphold the principles of climate justice and equity by ensuring that least developed countries can access sufficient adaptation financing. He emphasized that countries should leverage innovative sources of finance that provide scaled-up funding for the implementation of national adaptation plans, noting that Zambia has made significant progress in executing its adaptation plan, officially launched in 2023, by integrating it into national development processes.

Ali Mohamed, special climate envoy of Kenya and the chair of the African Group of Negotiators on Climate Change, said the convening comes at a critical moment for Africa's climate agenda because they will review the outcomes of the 29th session of the Conference of Parties (COP29) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that was held in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November 2024.
  Instance 3: He added that the meeting will also set priorities for 2025 as well as Africa's united position ahead of COP30 that will be held in Brazil later this year. Harsen Nyambe, director of Sustainable Environment and Blue Economy Directorate at the African Union Commission, said the continent cannot afford to be a passive participant in climate diplomacy and must be proactive, strategic, and united in driving a climate agenda that protects the continent as a leader in the green economy. Nyambe noted that Africa's quest for climate justice includes supporting the operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund, increasing investment in renewable energy, and strengthening community-driven climate adaptation strategies. He said African countries are expected to receive adequate climate funds if the global climate finance mechanisms are reformed.

The ICJ on July 23 confirmed that the system of UNFCCC is the principal legal instruments regulating the international response to the global problem of climate change, and made clear countries' rights and obligations under international environmental law. Some countries said this marked a decisive moment in promoting global climate justice."We noted that the ICJ's advisory opinion pointed out that the UNFCCC system is the principal legal instruments regulating the international response to the global problem of climate change and confirmed that the principle of common but differentiated responsibility, the principle of sustainable development and the principle of equity are applicable as guiding principles for the interpretation and application of relevant international law," Guo said.He said it stressed that developed countries should take the lead in combating climate change and that countries have the obligation to strengthen international cooperation, adding that the advisory opinion reflects the long-standing stance and proposition of developing countries, including China, which is of positive significance to maintaining and advancing international climate cooperation.China took an active part in this advisory opinion, Guo said, noting that as the biggest major developing country, China has been a staunch doer in and important contributor to green development, and is actively and prudently working towards its goals on carbon peak and carbon neutrality."We will make the world's biggest cut in carbon emission intensity and move from carbon peak to carbon neutrality in the shortest time frame ever seen in history," Guo said.In the meantime, China's quality and low-cost clean energy technologies and products have significantly cut the costs for global green and low-carbon transition, and China has also provided as much assistance as it can to fellow developing countries through the channel of South-South cooperation, he added.Guo pointed out that however the world may change, China will not slow down its climate actions, will not reduce its support for international cooperation, and will not cease its efforts to build a community with a shared future for humanity.PDOENG-10434166PDOENG2025urn:contentItem:6GBK-14Y3-RSMW-706H-00000-004203032025-07-25Copyright 2025 Benchmark Information LimitedAll Rights ReservedCopyright 2025 People's DailyPeople's Daily Online - EnglishJuly 25, 2025 FridayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsENGLISHST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTX000483DEVELOPING COUNTRIESSTX000639ENVIRONMENTAL LAWST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSST0009TYVGREEN BUILDINGST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSSTX001941ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION &amp;

  Instance 1: These consequences underscore the urgent and existential threat posed by climate change,” Judge Yuji Iwasawa, the ICJ president, said on Wednesday.Litigants can now cite the advisory opinion in future climate-related litigation.Aim for 1.5°C targetGreenpeaceHong Kong told HKFP on Thursday that “Hong Kong as a responsible city, must also strengthen its policies to support the globe to achieve the more ambitious 1.5°C target in the coming update of the Climate Action Plan.”Launched in 2021, Climate Action Plan 2050 (CAP2050) lays out multiple decarbonisation strategies – such as net-zero electricity generation and green transport – with an aim to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050.Net zero refers to achieving a balance between the production and removal of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in order to slow the progression of global warming. The overarching goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement, adopted by 195 parties at the UN Climate Change Conference, is to limit the global temperature rise to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. In the long term, further efforts are required in the pursuit of a 1.5°C target.A spokesperson for Ark Eden, an eco-education centre on Lantau Island, called the climate change ruling a “historic milestone,” particularly for biodiversity advocacy and for the potential impact on future environmental litigation in local courts.“By affirming the legal right to a healthy environment, it places a binding obligation on all states to protect the natural world – a powerful reinforcement of every citizen’s right to demand climate justice,” said the Ark Eden spokesperson. “For species on the brink, this ruling could be a game-changer.”Public readiness Civic Exchange, a local public-policy think tank, said that Hong Kong has shown steady climate progress, such as through the city’s CAP2025.Civic Exchange Executive Director Lawrence Iu told HKFP that, on a regional scale, the city made some of the most significant greenhouse gas emission reductions in Asia. “Between 2014 and 2022, Hong Kong reduced its [greenhouse gas] emissions by 24%, with electricity-related emissions dropping by nearly 33%,” he wrote.Iu also said that, if the government were to become more ambitious in their climate policies and actions, Hongkongers should be “prepared to shoulder some of the associated costs.”“Ultimately, Hong Kong’s ability to move faster will hinge not only on technical feasibility or government leadership, but also on public readiness to participate in and support the transition,” he added.Others, such as Paul G.
Carbon bootprints: how war is fuelling climate catastrophe [1]
  Instance 1: History shows that those with power and resources will adapt; the marginalised will be displaced, stripped of assets and forced to migrate. Climate migration is no longer a hypothetical - it is a present reality. Peace and climate justice are inseparable from the fight against poverty and inequality. While the world obsesses over individual carbon footprints, militaries - the elephant in the climate room - operate in the shadows, protected by the very institutions that have been charged with saving our planet. We must demand transparent reporting, genuine accountability for conflict emissions and a redirection of military spending towards climate resilience.
All-out thaw: can India and China unfreeze icy ties at last? [1]
  Instance 1: Economic engagement cannot be delinked from national security concerns," Kishor said. Meanwhile, China's construction of a mega dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo River, which becomes the Brahmaputra upon reaching India, has stoked anxieties in Delhi about water security. Still, both countries saw value in amplifying the Global South's voice on issues such as climate justice and equitable development, Kishor said - though bilateral tensions and regional rivalries had hampered their cooperation at global forums. In India, some of the harsher anti-China rhetoric that had been common in the immediate aftermath of the Galwan Valley clash had now died down, Dhar told This Week in Asia. Public discourse, once dominated by calls for boycotts, had gradually softened.

Some countries said this marked a decisive moment in promoting global climate justice. How do you view this advisory opinion?Guo Jiakun: We noted that the ICJ's advisory opinion pointed out that  the UNFCCC system is the principal legal instruments regulating the international response to the global problem of climate change and confirmed that the principle of common but differentiated responsibility, the principle of sustainable development and the principle of equity are applicable as guiding principles for the interpretation and application of relevant international law. It stressed that developed countries should take the lead in combating climate change and that countries have the obligation to strengthen international cooperation.

The call was made at an experts and partners engagement meeting focusing on the AU Great Green Wall Initiative, held on Tuesday in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. Speaking at the event, Mithika Mwenda, executive director of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, said African governments need to act swiftly to save the continent from the imminent danger of desertification, driven by climate change, unsustainable utilization of natural resources, and the destruction of forest ecosystems. Mwenda warned that the Sahara Desert is advancing southward while the Kalahari Desert is advancing northward, a stark reminder of the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions significantly. Noting that desertification and land degradation are rapidly expanding in Africa, Louise Baker, managing director of the Global Mechanism of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, urged for maintaining the balance between shrinking natural resources and increasing human demands.

At the same time, international financial institutions and Western donors should recognize and complement these efforts, rather than compete or isolate. There is an urgent need to move from fragmented initiatives to coordinated and synergistic action — where Chinese, Western and multilateral actors work together to close the global energy access gap and support climate justice.China's capabilities in renewable energy — its innovation, industrial scale and capital — can be transformative for the Global South. The future of global energy security depends not just on reducing carbon emissions, but on building systems that are resilient, inclusive and shared. In this, China has both the tools — and the responsibility — to lead.

Rekindling the Bandung Spirit [1]
  Instance 1: The AfCFTA, launched in 2021, embodies Bandung's vision of intra-regional economic solidarity, aiming to uplift people on the continent through reduced trade barriers and shared prosperity.Climate change, economic inequality and global health crises represent existential threats to the Global South that demand collective action and solidarity. Developing nations, despite contributing least to global carbon emissions, are bearing the brunt of climate-related disasters. The Bandung principle of mutual benefit calls for greater collaboration among developing countries to demand climate justice, increase green technology transfer and push for more ambitious emissions reductions from industrialized nations.The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of global solidarity, as hoarding of vaccines by wealthy nations undermined global recovery efforts. However, initiatives such as India and South Africa's campaign for a temporary World Trade Organization waiver on COVID-19 vaccine patents, though initially resisted by Western nations, reflect the Bandung-era ethos of collective bargaining and moral persuasion.The Global South's response to these challenges will determine whether the Bandung Spirit remains a historical relic or a living political philosophy. To harness this spirit effectively, developing nations must invest in institutional capacity-building, strengthen regional cooperation and leverage their collective economic and political weight to challenge inequities in global governance.

Roundup: Global energy forum CERAWeek kicks off over uncertainties on market, policy, transition [1]
  Instance 1: Simonelli noted that the recent decline in oil prices could prompt producers to scale back drilling efforts, adding that while large producers have not yet signaled changes to their capital spending plans, smaller firms are likely to respond more quickly to price fluctuations. Some oil giants, including Chevron, have already announced workforce layoff. Hours after the forum began, more than 100 protesters marched through downtown Houston and rallied outside the CERAWeek venue, denouncing oil and gas companies and demanding climate justice. Witnesses said several demonstrators were detained by the police. "From the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast and beyond, we're uniting to confront S&amp;P Global's oil and gas conference, CERAWeek," Future Generations, one of the organizers, announced on its website, calling for "an end to the burning of fossil fuels for the sake of short-term profits" to ease the world's climate crisis.
After America: Redefining global leadership in an age of collapse [1]
  Instance 1: Or has it long functioned as a mechanism to prolong dominance beneath the language of universality?We often associate sustainability with clean energy, green tech, and ESG investing. But true sustainability demands more than surface solutions: It requires structural change. The world cannot achieve ecological balance while its economic logic still rewards fossil fuel dependency, large-scale mining and supply chains that externalize harm.There will be no climate justice as long as financial systems continue to incentivize extractive growth. And there can be no real sustainability if it remains a corporate slogan rather than a core principle of global governance.America’s dominance normalized inequality. Countries deep in debt were pressured to cut social protections to meet loan conditions.
HK marks International Women's Day with improvements, but more work lies ahead [1]
  Instance 1: This is usually attributed to the extremely low smoking rates among women.The UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was extended to Hong Kong in 1996. In the same year, the Sex Discrimination Ordinance came into force in Hong Kong, prohibiting discrimination against men or women based on sex, marital status, and pregnancy in employment, education, and the provision of goods, services, and facilities, as well as prohibiting sexual harassment of either men or women.And today, the latest Global Women Peace and Security Index, measuring schooling, employment, finances, cellphone use, justice, violence, maternal mortality, and community safety in 177 countries and regions, ranked Hong Kong 39th — virtually the same as the United States at 37th. Singapore ranked 15th and the United Kingdom 26th.Ahead of International Women's Day on Saturday, March 8, this year, the "Women's Rights in Review 30 years after Beijing" report to the UN secretary-general shows worldwide improvements in laws, education, and maternal mortality, but there are continuing discrepancies in politics, poverty, unpaid and domestic work, labor force participation, violence against women, climate justice, and health. Globally, only 1 in 4 seats in politics is held by a woman. Women are 25 percent more likely to live in poverty.

  Instance 3: dollars over two years in expanding grid access in rural Burundi and a 4.5 billion dollars commitment to boost renewable energy. Moussa Faki Mahamat, the chairperson of the African Union Commission, said he will push to make climate change Africa's theme of 2025/2026, be institutionalized and the summit be held every two years. He added that with the Nairobi spirit, Africa will in no way lose momentum to push for climate justice, concrete climate action, and the need for adaptation and transition.

UN chief calls for making 2025 "new beginning" in New Year message [1]
  Instance 1: Inequalities and divisions are rife -- fueling tensions and mistrust," Guterres said.He said that the globe has just endured a decade of deadly heat and the top ten 10 hottest years on record have happened in the last 10 years, including 2024."This is climate breakdown -- in real time," Guterres stressed. "We must exit this road to ruin -- and we have no time to lose."The UN chief urged countries to put the world on a safer path by dramatically slashing emissions, and supporting the transition to a renewable future. "It is essential and it is possible," he added."Even in the darkest days, I've seen hope power change," Guterres said, hailing the activists raising their voices for progress, as well as the humanitarian heroes overcoming enormous obstacles to support the most vulnerable people.The UN chief said he also sees hope in developing countries fighting for financial and climate justice.He underscored that the Pact for the Future, adopted in September, "is a new push" to build peace through disarmament and prevention, reform the global financial system, and stick to the values and principles enshrined by human rights, international law and the United Nations Charter."There are no guarantees for what's ahead in 2025. But I pledge to stand with all those who are working to forge a more peaceful, equal, stable and healthy future for all people," Guterres said."Together, we can make 2025 a new beginning," the UN chief said. "Not as a world divided.

Guiltless scorching sky: Balochistan’s unjust climate burden [1]
  Instance 1: The top 10 emitting countries, led by China and the US, account for over 60% of annual greenhouse gases, while Pakistan’s share hovers below 0.8%. Yet, Balochistan’s climate vulnerability rivals that of small island states facing existential threats from rising seas.The province’s carbon neutrality, its people emit almost nothing, offers no shield against a warming planet. This mismatch demands a rethink of climate justice, where responsibility aligns with impact, not just emissions.Sign up for one of our free newslettersPakistan must also look inward. While it can not control global emissions, it can bolster Balochistan’s resilience. The government’s climate rhetoric, think “climate-smart policies” and glacier strategies, needs teeth.Redirecting funds to water harvesting, solar-powered irrigation and reforestation could blunt the edge of drought and heat.
China to align development initiatives with Nigeria's Renewed Hope Agenda: FM [1]
  Instance 1: He called on Nigeria to safeguard the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and personnel operating in the country. China appreciates Nigeria's support for its three major global initiatives, namely the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative, Wang said, adding that China supports Nigeria in playing a greater role in international and regional affairs, uniting regional countries, and maintaining regional stability. He reiterated China's steadfast support for Africa in voicing demands for climate justice at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, saying China is ready to strengthen coordination with Nigeria and other African countries on climate change issues to safeguard the development interests of the Global South. For his part, Tuggar said Nigeria and China have deep historical ties, rooted in mutual respect and trust, which have produced substantial achievements. Nigeria and China share no differences and strengthening their cooperation conforms to their mutual interests, he said.

I harbour no desire to see the developed world continue to grow at the expense of countries like mine. Carbon emissions must be drastically reduced.
  Instance 4: Climate activists must envision a future where countries in the South actively contribute to the solution, rather than being passive recipients. The underdeveloped yet resourceful markets of the South could easily be integrated into the renewable revolution by becoming part of its supply chains - uplifting their populations out of poverty and vulnerability, while maintaining profits for developed economies. If the South's demand for climate justice is justified, so is the developed world's need for growth and security - both consider these elements crucial for their survival. Climate activists must remember that though the poor may contribute meaningfully to the fight against climate change, it is the developed world that must eventually take the lead. Therefore, above all else, COP28 must prioritise the crafting of a win-win situation for all, including the rich.

He said that Africa's resilience to the climate crisis that has devastated economies, livelihoods and ecosystems will be hinged on tapping into youth-pioneered advocacy for carbon-free production and consumption systems coupled with enhanced protection of the continent's natural assets. Mwenda noted that African youth face a bleak future unless governments and funders took proactive measures to arrest runaway carbon emissions that were to blame for recurrent droughts, cyclones and emergence of lethal pathogens.
  Instance 4: Mwenda noted that African youth face a bleak future unless governments and funders took proactive measures to arrest runaway carbon emissions that were to blame for recurrent droughts, cyclones and emergence of lethal pathogens. "The climate crisis is impacting agriculture, livelihoods and slowing down implementation of Africa's Agenda 2063 on growth and transformation," he said. "We, therefore, require the youth to offer viable solutions." More than 700 African youth have participated in the Nairobi Summer School for Climate Justice since its inception in 2020. The program blends training, capacity-building, mentorship and field visits to prepare them for a role in advocating for a carbon-neutral future for the continent. PACJA Head of Policy, Advocacy and Communication Philip Kilonzo said the summer school has inspired African youth to raise awareness of the plight of grassroots communities bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.

Despite Pakistan's minimal contributions to global emissions, the country remains susceptible to climate change. Climate justice is an alien concept to us. I harbour no desire to see the developed world continue to grow at the expense of countries like mine. Carbon emissions must be drastically reduced.
  Instance 4: Climate activists must envision a future where countries in the South actively contribute to the solution, rather than being passive recipients. The underdeveloped yet resourceful markets of the South could easily be integrated into the renewable revolution by becoming part of its supply chains. If the South's demand for climate justice is justified, so is the developed world's need for growth and security - both consider these elements crucial for their survival. Climate activists must remember that though the poor may contribute meaningfully to the fight against climate change, it is the developed world that must eventually take the lead. Therefore, above all else, COP28 must prioritise the crafting of a win-win situation for all, including the rich.
Animal welfare body advocates reviving traditional food systems amid Africa's hunger crisis [1]
  Instance 1: This year's World Food Day will be marked on Wednesday under the theme "Rights to Foods for a Better Life and a Better Future," highlighting the importance of diversity, nutritional value, and affordability of staple food consumed globally. In Africa where nearly 20 percent of the population is undernourished, a restoration of indigenous crops and animal husbandry will boost the continent's food and nutritional security as well as benefit human and ecological health, Kahiu said. According to Kahiu, governments across Africa should align the quest for climate justice with food systems transformation to enhance the resilience of small-holder farmers. She called for channeling climate finance to the continent's small-holder farmers in a bid to improve their capacity to produce indigenous food in a manner that is in harmony with nature.

A new climate of change or just hot air' [2]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6GDK-G1G3-RYBT-1303-00000-00A new climate of change or just hot air'2025-08-04T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:19:11ZLexisNexisFRONT PAGE OPINIONA new climate of change or just hot air'David Fogarty, A new climate of change or just hot air'On July 23, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) turned the world of climate diplomacy and climate justice upside down. In a 133-page advisory opinion, the ICJ made clear that all states -- and the companies they regulate -- have a legal obligation to prevent harms caused by climate change. That means major polluting nations and companies are on the hook for the climate and environmental harms their fossil fuel emissions are causing globally.
  Instance 2: The court's 15 judges made clear that states' climate plans, called nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, must be of the highest ambition and aimed to limit warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, a key limit backed by scientific research. Many nations have yet to submit their updated climate plans to the UN this year and the ICJ opinion could lead some governments to rethink, and possibly strengthen, them ahead of COP30. "The ICJ ruling reflects the demand for climate justice. The 1.5 deg C temperature threshold is a legal obligation, and the fossil fuel industry and particularly petrostates cannot continue to argue that staying within 1.5 deg C is optional," said Ms Vesga Correa. Intense interestWhat makes this ICJ opinion a bit different is the sheer level of interest and support from nations.
ICJ advisory opinion on global climate action is a game changer [2]
  Instance 1: It is the first time the ICJ has addressed states' obligations regarding climate change under existing laws. It has come as the impacts of global warming -- from extreme floods and storms, to wildfires and rising sea levels -- are worsening and affecting the poorest and most vulnerable nations the most. Ripple effects"The ruling by the ICJ is a watershed moment in the fight for climate justice and will likely have ripple effects in courtrooms, boardrooms, legislative halls and international negotiations around the world," said Ms Erika Lennon, senior attorney for the Centre for International Environmental Law. "The powerful advisory opinion made clear that all states have a legal duty under multiple sources of international law to protect the climate and preserve our collective future," she told The Straits Times. In a unanimous opinion, the court's 15 judges emphasised that longstanding duties to prevent environmental harm, which include preventing climate damage and protecting human rights, mean that states must take action to address the drivers of climate change.
  Instance 2: "The opinion could also shape judicial understandings of climate change, particularly in jurisdictions where international law and norms can influence domestic 'standards of care' in the context of assessing state and non-state actor responsibility to address climate change," she told ST. And for Asia? The opinion gives solid legal ground for vulnerable communities to bring claims not only against states for climate inaction but also against corporations that seek to expand fossil fuel extraction and subsidies, on human rights grounds for irreversible climate harm -- as Ms Nicole Ponce, an environmental and human rights lawyer-advocate from the Philippines with the World's Youth for Climate Justice campaign group, told ST. Observers said that for now, governments, companies and lawyers will be closely studying the 133-page opinion for next steps. Vanuatuan minister Regenvanu, a key figure in bringing the case before the ICJ, said one quick result could be the strengthening of national climate plans ahead of the UN's upcoming COP30 climate conference in Brazil in November.
ICJ's climate ruling may spur scrutiny of S'pore carbon tax, action plans of companies [1]
  Instance 1: The sovereignty of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean had been disputed by Britain and Mauritius, a former British colony. The court found that Britain's claims on the islands were wrongful, preventing Mauritius from being fully independent. This prompted Britain to enter into negotiations with Mauritius, leading to an agreement in May 2025, when Britain signed a deal to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, said the Singapore front of the World's Youth for Climate Justice (WYCJ). Associate Professor Jolene Lin, director of the NUS Asia-Pacific Centre for Environmental Law, told ST: "The power of this opinion is that it gives a lot more legal foundation... to (argue) that states owe an obligation to cut emissions, even if they have withdrawn from the Paris Agreement." What impact could the advisory opinion have  for Singapore'Singapore's contribution to global emissions is small, at about 0.11 per cent.
Beijing accused of blocking Filipino film on South China Sea [1]
  Instance 1: In a letter to festival organisers before the screening, which was later posted online, the Chinese Consulate-General called the film "rife with disinformation and false propaganda", and urged the organisers to refrain from screening it, saying it would "mislead" the public and harm China-New Zealand relations. Doc Edge rejected the request, affirming its commitment to "independence and curatorial freedom". Food Delivery won the Tides of Change award, which the festival grants to films that highlight global issues, such as conflict, human rights and climate justice. The Straits Times has reached out to the Chinese government for comment. The controversy only drew more attention to Food Delivery, which offers rarely seen civilian and military perspectives from the Spratly Islands, a region in the disputed sea claimed by the Philippines, China, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan.
ASEAN vs GCC: Why one embraces China, the other hesitates [1]
  Instance 1: Unlike ASEAN, which is widely recognised as part of the global south due to its postcolonial legacy, developmental status, and active role in south-south cooperation, the GCC countries occupy a more complex position. In classifications by the United Nations, Human Development Reports and the World Bank, they are often listed as “high-income developing countries” or “non-OECD high-income countries”, reflecting a hybrid or peripheral global south identity. From a strategic and diplomatic standpoint, however, the GCC states frequently advocate for south-south cooperation and align themselves with developing countries on key issues such as climate justice, decolonisation, and global governance reform. For instance, the UAE has positioned itself as a strategic partner of the global south through BRICS engagements and climate-related efforts, including the establishment of the “loss and damage” fund at COP-28. Qatar has launched public health and education initiatives specifically targeting developing nations, with officials explicitly aligning these programs with “the priorities of the global south”.
UN expert says S'pore can do more to cut emissions, protect nature and safeguard human rights [1]
  Instance 1: all of these assessments incorporate climate and human rights perspectives." The UN expert also urged the Singapore Government to be more inclusive in engaging the public on environment matters, even as she noted that such consultations have increased over the last decade. "I received information that people, including youth, have been excluded from participation in certain processes due to what might be seen as diverging opinions," she said in a 10-page statement, without giving specific examples. "It is important that the Government continues its effort to increase participation to receive feedback and explain its decisions while keeping spaces for dialogue open." Following her visit, Ms Puentes Riano will work on a full report with a more detailed and comprehensive analysis of her visit, including recommendations on how to improve the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment in Singapore, and this will be presented to the UN in March 2026.Ms Puentes Riano, an environmental and climate justice lawyer based in Mexico, was invited by the Singapore Government. This is the first visit to Singapore in a decade by a UN human rights expert. In 2016, Ms Rosa Kornfeld-Matte -- then UN independent expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons -- visited Singapore on a similar mission, but focused on the ageing population.
Thousands rally in Glasgow to call for climate justice [5]

They gathered near the COP26 climate summit venue, marching from Kelvingrove Park to the Glasgow City Centre about 4km away to the sound of beating drums. They carried signs that urged world leaders to respect the rights of indigenous communities and consider how climate change was impacting the most marginalised of groups, from refugees to women and those facing persecution from governments back home.
  Instance 2: Organisers estimate that more than two million took part in the protests worldwide. "Climate refugees welcome," read some signs in Glasgow, while others toted placards that highlighted how class could impact a group's ability to deal with climate change. Ms Pauline Lancon, 30, a protester from France who was at the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, told The Sunday Times that women in many parts of the world are negatively impacted by climate change. "They are the ones taking care of their families, they are the ones producing the food, so they're really at the centre of the climate crisis and should be part of the solution," said Ms Lancon, who is a member of the Women and Gender Constituency - a coalition of groups that ensure gender equality and women's human rights are central to climate negotiations. The protest was organised by the Britain-based COP26 Coalition, a group that comprises faith, youth, environment and development non-government groups, trade unions, grassroots community campaigns, as well as migrant and racial justice networks.
  Instance 3: The protest was organised by the Britain-based COP26 Coalition, a group that comprises faith, youth, environment and development non-government groups, trade unions, grassroots community campaigns, as well as migrant and racial justice networks. Different communities experience climate impacts differently, with some bearing the brunt of the planetary crisis more than others. The call for climate justice is a call for climate policies to involve these communities in decision-making so that their rights are respected. Ms Pema Doma, 27, the granddaughter of Tibetan nomads, was at the protest to call for her community to be more included in climate policy. "In the past several decades, over a million Tibetan nomads have been resettled from the plateau and forced to live in urbanised areas, forced to change their way of life that they've had for thousands of years," she said.

S'pore submits statement to ICJ on protecting people from climate change [1]
  Instance 1: The final legal issue to be addressed in the ICJ's ruling involved the protection of future generations. "An advisory opinion is basically an interpretation of the existing law, and for that it can strengthen already existing laws on climate change and human rights, I would say especially the Paris Agreement," lawyer Elisa Granzotto, who specialises in environmental law, told The Straits Times. Ms Granzotto is a member of the World's Youth for Climate Justice, a global youth-led organisation that started the movement to obtain an advisory opinion from the ICJ. She added that, in time, the legal opinion of the World Court could also influence regional or national climate-related court cases, or even be implemented as law in certain countries. This development comes as climate-related lawsuits have more than doubled in the past five years.

  Instance 2: But one day, it might become a daily reality for the rest of us."  Pacific Islands such as Kiribati have a far smaller carbon footprint than the world's biggest countries and polluters. Yet, they will disproportionately bear the brunt of that pollution, a point tactfully made by Mr Tong as he travels the world speaking to world leaders and the United Nations. "It was important for me to move the debate from climate change to climate justice," says Rytz. "Yes, we can try to slow down emissions globally, but we've already passed a tipping point and places like Kiribati are doomed. Even now when there is much less oil being burned because of the Covid-19 crisis, it's not stopping the ice from melting.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the pledge as one of India's five commitments, which included a promise to secure half of the country's energy needs from renewable resources by 2030.India also plans to reduce its total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by the same year. China, Saudi Arabia and Russia have announced plans to attain their net-zero targets by 2060, while the United States and the European Union aim to hit theirs a decade earlier.
  Instance 2: Given this context, Mr Siddharth Singh, an independent climate policy and energy analyst, called the announcement a "very big and welcome piece of news". "This will help India plan for the interim five years and 10 years much better because when you have a long-term target, it just helps bring together the short-term policies in place more effectively," he told The Straits Times. Dr Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think-tank, described India's aims for 2070 as a bold statement that is "equitable and consistent with climate justice". "Yet, it is far more aggressive than developed countries because it is going to be a much faster transition from peaking of emissions to net zero," he told ST on the phone from Glasgow, where he is attending the COP26 meet.India's emissions are expected to peak around 2045 - 25 years before its net-zero target. In contrast, countries such as the US and Britain, as well as the EU, have had a long runway between the peak of their emissions and their net-zero goals.
Singapore: Asia-Pacific's renewable energy hub' [1]
  Instance 1: Singapore has made strategic moves towards this end, with GIC, its sovereign wealth fund, pumping capital into companies specialising in green hydrogen.While the government is watching developments in green hydrogen closely, this is not to say that Singapore is putting all its eggs in one basket, or that green hydrogen is without sceptics. Scholars have, for example, scrutinised the buzz around green hydrogen and raised queries around technical and commercial ambiguities. There are also question marks surrounding the fact that oil majors are among the biggest cheerleaders of green hydrogen, raising issues of climate justice and inequality.The government is hedging across several sectors, and is likely working along the lines of the EMA report which mapped out several paths to net zero, depending on the geopolitical context and technological developments.The fulfilment of Singapore's renewable energy hub aspirations certainly hinges on all such factors, and the final outcome will stem from a mixture of vision, flexibility and luck.

Surging US oil production brings down prices, raises climate fears [1]
  Instance 1: The wells that were drilled last year are now in full swing.With the surge in output, gasoline prices have fallen by close to US$2 a gallon since summer 2022 and are back to levels that prevailed in 2021. The increase in production has also provided the Biden administration with substantial leverage in its dealings with oil-exporting foes such as Russia, Venezuela and Iran while reducing its need to cajole more friendly countries such as Saudi Arabia to temper prices.But the comeback in US oil production poses big risks, too. More supply and lower prices could increase demand for fossil fuels when world leaders, who are meeting in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, are straining to reach agreements that would accelerate the fight against climate change.Scientists generally agree that the world is far from achieving the goals necessary to avoid the catastrophic effects of global warming, which is caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal."We're achieving energy security and reducing inflation by leveraging high-emitting, carbon-intensive oil production," said Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University. "We're going to need to address that conflict."The United States now exports roughly 4 million barrels a day, more than any Opec member except Saudi Arabia. On balance, the United States still imports more than it exports because domestic demand exceeds supply and many American refineries can more easily refine the heavier oil produced in Canada and Latin America than the lighter crude that oozes out of the shale fields of New Mexico, North Dakota and Texas.Nearly every extra barrel of American crude produced is being exported, mostly to Europe and Asia, where supplies are tight.
See you in court: Training equips Asian judges for climate litigation [1]
  Instance 1: Cases will also need to consider how to incorporate the latest climate science. "Given that the judiciary will play an increasingly important role in climate-related justice issues, it is essential that members of the judiciary understand the scientific basis on what we know about human-caused climate change," said Associate Professor Winston Chow from Singapore Management University, who spoke at the course. "A better-informed and well-educated judiciary about the basis of climate science and climate change would be more confident in assessing cases related to climate justice, such as those in which local communities affected by climate-driven impacts seek recourse from the judiciary. "If vulnerable communities understand that judiciaries know the basis of climate science and understand their rights, I'm quite certain it also gives these communities stronger support towards actions limiting the worst excesses of climate change," said Prof Chow, who was recently elected as a co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations' top climate science body. Justice Bambang Hery Mulyono, chief of the Supreme Court of Indonesia's Judicial Research and Education Agency, and a speaker at the course, said judges have a critical role in protecting and preserving the environment.

The issue of loss and damage -- whereby those nations impacted most by the effects of climate change (that is, the Global South) are compensated by those historically responsible for its amplification (the Global North) -- has long been a sticking point at annual COP negotiations. Rich nations have traditionally pushed back against the matter to avoid debates around climate change blame and liability, but the tide appears to be turning.
  Instance 2: There appears to be good reason for developing nations to force this issue -- developed nations' pledge to provide a baseline of US$100 billion of climate finance annually by 2020 to assist decarbonisation efforts has still not been met, with the funding gap caused by richer nations' failure to act expected to be closed only next year or in 2024. What a just transition means for investorsFor the conference to be a success, it is key that COP27 delivers meaningful progress on loss and damage. As climate disasters such as Pakistan's catastrophic flooding wreak havoc, we believe developing nations are right to demand reparations and climate justice. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) this year highlighted the importance of accelerating progress towards a just transition, stating that sustainable development is concurrently able to enhance social inclusion. The private sector can play a large role in financing a just transition and climate adaptation in communities that need it.
  Instance 3: If fossil fuels are to be leapfrogged in favour of low-carbon alternatives, developed nations need to provide adequate support. Here, as with loss and damage, there is much for the Global North and private sector investors to do.

Over 1,400 attend SG Climate Rally highlighting pervasive impact of climate change [1]
  Instance 1: Mr Syazwan, who runs the social platform Wan's Ubin Journal, spoke about emphasising the importance of including indigenous voices and history in policy planning and education of climate change. Drawing on his experience of learning his heritage as a descendant of the Ubin Orang Pulau from his mother, Mr Syazwan said: "The Orang Pulau were champions of sustainability. They understood what nature provided for them and the symbiotic relationship between humans and nature." Rally organiser Kristian-Marc James Paul said that advocating for climate justice means being aware that climate change and the ways we tackle this issue is "fundamentally related" to other bread-and-butter issues. Besides speeches, environmental groups such as Students for a Fossil Free Future and the People's Movement to Stop Haze (PM.Haze), as well as civil society groups, such as Migrant Mutual Aid and Workers Make Possible, set up community booths to raise awareness about their causes. One activity available at the booths allowed participants to write postcards to MPs about the various concerns and suggestions that they had about climate change.
Geopolitical tug of war an opportunity for Pacific Island nations [1]
  Instance 1: Infrastructure financing, until recently the niche for China and Japan, has become the flavour of the day. Pacific Island countries are leaders in the global fight against climate change. They have been pushing the global agenda on the ocean and climate change connection, and on climate justice. Spiralling debt problem According to the Lowy Aid Map, aid to the Pacific was up 47% during the Covid-19 crisis. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) had tripled its aid and became the biggest and Australia the second biggest development partner.
Cover Story: The world calls time on fossil fuel [1]
  Instance 1: "The applause that we just saw for Aosis is a clarion call to all of us about our obligation and responsibility over these next months to ensure we're reaching as far as we can to implement as fast as we can."Kerry, the former US secretary of state under President Barack Obama, commends the work of negotiators. "While all of us can find a paragraph, sentences or sections where we would have said it differently, where we would have liked it not to appear, we would have liked something else to appear; but in a multilateral venue, to have as strong a document as has been put together, I find is cause for optimism, cause for gratitude and cause for some significant congratulations to everybody here."Tom Evans, policy adviser at global climate change think-tank E3G, says "not everyone is ready to admit the truth of what's needed to avert climate disaster".He adds: "Champions for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels - both small island states and major economies - have pushed the rest of the world to realise this transition cannot be stopped. But this is only a small first step   The COP text shows the hard work that lies ahead: rewiring the financial system, driving action to vastly scale up renewables and energy efficiency and crucially paying much more attention to adaptation, which has been neglected, putting all of us at risk."Teresa Anderson, global lead on climate justice at international non-governmental organisation ActionAid, says COP28 shows that "while the world's appetite for climate action has moved significantly forward, its willingness to pay lags behind"."The goal to move to a fossil-free future does not yet have the finance components needed to make this goal workable for lower-income countries," says Anderson in a Dec 13 post on X, the social media network formerly known as Twitter. "If rich countries had been willing to put real finance and fair timelines on the table, the outcome could have been much stronger."COP28's many painsThis year's summit faced mounting challenges, chief among them scepticism about whether summit president Al-Jaber would broker the talks fairly. Al-Jaber's role as the head of the state oil company Abu Dhabi National Oil Company was already cause for concern, but he faced further controversy days before the summit began.
How will paying for climate destruction work exactly' [4]
  Instance 1: Africa, which has 17 per cent of the world's population, accounts for less than 4 per cent of current global emissions. Understandably, poor countries believe, as Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados pointed out at Sharm El-Sheikh, that they have "a moral and just cause". Climate justiceAt its core, loss and damage is about climate justice. This concept has been barely acknowledged in the climate debate, with scant mention. The iconic 2015 Paris Agreement mentions the word "justice" only once in the preamble: "The Parties to this agreement...
  Instance 2: This concept has been barely acknowledged in the climate debate, with scant mention. The iconic 2015 Paris Agreement mentions the word "justice" only once in the preamble: "The Parties to this agreement... noting the importance for some of the concept of 'climate justice'..." (my emphasis in italics) -- making clear that justice does not have universal support. But there is a budding change of heart. At the 2021 Glasgow summit, host Scotland committed US$2.2 million to loss and damage -- a drop in the bucket, but symbolically important as the first actual commitment of funds.
  Instance 3: The abundance of ideas is promising but the devil will be in the details. The good news from COP27 is that there is, at last, some support for the idea of loss and damage funding, but we are still many steps away from creating an effective mechanism for this.

Climate conferences won't save us: Building your own climate solution (Part 2) [1]
  Instance 1: It depends on what is driving the costs, but unless the problem is the technology (too early = unreliable or too expensive), there is often a way around it. If it's the cost-per-unit, can you work with customers to produce in volumes they can afford or find like-minded businesses to join their adoption journey to reduce costs for all? Also Read:How the 'Paris agreement' for plastic is accelerating climate justice in SEA[4] If it's a CAPEX issue, could switching to a subscription model, getting a supplier with friendlier payment terms, or finding a financial partner that enables instalments/payment plans to help make this more affordable to adopt? Convenience Modern life has been optimised for making everything ready to use, always available, and easy to dispose of; it's incredibly wasteful but straightforward, so more environmentally friendly options (e.g. reuse/refill models instead of single-use) can feel like too much effort by comparison.
UN report spells out feasible ways to defuse climate 'time bomb' [1]
  Instance 1: It is a survival guide for humanity," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said  at the release of the report in Switzerland. The report, approved during a week-long session in Interlaken, brings into "sharp focus" the losses and damage that humanity is already experiencing, hitting the most vulnerable people and ecosystems especially hard. "Climate justice is crucial because those who have contributed least to climate change are being disproportionately affected," said Dr Aditi Mukherji, one of the 93 authors of the Synthesis Report. "Almost half of the world's population live in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change. In the last decade, deaths from floods, droughts and storms were 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions," she added.
Panel shines spotlight on inclusivity and care [1]
  Instance 1: Sometimes there's this slippage between inclusion and bothsidesism. I've heard a lot of corporate diversity and inclusion leaders say... 'I don't see gender, I don't see race.' That's also not really it." On the topic of care, Paul, who is a member of climate justice collective SG Climate Rally, says: "A system that tries to extract as much from you as possible is not a caring system. "And so then, the converse becomes more evident. 'Revolutionary care' to me is about centring justice, doing the work of social justice, believing everyone deserves a decent wage to live a full life, it means being anti-racist, anti-homophobic, anti-patriarchal, anti-ableist." Over at the Asian Civilisations Museum, the panel Decolonise Your-s(h)elf brought together three Asian writers -- Muna Gurung from Nepal, Nguyen An Ly from Vietnam and Criselda Yabes from the Phillippines.
Enough of the carrots, it's time for the sticks [1]
  Instance 1: Rather than extracting materials and disposing of used products, companies need to move towards a regenerative model and supporting natural processes. Product companies need to rethink innovative ways to incorporate materials that are upcycled and renewable, which in turn encourage best practices across the supply chains. Climate justice: Rethinking our economy to redistribute valueWhile several major corporations are starting to pledge to achieve net-zero operations by the end of 2030, many are also looking at carbon credits to offset their greenhouse gas emissions to reduce their tax liabilities. Despite the recent controversy around carbon credits, ensuring greater transparency on carbon offset projects and the benefit on indigenous and local communities can help to redirect financing to areas where real impact can be made.Higher taxes and stricter regulations may be needed for companies to reduce emissions, and minimise the extent to which companies can propagate vague net-zero pledges, as these may be misleading and could amount to greenwashing. Economists now need to consider how to redesign the flow of economic value to redistribute it for the sustainability of the environment and the community.
Choice of oil boss to lead UN climate talks draws mixed reactions [1]
  Instance 1: "This appointment risks further undermining the credibility of global climate talks," he added. ActionAid said fossil fuel interests had captured the UN climate talks process. "The UN Climate Summit is supposed to be a space where the world holds polluters to account," said Ms Teresa Anderson, global lead of climate justice at ActionAid, in a statement. "Like last year's summit, we're increasingly seeing fossil fuel interests taking control of the process and shaping it to meet their own needs," she added. Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, the UAE's minister of industry and technology, will help shape the agenda of COP28.STRAIT-JJ1A4P0STRAIT2023urn:contentItem:679P-WBF1-JCF2-82H6-00000-001449652023-01-13Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.
Australian PM slammed for backing gas, oil projects despite green pledge [1]
  Instance 1: "The Albanese government needs to stop approving new fossil fuel projects and deliver on its promise of Australia as a renewable energy superpower." Analysts also rejected the government's claims that new gas projects would help to address domestic shortfalls, noting that Australia produces plentiful supplies of gas but has locked in large volumes for sale to foreign buyers. Australia has one of the highest rates of carbon emissions per capita in the world, and is also a major exporter of coal, oil and gas. Professor Jeremy Moss, a climate justice expert from the University of New South Wales, criticised the government's strong subsidies for the resources export sector, saying that this support meant Australia shared the responsibility for emissions that stem from its export of fossil fuels. "Australia is not responsible for all the emissions produced by exported fossil fuels - after all, other countries consume them," he wrote on The Conversation website. "Still, Australia must take a high degree of responsibility given the billions of dollars in subsidies and environmental approvals that allow the industry to exist." But Mr Albanese, who is riding a wave of public popularity and attempting to dominate the political centre in Australia, has made it clear that his push for climate action will not extend to ending the growth of the lucrative resources sector.
COP27: A LONG, LONG NIGHT [1]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:66XD-DH61-DYX4-0160-00000-00COP27: A LONG, LONG NIGHT2022-11-22T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:19:11ZLexisNexisWORLDCOP27: A LONG, LONG NIGHT, COP27: A LONG, LONG NIGHTSHARM EL-SHEIKH  This year's UN climate summit featured visits by world leaders, proposals by business leaders, and negotiations by nearly 200 nations about the future of global action on climate change. Here are some of the key takeaways from the two-week COP27 summit held in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh: Fund for 'climate justice'After years of resistance from rich governments, nations for the first time agreed to set up a fund to provide payouts to developing countries that suffer "loss and damage" from climate-driven storms, floods, droughts and wildfires. Despite being the standout success of the talks, it will likely take several years to hammer out the details over how the fund will be run, including how the money will be disbursed and which countries are likely to be eligible. Fossil fuel flowThe final COP27 deal drew criticism from some quarters for not doing more to rein in climate-damaging emissions, both by setting more ambitious national targets and by scaling back use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.
Heatwaves, then floods ruin Pakistani farmers' livelihoods [1]
  Instance 1: Between six million and nine million Pakistanis are set to be dragged into poverty as a result of this year's cataclysmic monsoon flooding that has sent food prices soaring and is estimated to cost at least US$30 billion (S$42.64 billion) in loss and damage, according to government estimates. Even before the deluge, Pakistan's economy was struggling, with soaring inflation, a plunging rupee and dwindling foreign exchange reserves. Calls are growing from the government and activists for richer and more industrialised nations  to offer debt relief to Pakistan as a form of climate justice. Demands for the largest emitters to take financial responsibility for the climate chaos impacting poorer nations is set to dominate a United Nations summit in November. Pakistan, the world's fifth-most populous country, is on the front line of climate change, despite being responsible for just 0.8 per cent of global emissions.
Youth at summit demand compensation for impact of climate change [1]
  Instance 1: Mr Lavetanalagi Seru, 30, the regional policy coordinator at the Pacific Islands Climate Action Network, said that young people who survived a Category 5 typhoon in the Fijian island of Gau in 2016 are still afraid to play in the rain, and cry at any sound of thunder. The Fijian added: "We don't have adequate facilities and the necessary resources to deal with mental health on this scale. To be able to address this, we would need funding, and it would have to come from a loss and damage finance facility."

Solar power generation helped 7 Asian nations avoid $48b in potential fossil fuel costs: Report [1]
  Instance 1: The report concluded that if these countries could meet their 2030 solar capacity targets, at least US$44 billion in fuel costs could be avoided. The region's solar capacity is expected to acquire an average annual growth rate of 22 per cent a year till 2030 across China, India, Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines.

New climate Act will transform energy sector in the US [1]
  Instance 1: This is very important." Reuters quoted Mr Keith Martin, an attorney with Norton Rose Fulbright who works on financing renewable energy projects, as saying: "This is going to be a golden period of 10 years, at least. That is a long horizon for people to plan and really get this transition to clean energy into high gear." Mr Biden said at the signing ceremony in the White House on Tuesday: "With this law, the American people won, and the special interests lost." Under the IRA, electric vehicles will be cheaper both to make and to buy. It includes generous tax credits for manufacturing wind turbines and solar panels; nearly US$6 billion to reduce emissions from chemical, steel and cement plants; US$3 billion in "climate justice" grants to address health risks from pollution and climate change; more than US$20 billion for climate-smart agriculture; and US$5 billion for forest management. This comes at a time when the US has for consecutive years reeled from forest fires and storm disasters intensified by global warming. Separately, according to a new model released this week by First Street Foundation, a non-profit organisation that assesses future climate risk, more than 100 million Americans live in areas that are expected to see at least one day with a heat index of 51.6 deg C or more in the next 30 years.
COP27 seals climate deal, but lacks tough action to phase out fossil fuels [1]
  Instance 1: The deal also aims to broaden the pool of financing sources for loss and damage and encourages multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, to do more to help. "A mission 30 years in the making has been accomplished," said Mr Molwyn Joseph, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, of which Singapore is a member. Mr Yeb Sano, executive director at Greenpeace South-east Asia, told The Straits Times: "The agreement for a loss and damage fund marks a new dawn for climate justice. "This provides a glimmer of hope for the vulnerable communities in South-east Asia which are already experiencing destructive storms, massive floods, rising sea levels, forest fires, droughts." But there was deep disappointment on the final wording around fossil fuels and ambition to ramp up global action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The text maintains the same compromise language of 2021's Glasgow Climate Pact of phasing down unabated coal and phasing-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.
Conservation technology: The role of data and technology in addressing our biodiversity crisis [1]
  Instance 1: In the past few decades, researchers and practitioners have leveraged conservation technology, and tools that enhance the monitoring and protection of wildlife, including established technologies[3] like camera traps, acoustic sensors, tracking tags, and satellite imagery. At the same time, newer technologies have been increasingly explored for their potential in advancing the field; a recent study[4] led by WILDLABS identified the top three emerging innovations with promising trajectories to be Artificial intelligence (machine learning and computer vision), Environmental DNA, and networked sensors. The case for conservation technology solutions We at Mana Impact and Silverstrand Capital perceive that there is room for technology, implemented through holistically-designed interventions, to further enable conservation and restoration in the following aspects: Also Read: How the 'Paris agreement' for plastic is accelerating climate justice in SEA[5] Measurement, reporting and verification Enforcement of protected areas through better monitoring Unlocking additional capital for biodiversity conservation Technologies of interest and solutions in the market Enhancing measurement and evaluation Conservation technology such as solutions that measure and monitor biodiversity and ecosystems has received relatively little funding and attention, as compared to the environmental monitoring market (which focuses on health and pollution issues). However, a key component of any biodiversity or nature conservation project is the monitoring and evaluation of the intervention to improve the effectiveness of the project. A well-designed project involves a thorough baseline assessment of the ecosystem and biodiversity conditions in the area, measurable targets to track an improvement (or retention) in ecological integrity, and periodic evaluations to measure progress in relation to the baseline conditions and project goals.
Nature-based solutions key in tackling climate change: Expert [1]
  Instance 1: That brings us to our best state of knowledge of the world." She said putting together the just over 3,000-page Working Group 2 report was no small feat, with 270 scientists labouring over it for five years. It is the second of three that collectively make up the IPCC's sixth assessment report. Dr Roberts hopes the three reports will communicate the urgency of finding different ways to make deep cuts in emissions, and raise climate justice and equity.

For example, the health of those living near coal plants would be affected by pollution, she said. "Energy is a necessity for everyone, and the climate justice we demand is a fast and just recovery towards 100 per cent community-led renewable energy for all," she said. "This means no new fossil fuel projects, and consulting the communities on their needs." &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; Renewable energy can also provide more energy security for communities.

The beginning of the decentralised office — are you ready for a remote working future? [1]
  Instance 1: To be able to work remotely cuts back four full hours from my workday and relieves me from the violence and terror that a tedious commute system entails. With remote working, not only am I able to perform better, but conversely, the companies I work for get to maximise my time and energy better, rendering a mutually beneficial partnership between employer and employee.Environmental impact of remote workOf all the things modern society has to contend with, the one thing we cannot deny is the impact of carbon emissions to our climate. With climate justice taking on an increasingly important role in how we shape society, it is important to recalibrate how we operate in our daily lives to mitigate the effects of climate change. A recent report from the Carbon Trust found that greater adoption of home working could save around 3 million tons of carbon emissions in the UK alone[1]. Because of our growing knowledge on the impact we have towards the natural environment, it is likely that organisations big and small will continue to push for remote working as a means to reduce our carbon footprint.
Paris agreement: Game-changer or epic failure' [5]
  Instance 1: But some others have labelled it a total hogwash and "epic failure". What are they really concerned about? It boils down to two words: climate justice. This is a concept that views climate change as an ethical and political issue involving equality, human rights, collective rights and historical responsibility. The grassroots movement began in 2000, when the first Climate Justice Summit took place in the Netherlands alongside the UN climate change talks.

This is a concept that views climate change as an ethical and political issue involving equality, human rights, collective rights and historical responsibility. The grassroots movement began in 2000, when the first Climate Justice Summit took place in the Netherlands alongside the UN climate change talks. It seeks to draw attention and give voice to those least responsible for climate change, but who bear the brunt of its impact - usually the poor, disempowered and marginalised. In 2002, a coalition of NGOs which includes Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and Third World Network, established the Bali Principles of Climate Justice that defined climate change from a human rights and environmental justice perspective.

It seeks to draw attention and give voice to those least responsible for climate change, but who bear the brunt of its impact - usually the poor, disempowered and marginalised. In 2002, a coalition of NGOs which includes Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and Third World Network, established the Bali Principles of Climate Justice that defined climate change from a human rights and environmental justice perspective. Since then, a growing army of activists, including former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, have campaigned for the voices of these people to be heard, and for developed nations to help minimise the climate impact on these communities.Under the Paris agreement, targets are not binding but countries are obliged to declare, communicate and maintain their targets. There is no "penalty" as such, but countries that do not keep their commitments will lose credibility and international standing, which may impact trade and diplomatic relations.
  Instance 4: More importantly, the Paris agreement is a big deal because it is a powerful show of global willingness to transition into a cleaner, more sustainable era. It sends a clear message - particularly to corporates - that the world has recognised climate change as a serious threat and has set out pathways to tackle it. The fact is, we are - and climate justice is - better off with the Paris agreement than without it. Rather than slamming it, a more constructive response by the international community would be to encourage the process and mobilise governments and businesses to finance the infrastructure projects needed to achieve a low-carbon, more stable world. Developing countries should view the agreement as an opportunity to embrace a path of development that leapfrogs existing inefficient and pollutive fossil fuel energy systems.
  Instance 5: Make no bones about it: Gaining consensus from 194 parties is nothing short of a miracle. Even NGOs known for their tough demands gave their cautious approval. Friends of the Earth climate justice coordinator Lucy Cadena said the agreement "marks a turning point for the balance of power" , while Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said of the agreement that "the human race has joined in a common cause". "%5BIT%5D is only one step on a long road... but it is progress.

Still, Mr Modi noted that climate change remained a "challenge" for the world.India, one of the top three carbon polluters, is already seen to be feeling the impact of climate change, with Mr Modi early this month calling the recent floods in Chennai, in which 347 people lost their lives, a result of "climate change's fast-growing impact". According to one estimate, the Chennai floods will cost the economy an estimated US$3 billion (S$4.2 billion) in losses.

"We children are not sacrificing our education and our childhood for the adults and politicians to tell us what they consider is politically possible in the society they have created," the 16-year-old told crowds gathered in Rome. "We have not taken to the streets for them to take selfies with us, and tell us that they really, really admire what we do.
Sun's rays to rival oil wells, says PM Modi [1]
  Instance 1: "The role that oil wells have today will be taken over by the sun's rays." Mr Modi was speaking on Tuesday at the inauguration of the first assembly of ISA in New Delhi. "In coming years, when the world discusses organisations set up in the 21st century for the welfare of humanity, ISA's name will be at the top. It has created a large platform to ensure climate justice," he said. The ISA, launched in 2015 by Mr Modi and then-French President Francois Hollande and headquartered in Gurugram in India, is an alliance of countries mostly located between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn that receive abundant sunshine. Attempts are on to expand this grouping to include countries outside this region.
Climate-change agreement would need follow-up to verify pledges [1]
  Instance 1: This "cap and trade" system will place a limit on emissions while also creating a market where companies can trade carbon allowances. This scheme will cover power stations, and steel, cement and other heavy power-consuming industries.India unveiled a global solar alliance of 120 countries, together with France. The idea is that climate justice would be served when public financing from the industrialised nations is mobilised to deliver clean energy in the poor countries. It is a noble concept but how it will turn out remains to be seen. In the meantime, India holds on to the view that those responsible for the present state of affairs - the industrialised countries - must pay the most to mitigate the problem of global warming.
Conservation scheme: On or not? [1]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:527H-7H21-DYX3-Y0KX-00000-00Conservation scheme: On or not?2011-02-23T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:19:11ZLexisNexisASIA - SOUTH-EAST ASIAConservation scheme: On or not?A SCHEME to save Indonesia's trees by imposing a two-year national moratorium on forest clearing has run into problems.Indonesia signed on to the moratorium last year as part of a broader UN programme to reward developing countries for keeping their forests intact.The UN plan - Redd (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) - calls for Indonesia to impose a two-year ban on new concessions to clear forests and peatlands. In return, Norway will pay Indonesia US $1 billion (S $1.3 billion).But for the moratorium to be legally binding from its Jan 1 start date, it must be backed by a presidential decree, which has not been issued yet, the Jakarta Globe reported last week. What is more, the Civil Society Organisation Common Platform, which includes the groups Greenpeace South-east Asia and the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi), says that even if enforced, the moratorium may not protect more forested areas as claimed.'Only 41 million hectares will be protected, but these are already categorised as conservation and protected areas,' Mr Teguh Surya, head of international liaison and climate justice at Walhi, said.The confusion arises because there are two versions of the draft presidential decree, one submitted by the Forestry Ministry and the other by the Redd task force, appointed by the president.The ministry's version states the moratorium should apply only to primary forests and peatlands, while the other version says secondary forests in peat areas should also be included, the Globe reported.The Redd scheme - which some palm oil and pulp and paper firms fear would hurt their expansion plans - will kick off in Central Kalimantan.But even before the scheme begins, complications have set in, with carbon brokers reportedly trying to manipulate the system by signing deals with provincial or district governments in East Kalimantan, Papua and Aceh.Mr Fitrian Ardiansyah, programme director for climate and energy at World Wildlife FundIndonesia, told the Globe: 'They say, 'Sign this. For 100,000ha for Redd, you will get US $2 per hectare.' But you're not supposed to count the hectares, you count the carbon.'Dr Dicky Simorangkir, forest programme director at The Nature Conservancy, told The Straits Times: 'People are still unsure how this works. How do you measure carbon emission?
A clash of two worlds - and a loss of faith [1]
  Instance 1: Everything came to a temporary standstill until the large knot of people had made their way through to the exit.Their demands: Real action to curb climate change, and resistance to the array of vested interests of rich countries and corporations trying to undermine efforts to curb greenhouse gases, or to profit from peddling false solutions.One banner read: 'Don't change the climate, change the system.'Different worlds overlap inside?the cavernous Bella Centre - and the mood within both is increasingly ragged and occasionally ugly.Rich countries are ranged against poor, and sub-groups guard their national - and often parochial - interests. Delegates have battled over even the smallest of terms - whether text in the treaty should say 'shall' or 'should'.Tuvalu, a tiny island nation in the Pacific which is at great risk of being submerged by rising sea levels, likened the state of play to the Titanic.'I have the feeling of dread that we are on the Titanic and sinking fast,' its chief negotiator, Mr Ian Fry, told the conference.New restrictions on entry have emerged. Yesterday, the?Metro station outside was closed to space out the crowds, forcing?participants to walk?a kilometre through the biting cold.Yet, two demonstrators still managed to skirt security, briefly seizing the podium in the main conference room and shouting 'Climate justice now!' before being whisked away by security.Outside is another?world - an array of environmental and social justice activists speaking for forest-dwelling tribes and islanders losing their homes to the sea, as well as farmers hit by water shortages and genetically modified organisms.Some have booths in the conference venue. But most gather at the?alternative Klimaforum in the city, where cynicism is energised by idealism.Earlier demonstrations were generally peaceful, but the mood outside the Bella Centre has become worse as the anger grows. Yesterday, demonstrators clashed with police and were clubbed and hit with pepper-spray.To some, that is the real world.
5-hour walkout by poorer nations [1]

Questions of politics in typhoon aftermath [1]
  Instance 1: Second, the unprecedented intensity and destruction of Haiyan has already prompted political discussion at the international level. While it may have been branded by some as "bad taste" to politicise the recent bushfires in Australia with links to climate change, in the case of this Philippines environmental disaster things couldn't be more different. On Monday, as news of the suffering to the south shocked the country, the Philippines Movement for Climate Justice mobilised a thousand people to march on the US Embassy in Manila, carrying banners that read "US Dirty Energy means Our Disaster and Our Misery".Philippine protests about the link between killer storms and climate change have not been limited to the streets. A year ago the head of the Philippines delegation to the UN Climate Summit in Doha wept while addressing the plenary. Just days before, Typhoon Bopha had made its destructive way through the Southern Philippines, leaving over a thousand people dead, tens of thousands dislocated, and livelihoods destroyed.

  Instance 1: "We're certainly not looking to escalate, but we will stand up for Canada, for Canadians, for Canadian jobs," Trudeau said. He added that the trade conflict will have "real consequences" not only for Canadians, but also for Americans, including job losses, higher costs for food and petrol, potential shutdowns of auto assembly plants, and impeded access to Canadian nickel, potash, uranium, steel and aluminium. 'Split us apart'Trudeau offered a reminder that Canada has been at the US' side in its "darkest hours", from the Iran hostage crisis and war in Afghanistan, to deadly natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and the recent California wildfires. "We're always there, standing with you," he said. "If President Trump wants to usher in a new golden age for the United States, the better path is to partner with Canada, not to punish us.

Shipping prices to ease as US port strike congestion clears, but unresolved issues remain [2]
  Instance 1: This was the union's direct aim, he added, after its West Coast counterpart made similar gains in 2023. The ILA might have felt pressure to end the strike early because of Hurricane Helene, said Gregg Johnston, partner and head of shipping and offshore finance at Stephenson Harwood. The late September storm was the deadliest to strike the mainland US since 2005's Hurricane Katrina. In its aftermath, keeping the logistics chain open would have been seen as critical to US national interests, noted Johnston. Ending the strike would prevent the ILA from losing public sympathy and circumvent the threat of direct government intervention.

To some, the act of naming a biennale is a surprising choice, as it disrupts the way we typically approach or understand biennales, which are often seen as mega-thematic art exhibitions featuring a myriad of artists. However, this concept of naming an entity is a familiar one such as Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa, or even natural phenomena like Hurricane Katrina. As highlighted by Mr Lin, giving SB2022 a name may produce a sense of familiarity and intimacy. With Natasha, we want to create an international art event that can be experienced on a personal level; where artists, collaborators and audiences are encouraged to discover and renew their relationships to art and life, and to each other.

Forum: Aim is for Singapore Biennale 2022 to be experienced on personal level [2]

However, this concept of naming an entity is a familiar one such as Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa, or even natural phenomena like Hurricane Katrina.As highlighted by Mr Lin, giving SB2022 a name may produce a sense of familiarity and intimacy.With Natasha, we want to create an international art event that can be experienced on a personal level; where artists, collaborators and audiences are encouraged to discover and renew their relationships to art and life, and to each other.Since announcing the biennale in March, we have been heartened by the dialogue and constructive discourse that have surfaced since, especially among the public.While doing away with a traditional theme allows artists and collaborators to enjoy a greater sense of freedom in the format of their presentations, they are still beholden to creating an engaging art event.As we reveal the SB2022 artworks and programmes over the next few weeks, there will be opportunities for contributions from members of the public, as well as more avenues for connection and reflection with art.Opening in October, the main event for SB2022 will span the course of six months. The public will be able to participate and engage with exciting and thought-provoking projects by Singapore and international artists, and we look forward to the many great conversations to come.Binna Choi, Nida Ghouse, June Yap and Ala YounisCo-Artistic DirectorsSingapore Biennale 2022STRAIT-STRAIT2022urn:contentItem:663T-CSG1-DYX4-00XB-00000-001449652022-08-07Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Insured losses from natural disasters reach $160b [1]
  Instance 1: The study, published earlier in January in the Science Advances journal, looked at the impacts of hurricanes on the United States and economic risks in the future from an increase in the number of intense category 4 or 5 storms, which historically have caused the most damage and had long-lasting impacts. The key question is whether insurance schemes can be designed to help areas recover after a major storm, especially if the frequency of these storms increases. In the US, hurricanes caused more than US$400 billion in direct economic losses from 1980 to 2014, with losses peaking at more than US$150 billion in 2005, the year Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. "There is good scientific agreement that with ongoing global warming, the proportion of the most intense hurricanes will increase. Our computer simulations show that hurricane-induced economic growth losses could more than double in the US compared to the historical period (1980-2014) even if global warming can be limited to below 2 deg C," said PIK scientist Kilian Kuhla, a lead author of the study.

As floodwaters rose and the power went out, the 2,000 or so people sheltering at Memorial Hospital found themselves trapped - and staff such as Dr Anna Pou (Vera Farmiga) were forced to make life-or-death decisions about patients that would haunt them for years to come. And unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that key lessons from the hurricane were forgotten, with many healthcare systems in America just as illprepared to handle the pandemic as they were the hurricane.

A performance artist pushes the boundaries of drag [1]
  Instance 1: There, he picked up techniques from transgender actress Candis Cayne and drag comedian Jackie Beat. "They contributed to my understanding of how to command a room," he said. Needing a break from the New York party scene and space to develop his characters, he returned to New Orleans in 2005, and then moved to Austin, Texas, the year after Hurricane Katrina. To make ends meet, he worked as a barista at a Starbucks drive-through. "Christeene became a vessel for me to pour it all into, as though I summoned this spirit-slash-demon into my life to accompany me," he said.

"It seems they want to keep on with business as usual while building the wall as tall as possible and engineering our way, so we can continue developing and producing the same things without looking more holistically at (the problems)." One of the assumptions is that the Coastal Spine will do its work. But doubts remain, as one recalls the levees of New Orleans that were breached during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, or the sea walls of Tohoku, Japan, over which swept the 2011 tsunami. She said: "This is designed for a once-in-100-years event and... is that enough protection' "That's something that I think the communities that will be voting on the local cost share will have to decide...

Images of people being plucked from flooded cars and pictures of destroyed homes surfaced on social media, while the damage in New Orleans itself remained limited.Branches, broken glass and other debris littered New Orleans's downtown, while in the touristy French Quarter, a number of trees were uprooted.Ida - which was downgraded to a tropical storm early Monday - knocked out power for all of New Orleans, with more than a million properties across Louisiana without power, according to outage tracker PowerOutage.US."I was there 16 years ago. The wind seems worse this time but the damage seems less bad," said French Quarter resident Dereck Terry, surveying his neighborhood in flip flops and a t-shirt, umbrella in hand."I have a broken window.

US faces grim winter as virus overwhelms hospitals, health staff [2]
  Instance 1: Nearly 37,000 Americans died of Covid-19 last month, the most in any month since this year's savage spring. Death rates lag behind hospitalisations, which are soaring again, leading experts to forecast that the country could soon see 2,000 or more fatalities a day. That would be the equivalent of a major natural disaster, like 2005's Hurricane Katrina (1,800 deaths), every single day. Last Wednesday, Centres for Disease Control and Prevention director Robert Redfield warned: "I actually believe (December, January and February) are going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation." HOSPITALS FILLING UP Hospitalisations from the coronavirus topped 100,000 last Thursday - more than double the number at the beginning of last month. The total death toll as at last Friday was 276,000.

And, unlike the spring, when cases were concentrated in a few states, this time they are nationwide - helped, epidemiologists say, by last weekend's Thanksgiving holiday, which saw millions ignoring pleas not to travel.STRAIT-753810STRAIT2020urn:contentItem:61FR-92M1-JCF2-819F-00000-001449652020-12-05Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights ReservedThe Straits Times (Singapore)December 6, 2020 SundayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHUNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTSUNIVERSITY OF MARYLANDSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST000DQGECOVID CORONAVIRUSST000DOTHCOVID-19 CORONAVIRUSSTX000453DEATH &amp; DYINGSTX000912INFECTIOUS DISEASESTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX000425DEATH RATESSTX002233EPIDEMIOLOGYN621399MGNURSES &amp; NURSINGSTX001880PUBLIC HEALTHN923120CCPUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATIONST000DOTYCORONAVIRUSESSTX000511DISEASES &amp; DISORDERSST000A7R7INTENSIVE CARE UNITSSTX002002MEDICAL TREATMENTS &amp; PROCEDURESSTX001657SURGERY &amp; TRANSPLANTATIONST000A8A4LEVELS OF CAREN923120GCCOMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROLSTX002145VIRUSESST000DN6RPUBLIC OFFICIALSST00097CIHEALTH DEPARTMENTSST00096VNPOPULATION CHARACTERISTICSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST0009F7UHURRICANESN551112MMHOLDING COMPANIESST0009XS5THANKSGIVINGN622000CCHOSPITALSSTX002233EPIDEMIOLOGYN621399MGNURSES &amp; NURSINGST000A7R7INTENSIVE CARE UNITSST00097CIHEALTH DEPARTMENTSN622310JMMATERNITY HOSPITALSGX567BOSTON, MA, USAGX603BALTIMORE, MD, USAGS136MARYLAND, USAGS120CALIFORNIA, USAGS124WASHINGTON DC, USAGC343UNITED STATES
Social trust in times of crisis [2]
  Instance 1: Stockpiling incidents have occurred across the globe, but in some places, this is the least of their social trust worries. Gun sales have skyrocketed alongside Covid-19 case counts in the United States. Americans remember Hurricane Katrina's violent aftermath. People expected looting, and set about aggressively defending their property. While there was little actual looting, violence sparked by mutual distrust contributed to hundreds of deaths.
  Instance 2: At this momentous juncture, all governments face an opportunity to engage and build trust with and among citizens. As we come together to confront this common enemy of humanity, who knows what new bonds will be forged'· Nomi Claire Lazar is an associate dean of faculty and associate professor of politics at Yale-NUS College.Residents of The Pinnacle@ Duxton were among many Singaporeans on Monday who applauded in appreciation of workers on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus. The writer says that where social trust flourishes, there is hope, and adds that social trust is dynamic: Facing a challenge together can seed new vectors of cohesion and mutual care.STRAIT-677138STRAIT2020urn:contentItem:5YK2-CNR1-DYX4-00RX-00000-001449652020-04-02Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights ReservedThe Straits Times (Singapore)April 3, 2020 FridayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHST000DQGECOVID CORONAVIRUSST000DOTHCOVID-19 CORONAVIRUSSTX000912INFECTIOUS DISEASEST000DPIZLOOTINGSTX002017NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; FOREIGN RELATIONSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST000DOZBSOCIAL DISTANCINGN920000CCGOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONSTX001880PUBLIC HEALTHST000DOZLSHELTER IN PLACEST000DRDXNEGATIVE MISC NEWSST000DNKDSELF IMPROVEMENTST0009QS2REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONSST00097CNARMIESSTX000518DIVIDENDSST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001339POLICE MISCONDUCTST0009G89REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTSSTX001566SHOOTINGSST000DI83DEATHS &amp; INJURIES BY POLICEN921000CCGOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICESN922120CCLAW ENFORCEMENTSTX000724FIREARMSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINASTX000556EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONSN551112MMHOLDING COMPANIESSTX001464RELIGIONST00097CNARMIESGC311SINGAPOREGC343UNITED STATESGC308MALAYSIA

  Instance 1: Meanwhile, Amazon is leasing 90,000 sq ft across three levels at Asia Square Tower 1 that were previously occupied by Citi.Despite the positive moves, the office market faces significant challenges as the prevalence of staff working from home is expected to remain widespread in the short to medium term, cautions C&amp;W.It expects office rentals to fall by 10% in the full-year 2020, with a further decline in 2021.Climate risks a key factor in real estate investment decisionsReal estate investors are starting to place more importance on climate risks in investment decisions, highlights a report by the Urban Land Institute (ULI), a global multi-disciplinary real estate organisation, and Heitman, a global real estate investment management firm.Investors now commonly view local climate risks - such as wildfires, intense storms and sea-level rise - as core factors in investment decision-making. In particular, some investors revealed that they were starting to pull back their investments in some property markets due to a lack of climate resilience, although the exact weighting of climate risks varies from investor to investor.Climate-aware investors "are looking beyond the individual asset and assessing a city's preparedness for climate change, but the models and metrics they need are still in their infancy. Benchmarking cities for climate risk and resilience is a challenge and I anticipate significant progress from the industry on obtaining this much-needed data", comments ULI CEO Ed Walter.In the report, the investors also raised the need for better data and frameworks to make market-level impact transparent and allow benchmarking between markets.Some cities threatened by climate change are in the process of moving their populations, notably Cairo and Jakarta.Climate migration is also an increasingly recognised phenomenon, with examples in the US that include migrations after disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Maria and the 2020 wildfires.Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of many different weather events that result in catastrophic losses, including extreme precipitation, drought, floods, tsunamis, wildfires, heat waves and landslides, notes the report.Globally, there were 40 disaster events in 2019 that resulted in at least US$1 billion ($1.36 billion) in near-term direct losses each - part of an upward trend of billion-dollar disasters. Worldwide losses from extreme weather events from 2010 to 2020 totalled over US$3 trillion.More information on climate risks will also help city governments to create a more robust business case for major resilience measures, alongside more transparent accounting for the actual costs of catastrophic climate events, says the report. The economic benefits of resilient infrastructure projects include job creation and retention, preservation of the tax base and avoided losses, it adds.
Champion of human goodness [2]
  Instance 1: How can you explain genocides and wars' "The irony of writing a book on human goodness is that you have to go on for hundreds and hundreds of pages about the dark chapters in human history because one of the strange facts about our species is that we're not only the friendliest species in the animal kingdom, but we're also the cruellest." What is most fascinating about this, he adds, is how these two things - our friendliness and our cruelty - are inextricably connected. A history of human kindness may be just the ticket for a world beset by the coronavirus pandemic. Bregman filled his book with examples of crises - from the London Blitz during World War II to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Popular wisdom tends towards what Dutch biologist Frans de Waal calls "veneer theory", which Bregman defines as the "notion that civilisation is nothing more than a thin veneer that will crack at the merest provocation". What actually happens is the opposite, he says.
  Instance 2: "Now, if I'm saying that actually, we can be trusted and most people are pretty decent and can work together, then maybe we don't need all these hierarchies. "And this is also the reason why throughout history, those who have advocated a more hopeful view of human nature have often been persecuted by those in power."Humankind ($25.95) is available at bit.ly/Humankind_BregmanThis article includes affiliate links.

She also serves on the board of the Children's Defense Fund (CDF), a child advocacy and research group.

U.S. accepts S'pore's offer of help [2]
  Instance 1: In response to media queries, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said last night that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong called American President Donald Trump to express his concern and sympathies over the loss of life and damage caused by the storm.PM Lee offered Singapore's assistance in disaster relief efforts by deploying the Republic of Singapore Air Force's (RSAF) CH-47 Chinook helicopters from its Peace Prairie detachment in Grand Prairie, Texas. Mr Trump thanked PM Lee and accepted his offer, said the spokesman. The hurricane has killed at least 10 people, led to mass evacuations and paralysed Houston, the fourth most-populous American city.In 2005, the RSAF deployed four CH-47 Chinook helicopters to Fort Polk, Louisiana to assist in disaster relief efforts following the deadly Hurricane Katrina, the costliest natural disaster to strike the US. The team carried out various missions ranging from relocating evacuees to transporting Zodiac boats to facilitate search and rescue efforts.The MFA's spokesman also said both leaders also looked forward to their meeting in the White House this October.TODAYN-3008WNP052APMTODAYN2017urn:contentItem:5PC1-MF71-JB7G-0546-00000-004082321901-11-11Copyright 2017 MediaCorp Press Ltd All Rights ReservedTODAY (Singapore)APM EditionAugust 30, 2017 WednesdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHForeign AffairsN624230GCDISASTER RELIEFN624230CCDISASTER &amp; EMERGENCY RELIEFST000DLVEHURRICANE HARVEYST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSN928120MMSTATE DEPARTMENTS &amp; FOREIGN SERVICESSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINASTX001763TROPICAL STORMSN921110CCHEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENTST0009EOQPRIME MINISTERSST00097CMAIR FORCESN928110MMARMED FORCESSTX002260MILITARY HELICOPTERSST00097CMAIR FORCESN928110MMARMED FORCESSTX002247HELICOPTERSPE000A0WKLEE HSIEN LOONGPE0009THXDONALD TRUMPGX591HOUSTON, TX, USAGS134LOUISIANA, USAGS159TEXAS, USAGC343UNITED STATESGC311SINGAPORE

Mr Obama's critics would argue that his defining image is of him promising the American people before the launch of Obamacare in 2009 that "No matter how we reform healthcare, we will keep this promise: if you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period." In reality, and contrary to those early promises, millions of Americans were required to give up their healthcare insurance plans after Obamacare went into effect.
  Instance 3: Mr Obama's critics would argue that his defining image is of him promising the American people before the launch of Obamacare in 2009 that "No matter how we reform healthcare, we will keep this promise: if you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period." In reality, and contrary to those early promises, millions of Americans were required to give up their healthcare insurance plans after Obamacare went into effect. Mr Obama's supporters would argue that it's not fair to compare what was in essence a technical glitch on the Obamacare website (Healthcare.gov) with the Hurricane Katrina disaster where 1,833 Americans died and more than US$80 billion worth of property was destroyed with the recovery operations costing American taxpayers more than US$100 billion. "There's a qualitative difference between people dying in New Orleans and people not able to get healthcare," said former Bush strategist and pollster Matthew Dowd on ABC's This Week news show on Sunday. "But from a political standpoint, it's eerily similar to President Bush in the fall of 2005" Indeed, the American public's response to the launching of Obamacare seems to suggest that Mr Obama may be facing his Katrina moment.
  Instance 4: According to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, more than 50 per cent of Americans share a negative view of the Republican Party, and more Americans mistrust Congress than they mistrust the White House. So Mr Obama and his aides are praying, wishing and hoping that a major acceleration in the economic recovery will take place before next year's mid-term congressional elections and help change the public's perception of the president. But they also recall that in the mid-term elections that followed Katrina, the Republicans were badly beaten and haven't been able to recover from that electoral blow since then.BUSTMS-884035BUSTMS2013urn:contentItem:59X7-XXC1-DYX4-02B8-00000-00114322015-09-07Copyright 2013 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights ReservedThe Business Times SingaporeNovember 26, 2013 TuesdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHCC0002JR3NBC UNIVERSAL INCCC0004CEBWALL STREET JOURNALNAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTINGSIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONSSTX000833HEALTH CARE POLICYST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST000C49JOBAMA HEALTH CARE REFORMST0009QS2REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONSST0009J14HEALTH CARE LAWSTX002246HEALTH CARE REGULATION &amp; POLICYN551112MMHOLDING COMPANIESST000DE28APPLICATION FAILURESST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX000556EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONSSTX002075HEALTH CARE REFORMST00097CMAIR FORCESST0009YM7IRAQ WARSTX000453DEATH &amp; DYINGSTX002149HEALTH CARESTX000833HEALTH CARE POLICYST000C49JOBAMA HEALTH CARE REFORMST0009T96ST0009J14HEALTH CARE LAWSTX002246HEALTH CARE REGULATION &amp; POLICYST000DE28APPLICATION FAILURESSTX002075HEALTH CARE REFORMSTX000834HEALTH INSURANCEST00097CMAIR FORCESPE0009TJPBARACK OBAMAPE0009U6FGEORGE W BUSHGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGS134LOUISIANA, USAGC343UNITED STATESGC358IRAQ

Trump accepts PM's offer of copters for relief effort [2]
  Instance 1: President Trump thanked PM Lee and accepted his offer of help. The RSAF detachment in Grand Prairie was set up in 1995 to train Chinook crewmen and maintenance personnel. Four of its helicopters and 41 personnel had assisted in a relief mission for Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana in September 2005, during which they worked alongside the Texas Army National Guard. Yesterday, Mr Trump took PM Lee's call while on board Air Force One on his way to Texas for an update on the flooding crisis. Both leaders also discussed North Korea's "continued and deliberate provocations, including the latest ballistic missile launch", with the missile flying over Japan.
  Instance 2: "We strongly urge North Korea to cease all provocations immediately, and reiterate our longstanding call for North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments," he added in a Facebook post. His upcoming meeting with Mr Trump comes after they met at the Group of 20 Leaders' Summit in Hamburg, Germany, last month. At that meeting, Mr Trump said he looked forward to receiving PM Lee in Washington later this year.SEE WORLDSTRAIT-403992STRAIT2017urn:contentItem:5PC1-X361-JCF2-835T-00000-001449652017-09-02Copyright 2017 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights ReservedThe Straits Times (Singapore)August 30, 2017 WednesdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHCC0009VRAFACEBOOK INCNAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALSFB (NASDAQ)N624230CCDISASTER &amp; EMERGENCY RELIEFN624230GCDISASTER RELIEFN921110CCHEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENTST000DLVEHURRICANE HARVEYST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSST0009EOQPRIME MINISTERSSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSN551112MMHOLDING COMPANIESN928120KMINTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCESTX001669TALKS &amp; MEETINGSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINASTX001463RELIEF ORGANIZATIONSN928120MMSTATE DEPARTMENTS &amp; FOREIGN SERVICESN928110MMARMED FORCESSTX001150MISSILE SYSTEMSSTX001982WEAPONS &amp; ARMSST00097CMAIR FORCESST00097CNARMIESN928000CCINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp; NATIONAL SECURITYST000DRK8BLUE COLLAR WORKERSST000D17DNEWS BRIEFSSTX002247HELICOPTERSSTX002260MILITARY HELICOPTERSN928110MMARMED FORCESSTX001150MISSILE SYSTEMSST00097CMAIR FORCESST00097CNARMIESPE0009THXDONALD TRUMPPE000A0WKLEE HSIEN LOONGGX122HAMBURG, GERMANYGS159TEXAS, USAGS134LOUISIANA, USAGC311SINGAPOREGC371KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OFGC343UNITED STATESGC318GERMANY

She added: "That same concerned and uncalculating friendship was on display in more recent days, as Singapore became one of the first foreign governments to assist in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in Texas." The Republic of Singapore Air Force deployed four helicopters and assisted in disaster relief operations in the battered south- western American state earlier this month. That was a reminder of its military aid after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which Ms Syptak-Ramnath called "another sign of the longstanding partnership that exists between our two countries". Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) Lim Hng Kiang, who was also at the business event at the Four Seasons Singapore hotel, thanked the charge d'affaires for her "kind remarks". He added: "It shows the wide-ranging relations between the US and Singapore." Ms Syptak-Ramnath has been heading her embassy in Singapore since Mr Kirk Wagar left his post as ambassador at the start of US President Donald Trump's administration.SEE BUSINESS The guided-missile destroyer USS John S.

I found everything here so familiar.'He moved to Buras in 1991 with his wife and daughter, and set up the China Sea restaurant that year.But they lost everything in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina struck, losing more than US $400,000 (S $546,000) in that disaster.He worked in Dallas and New Orleans for the next four years, but could not forget Buras.'My heart told me to come back, not my mind,' said Mr Tao, who began rebuilding China Sea last year. The restaurant reopened for business in March this year to much fanfare. A month later, however, his business was badly hit after an oil rig 65km off the Gulf Coast exploded and sank while working on an undersea well belonging to BP.He even lost three of his employees to BP's cleanup operation, which offered workers US $120 a day in wages.
  Instance 2: But her monthly bills for utilities, sewerage and rent have already come to US $13,000.And with the supply of crabs falling by more than 10 times since the waters in the Gulf were closed in response to the oil spill, Ms Taponpanh said she has had no choice but to let her 35 workers go.Given the uncertainties surrounding the Gulf seafood industry, would she wind up her business and move on?'No. If I'm here, at least I can help my workers translate so that they can make their claims against BP,' said the entrepreneur, who took English classes in the 1980s.For now, she is uncertain about how she will rebuild her business. But it won't be her first attempt at such a task.Chanta Seafood was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, about a year after it was first launched. It took her and her husband nearly two years to secure new loans and to rebuild their premises before the plant was reopened again with 15 of her former employees.Recovering from the fallout of the oil spill might take longer, but she said: 'I'm not going to leave. Seafood is my life and it is the only thing I know how to do.'STRAIT-10080117STRAIT2010urn:contentItem:802M-0XB1-2R99-300H-00000-001449652015-09-09Copyright 2010 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights ReservedThe Straits Times (Singapore)August 1, 2010 SundayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Rulemaking AuthorityZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDQ5NTQxQjhEOEVGNDQxQzgzNjBENTcwMUJDMzMyRDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUYwRjQ2MEQ2RjgxNDE1REI0NDk0REYzNDA4Q0ZEMUULabor &amp; Employment LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTE3QUQwOTA0MUYzNDlCMEFFMjUwRUNDM0RDRkM5QzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Rulemaking AuthorityZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDQ5NTQxQjhEOEVGNDQxQzgzNjBENTcwMUJDMzMyRDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUYwRjQ2MEQ2RjgxNDE1REI0NDk0REYzNDA4Q0ZEMUUSTX001813WAGES &amp; SALARIESSTX002026COMPENSATION &amp; BENEFITSST000CFJM2010 GULF COAST OIL SPILLN551112MMHOLDING COMPANIESST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST000DBMJOFFSHORE OIL &amp; GAS EXPLORATION &amp; EXTRACTIONSTX001243OIL SPILLSSTX001461REFUGEESSTX000887IMMIGRATIONSTX001143MINIMUM WAGEST0009F7UHURRICANESN311700CCSEAFOOD PROCESSINGSTX001591WELFARE BENEFITSSTX000746FOOD STAMPSSTX001482RESTAURANTSST000CFJM2010 GULF COAST OIL SPILLST000DBMJOFFSHORE OIL &amp; GAS EXPLORATION &amp; EXTRACTIONSTX001243OIL SPILLSN311700CCSEAFOOD PROCESSINGN221320MMSEWERAGE SYSTEMSGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAST000A2L8PACIFIC OCEANGS116ALABAMA, USAGS134LOUISIANA, USAST000A2VVMISSISSIPPI RIVERGR215SOUTHEAST USAGC343UNITED STATESGC372LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICGC385VIET NAM

Nor were economies crippled when oil prices reached $75US last month, due to geopolitical tensions in oil-rich Iran.In fact, growth in the economies of the US, Japan and Europe, along with Asia, has been healthy and the widely feared spectre of high inflation did not materialise. While pump prices spiked following these episodes, inflation levels in most countries remained surprisingly mild.'Generally, we've been pretty fortunate that oil hasn't had a big impact on core inflation rates and growth over the last few years,' said Mr David Carbon, DBS' head of economic and currency research.Given that crude oil products go into everything from plastics to petrol to cosmetics, pricier crude means raw materials cost more to businesses, putting a squeeze on profit margins.An important 'shock absorber' has been the spread of global trade and the rise of China as the 'factory of the world'.Globalisation has ensured that low labour costs in China are translated into cheap finished goods exported to the rest of the world.Ms Selena Ling, the head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank, said: 'Downward pricing pressures from manufactured goods such as electronics, especially those from China, have helped offset some of the commodity price inflation.'Another countering factor, she noted, was that oil prices were pushed up not by any actual shortage in supply, but rather by rising demand from fast-growing economies.Still, it does not stop concerns about oil hitting $100US a barrel.
  Instance 3: Quantum Fund co-founder Jim Rogers even predicted prices would reach $150US within a decade, as there has been no major oil discovery in 35 years.A possible trigger of new highs would be, once again, the US hurricane season.United Overseas Bank economist Thomas Lam said: 'I suspect that in the coming months, from June to November, when the hurricane season gets under way, there will be another source of upside risk.'However, he believes that when oil stays above $80US a barrel, consumers will start to shy away from oil, bringing prices down again. 'Over the longer term, consumers' response becomes more obvious. People start to switch to alternative fuels, or drive less, or take public transport,' said Mr Lam.ericatay@sph.com.sgurn:contentItem:4JYD-56G0-TX7D-H2WB-00000-00STRAIT-060515081STRAIT20061449652015-09-09Copyright 2006 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights ReservedThe Straits Times (Singapore)May 15, 2006 MondayNewspaperENGLISHSTX000432CRUDE OIL MARKETSSTX001242OIL &amp; GAS PRICESST0009GJTCRUDE OIL PRICESSTX001937ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORSST00090NTECONOMIC CONDITIONSST000DSD5ENERGY PRICESSTX000913INFLATIONST000971EPRICE INCREASESST000DIJWPRICESSTX001457RECESSIONSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST000DEILCOMMODITIES PRICESSTX000551ECONOMIC NEWSST000DLA3ECONOMICSSTX000797GLOBALIZATIONST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST0009F7UHURRICANESST000DL7QRETAIL PRICESSTX001826WEATHERSTX001973COMMODITIES MARKETSST000DDH2ENERGY SHORTAGESST0009GJUGASOLINE PRICESN551112MMHOLDING COMPANIESSTX000951INTERNATIONAL TRADEST000DDGKSUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONSST000DM8YBUSINESS NEWSSTX000484DEVELOPMENT BANKSSTX000550ECONOMIC GROWTHSTX000619ENERGY &amp; UTILITY POLICYST0008XKGOUTPUT &amp; DEMANDSTX001970TRENDS &amp; EVENTSSTX000679EXPORT TRADEST000DDGYSHORTAGESST0008X7DMANUFACTURING FACILITIESST0008X90MANUFACTURING OUTPUTSTX000432CRUDE OIL MARKETSSTX001242OIL &amp; GAS PRICESST0009GJTCRUDE OIL PRICESST000DSD5ENERGY PRICESST000971EPRICE INCREASESST000DEILCOMMODITIES PRICESST000DL7QRETAIL PRICESSTX001973COMMODITIES MARKETSST000DDH2ENERGY SHORTAGESST0009GJUGASOLINE PRICESSTX000484DEVELOPMENT BANKSSTX000619ENERGY &amp; UTILITY POLICYSTX000410COSMETICS &amp; TOILETRIESST0009S3CCOSMETICSN213112MMOIL &amp; GAS EXPLORATIONST0009GJYOIL EXPLORATIONST0008X7DMANUFACTURING FACILITIESST0008X90MANUFACTURING OUTPUTGC302CHINAGC368IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OFGC311SINGAPOREGC343UNITED STATESGT113ASIAGT115EUROPEGC306JAPAN

Viet Nam presents five proposals to protect environment, global health at BRICS Summit [1]
  Instance 1: Stressing the importance of achieving breakthroughs in climate finance at COP30, he supported Brazil's priorities and called for innovative green financing mechanisms and stronger private sector involvement.Fourth, PM Chính stressed the need to maximise the role of science, technology, and innovation in environmental protection and healthcare. He called for stronger international cooperation in developing green technologies, digital infrastructure, and knowledge-sharing to narrow development gaps.Fifth, he urged substantive, effective reforms of global governance in environment, climate and health, while affirming the central role of the United Nations, multilateral cooperation, and meaningful participation by regional and inter-regional mechanisms to ensure that global commitments are delivered fairly, transparently and effectively.PM Chính expressed his support for Brazil's selection of environment protection and global health as priorities for this year's BRICS Summit, saying the issues are existential for the planet.Reflecting on lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and other global challenges, such as natural disasters, climate change, resource depletion, and population ageing, the Vietnamese PM noted that the world remains unprepared and global institutions are not yet cohesive or strong enough to respond effectively. He called for a shift in mindset and a sense of urgency, with a spirit of "shared journey, shared action, shared benefits and shared success."PM Chính reiterated that climate action, environmental protection, and public health must form the foundation of all national development policies - not only a strategic choice but a historical imperative.He reaffirmed Viet Nam's strong commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, and its readiness to contribute responsibly and actively to global environmental and health cooperation.There is no substitute for Earth, no asset more valuable than health, and no foundation more solid than humanity, he stated, stressing that "only through collective action can we leave future generations a thriving planet, a prosperous world, and a happy humankind."In his opening address, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, current Chair of BRICS, underscored the urgency of a just and well-planned energy transition, the need to reduce fossil fuel dependence, and the pursuit of "zero deforestation." He called for stronger investment in protecting tropical rainforests and emphasised the importance of climate justice in tackling poverty and inequality.Leaders at the session warned of delays-and even reversals-in progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and stressed the need for global cooperation to address climate crises, strengthen health governance, and promote inclusive, sustainable development.The high-level session marked the conclusion of the expanded BRICS Summit 2025, which showcased Brazil's leadership and reflected the shared aspirations of developing nations for multilateral cooperation, global solidarity, and inclusive governance with people at its heart.Viet Nam's active and constructive participation once again highlighted the image of a dynamic nation, firmly committed to environmentally responsible development and proactive global integration for peace, cooperation and progress.VIETNW-VIETNAMNEWS0807202500010047VIETNW2025urn:contentItem:6G76-FXM3-RRKC-14XM-00000-004655272025-07-09Copyright 2025 Viet Nam News All Rights ReservedViet Nam NewsJuly 8, 2025 TuesdayNewspaperNewspapersEnglish USEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQN924120CCCONSERVATIONSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESST000D17OBRICS COUNTRIESST0009SI7ENVIRONMENTALISMST000DR4JGREEN FINANCEN921110CCHEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENTN928000CCINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp; NATIONAL SECURITYST0009EOQPRIME MINISTERSST000DT12TECHNOLOGYST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONN921000CCGOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICESSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGESTX000591EMERGING MARKETSSTX000594EMISSIONSST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST000DPKLENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYST000DQY1GREEN ECONOMYSTX000950INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSSTX001960PUBLIC POLICYST000DL6MSUSTAINABILITYST0009F91SUSTAINABLE FORESTRYSTX001880PUBLIC HEALTHST000C4DXHEALTH CARE RATIONINGST00632417FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGYSTX000038AGINGST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYST0009GETDEFORESTATIONST000CA1XENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGYSTX002064EPIDEMICSSTX000912INFECTIOUS DISEASEST000DOXWPANDEMICSST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSST0008XKMHUMAN RESOURCES &amp; PERSONNEL MANAGEMENTST0009U58HISTORYST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSSTX001692TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSST000DQGECOVID CORONAVIRUSST000DOTHCOVID-19 CORONAVIRUSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST000DR4JGREEN FINANCESTX000594EMISSIONSSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESST000DPKLENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYST000DQY1GREEN ECONOMYST0009F91SUSTAINABLE FORESTRYST000C4DXHEALTH CARE RATIONINGST00632417FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGYST0009GETDEFORESTATIONST000DSGIFOSSIL FUELSPE000DSIHPHAM MINH CHINHPE0009UJBLUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVAGX038RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZILGC338BRAZILST000DO5ZBRICS MEMBER STATESGC385VIETNAM

  Instance 1: Stressing the importance of achieving breakthroughs in climate finance at COP30, he supported Brazil's priorities and called for innovative green financing mechanisms and stronger private sector involvement.Fourth, PM Chinh stressed the need to maximise the role of science, technology, and innovation in environmental protection and healthcare. He called for stronger international cooperation in developing green technologies, digital infrastructure, and knowledge-sharing to narrow development gaps.Fifth, he urged substantive, effective reforms of global governance in environment, climate and health, while affirming the central role of the United Nations, multilateral cooperation, and meaningful participation by regional and inter-regional mechanisms to ensure that global commitments are delivered fairly, transparently and effectively.PM Chinh expressed his support for Brazil's selection of environment protection and global health as priorities for this year's BRICS Summit, saying the issues are existential for the planet.Reflecting on lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and other global challenges, such as natural disasters, climate change, resource depletion, and population ageing, the Vietnamese PM noted that the world remains unprepared and global institutions are not yet cohesive or strong enough to respond effectively. He called for a shift in mindset and a sense of urgency, with a spirit of "shared journey, shared action, shared benefits and shared success." PM Chinh reiterated that climate action, environmental protection, and public health must form the foundation of all national development policies-not only a strategic choice but a historical imperative.He reaffirmed Vietnam's strong commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, and its readiness to contribute responsibly and actively to global environmental and health cooperation.There is no substitute for Earth, no asset more valuable than health, and no foundation more solid than humanity, he stated, stressing that "only through collective action can we leave future generations a thriving planet, a prosperous world, and a happy humankind."In his opening address, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, current Chair of BRICS, underscored the urgency of a just and well-planned energy transition, the need to reduce fossil fuel dependence, and the pursuit of "zero deforestation." He called for stronger investment in protecting tropical rainforests and emphasised the importance of climate justice in tackling poverty and inequality.Leaders at the session warned of delays-and even reversals-in progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and stressed the need for global cooperation to address climate crises, strengthen health governance, and promote inclusive, sustainable development.The high-level session marked the conclusion of the expanded BRICS Summit 2025, which showcased Brazil's leadership and reflected the shared aspirations of developing nations for multilateral cooperation, global solidarity, and inclusive governance with people at its heart.Vietnam's active and constructive participation once again highlighted the image of a dynamic nation, firmly committed to environmentally responsible development and proactive global integration for peace, cooperation and progress.VIEPLS-VIETNAMPLUS0807202500010024VIEPLS2025urn:contentItem:6G75-9JX3-RRRW-F0D3-00000-004725732025-07-09Copyright 2025 Vietnam Plus, Vietnam News Agency All Rights ReservedVietnam PlusJuly 8, 2025 TuesdayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsEnglish USEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQN924120CCCONSERVATIONSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESST000D17OBRICS COUNTRIESST0009SI7ENVIRONMENTALISMST000DR4JGREEN FINANCEN921110CCHEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENTN928000CCINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp; NATIONAL SECURITYST0009EOQPRIME MINISTERSST000DT12TECHNOLOGYST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONN921000CCGOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICESSTX000591EMERGING MARKETSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGESTX000594EMISSIONSST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST000DPKLENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYST000DQY1GREEN ECONOMYSTX000950INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSSTX001960PUBLIC POLICYST000DL6MSUSTAINABILITYST0009F91SUSTAINABLE FORESTRYSTX001880PUBLIC HEALTHST000C4DXHEALTH CARE RATIONINGST00632417FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGYSTX000038AGINGST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYST0009GETDEFORESTATIONST000CA1XENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGYSTX002064EPIDEMICSSTX000912INFECTIOUS DISEASEST000DOXWPANDEMICSST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSST0008XKMHUMAN RESOURCES &amp; PERSONNEL MANAGEMENTST0009U58HISTORYST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSSTX001692TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSST000DQGECOVID CORONAVIRUSST000DOTHCOVID-19 CORONAVIRUSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST000DR4JGREEN FINANCESTX000594EMISSIONSSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESST000DPKLENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYST000DQY1GREEN ECONOMYST0009F91SUSTAINABLE FORESTRYST000C4DXHEALTH CARE RATIONINGST00632417FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGYST0009GETDEFORESTATIONST000DSGIFOSSIL FUELSPE000DSIHPHAM MINH CHINHPE0009UJBLUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVAGX038RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZILGC338BRAZILST000DO5ZBRICS MEMBER STATESGC385VIETNAM

The move aims to force countries to further increase measures to prevent, reduce, and control marine pollution. This is a first-of-its-kind climate justice case that focuses on protecting the oceans.According to representatives of the Pacific island countries, severe weather events are increasing in both quantity and intensity each year, seriously affecting people's lives and destroying the infrastructure of small island states.All the marine and coastal ecosystems are being damaged by increasingly warmer and more acidic waters. Climate change is causing sea levels to rise rapidly, threatening to submerge some Pacific island nations.In that context, Pacific island countries believe that countries with high emission must act more responsibly and practically, not just by making calls and creating unclear research funding packages.The Committee on Climate Change and Pacific Island International Law (COSIS) is in charge of this lawsuit.The lawsuit is expected to increase pressure and create an environmental protection movement, forcing the world's leading industrial nations to reduce emissions necessary to meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement.VIETNG-VIETNAMNGAZ130920230001043VIETNG2023urn:contentItem:695K-MWV1-JCH9-G487-00000-004725712023-09-14Copyright 2023 Vietnam News Gazette All Rights ReservedVietnam News GazetteSeptember 13, 2023 WednesdayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsEnglish USCC000DRDRSEA LTDNAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICESSE (NYSE)STX000310CLIMATE CHANGESTX001040LITIGATIONST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYSTX000594EMISSIONSST0009QUFISLANDS &amp; REEFSSTX001074MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENTST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST000DS5VOCEAN HEALTHSTX001235OCEANSSTX001648SUITS &amp; CLAIMSST000DH0QAGREEMENTSST000DNUOCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICYSTX001941ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION &amp; POLICYN922110EMINTERNATIONAL COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALSST000DQOUMARINE CONSERVATIONST000DS4VSEA LEVEL CHANGESSTX000317COASTAL AREASN924120CCCONSERVATIONSTX001007LAW OF THE SEASTX001348POLLUTIONST0008X12POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp; REMEDIATIONST0009FY4SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMSSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSST000DLXIADMIRALTY COURTSSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST000DEUISEVERE WEATHERSTX001826WEATHERSTX001816WATER POLLUTIONSTX000594EMISSIONSSTX001074MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENTST000DQOUMARINE CONSERVATIONST000DLXIADMIRALTY COURTSGX122HAMBURG, GERMANYGC510ANTIGUA &amp; BARBUDAGC512BAHAMASGC318GERMANY

It saw the presence of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, and leaders and representatives of 134 member states of G77 and international organisations.Addressing the summit's main debate, PM Chinh hailed Cuba's initiative to hold the event and affirmed the Caribbean country's leadership as Chair of G77.He emphasised the importance of effective climate change response to the world and Vietnam and proposed three cooperation orientations for G77.First, it is necessary to promote a global and all people-based approach and uphold multilateralism with the motto of common but differentiated responsibilities, justice, and reasonableness with socio-economic development demand of developing countries taken into account.Second, science, technology, and innovation should be turned into the key cooperation area of G77 on the basis of establishing an inclusive cooperation mechanism and capitalising on the strengths of both developed countries (capital, technology) and developing ones (markets, resources).Third, preferential climate finance should be promoted in a way that makes it more accessible, does not increase the debt burden, and not at the expense of resources for realising other development goals.The PM highlighted Vietnam's green transition resolve as seen in its strong commitments announce at COP26, participation in the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), and implementation of plans, projects, and strategies on green growth, sustainable development, and energy transition.The Vietnamese leader expressed readiness to coordinate and share experience with other G77 members.In his remarks, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez underlined the importance of enhancing international solidarity and cooperation in response to major global challenges. He called on G77 countries to stay united, share voice, and ensure the rights and legitimate interests of developing countries that are being directly and severely affected by climate change.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed the role of developing countries in promoting a multilateral process for climate targets and calling for climate justice. He urged developed nations to quickly increase assistance for the countries of the Global South and, especially, deliver on their climate finance commitments.The summit welcomed and highly valued the turning-point significance of the adoption of the Loss and Damage Fund. It affirmed the need to bring into play the role of G77, step up actions, and boost effective solutions to climate change./.VIETNG-VIETNAMNGAZ0312202300001VIETNG2023urn:contentItem:69SN-FSJ1-F00C-62C1-00000-004725712023-12-03Copyright 2023 Vietnam News Gazette All Rights ReservedVietnam News GazetteDecember 3, 2023 SundayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsEnglish USGROUP OF SEVENTY SEVEN (G77)DubaiSTX000365CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONSSTX000483DEVELOPING COUNTRIESN921000CCGOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICESN921110CCHEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENTST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYST000DR4JGREEN FINANCEST0009EOQPRIME MINISTERSST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSSTX000591EMERGING MARKETSSTX000549ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTX000632ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES &amp; AGREEMENTSST000DQY1GREEN ECONOMYST000DRAQGREEN GROWTHSTX001660SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTSTX000551ECONOMIC NEWSSTX000948INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTST000A7ISASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONSST000DNUOCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICYST000DL6MSUSTAINABILITYST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSST000DM8YBUSINESS NEWSST000DR4JGREEN FINANCEST000DQY1GREEN ECONOMYST000DRAQGREEN GROWTHST000DRDOPRESS AGENCY RELEASESSTX001660SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTPE000DM6VANTONIO GUTERRESPE000DM8WMIGUEL DIAZ-CANELPE000DSIHPHAM MINH CHINHST0009TXVDUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATESGC354UNITED ARAB EMIRATESGC385VIETNAMGC503CUBAGR114CARIBBEAN ISLANDS

UNDP helps Vietnam strengthen women's resilience to climate change [1]

The installation of LED lights has led to a reduction of GHG emissions from the dragon fruit supply chain.Additionally, these cooperatives have employed several water-saving solutions, such as drip irrigation or low-pressure sprinkler irrigation, resulting in better conservation of water resources that are becoming increasingly scarce due to droughts, especially in the south-central coastal provinces.The shifting to green climate friendly agriculture has opened the way for women farmers to sell their dragon fruit in lucrative, green markets such as the EU, the UNDP Representative emphasised.She continued to say that Vietnam experiences many storms and extreme weather events and floods, and these weather events disproportionately impact women and other vulnerable groups as they have less ability adapt to severe weather events.UNDP, through a Green Climate Fund-financed project, is supporting vulnerable communities to enhance their resilience to storms by providing climate resilient houses. As documented in previous major floods of 2020, these storm resilient houses not only protect women and their families before during and after storms, but the houses also often become safe havens for other vulnerable members of the community and enabling women to re-start their livelihoods as soon as waters recede.Women have also participated in the design and construction of their houses and one by one are building an empowered frontline of women resilient to climate change, she added.UNDP through the GCF project has made an important contribution with 4,000 storm resilient houses, but there is still an estimated 100,000 houses required to meet the needs of vulnerable women and their households on the climate frontlines and should be delivered in the name of climate justice.Promoting women's stewardship, contributions, participation and leadership are key for successful climate and environmental solutions, Wiesen affirmed.VIEPLS-VIETNAMPLUS14032022000522VIEPLS2022urn:contentItem:650S-3021-JCH9-G4RJ-00000-004725732022-03-15Copyright 2022 Vietnam Plus, Vietnam News Agency All Rights ReservedVietnam PlusMarch 14, 2022 MondayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsEnglish USUNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGHEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQST000D7R3GENDER EQUALITYST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGESTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESSTX000632ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES &amp; AGREEMENTSST00098X6SEX &amp; GENDER ISSUESST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSSTX001851WOMENN924120CCCONSERVATIONSTX000526DROUGHTST0009SI7ENVIRONMENTALISMSTX000735FLOODS &amp; FLOODINGST00097Z3GENDER &amp; SEX DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENTST000DEUISEVERE WEATHERST000DS6GWATER CONSERVATIONSTX001826WEATHERSTX000317COASTAL AREASN926130GJENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMSST000D89FFEMINISM &amp; WOMEN'S RIGHTSST000DIEGGENDER &amp; SEX DISCRIMINATIONN928000CCINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp; NATIONAL SECURITYST000DIURMINORITY GROUPSST0008XH6NATURAL RESOURCESST000DKUIWATER RESOURCESST0008ZAIENERGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST0008X12POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp; REMEDIATIONST00092L9SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTUREST000DNUOCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICYSTX000594EMISSIONSST000D8B1GREENHOUSE GASESST0008ZF6INTERVIEWSSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSN920000CCGOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONSTX001444RACE &amp; ETHNICITYSTX000383CONSUMPTIONST00014380BUSINESS COOPERATIVESST000DRN1NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWSST000D73FEUROPEAN UNIONST0009P2UETHNIC GROUPSSTX001817WATER QUALITYSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESN926130GJENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMSST0008ZAIENERGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTST00092L9SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURESTX000594EMISSIONSN111300CCFRUIT &amp; NUT FARMINGST00097GYFRUITS &amp; VEGETABLESST000CYB1LIGHT EMITTING DIODESST000D1GOENERGY CONSUMPTIONGC385VIET NAM

Others armed with picket signs in different languages, turning on their megaphones to shout a call for climate justice: 'No more fossil fuels'.Commitments on coalInside the Scottish Event Campus, the main meeting of the day started with the COP26, co-hosts echoing the words of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres: 'consign coal to history'.President of the Conference Alok Sharma announced the new Global Clean Power Transition Statement, a commitment to end coal investments, scale up clean power, make a just transition, and phase out coal by the 2030´s in major economies, and in the 2040´s elsewhere.The pledge has 77 signatories, including 46 countries such as Poland, Vietnam and Chile, 23 of which are making commitments on ending coal for the first time, he explained.'All this helps to power the world to net-zero. We know that there is more to be done, it's up to all of us governments, business, financial institutions and civil society and we must continue building the moment though alliances and coalitions. I do believe that the end of coal is in sight.

Addressing a press conference on Thursday at the United Nations headquarters in New York, Guterres said the climate agenda is being undermined and insisted on the need to wake up and step up action to rebuild trust based on climate justice and accelerate the just transition to a green economy and environmental friendliness.The UN chief proposed a Climate Solidarity Pact and an Acceleration Agenda to further step up efforts to combat climate change. The programs include the call to governments, the fossil fuel industry, and other stakeholders to take their commitments seriously.VIETNG-VIETNAMNGAZ1606202300006VIETNG2023urn:contentItem:68GM-76J1-JCH9-G0CP-00000-004725712023-06-17Copyright 2023 Vietnam News Gazette All Rights ReservedVietnam News GazetteJune 16, 2023 FridayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsEnglish USContracts LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzY0RTZFMzE0RjkwNDdFQUI5M0U5N0ZFMjYyREMyQzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Time for PaymentsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI0Mjg4MEQzOTcwNDZCM0E0QzY0Q0Q1NENCMEJFODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTVEQjIxRDAzMUY0NDUyM0E5Q0E1MDZBMEVBNzI1ODQEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQGovernmentsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Relations With GovernmentsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDIST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST000DQY1GREEN ECONOMYST00096SZPRESS CONFERENCESST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST000DQY1GREEN ECONOMYSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESPE000DM6VANTONIO GUTERRESGS148NEW YORK, USA

A Cultural Gumbo: Immigrants Propel Evolution of Louisiana Cooking [1]
  Instance 1: That's an effect of the Sicilians who arrived here."Red gravy, the Creole adaptation of tomato sauce - similar to how Creoles use a roux in gumbo as a thickener - and the introduction of sno-balls, made from shaved ice, to New Orleans are further examples of how New Orleanian and Sicilian cuisines merged."In Sicily and lots of Europe, it was common during hotter months to walk up a mountain to collect snow that you could flavor with syrup for a summertime treat," Williams said. "In America, most places use crushed ice for more of a frozen sherbet. In New Orleans, however, shaved ice is used because it emulates more of what our Sicilians knew back home."In more recent decades, Mexican immigrants came to New Orleans to help rebuild after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. They, too, left an impact on their new home - not just on the cuisine, but also the way it's served.New Orleans is now dotted with dozens of taco trucks it didn't have before the storm."Because the local ingredients are different here," Williams explained, "so are the items sold. You're not going to find fried oyster tacos in many places in the world, but you can find them in New Orleans."These examples are just the tip of the iceberg.

And New Orleans, we're still making history,' Cantrell told a cheering crowd in her victory speech.Immigrant wins council seatVoters also made history in a New Orleans City Council race.Cyndi Nguyen defeated incumbent James Gray in an eastern New Orleans district.

An immigrant who fled Vietnam with her family when she was 5 in 1975, Nguyen is the organizer of a nonprofit and will be the first Vietnamese-American to serve on the council.Mayor's raceIn the mayor's race, Cantrell was the leader in most polls before the runoff election, she never trailed as votes were counted.Her opponent, former municipal Judge Desiree Charbonnet, conceded the race and congratulated Cantrell late Saturday. Later, complete returns showed Cantrell with 60 percent of the vote.The two women led a field of 18 candidates in an October general election to win runoff spots.Landrieu earned credit for accelerating the recovery from Hurricane Katrina in an administration cited for reduced blight, improvements in the celebrated tourism economy and economic development that included last week's announcement that a digital services company is bringing 2,000 new jobs to the city.But Cantrell will face lingering problems. Crime is one. Another is dysfunction at the agency overseeing the city's drinking water system and storm drainage - a problem that became evident during serious flash flooding in August.About 32 percent of the city's voters took part in last month's election.
  Instance 3: Her work as a neighborhood activist in the aftermath of Katrina in the hard-hit Broadmoor neighborhood helped her win a seat on council in 2012.Charbonnet, from a well-known political family in New Orleans, was the city's elected recorder of mortgages before she was a judge. In the campaign she made a point of saying hers was the first city office to re-open after Katrina, providing critical property records to the displaced.Former state civil court Judge Michael Bagneris, who finished third in last month's race, endorsed Cantrell, as did Troy Henry, a businessman who also ran for the post last month.University of New Orleans political science professor Edward Chervenak said the endorsements appeared to help Cantrell overcome revelations that she had used her city-issued credit card for thousands of dollars in purchases without clear indications that they were for public purposes. The money was eventually reimbursed, but questions lingered about whether she had improperly used city money for personal or campaign expenditures.VIETNG-VIETNAMNGAZ191120170008VIETNG2017urn:contentItem:60P9-1Y11-JCH9-G2S0-00000-004725712020-09-15Copyright 2017 Vietnam News Gazette All Rights ReservedVietnam News GazetteNovember 19, 2017 SundayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsEnglish USST0008X9ICITY GOVERNMENTSTX000246CAMPAIGNS &amp; ELECTIONSSTX000297CITIESST00097CZELECTIONSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST0009F7UHURRICANESN921120CCLEGISLATIVE BODIESN921100JQMAYORSST0009G89REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTSSTX001510RUNOFF ELECTIONSSTX001851WOMENSTX000984JUDGESSTX001812VOTERS &amp; VOTINGSTX000118ASIAN AMERICANSSTX000300CITY LIFEST000CZNYCOMMUNITY ACTIVISMSTX002003ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICSST0008XANDISPLACED PERSONSSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSSTX001826WEATHERSTX000887IMMIGRATIONSTX000093ANNIVERSARIESST000DM8YBUSINESS NEWSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001220NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONSSTX000549ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSTX000551ECONOMIC NEWSSTX000980JOB CREATIONST000DKUIWATER RESOURCESST000CVJYDEEDS &amp; RECORDINGSSTX000424CREDIT CARDSST000CVJYDEEDS &amp; RECORDINGSGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGS120CALIFORNIA, USAGS134LOUISIANA, USAGC385VIET NAMGC343UNITED STATES

Vanuatu Brings Climate Justice Fight to the World Court [3]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6GDJ-B9Y3-S24V-D562-00000-00Vanuatu Brings Climate Justice Fight to the World Court2025-08-03T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:05ZLexisNexisVanuatu Brings Climate Justice Fight to the World CourtAccording to Al Jazeera, the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu is taking a historic step this week as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) prepares to deliver its advisory opinion on whether governments have legal obligations to address climate change. The case, supported by more than 130 countries, could reshape international climate law and set a precedent for holding major polluters accountable.For Vanuatu, the fight is personal. Once-thriving reefs have collapsed into "coral graveyards," battered by cyclones, rising seas, earthquakes, and warming waters.
  Instance 2: Many Pacific leaders have also pushed for ecocide—the destruction of the environment—to be recognized as a crime under the International Criminal Court.While the ICJ's opinion will not be legally binding, it could become a powerful tool for small island nations demanding stronger climate action, financing, and recognition of the human rights crisis created by climate breakdown. For communities already watching their homes and histories wash away, the ruling cannot come soon enough.Every person has a role to play in this struggle. Whether it's cutting out meat and dairy, reducing plastic, or supporting organizations pushing for climate justice, small choices build momentum. The people of Vanuatu are fighting for survival—it's up to the rest of us to fight alongside them.Video Source: Associated Press/YoutubeSign These Petitions!\xa0Please sign our latest and most urgent petitions to help the planet .

Climate Justice Alliance Supports a People's AI Action Plan [6]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6GBC-TYY3-RW5V-4278-00000-00Climate Justice Alliance Supports a People's AI Action Plan2025-07-24T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:06ZLexisNexisClimate Justice Alliance Supports a People's AI Action PlanTargeted News ServiceWASHINGTONThe Climate Justice Alliance issued the following news release on July 23, 2025:* * *Climate Justice Alliance Supports a People's AI Action PlanWe need an AI Plan that protects people and the planet, not a plan that accelerates extraction*Today, the Trump Administration released an AI plan that would fast-track industry growth by rapidly expanding data centers, many of them in already climate-vulnerable environmental justice regions and creating exponential demand for dirty and dangerous energy. This plan is not about innovation for the public good. It's about deepening the grip of Big Tech and Big Oil on our economy, environment, and democracy.
  Instance 2: Massive data centers needed to power AI, which operate with little transparency, place enormous strain on already-fragile infrastructure -- reviving the coal industry and expanding natural gas, draining public water in drought-stricken regions, destabilizing power grids, and driving up utility costs and housing prices for working people. The plan also opens up the development of public lands for data centers and new fossil fuel projects, when we need to end dependency on fossil fuels.Among other harmful provisions, the plan:* Further reduces the power of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and reduces permitting requirements to fast-track data centers despite their dangers and harms to communities* Opens federal lands to data center and fossil fuel projects and paves the way for nuclear energy* Promotes military and surveillance use of AI"Training an AI model can emit almost 5 times the lifetime emissions of the average American car. When heatwaves, storms and flooding, and wildfires are raging across the country, we should do everything we can to end our reliance on fossil fuels and protect people, not develop technologies that aggressively exacerbate the climate crisis and dig us deeper into the hole of fossil fuel extraction," said Dwaign Tyndal, Executive Director of Alternatives for Community and Environment "We must question, do we really need every possible commercialized application of AI at the expense of our lives and our future generations?""This US AI Action Plan doesn't just open the door for Big Tech and Big Oil to team up, it unhinges and removes any and all doors--it opens the floodgates, continuing to kneecap our communities' rights to protect ourselves," said KD Chavez, Executive Director of Climate Justice Alliance "With tech and oil's track records on human rights and their role in the climate crisis, and what they are already doing now to force AI dominance, we need more corporate and environmental oversight, not less.""When developers look to site industrial facilities -- whether it's a power plant, an incinerator, or now, an AI data center -- they target communities where Black and Brown people live, places with little political power and towns desperate for revenue," said Sharon Lewis, Executive Director of the Connecticut Coalition for Economic and Environmental Justice. "We call them sacrifice zones because that's exactly what happens -- people sacrifice their health, their well-being, and too often, their future, so that others can benefit. We're told these data centers are harmless, but even though they might seem like they pose no risk, in reality, these energy-hungry, pollution-intensive facilities are just as damaging to our environment and health."Unchecked AI development fueled by tax incentives and profits will only pollute our water, air, and land, with deadly consequences on everyday communities.

Climate Justice Alliance supports a People's AI Action plan that is community-led, transparent, and fossil-free. Right now, we need clean supply chains that prioritize the health and safety of communities and minimize harmful environmental impacts, democratic processes of decision-making including adequate reporting, testing, and permitting, and a complete decoupling from fossil fuel energy and scams that offset energy emission claims.* * *Original text here: https://climatejusticealliance.org/climate-justice-alliance-supports-a-peoples-ai-action-plan/[Category: Environment]Contact: Contact: kayla@unbendablemedia.comCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-9343318 MSTRUCKTNS-PR9343318TARGET2025urn:contentItem:6GBC-TYY3-RW5V-4278-00000-002992192025-07-247:11 AM  ESTCopyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedTargeted News ServiceJuly 24, 2025 ThursdayNewswireNewswires &amp;

Instead of taking place in glamorous cities like Paris or Dubai, it's heading to Belem, Brazil—a city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest where poverty, deforestation, and climate risks collide. According to the Times of India, the choice of Belem is meant to spotlight the urgent realities of climate injustice, showing how environmental challenges and social inequality are inseparable.Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has argued that climate negotiations can't be staged in luxury while frontline communities bear the brunt of floods, droughts, and deforestation.
  Instance 2: Delegates will be urged to halt illegal logging, restore degraded land, and secure indigenous land rights. The symbolism of hosting COP30 in Belem is clear: this summit is not just about numbers on a page but about survival, justice, and protecting the natural systems that make life possible.If COP30 succeeds, it could be remembered as the "Summit of Solutions," a turning point where climate action was framed not as sacrifice but as opportunity. For the rest of us, it's a reminder to align our choices with the planet's needs—eating more plants, supporting climate justice, and demanding accountability from leaders. Real change begins with action, and every choice we make adds up.Sign These Petitions!\xa0Please sign our latest and most urgent petitions to help the planet.

Landmark Win for Climate Justice: CESR Welcomes Historic Advisory Opinions From International Courts [4]

These rulings mark a turning point in international law, recognizing states' legal obligations to prevent climate harm and protect the rights of present and future generations.The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in an advisory opinion released on 3 July at the request of Chile and Colombia, laid out states' legal obligations to confront the climate crisis through a human rights lens. The opinion emphasizes the vastly unequal impacts of climate breakdown and affirms the rights of frontline communities to redress and reparation.Just weeks later, on the 23rd of July, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) echoed this urgency, declaring climate change an "an existential threat" and confirming that greenhouse gas emissions are unequivocally caused by human activity.
  Instance 2: As the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) noted, this ruling "ends fossil fuel impunity" and lays the groundwork for holding major polluters accountable.Taken together, these opinions strengthen what CESR and our partners continue to champion: human rights must be at the heart of climate action. These opinions are a powerful step forward, but their full promise will only be realized if governments, institutions, and international financiers act on their guidance. As the global climate landscape evolves, CESR and our allies from all over the world will continue advancing intergenerational, rights-based climate justice.* * *Original text here: https://www.cesr.org/landmark-win-for-climate-justice-cesr-welcomes-historic-advisory-opinions-from-international-courts/[Category: Economics]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-9344700 MSTRUCKTNS-PR9344700TARGET2025urn:contentItem:6GBK-T1J3-RTD7-6148-00000-002992192025-07-257:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedTargeted News ServiceJuly 25, 2025 FridayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST0009J49HUMAN RIGHTS &amp; CIVIL LIBERTIES LAWST0008ZBXINTERNATIONAL LAWST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST000DZIFREPARATIONSST0008ZBZHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSST0008XMRLAW &amp; LEGAL SYSTEMST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX000639ENVIRONMENTAL LAWST0009QUFISLANDS &amp; REEFSSTX000873HUMAN RIGHTSST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST000DL6MSUSTAINABILITYST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSSTX001348POLLUTIONSTX001941ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION &amp; POLICYSTX001660SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTSTX000594EMISSIONSN922110CCLAW COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALSST0009ZVDSUPREME COURTSST000D8B1GREENHOUSE GASESSTX001937ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORSSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSN922110EMINTERNATIONAL COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALSST000DSGIFOSSIL FUELSSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESSTX001660SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTSTX000594EMISSIONSGC343UNITED STATESBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Greenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjALegislationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhGMTVENjdEQTUzNDVGMDlBMjQzMTE3MDRCQ0UwQUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkJDMzEzRDkxMDVBNDA3N0FDRjNDODI2NUIzMzZDMDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjI3QUU4NUZEQzZFNEYzRThENkZBRTA1MkUyQTAwQTAGreenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkVGNUU3RDc3MUVENDYwRjkxMEQwMDVGNTcxRTJDODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REZDN0NDN0QzNDUwNDA4NjlENDAxODkzMUNGOUNCQTMLegislationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhGMTVENjdEQTUzNDVGMDlBMjQzMTE3MDRCQ0UwQUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAInternational LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkNBOTBFMURCNEE3NEE5OEIwNjA1MDE4OTIxNEU1ODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTYzQjQyOTBDNzNDNEI2QUIyOTE2MEYyMTdBQTlDMzIGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdDODU0RjdGQ0JENEQ5RkI0MEU5MDA3NUMxQzEwNTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTUzQTNGNUEzODNDNDhCRTg2MDNCNDE3MkU4NkE1NjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTZCMUU5OEUyREYzNDM4MjkzMkFCQzA0MTM3QUY1NjQJurisdictionZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjAxNThGMjZDN0E2NDlEMzg3RUI5MTAwNDY1OUU1QTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzY4MUJFQkI2ODRDNDYzOTlDMUMzNTAwOTcyNEI4NzYTribunalsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkIxQTU1MkJBMEY1NDY4MDhBODUxRTJBNjVCREFDRDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjhBNEU2OUVGMEJGNDQzNUFEODk2MUY5QTRFMThCQjU

It claims to speed up environmental review and infrastructure projects, but in reality, it speeds up disaster. It does nothing to ensure efficient environmental oversight and strips already-limited legal recourse from communities--especially those most impacted by pollution--to defend themselves against polluters and powerful industry interests.By narrowing what qualifies as a "major federal action" and weakening the requirement to study long-term or cumulative impacts, this bill strips away essential tools like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) that Tribal Nations and frontline communities use to protect their lands, waters, cultural resources, and public health.

Weakening NEPA would strip communities of the ability to challenge harmful industrial projects that pollute air and water, accelerate climate change, and violate Tribal sovereignty.NEPA acts as the legal thread connecting foundational public health and environmental protection laws like the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act.

  Instance 3: Weakening NEPA would strip communities of the ability to challenge harmful industrial projects that pollute air and water, accelerate climate change, and violate Tribal sovereignty.NEPA acts as the legal thread connecting foundational public health and environmental protection laws like the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act. Undermining it would erode critical environmental protections and public oversight, especially for frontline, Indigenous, and environmental justice communities."This Administration has set no guardrails for big business and polluters. DOE's proposed rollback paves the way for more extraction, more emissions, and more environmental harm-compounding the public health crisis and accelerating land grabs from frontline, Indigenous, and environmental justice communities," said KD Chavez, Executive Director of Climate Justice Alliance. "NEPA does not operate in a vacuum--it's the legal thread that binds together our most critical environmental and cultural protection laws. Gutting it signals a dangerous disregard for public health, Tribal rights, and the future of our planet.""DOE's rule guts public protections and shuts out frontline communities from decisions that impact their health.
  Instance 4: Communities already burdened by pollution deserve stronger protections, not fewer. We need transparency, accountability, and a real voice for our communities. Not more loopholes," stated Meisei Gonzalez, Climate Justice &amp; Clean Air Advocate for GreenLatinos."NEPA is one of the few tools our communities have to challenge harmful projects that threaten our health and environment. For decades, Indigenous, low-income communities, and communities of color have borne the brunt of toxic pollution from energy infrastructure that poison their air, water, and land, costing lives and futures. Gutting NEPA undermines meaningful public participation, silences frontline voices, and deepens sacrifice zones.
  Instance 5: Gutting NEPA undermines meaningful public participation, silences frontline voices, and deepens sacrifice zones. As environmental protections are stripped away, NEPA must be protected and strengthened to uphold health, justice, and democracy," shared Anastasia Gordon, Director of Federal Policy, WE ACT for Environmental Justice.The rollback could lead to an increase in large-scale energy infrastructure projects without proper environmental review or community consultation, resulting in irreversible damage to ecosystems and sacred lands. As natural resources continue to deplete and the climate crisis intensifies, stripping away these protections is both reckless and unjust.In their letter, the coalition urges the Department of Energy to:* Reinstate all NEPA implementation procedures within the Code of Federal Regulations, where they are subject to public rulemaking, transparency, and legal enforcement;* Reverse the reclassification of previously reviewed actions to ensure no energy-related activities are excluded from NEPA solely at the agency's discretion;* Restore NEPA applicability to Presidential permit processes to protect communities impacted by international energy infrastructure.* Meet the legal and ethical responsibility of ensuring that federally approved projects:- Do not bypass environmental safeguards;- Do not marginalize Tribal Nations and frontline communities;- Are evaluated through a public, science-based, and just process.Click here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l-OxuSGLSnlXTaM_9FwF9S31bcdAxEeRuRAfteSvW5U/edit?tab=t.0) to read the full NEPA Comment Letter.###About Climate Justice AllianceCJA is a growing member-based organization of nearly 100 urban and rural frontline and tribal communities, organizations, and supporting networks working to build a Just Transition away from the extractive economy and toward a more regenerative one.

The ICJ made clear that the full enjoyment of human rights cannot be ensured without protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment. The world's highest court stressed that states have a duty to act now, regulate the activities of private actors and cooperate to protect current and future generations and ecosystems from the worsening impacts of human induced climate change.
  Instance 2: The ICJ made clear that the full enjoyment of human rights cannot be ensured without protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment. The world's highest court stressed that states have a duty to act now, regulate the activities of private actors and cooperate to protect current and future generations and ecosystems from the worsening impacts of human induced climate change. This unprecedented opinion will bolster the hundreds of ongoing and upcoming climate litigation cases around the world, where people seek justice for the livelihoods that have been snatched away and the damage caused by major polluters.Today's opinion is a landmark moment for climate justice and accountability. The ICJ made clear that the full enjoyment of human rights cannot be ensured without protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment.Mandi Mudarikwa, Head of Strategic Litigation, Amnesty InternationalCandy Ofime, Researcher and Legal Advisor in the Climate Justice Team at Amnesty International, said:'In light of the polluters pay principle, the ICJ established that states' failure to take action to protect the climate system- including through continued fossil fuel production, licencing or the provision of subsidies to fossil fuel companies-may constitute an internationally wrongful act. Despite big polluters' suggestion to the contrary, the ICJ recognized that it is scientifically possible to determine each state's contribution to the climate crisis, taking into account current and cumulative emissions.

Despite big polluters' suggestion to the contrary, the ICJ recognized that it is scientifically possible to determine each state's contribution to the climate crisis, taking into account current and cumulative emissions. States, particularly historically high greenhouse gas emitters, must take responsibility and repair the climate harms they have caused and provide guarantees of non-repetition.'Following in the footsteps of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the ICJ reaffirmed that climate change can lead to the forced displacement of people seeking safety, including across borders, emphasizing that in such circumstances, non-refoulement protections applies.
  Instance 4: States, particularly historically high greenhouse gas emitters, must take responsibility and repair the climate harms they have caused and provide guarantees of non-repetition.'Following in the footsteps of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the ICJ reaffirmed that climate change can lead to the forced displacement of people seeking safety, including across borders, emphasizing that in such circumstances, non-refoulement protections applies. The ICJ recognized that climate change constitutes 'an existential problem of planetary proportions that imperils all forms of life and the very health of our planet'. It stressed that a complete solution to this 'life-daunting' and 'self-inflicted' crisis does not only require contribution of all fields of knowledge but also 'human will, at individual, social and political levels to change our current way of life to secure a future for ourselves and those who are yet to come.' Delivering a message to the climate justice movement worldwide, the ICJ expressed 'hope that its conclusions would inform and guide social and political action to address the ongoing climate crisis.'Amnesty International expresses the utmost gratitude to the Pacific Islands students whose innovative and inspiring global advocacy was critical in making today a reality.ASEANT-ASEANTRIB23072025000015001ASEANT2025urn:contentItem:6GBM-0CX3-S24C-B04W-00000-004341372025-07-25Copyright 2025 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedASEAN TribuneJuly 23, 2025 WednesdayNewspaperNewspapersEnglish USAMNESTY INTERNATIONALST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST0008ZBXINTERNATIONAL LAWST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST0009FYFLIFE FORMSST0008ZBZHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSSTX002021SAFETYST0008XMRLAW &amp; LEGAL SYSTEMST0008XANDISPLACED PERSONSST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX001946IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP &amp; DISPLACEMENTSTX000873HUMAN RIGHTSST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSSTX001348POLLUTIONSTX001040LITIGATIONSTX000594EMISSIONSST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYN922110CCLAW COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALSST0009ZVDSUPREME COURTSST000D8B1GREENHOUSE GASESST0009FJKNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSN922110EMINTERNATIONAL COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALSST000DSGIFOSSIL FUELSSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESSTX000594EMISSIONSST000A26SEARTHGC343UNITED STATESBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Greenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjALegislationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhGMTVENjdEQTUzNDVGMDlBMjQzMTE3MDRCQ0UwQUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Greenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkVGNUU3RDc3MUVENDYwRjkxMEQwMDVGNTcxRTJDODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REZDN0NDN0QzNDUwNDA4NjlENDAxODkzMUNGOUNCQTMLegislationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhGMTVENjdEQTUzNDVGMDlBMjQzMTE3MDRCQ0UwQUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAInternational LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General 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

Undermining it would erode critical environmental protections and public oversight, especially for frontline, Indigenous, and environmental justice communities."This Administration has set no guardrails for big business and polluters. DOE's proposed rollback paves the way for more extraction, more emissions, and more environmental harm-compounding the public health crisis and accelerating land grabs from frontline, Indigenous, and environmental justice communities," said KD Chavez, Executive Director of Climate Justice Alliance. "NEPA does not operate in a vacuum--it's the legal thread that binds together our most critical environmental and cultural protection laws. Gutting it signals a dangerous disregard for public health, Tribal rights, and the future of our planet.""DOE's rule guts public protections and shuts out frontline communities from decisions that impact their health.
  Instance 5: Communities already burdened by pollution deserve stronger protections, not fewer. We need transparency, accountability, and a real voice for our communities. Not more loopholes," stated Meisei Gonzalez, Climate Justice &amp; Clean Air Advocate for GreenLatinos."NEPA is one of the few tools our communities have to challenge harmful projects that threaten our health and environment. For decades, Indigenous, low-income communities, and communities of color have borne the brunt of toxic pollution from energy infrastructure that poison their air, water, and land, costing lives and futures. Gutting NEPA undermines meaningful public participation, silences frontline voices, and deepens sacrifice zones.

AI AND CLIMATE JUSTICE: BALANCING RISK WITH OPPORTUNITY [10]

In moments of alignment, their fields reinforce each other, giving new vitality and perspective.Yet not all orbits are stable and the gravitational field of AI is growing at an accelerated pace. The ultimate danger we face is the potential for AI to swallow everything around it, much like a black hole.AI has the potential to illuminate patterns in climate data, sharpen models and increase our chances to forecast an uncertain future.
  Instance 2: The risk is that AI becomes the superstar rather than co-star, disrupting the equilibrium of the whole system. The question, therefore, is not whether or not these two spheres can coexist, but whether or not they can do so in mutually reinforcing terms.In this time of rapid information consumption, one of the greatest challenges may simply be to open the door to conversation. In other words, not to idealize or dismiss AI, but to collaborate on conventions, best practices and boundaries that will govern its development within the climate realm in general and climate justice more specifically. Indifference can relegate the silent stakeholder to the sidelines, and the climate community could miss an opportunity to be fully engaged in what could possibly be one of the most transformative developments of our era.Understanding where climate justice and AI meet should not be a pure academic exercise either. It should require dialogue that flows between technical, ethical, community, policy, political, environmental and social spaces.

The effort should be rooted in the needs of the day-to-day lives of people most vulnerable to both climate hazards and technological exclusion.In an initial effort to try to understand the relationships and tensions between AI and climate justice, we can use a popular strategist's toolkit: the SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, threat) analysis.

By examining AI and climate justice in the context of this analysis, we can start exploring what this relationship might look like.AI's ability to quickly process massive, unrelated datasets, from weather patterns to social media sentiment, is transforming climate work across different fields. Emergency responders can use AI to optimize response times following hurricanes or wildfires.

Emergency responders can use AI to optimize response times following hurricanes or wildfires. In Southeast Asia and East Africa, AI-powered early warning systems are already saving lives.
  Instance 6: In an ironic twist, training AI models takes vast amounts of energyenergy that is often generated by fossil fuels. Research shows that building one advanced language model can create as much carbon as five cars emit during their lifetimes. If AI is to be part of the climate solution, it first needs to fix its own contribution to the problem.Yet there are also numerous opportunities to use AI for climate justice, which might help mitigate some of these weaknesses.One of the most promising opportunities is community-driven AI. Local communities worldwide are taking the lead in developing their own toolsadapting AI to Indigenous knowledge, cultural values and local priorities. For example, in Pacific Island states, community-driven drone programs closely track erosion and provide guidance for adaptation.
  Instance 7: Simply digitizing knowledge for extraction without prioritizing values does not lead to real progress. In this regard, the next decade will be crucial. With climate hazards intensifying and AI systems becoming more powerful, the echo of our choices will shape the future more and more.We can choose how AI and climate justice interact. To make that choice wisely, we must listen not only to the facts; we also need to realize that climate change is more than a data problemit is a humanitarian and social crisis. To leverage AI technology properly, we need to regulate activities we know are harmful to society and to the most vulnerable, and we need to start co-creating new tools that include the voices of those who are too commonly marginalized.
  Instance 8: Artificial intelligence helps us expand our rational intelligence beyond limits that we would have never imagined even a few years ago. Let us not forget we also need emotional intelligence.Marco Tedesco is Lamont Research Professor of Marine and Polar Geophysics at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), which is part of the Columbia Climate School.

Why Public Health in Africa Begins With Climate Justice [10]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6G3J-SFD3-S762-X2KK-00000-00Why Public Health in Africa Begins With Climate Justice2025-06-21T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:05ZLexisNexisWhy Public Health in Africa Begins With Climate JusticeTèmít??p?? B??ládal??Africa's current public health crisis cannot be separated from the devastating effects of climate change. Poor health outcomes on the continent are often, and rightly so, linked to other issues like funding, infrastructure, and policy issues.
  Instance 2: However, climate change is becoming an undeniable threat to our fundamental right to health as Africans. The climate crisis imposes additional health burdens on the world's most vulnerable populations, such as people in low-income communities, women, and children. To protect people's rights to health, governments and other stakeholders must work to mainstream climate justice and centre human rights and equity in health policy-making. Additionally, governments must prioritise justice in climate mitigation and adaptation strategies at all levels and strengthen climate financing for public health uses. Climate change events adversely affect not just mortality and morbidity rates across the continent but also our health systems and infrastructure.
  Instance 3: A World Health Organization assessment concluded that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year, with between US$ 2-4 billion worth of direct damage costs to health by 2030. Climate change represents a significant public health burden to Africans, even though the continent contributes the least to global greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, it has become imperative to focus on climate justice as a critical factor in improving public health in Africa. Climate justice is based on the idea that those who have historically contributed the most to climate change should bear the most responsibility for mitigating its impact. And this must be at the heart of Africa's public health reforms.

Climate justice is based on the idea that those who have historically contributed the most to climate change should bear the most responsibility for mitigating its impact. And this must be at the heart of Africa's public health reforms. The concept of climate justice has been codified into the legal regime on the environment.
  Instance 5: Climate justice is based on the idea that those who have historically contributed the most to climate change should bear the most responsibility for mitigating its impact. And this must be at the heart of Africa's public health reforms. The concept of climate justice has been codified into the legal regime on the environment. Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration introduces the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. This principle acknowledges that every country has a common responsibility to protect the environment.
  Instance 6: However, countries contributing more to climate change have a greater responsibility to reduce their carbon emissions. These countries must also acknowledge the special needs and interests of developing economies negatively impacted by climate change and make financial contributions towards climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. At the core of climate justice is climate finance. Developed nations pledged in 2009 to mobilise $100 billion annually by 2020. This benchmark was achieved in 2022.
  Instance 7: It is also important to advocate not just for the availability of funds but also for climate finance to be tied to realising public health objectives in Africa. This can take the form of promoting and investing in sustainable practices within the health system such as adopting energy-efficient infrastructure and renewable energy sources and introducing waste reduction protocols within the system that do not compromise quality of care for patients. Also, attaching health welfare initiatives and conditional cash transfers to climate objectives can help promote climate justice at all levels of care particularly at the primary healthcare level. For example, patients can be encouraged to recycle plastic waste in exchange for malaria medications or free consultations at health facilities in their communities. Africa's peculiar vulnerability to climate change is tied to underlying socio-economic inequalities.
  Instance 8: Poverty, political instability, and weak infrastructure make it harder for communities in Africa to recover from climate shocks. Add that to the lasting impact of global inequalities and the continued mindless extraction of natural resources on the continent to fulfill capitalist wants, and it is clear why African communities face greater risks with fewer resources to adapt.According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, 17 out of the 20 countries most threatened by climate change are in Africa. Climate justice lies in recognising these inequalities and adopting equitable strategies to reduce their impact. To improve public health, climate adaptation and mitigation strategies must be integrated into health policies. Climate mitigation efforts that impact community resources like land and people's livelihoods must be implemented with the input of the community, bearing in mind how losses of livelihood and other social injustices can negatively impact health.

Pulitzer Center-supported stories--as an integral element in this process--is a testament to the fact that journalism can create impact that goes beyond the realm of newsrooms," says Grenti Paramitha, who first conceptualized ISF and is the Pulitzer Center's program manager of education in Southeast Asia.Since the beginning of ISF, the Pulitzer Center has awarded 55 ISF microgrants, starting in Southeast Asia, and expanding to South Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
Chicago Teachers' "Climate Justice" Collides With $734M School Budget Crisis [5]

Supporters tout the deal as a "strategic use of capital," but critics say it reflects misplaced priorities in a school district already struggling with a budget deficit, falling enrollment and chronically low academic achievement.READ: Tick-Tock Goes The Epstein Tape: AG Bondi Explains Missing Minute As Conspiracy Theories Swirl"Instead of finding ways to improve student performance in the classroom, the Chicago Teachers Union spent their bargaining time negotiating for costly, environmental policies in their latest contract," Mailee Smith, senior director of labor policy for the Illinois Policy Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. "Chicagoans just want somewhere safe to send their kids so that they will learn how to read and become independent.
  Instance 2: Rather than support spending cuts, CTU President Stacy Davis Gates has called for "taxing the rich" to fill the gap.READ: Former Illinois Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. Eyes Congressional Comeback Amidst Past ScandalsUnion officials have adopted the "bargaining for the common good" framework, which emphasizes "climate justice" alongside other left-wing demands, such as support for Black Lives Matter, opposition to collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and resistance to charter schools."What our union does, I think, better than most places is we connect the dots," CTU President Gates said in a June 2024 interview with E&amp;E News. "Poverty doesn't just manifest in school policy; it manifests in environmental policy and manifests in housing policy. So the impacts that we are experiencing in our school communities are connected."While the union expands its "common good" political mission, student outcomes in Chicago remain bleak.Only one in three CPS students can read at grade level, and one in five can perform math at grade level, according to 2024 data analyzed by the Illinois Policy Institute.
Catholic bishops from Asia, Africa, Latin America demand climate justice [4]

As a heat wave hits much of Europe, including the Vatican, the continental bishops conferences of the Global South penned a first-ever joint ecological appeal ahead of the next U.N. climate conference in November in BelÃ©m, Brazil.
  Instance 2: They blasted the "openly denialist and apathetic stance" of "so-called elites of power" in the industrialized world who pressure their governments to back off sufficient mitigation and adaptation measures. The proposals merely perpetuate the exploitation of God's creation and its most vulnerable people, when what is really needed is the complete abandonment of fossil fuels and a new economic model that values the common good, the bishops said. Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, the archbishop of Kinshasa, Congo, said the document isn't just an analysis, "but a cry of dignity." "We, the pastors of the South, demand climate justice as a human and spiritual right," he told a Vatican news conference in prepared remarks. The document said it was "seriously contradictory" to use profits from oil extraction to finance green energy transition, saying carbon markets and mining for clean technologies were "false solutions." This "green economy" really serves as an "ecological restructuring of capitalism" that just concentrates power again in corporations and regulatory systems, they said. Francis made caring for the environment a hallmark of his pontificate and penned a landmark encyclical that has spawned global movements to care for the planet.

On top of that, newly marked-up appropriations bills pave the way for a level of harm we haven't seen in generations; a recipe for disaster is being legislated.If enacted, these bills would mean devastation for millions of people. Communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis, and those already grappling with extreme weather, will see health, economic, and environmental conditions deteriorate further.Rolling back critical protections, including vehicle and methane emissions regulations, sewage sludge risk assessments, regulations that address air pollution emissions from power plants and the crude oil and gas sectors, hazardous waste regulations, and vehicle emissions fuel standards, among many others, is ill-intentioned.

According to news reporting out of the University of Technology Sydney by NewsRx editors, research stated, "Indigenous peoples have acted across a wide range of fields to address climate change."  Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Technology Sydney: "In all contexts they encounter the barriers of established colonial relations of land and state sovereignty. Indigenous-centred agendas are defined in articulation, with and against these dominant regimes.
  Instance 2: Indigenous-centred agendas are defined in articulation, with and against these dominant regimes. In this respect they are 'immanent', locked into in dialectical struggles for sovereignty. Such contestations are inherently generative: they force new issues onto the agenda, enabling transformation."  According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "In this special issue, transformative possibilities are discussed across the carbon cycle: at the point of extraction and emission; the application of mitigation and renewables; carbon sinks and 'nature-based' solutions'; adaptation and conservation; and issues of governance and influence."

Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Issues Commentary: AI and Climate Justice - Balancing Risk With Opportunity [11]

In moments of alignment, their fields reinforce each other, giving new vitality and perspective.Yet not all orbits are stable and the gravitational field of AI is growing at an accelerated pace. The ultimate danger we face is the potential for AI to swallow everything around it, much like a black hole.AI has the potential to illuminate patterns in climate data, sharpen models and increase our chances to forecast an uncertain future.
  Instance 2: The risk is that AI becomes the superstar rather than co-star, disrupting the equilibrium of the whole system. The question, therefore, is not whether or not these two spheres can coexist, but whether or not they can do so in mutually reinforcing terms.In this time of rapid information consumption, one of the greatest challenges may simply be to open the door to conversation. In other words, not to idealize or dismiss AI, but to collaborate on conventions, best practices and boundaries that will govern its development within the climate realm in general and climate justice more specifically. Indifference can relegate the silent stakeholder to the sidelines, and the climate community could miss an opportunity to be fully engaged in what could possibly be one of the most transformative developments of our era.Understanding where climate justice and AI meet should not be a pure academic exercise either. It should require dialogue that flows between technical, ethical, community, policy, political, environmental and social spaces.

It should require dialogue that flows between technical, ethical, community, policy, political, environmental and social spaces. The effort should be rooted in the needs of the day-to-day lives of people most vulnerable to both climate hazards and technological exclusion.In an initial effort to try to understand the relationships and tensions between AI and climate justice, we can use a popular strategist's toolkit: the SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, threat) analysis.

By examining AI and climate justice in the context of this analysis, we can start exploring what this relationship might look like.AI's ability to quickly process massive, unrelated datasets, from weather patterns to social media sentiment, is transforming climate work across different fields. Emergency responders can use AI to optimize response times following hurricanes or wildfires.

Emergency responders can use AI to optimize response times following hurricanes or wildfires. In Southeast Asia and East Africa, AI-powered early warning systems are already saving lives.
  Instance 6: In an ironic twist, training AI models takes vast amounts of energy--energy that is often generated by fossil fuels. Research shows that building one advanced language model can create as much carbon as five cars emit during their lifetimes. If AI is to be part of the climate solution, it first needs to fix its own contribution to the problem.Yet there are also numerous opportunities to use AI for climate justice, which might help mitigate some of these weaknesses.One of the most promising opportunities is community-driven AI. Local communities worldwide are taking the lead in developing their own tools--adapting AI to Indigenous knowledge, cultural values and local priorities. For example, in Pacific Island states, community-driven drone programs closely track erosion and provide guidance for adaptation.
  Instance 7: Simply digitizing knowledge for extraction without prioritizing values does not lead to real progress. In this regard, the next decade will be crucial. With climate hazards intensifying and AI systems becoming more powerful, the echo of our choices will shape the future more and more.We can choose how AI and climate justice interact. To make that choice wisely, we must listen not only to the facts; we also need to realize that climate change is more than a data problem--it is a humanitarian and social crisis. To leverage AI technology properly, we need to regulate activities we know are harmful to society and to the most vulnerable, and we need to start co-creating new tools that include the voices of those who are too commonly marginalized.

Teachers Union's 'Climate Justice' Goals Meet Fiscal Reality As Students Fail [4]

Supporters tout the deal as a “strategic use of capital,” but critics say it reflects misplaced priorities in a school district already struggling with a budget deficit, falling enrollment and chronically low academic achievement. “Instead of finding ways to improve student performance in the classroom, the Chicago Teachers Union spent their bargaining time negotiating for costly, environmental policies in their latest contract,” Mailee Smith, senior director of labor policy for the Illinois Policy Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.
  Instance 2: “This isn't an added expense - it's a more strategic use of capital funds,” Board Member Yesenia Lopez said about the program. “By investing in clean energy today, CPS can reduce utility and maintenance costs over time - allowing more resources to flow to our students.” Still, CPS must grapple with a $734 million budget shortfall. Rather than support spending cuts, CTU President Stacy Davis Gates has called for “taxing the rich” to fill the gap.Union officials have adopted the “bargaining for the common good” framework, which emphasizes “climate justice” alongside other left-wing demands, such as support for Black Lives Matter, opposition to collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and resistance to charter schools.“What our union does, I think, better than most places is we connect the dots,” CTU President Gates said in a June 2024 interview with E&amp;E News. “Poverty doesn't just manifest in school policy; it manifests in environmental policy and manifests in housing policy. So the impacts that we are experiencing in our school communities are connected.”While the union expands its “common good” political mission, student outcomes in Chicago remain bleak.Only one in three CPS students can read at grade level, and one in five can perform math at grade level, according to 2024 data analyzed by the Illinois Policy Institute.

The abrupt cancellation of these funds has caused widespread disruption to ongoing projects and left many organizations struggling to move forward without the promised financial support.
  Instance 3: The administration's actions put the health and well-being of communities in jeopardy, and we fully support the fight to restore these grants and continue this important work."Roos also submitted a declaration to the court in support of the lawsuit in which she highlighted that EPA's actions left hundreds of grantees struggling to understand why their funding was abruptly frozen or terminated. Despite EPA's claims of conducting an "individualized, grant-by-grant review," many grantees received vague termination notices, which cited "changes in agency priorities," with no clear explanation or documentation to support these decisions. This lack of transparency and failure to provide necessary records further deepens the disruption faced by communities already impacted pollution and environmental injustice.The lawsuit seeks to restore funding for community-driven environmental and climate justice projects that were unlawfully halted. Lawyers for Good Government, Earthjustice, Southern Environmental Law Center and the Public Rights Project represent a coalition of over 350 grant recipients who are fighting for the continuation of projects that are essential for the health, resilience, and safety of their communities.###ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION NETWORKFounded in 2017, the Environmental Protection Network harnesses the expertise of more than 650 former EPA career staff and confirmation-level appointees from Democratic and Republican administrations to provide the unique perspective of former scientists and regulators with decades of historical knowledge and subject matter expertise.* * *Original text here: https://www.environmentalprotectionnetwork.org/20250626_grant-termination-suit_release/[Category: Environment]Contact:CONTACT:Aaron Bharucha, Public Relations Associate(509) 429-1699 and epn-press@environmentalprotectionnetwork.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesT83-SS-FR-9321653 T83-SS-FRTNS-PR9321653TARGET2025urn:contentItem:6G4T-3NT3-RS9N-91ST-00000-002992192025-06-2810:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedTargeted News ServiceJune 27, 2025 FridayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHUS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCYEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTUSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTX001648SUITS &amp; CLAIMSST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONN924120CCCONSERVATIONST00097CHENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTSST0009SI7ENVIRONMENTALISMSTX001040LITIGATIONST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGESTX000639ENVIRONMENTAL LAWSTX000813GRANTS &amp; GIFTSSTX001348POLLUTIONN813312MMENVIRONMENTAL &amp; WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONSSTX001220NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONSSTX001372PRESS RELEASESSTX002021SAFETYSTX001780US ENVIRONMENTAL LAWST000A7ISASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONSN920000CCGOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONN921000CCGOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICESN928120KMINTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCEST0009G89REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTSST000DNULHEALTH EQUITYN541110GMLAWYERSST0009EVKMEDICINE &amp; HEALTHST0008X12POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp; REMEDIATIONST000DNULHEALTH EQUITYN541110GMLAWYERSGS124WASHINGTON DC, USAGC343UNITED STATES
Social protection essential for climate justice in Small Island Developing States [5]

Meanwhile, a lack of access to social protection is limiting their ability to cope with and adapt to climate-related shocks, the brief indicates.Only 43.5 per cent of the population of SIDS currently have access to social protection, compared with a global average of 52.4 per cent. The main cause of the gap is underinvestment, notes the brief, with SIDS only allocating 7.1 per cent of GDP to social protection and health -- far below the global average of 19.3 per cent.Yet, SIDS can build and develop their social protection systems by closing these gaps.
  Instance 2: For some SIDS, gradually increasing social security contributions and income and wealth taxes may be an option, outlines the brief. Other options include integrating climate considerations into social protection policies, reforming fossil fuel subsidies, and pension fund greening.Support from the international community remains essential, in light of the difficult fiscal environment that many SIDS face.The brief further warns that current reductions in international solidarity imperil SIDS and prevent them from building social protection systems that are strong enough to withstand the climate crisis. To protect those on the frontlines of the crisis, the brief calls for international financial assistance to be anchored in climate justice. This means recognizing that a that SIDS bear a negligible historical responsibility for emissions, and therefore the climate crisis. As such, international financial assistance, should include loss and damage assigned to supporting social protection.* * *REPORT: https://www.ilo.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/ILO%20brief_Closing%20social%20protection%20gaps%20in%20SIDS.pdf***Original text here: https://www.ilo.org/resource/news/social-protection-essential-climate-justice-small-island-developing-statesCopyright Targeted News Services-9270560 T80MV-MgEdTNS-PR9270560TARGET2025urn:contentItem:6FWB-49D3-RTJV-63B1-00000-002992192025-05-2410:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedTargeted News ServiceMay 23, 2025 FridayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHINTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATIONST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTX000950INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSSTX001965SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLEST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST0009QUFISLANDS &amp; REEFSST00097CKLABOR DEPARTMENTSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX000816GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCTST000DEUISEVERE WEATHERST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSST000DS4VSEA LEVEL CHANGESSTX001826WEATHERST0008X60SOCIAL SECURITYSTX000594EMISSIONSSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESSTX000594EMISSIONSGX452GENEVA, SWITZERLANDGC327SWITZERLAND

The lack of humanity."Key takeaways from the addressGaza "A moral crisis that challenges the global conscience"Ukraine Call for a "just and lasting peace" based on the UN Charter, international law and resolutionsAuthoritarianism A "global contagion", with political repression, attacks on minorities and shrinking civic spaceClimate justice Bold action needed to cut emissions; clean energy transition must uphold human rightsDigital threats Concern over algorithmic spread of hate and falsehoods; manipulation via social mediaCall to action "Human rights are the solution, foundation of peace and engine of progress"UN staff 'neither dead nor alive'He described UN staff in Gaza as working in "unimaginable conditions", many of them so depleted they "say they feel neither dead nor alive".Since late May, he noted, more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed trying to access food not in combat, but "in desperation while the entire population starves"."This is not just a humanitarian crisis. It is a moral crisis that challenges the global conscience."Ready to scale up aidMr. Guterres said the UN stands ready to dramatically scale up humanitarian operations "as we successfully did during the previous pause in fighting", but called for an "immediate and permanent ceasefire", the unconditional release of all hostages and full humanitarian access."At the same time, we need urgent, concrete and irreversible steps towards a two-State solution," he stressed.He also spoke about other conflicts, including Sudan as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where he called for a "just and lasting peace" based on the UN Charter, international law and relevant UN resolutions.UN Photo/Eskinder DebebeSecretary-General Guterres (left) addresses Amnesty International's Global Assembly via video link.Rising authoritarianismThe Secretary-General warned that authoritarian tactics are on the rise globally."We are witnessing a surge in repressive tactics aiming at corroding respect for human rights," he said.

"And these are contaminating some democracies."Political opposition movements are being crushed, accountability mechanisms dismantled, journalists and activists silenced, civic space strangled and minorities scapegoated.Rights of women and girls in particular are being rolled back, most starkly, he said, in Afghanistan."This is not a series of isolated events. It is a global contagion."Weaponization of technologyHe decried the growing weaponization of digital platforms, saying algorithms are "boosting the worst of humanity, rewarding falsehoods, fuelling racism and misogyny and deepening division".He called on governments to uphold the Global Digital Compact adopted by countries at the UN General Assembly last September and to take stronger action to combat online hate and disinformation.ICJ-CIJ/Frank van BeekActivists outside the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague as the Court delivers its advisory opinion on the obligations of States in respect of climate change.Climate justice is human rightsTurning to climate, Mr. Guterres described the environmental emergency as a "human rights catastrophe", with the poorest and most vulnerable communities suffering most.He welcomed the International Court of Justice (ICJ)'s advisory opinion this week, affirming that climate change is a human rights issue and that States have obligations under international law to protect the global climate system.But, he cautioned against a transition to clean energy that sacrifices human rights."We cannot accept a clean energy future built on dirty practices...We cannot accept enormous violations of human rights, many of them against children, in the name of climate progress."He called for urgent emissions cuts, a just transition away from fossil fuels and real financing for developing countries to adapt, build resilience and recover from loss and damage.A legacy of activismThe Secretary-General concluded by praising Amnesty International's decades of activism, calling its work "indispensable" to the global human rights movement."When you stand for human rights, you stand with what is right," he told delegates."Your courage continues to change lives. Your persistence is shifting the course of history.

  Instance 7: It's going to be hard. But overall, the students had an amazing experience. There were moments I would hear about in weekly meetings (with Franco and Hogue) where a lecture went really well and blew the students' minds."Franco, who researches climate change and homelessness in California, was similarly impressed with the students' tenacity in the course."Being a part of high school students' experience taking a UC-level course on climate justice was incredibly rewarding, and an immense learning opportunity," she said. "It was fascinating to see how their diverse backgrounds shaped their lived experiences and how they connected the content to their own communities and the issues they faced locally. For instance, students from Southern California engaged differently than those from New York, as the climate change risks in their regions vary greatly."She said navigating high school and the demands of a college-level program presented a steep learning curve for the enrolled students."It was crucial to consider everyone's capacity when developing lesson plans and providing support," she said.

These community-based initiatives include improving natural disaster preparedness, expanding workforce development opportunities, improving and monitoring air quality, mitigating stormwater and flood damage, combat high energy costs, and improving community members' ability to participate in decision-making and permitting processes that impact their health and environment.Southern Environmental Law Center, Earthjustice, Public Rights Project, and Lawyers for Good Government filed the challenge on behalf of ECJ grant recipients to seek the nationwide restoration of the program and to require the administration to reinstate awarded grant agreements."Unlawfully ending this program threatens the ability of local governments to protect their people and the environment," said Jon Miller, Chief Program Officer, Public Rights Project. "This case isn't just about restoring grant funding in a handful of places -- it's about restoring critical services and projects in areas of the country with the greatest need.

Climate justice itself is an often overlooked aspect of the effects of climate change, and these issues, unlike disasters, can be felt every day. While strides have been made to address these issues, the people and their communities continue to fight for change, and for previous changes to remain. As NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said, "The gains we fought for, and won, are being erased," so fighting, particularly by the people that live in these communities, is more important than ever.A huge part of the Climate Justice Hub's mission is to change the way these communities are supported.

"It was started to offer a kind of corrective to the ways that universities and colleges typically interact with community organizations," Kobie Coleman, professor at Brooklyn College and the classes and curriculum lead of The Hub, told The Meridian. "There have been partnerships between schools and the communities served before, but those partnerships often went one way."By providing the tools for change directly to communities, people are empowered from within rather than relying on outside forces.
  Instance 5: "It was started to offer a kind of corrective to the ways that universities and colleges typically interact with community organizations," Kobie Coleman, professor at Brooklyn College and the classes and curriculum lead of The Hub, told The Meridian. "There have been partnerships between schools and the communities served before, but those partnerships often went one way."By providing the tools for change directly to communities, people are empowered from within rather than relying on outside forces. This is especially true for matters of climate justice, where a lack of grassroots resources has often exacerbated these issues in a city already teeming with them. Maria "Mariposa" Teresa Fernández, professor at Lehman College and veteran environmental activist, was born in the 70s, a time when the Bronx was on fire. She recalls, "That era just really impressed upon me what the impact of pollution can have on the spirit, and obviously on people's health.
  Instance 6: I remember just the smell of Hunts Point being different and crossing over the Hunts Point Drawbridge and being able to smell what smelled like sewage." The Bronx fires, unfortunately, received little support from within or outside the community, and many of the challenges Bronx organizations face today can be traced back to those fires.Victoria Moran Garcia, a student at Lehman College who spoke at the event, said that while no personal respiratory issues such as asthma have been experienced, all of her cousins living in the South Bronx have dealt with asthma for their entire lives. In fact, Victoria, in collaboration with fellow student Keke Grant Floyd, have their own podcast hosted by The Bronx Journal called "Fighting Forward: The Bronx Environmental Justice Story" where they discuss these issues with Bronx residents and leaders of community organizations. These stories, along with those in the podcast, are just a few of what could be hundreds of experiences with climate justice issues."No one is coming to save us" was repeated by several presenters, and that realization is a big reason why organizations such as Nos Quedamos/We Stay, a South Bronx based community-based/environmental organization, exists in the first place. Another central theme of the conference was raising awareness. A number of the student speakers made the point in saying that issues of climate/environmental justice were completely unknown to them until they gotdirectly involved.
  Instance 7: But none of this was achieved alone-it was the result of unity, collaboration, and shared purpose. This summit is just one step in a much larger movement, not only to spread awareness but to drive real, community-led change. And the hope of the NYC-EJA and the CUNY Climate Justice Hub is that everyone-regardless of age, education, or background-will take part. This sentiment was exemplified by Elizabeth Yeampierre, executive director of UPROSE, a Brooklyn based environmental organization, who stated, "When you invest in our power, you invest in our ability to fight."UWIRE-6106546UWIRE2025urn:contentItem:6FBV-3NJ3-RS44-J00J-00000-001722442025-03-17Copyright 2025 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedMeridian: Lehman CollegeUniversity WireMarch 16, 2025 SundayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHNew YorkNYEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQEnvironmental JusticeZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkEzN0MzMjlCRTM5NERFRDhFQzU0MDZBRkE1MTQ0RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEIyMDRCRTUzRURFNEQ5MDhBQ0EzNDUwNEE4QUQ0RTcST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST000A7ISASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEN611310SSCOLLEGES &amp; UNIVERSITIESST0009JY5COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORSSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSST000DTNMACTIVISMSTX000125ASTHMAST00098PQCURRICULAST000DSTYENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISMSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSST0009HPZSTUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFEN813400CCCIVIC &amp; SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONSST000CZNYCOMMUNITY ACTIVISMST0009SI7ENVIRONMENTALISMSTX001481RESPIRATORY DISORDERS &amp; INJURIESN611310SSCOLLEGES &amp; UNIVERSITIESST0009JY5COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORSN610000CCEDUCATIONAL SERVICESGX601NEW YORK, NY, USAGS148NEW YORK, USA

According to news reporting originating from Wellington, New Zealand, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Urban heat stress is becoming increasingly urgent, yet it remains understudied within the broader intersection of climate change and spatial justice."  Funders for this research include Wellington Doctoral Scholarship At The Victoria University of Wellington, Faculty of Architecture And Design Innovation, New Zealand. The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Victoria University Wellington: "While urban climate scholarship has largely focused on climatic impacts such as flooding, rising sea levels, and prolonged droughts, the socio-spatial lens of urban heat in marginalised and low-income urban communities has received limited attention.
  Instance 2: The article identifies three interrelated conceptual framings that elucidate the production and persistence of heat inequity: transitional injustice, green climate gentrification, and intersectional adaptation praxis. These lenses reveal how heat risk is differentially distributed, governed, and experienced with broader discourses of urban marginalisation, environmental dispossession, and epistemic exclusion. We contend that advancing climate justice in the context of urban heat requires moving beyond technocratic and elite-oriented adaptation, toward multi-scalar planning paradigms that recognise embodied vulnerability, structural inequality, and the socio-political ecologies of thermal exposure."  According to the news editors, the research concluded: "By theorising urban heat through the lens of climate justice, this article contributes to a more expansive and critical understanding of urban climate risk, one that situates heat inequity within the broader structures of power, governance, and spatial exclusion shaping contemporary urban environments."

Stressing 'Your Courage Continues to Change Lives', Secretary-General Urges Amnesty International Global Assembly to Keep Fighting for Human Rights, Climate Justice [6]

I see your invitation as a tribute to UN staff working around the world for human rights and for justice. And I see it as a reflection of our shared, fundamental conviction in the equal dignity and worth of every person -- a founding principle of both our organizations.One morning in the early '60s, a British lawyer opened his newspaper on his way to work.
  Instance 2: The UN80 initiative, grounded in the UN Charter and international law, is aimed at strengthening our core work across peace, human rights and development. And our Call to Action for Human Rights is mobilizing every part of the UN system.In the face of crisis, we must stand together -- and act together. Let me turn to your focus for this year's Global Assembly: confronting the rise of authoritarian practices -- and advancing climate justice.First -- authoritarianism. Around the world, we are witnessing a surge in repressive tactics aiming at corroding respect for human rights. And these are contaminating some democracies.
  Instance 3: It is a scandal that Africa still has no permanent seat at the table. It means delivering on the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.And it means transforming the international financial system -- with debt relief, a surge in development finance, and a stronger voice and greater participation for developing countries in international financial institutions. I applaud your work on such issues, including through the 2048 Commission -- helping to shape a fairer, more inclusive global order.The second focus of this Global Assembly is one of the defining struggles of our time: securing climate justice. The climate crisis is not just an environmental emergency. It is a human rights catastrophe.
  Instance 4: It made clear that States are obliged to protect the global climate system, that climate change is a human rights issue. And that the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius must guide climate policies, in accordance with the Paris Agreement. We have young Pacific Islanders to thank for this landmark victory.And all of us must build on these hard-won gains -- by insisting on legal accountability and demanding climate justice. That means the biggest economies and emitters leading an urgent global reduction in emissions, and a just transition away from fossil fuels.New national climate action plans -- or NDCs - must align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. They must respect human rights.

  Instance 2: Western powers have long treated the region as expendable- testing nuclear weapons, building military bases, and ignoring the consequences of the climate crisis they created. Across the Global South, the story is familiar.In 2019, while serving as foreign minister, Regenvanu received a letter from law students at the University of the South Pacific. They wanted to bring climate justice to the ICJ: Would Vanuatu help lead the charge? The students-who called themselves the Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change (PISFCC)-wanted the court to clarify how international law protects the rights of present and future generations in the face of the climate crisis.The idea had started as a class assignment. Their professor, Justin Rose, asked them to imagine legal pathways for climate justice, and one group proposed the ICJ.

It wasn't a new idea: Pacific nations had pushed for a  1996 ICJ opinion on nuclear weapons, and in 2011, Palau floated a climate case that never gained traction. But by 2019, with both climate devastation and global awareness surging, the students believed the timing was right.They realized the most viable route to the ICJ was through the United Nations General Assembly, which would require at least 97 votes-a daunting target for such a politically charged question.

This isn't the first time they've organized an Earth Day protest - in April 2023, a group of protestors organized by the club delivered a model of the Earth in a coffin to the same office, as reported by The Commonwealth Times.The march in 2023 was focused on the petition the group created, urging the university to declare a climate emergency, which has over 2,000 signatures. There was also an action day last Earth Day in 2024 centered around VCU's lack of concrete demands in their sustainability plan, according to Caroline May, Green Action's co-president.
  Instance 4: "Right now they've closed the implementation phase of the plan, however, I think one of the big things that's an issue is the really really slow progress and lack of action on the sustainability plan."Participants added their names with Sharpies to a banner which said in large, green letters, "Take a stand - we support equity and sustainability at VCU." This banner was delivered to the VCU Office of the President at 910 W. Franklin Street. Hand-painted t-shirts with the message "take a stand" in green letters were also distributed to attendees.During the march from Monroe Park and back, protesters sang songs and chanted phrases such as "We want clean air, not another billionaire," and "Tell Michael Rao: climate justice now."After the marchers returned to the park, John Henry Williams, an organizer for Sunrise RVA, addressed the crowd with remarks about climate change and climate justice.

But this day is not just for celebration it's one where we recognize the struggle of Indigenous Peoples, and all they've accomplished to realize their human rights. This week, representatives from 14 AJWS partner organizations focused on climate justice and Indigenous land rights in Kenya met to strategize and share learnings and solidarity. These incredible activists have been building power of the people in communities, including winning significant battles in the courts to push the Kenyan government to recognize their rights and make environmentally sustainable choices for the future of their country.The government has often failed to comply with implementation of the rulings, in many cases continuing violations like evicting Indigenous peoples from their ancestral lands, denying them basic services, and pushing polluting fossil fuel development that is driving climate change.While there has been great progress in protecting and promoting Indigenous peoples' rights, many fights still lie ahead and this week's convening aimed to tackle them head on. They reflected on the importance of coming together no matter their Indigenous group, gender or age to make their voices heard.The convening attendees.

But above all, it is a story of resiliencea fire that has burned from generation to generation, passed down through the hands and hearts of elders, mothers, warriors, and now youth.Too often, movements are built for the present moment alone. But when we look at climate justice, water rights, and land protection through an intergenerational lens, something shifts. We begin to honor the wisdom of the past, carried by our elders who understood the land not as property but as kin. We recognize that the present must be a bridge, not a barrier, between what was and what could be.

It resulted in more than $200 billion in costs and at least 1,400 deaths. It was one of the most devastating Atlantic hurricanes in history.Hurricane Katrina disproportionately harmed low-income communities and communities of color. Pre-existing and systemic inequalities in flood risk, poverty, and access to resources set the scene for a grossly inadequate response that highlighted how disasters are most devastating for those in society who are lowest on the socioeconomic ladder.In the aftermath, Hurricane Katrina--along with Harvey, Irma, Maria, Sandy, and many other storms--played a role in shaping risk-reduction strategies: After all, preparing ahead of time is the best way to minimize the need for billions of dollars in disaster response. Making sure a highway or a hospital isn't built in a floodplain just makes sense, and it makes more sense now than ever before as climate-fueled storms become turbocharged.

As the city grew as a trade hub in the 1700s, wealthy residents claimed the best real estate, often on higher ground formed by river sediment. The city had little high ground, so everyone else was left in "back-of-town" areas, closer to swamps where land was cheap and flooding common.In the early 1900s, new pumping technology enabled development in flood-prone swamplands and housing spread, but the pumping caused land subsidence that made flooding worse in neighborhoods such as Lakeview, Gentilly and Broadmoor.Then redlining started in the 1930s.
  Instance 2: Redlining kept their property values lower. Black Americans were also denied government-backed mortgages and GI Bill benefits that could have helped them move to safer neighborhoods on higher ground. Hurricane Katrina showed how those lines translate to vulnerability.When history came callingOn Aug. 29, 2005, as Hurricane Katrina battered New Orleans, the levees protecting the city broke and water flooded about 80% of the city. The damage followed racial geography ?
  Instance 3: Black Americans were also denied government-backed mortgages and GI Bill benefits that could have helped them move to safer neighborhoods on higher ground. Hurricane Katrina showed how those lines translate to vulnerability.When history came callingOn Aug. 29, 2005, as Hurricane Katrina battered New Orleans, the levees protecting the city broke and water flooded about 80% of the city. The damage followed racial geography ? the spatial patterns of where Black and white residents lived due to decades of segregation ?
  Instance 4: Among survivors who did not evacuate, 55% did not have a car or another way to get out, and 93% were Black. More than 1,800 people lost their lives. This lack of transportation - what scholars call "transportation poverty" - left people stranded in the city's bowl-shaped geography, unable to escape when the levees failed.Recovery that made things worseAfter Hurricane Katrina, the federal government created the Road Home program to help homeowners rebuild. But the program had a devastating design flaw: It calculated aid based on prehurricane home value or repair costs, whichever was less. That meant low-income homeowners, who already lived in areas with lower property values due to the history of discrimination, received less money.
  Instance 5: Lower-income families are less likely to have adequate insurance or savings for quick rebuilding. Low-value homes with extensive damage still had not regained their prestorm value four years later, while higher-value homes sustaining even moderate damage gained value.Ten years after Katrina, while 70% of white residents felt New Orleans had recovered, only 44% of Black residents could look around their neighborhood and say the same.Community-led solutions for climate resilienceKatrina's lessons in the inequality of disasters are important for communities today as climate change brings more extreme weather.Federal Emergency Management Agencydenial rates for disaster aid remain high due to bureaucratic obstacles such as complex application processes that bounce survivors among multiple agencies, often resulting in denials and delays of critical funds. These are the same systemic barriers that added to the reasons Black communities recovered more slowly after Hurricane Katrina. FEMA's own advisory council reported that institutional assistance policies tend to enrich wealthier, predominantly white areas, while underserving low-income and minority communities throughout all stages of disaster response. The lessons from New Orleans also point to ways communities can build disaster resilience across the entire population.
  Instance 6: FEMA's own advisory council reported that institutional assistance policies tend to enrich wealthier, predominantly white areas, while underserving low-income and minority communities throughout all stages of disaster response. The lessons from New Orleans also point to ways communities can build disaster resilience across the entire population. In particular, as cities plan protective measures - elevating homes, buyout programs and flood-proofing assistance - Hurricane Katrina showed the need to pay attention to social vulnerabilities and focus aid where people need the most assistance.The choice America facesIn our view, one of Katrina's most important lessons is about social injustice. The disproportionate suffering in Black communities wasn't a natural disaster but a predictable result of policies concentrating risk in marginalized neighborhoods.In many American cities, policies still leave some communities facing a greater risk of disaster damage. To protect residents, cities can start by investing in vulnerable areas, empowering a community-led recovery and ensuring race, income or ZIP code never again determine who receives help with the recovery.Natural disasters don't have to become human catastrophes.

  Instance 2: The event was held in collaboration with Green Light New Orleans, a nonprofit organization focused on providing simple, effective environmental solutions to residents.Volunteers installed rain barrels at homes in the Hollygrove, Leonidas, and Fontainebleau neighborhoods, areas prone to flooding. The barrels, painted in bright, original designs, serve as practical tools for stormwater management by capturing rainwater, reducing runoff, and helping prevent property damage. Each barrel diverts an estimated 2,220 gallons of water annually from the city's overburdened drainage system.'As we observe the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, we're not just reflecting, we're responding with action,' said Deanna Rodriguez, president and CEO of Entergy New Orleans. 'This initiative reflects Entergy's commitment to resilience, not just as a company, but as a neighbor - helping families reduce the impact of heavy rainfall.'Laura Jayne, a Hollygrove resident and staff member at Loyola University, had been waiting nearly a year to receive a rain barrel for her home. She welcomed the delivery on Wednesday morning.'I have been wanting to get a rain barrel for a very long time,' said Jayne.
  Instance 3: She welcomed the delivery on Wednesday morning.'I have been wanting to get a rain barrel for a very long time,' said Jayne. 'Even though I have not experienced extreme flooding, I think the rain barrels are great to help prevent potential flooding.'Since its founding in 2006, Green Light New Orleans has distributed and installed more than 3,000 rain barrels across the city. The barrels not only provide cost savings to residents but also reduce stress on drainage infrastructure and contribute to the city's long-term climate goals.'Entergy has been a partner with Green Light New Orleans since we first started in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and we deeply appreciate this enduring partnership,' said Dr. Christian Ryan, executive Director at Green Light New Orleans. 'Together, we're working to help New Orleans residents make small changes that have a big impact.'This initiative is part of Entergy's broader commitment to community investment and environmental stewardship.
  Instance 4: Over the last two decades since Katrina's devastation, Entergy shareholders have invested $95 million to support nonprofit organizations in Orleans Parish while our employees in the area have completed more than 130,000 hours of volunteer service.In partnership with Rebuilding Together New Orleans, Entergy will hold another employee-driven Day of Service on Aug. 29, commemorating the 20th anniversary of Katrina. That initiative will focus on home weatherization efforts to improve energy efficiency and lower utility costs for some of the city's most vulnerable residents.Through acts of service and community partnership, Entergy continues to honor the past while investing in a safer, more resilient future for New Orleans.For more information about Entergy's restoration efforts following Hurricane Katrina, visit  entergy.com/Katrina20.About Entergy New OrleansEntergy New Orleans provides electricity to approximately 209,000 customers in Orleans Parish, Louisiana.

"The most pressing need among Katrina survivors wasn't treating storm-related injuries. It was medical attention for chronic health conditions that went untreated as the public health system collapsed."MLK Health's providers prescribed medicine to people displaced at Shreveport shelters, a process that often required them to examine and re-diagnose patients who'd already been diagnosed with a chronic disease.An MLK Health staff member prepares to deploy a Direct Relief emergency medic pack in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in 2017.

That kind of patient care is time-intensive and detailed, and MLK Health at that point was a tiny free clinic with a pharmacy "the size of a walk-in closet...It was difficult, let me tell you."Thousands of people who'd been displaced by Hurricane Katrina stayed in the area which was then hit by Hurricane Rita, a Category 3 storm, the following month.Mentesane remembers it as a "chaotic" time, but one that shone a spotlight on the urgent need for healthcare in southern states and that launched a groundswell of support for community providers like MLK Health."Starting from Scratch"Hurricane Katrina made landfall on Monday, August 29, 2005.

The impact was cataclysmic: 1,833 people were killed by the storm in Louisiana and Mississippi. But while the death toll was horrific on its own, that number doesn't begin to account for Katrina's disastrous consequences for health care access, insurance coverage, community mental health, housing, food security, or many other measures of health.Even before the disaster, Louisiana and Mississippi were ranked the two least-healthy states in the U.S., with high rates of chronic disease, food insecurity, and other issues.
  Instance 6: (NOELA had not yet been founded.) He remembers having a staff meeting the Friday before the storm made landfall, and reviewing evacuation plans with colleagues."We all thought we would return to work on Monday," he said.Instead, Dr. Winfrey's family, which included a toddler and an infant, fled to Alexandria, Louisiana, where Dr. Winfrey worked for three years, caring for community health center patients who had been displaced by Hurricane Katrina and were struggling to get their prescriptions, re-establish care for chronic diseases, and manage anxiety and distress related to their experiences."Many patients didn't have access to their medical conditions or history, but they'd tell you they needed their medications filled," he recalled. "You were pretty much starting from scratch in terms of trying to get a good handle on their medical conditions.""The Right Kind of Intervention"Dr. Winfrey returned to New Orleans in January of 2009 as a Tulane University professor of internal medicine who also provided community health care.
  Instance 7: Where 35,000 patients in a year might have been a typical number, they saw 35,000 in the first month after the storm hit. Many had physical trauma or needed a tetanus or hepatitis vaccination, and many others needed their prescriptions for diabetes or hypertension filled.But it was quickly obvious to Comeaux that mental health issues along with a broader need for maternal health care and other integrated services were going to drive health care needs over the long term. "Finding the need is not difficult; it's finding the right kind of intervention," he explained.However, the horrors of Hurricane Katrina drew public attention to the area's urgent health needs, and the lack of affordable health care. Tulane University, like other local players, was drawing on the groundswell of support to increase community health care in the NOLA area, expanding the presence of federally qualified health centers designed to serve low-income and underinsured or uninsured patients.MLK Health's Interprofessional Education Program, supported by Direct Relief's Fund for Health Equity, trains medical and nurse practitioner students at its clinic facility. (Photo courtesy of MLK Health)One of those health centers was NOELA, where Dr.
  Instance 8: (Photo courtesy of MLK Health)One of those health centers was NOELA, where Dr. Winfrey is now chief medical officer. The FQHC was founded by the Tulane University School of Medicine in 2008.Hurricane Katrina "led to a sort of rebirth of how primary care was delivered in New Orleans," Dr. Winfrey explained. The push for more available and effective care also led to the use of new kinds of electronic medical records that allowed patients' diagnoses and treatment regimens to be widely accessible rather than locally housed.In the aftermath of Hurricane Rita, MLK Health received enough financial support to install a generator that could power their entire pharmacy, allowing them to keep medications cold and safely dispense them during power losses.
  Instance 9: "That's been a game-changer for displaced people," Mentesane said. By that time, MLK Health was outgrowing its original clinic building, and purchased and renovated a new facility."It was a combination of not only the community need, but also community support," she recalled."To Be Ready"The combined disaster also grew MLK Health's partnership with Direct Relief. While the organization had provided support to nonprofit healthcare providers in California, most of its work was international at that point.For Direct Relief, too, the catastrophic impact of Hurricane Katrina was a pivotal moment.When the storm struck the Louisiana coastline, Direct Relief had recently wrapped up a successful pilot program focused on providing medication to California community health centers and clinics, free of charge. Damon Taugher, a former director of U.S. programs at Direct Relief, called NACHC to ask if similar medical support would be helpful to health facilities serving communities impacted by Katrina.Direct Relief had responded to international disasters for decades, but its U.S.
  Instance 10: The organization had never responded on a large scale to a U.S. disaster. But within six months, Direct Relief had provided more than $50 million in material medical aid and cash assistance to Gulf Coast community health centers and free clinics."Not only was the response among the largest in Direct Relief's history, but it shaped the organization's next ten years," Taugher recalled in a 10-year retrospective essay on Hurricane Katrina's impact. "To be ready for the next disaster, Direct Relief set out to establish relationships with a nationwide network of safety net providers.""Direct Relief was first introduced to the nonprofit healthcare safety net in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and it quickly became clear that providers at community health centers, free and charitable clinics, and charitable pharmacies were already so deeply aware of the community needs, and so ready to serve their patients in any capacity," said Katie Lewis, Direct Relief's regional director, U.S. Programs.

"Those partnerships were a natural fit for us."Willing to Step UpToday, Direct Relief works with more than 2,000 community health centers, free and charitable clinics and pharmacies, and other safety net providers across the U.S., and has provided more than $2.8 billion in material medical aid and $238 million in grants to U.S.
  Instance 12: communities from California to Louisiana to Puerto Rico through the organization's Power for Health program; provided financial support for mobile medical units; and distributed emergency grants to search and rescue groups and community organizations responding in the aftermath of disasters.Founded as the NO/AIDS Task Force in 1983, CrescentCare has grown to serve a wide range of communities across the city of New Orleans and South Louisiana. The health center will be the site of a solar and battery-powered resilience hub, supported by a $650,000 Direct Relief Power for Health grant. (Photo courtesy of CrescentCare)Over the long term, too, these safety net providers will support communities still recovering years or decades later like New Orleans, where Hurricane Katrina is still a monumental part of the area's history, identity, and current health landscape from a disaster.Research increasingly shows that communities deeply affected by tropical storms will experience vastly increased morbidity and mortality for decades to come: In some cases, the excess deaths caused by a disaster can reach 300 times the original death toll in the years following.Community health centers, free and charitable clinics and pharmacies, and other nonprofit providers work to prevent these excess deaths by connecting people to housing, reducing food insecurity, implementing new disease prevention measures and mental health monitoring, and much more."People Still Don't Realize"Today, Mentesane said, healthcare in Louisiana is a much larger network of coordinating organizations who work together during the Gulf Coast's frequent Atlantic storms to coordinate care.Emergency medical supplies, including a Direct Relief field medic pack, are prepared for disaster response at MLK Health. (Photo courtesy of MLK Health)Safety net organizations are assigned roles in local and state emergency planning MLK Health, for example, acts as a pharmacy and distributor for people displaced by disasters, conducts preparedness drills, and has its own detailed plans in place to keep tabs on patients, provide emergency care, and reopen as quickly as possible.MLK Health receives and stages Direct Relief's large-scale Hurricane Preparedness Packs, which contain the medications and supplies that responding organizations most frequently request in the aftermath of a tropical storm. If the storm season is uneventful, the medical support much of it intended for patients with chronic diseases is used as part of the health center's ongoing community healthcare work.Access Health also receives a Hurricane Prep Pack from Direct Relief, which Comeaux describes as a boon.

"Those supplies really do change lives," he said, recalling a child at one of the health center's facilities who received a nebulizer from the pack when he urgently needed one. Direct Relief also provided funding to support the purchase of two mobile medical units for Access Health."We have benefited from that relationship in amazing ways," Comeaux said.After Hurricane Katrina, "the emphasis became more on continuity of care for people with chronic diseases and disabilities," Mentesane said. "I think that a lot of people didn't realize I think a lot of people still don't realize the amount of chronic illness in Louisiana and a lot of the southern states."Dr. Keith Winfrey, chief medical officer at NOELA Community Health Center, examines a patient.
  Instance 14: Chronic diseases affect each community, but "these are unique medical conditions that can be impacted by language and culture," he said. His patients need "someone who is culturally aware and familiar with dietary practices."His practice has changed along with his patients, allowing him to suggest healthy substitutes for foods like white rice and tortillas, and learn more about how his patients see issues like chronic disease prevention and cancer screening."Each culture has their own way of viewing the importance" of health, Dr. Winfrey said.SNS-1127285285SNS2025urn:contentItem:6GGG-7P43-S32R-V2GP-00000-0080582025-08-12Copyright 2025 States News ServiceStates News ServiceAugust 11, 2025 MondayNewswireNewswires &amp;

It was one of the most catastrophic natural disasters in U.S. history and the largest humanitarian response the American Red Cross has ever undertaken.In the days that followed, nearly a quarter of a million Red Crossers the vast majority of which were volunteers mobilized to provide shelter, food, comfort and hope.
  Instance 2: We carry the responsibility to respond with even greater care, accountability and readiness.This August, as we mark two decades since the storm, we remember the lives lost and the communities forever changed. We honor the strength of survivors and the compassion of those who stepped forward to help. And we recommit ourselves to the mission that guides us still: to alleviate human suffering in the face of emergencies.SNS-1127279852SNS2025urn:contentItem:6GFM-BYC3-S2XX-N45W-00000-0080582025-08-08Copyright 2025 States News ServiceStates News ServiceAugust 7, 2025 ThursdayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHAMERICAN RED CROSSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST000DQK8DIVERSITY &amp; INCLUSIONN624230GCDISASTER RELIEFSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINASTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST0009U58HISTORYST000DS47HUMANITARIAN AIDSTX001463RELIEF ORGANIZATIONSSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSSTX000691FAMILYSTX002021SAFETYST0009F7UHURRICANESGS124WASHINGTON DC, USAGC343UNITED STATES

"Efforts like these should be applauded, but they must accelerate to continue to build our resilience to extreme weather events.
  Instance 3: Rising inflation in housing and auto costs have offset the resilience gains, according to the report.The Swiss Re report emphasizes the significance of adaptability to increase resilience, reduce exposures and decrease insurance costs. Hurricanes represent a major risk to the insurance and reinsurance industries, accounting for 39% of insured losses over the past decade and 37% over the last 40 years. After Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans rebuilt new flood defenses, such as new levees and floodwalls, funded by over $14 billion from the U.S. government, and implemented new building codes to enhance their infrastructure resilience against wind damage.INSNET-00000197ad7cdcc1a3d7af7ef51900001INSNET2025urn:contentItem:6G4J-YMS3-S2SS-526R-00000-003477722025-06-26Copyright 2025 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent All Rights Reserveddigitalinsurance.comVol. 1No.

Click here  to read the rest of the issue.August 28, 2025, will mark 20 years since my family rushed to pack up the cars and join 1.5 million people evacuating the Gulf Coast in the middle of the night. I was a week shy of turning 13 and storm evacuations were nothing new to me, but fleeing Hurricane Katrina felt noticeably different."It's funny," I remember my dad saying as he gazed into the overstuffed trunk of our 2002 Chrysler Sebring. It was packed to the brim with our valuables: family photo albums, sentimental knick-knacks, toys, the family computer. "What we choose to evacuate with is the kind of stuff a looter would just totally ignore."Katrina weakened and jogged eastward, decimating the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
  Instance 4: When observing this tenacious desire to thrive, the source of New Orleans' abundant dynamism comes into focus. For all the challenges it brings to human civilization, the Mississippi River Delta is also a large source of the region's life and vibrancy. Hurricane Katrina was just another chapter in the history of man's struggle both to control nature and to accept what he cannot control.Since leaving Louisiana, I've spoken with countless people who either have already been to New Orleans-and loved it-or hope one day to see it. To which I say, everyone should go at least twice: once to experience Mardi Gras and once to explore everything else. Like a bafflingly valueless yet invaluable trunk of belongings, this city exudes individuality and the contradictory complexities that come with it.The post Hurricane Katrina Devastated New Orleans.

It tells it from the point of view of the people who lived it. We're not hearing from a lot of institutions and things like that.
  Instance 6: And one of the things he told me, and this isn't in the film, is that after Katrina, FEMA learned some lessons. And part of what they learned was -- and it's, I guess, a bit of a dirty word these days, but that you have to take equity on -- into how you approach these disasters on the front end and the response on the front end, which is to say that these disasters affect everyone, but they affect some people more than others.And that the people who are most vulnerable, for whatever reasons, whether class, age, disability, on the front end of the storm are the people who are going to have the hardest time recovering on the back end of the storm.So, if you center the needs of those people, and the way that you prepare and respond, it not only helps them, it helps everyone. And I'm sorry to say that it feels like that that sort of approach has fallen out of favor under the current administration and the current understanding of FEMA and what its roles and responsibilities are.CORNISH: Traci Curry is the Director of the new docuseries "Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time."

A massive mural of a girl on the warehouse's exterior is a city fixture, her angelic gaze a mix of wonder and courage. Inside, the studio bustles with activity.
  Instance 2: John Lewis - peer down from their canvases. Visitors meander through the large space, and welding beams flicker against walls as workers build a mobile display stage.A born New Orleanian, Mr. Odums began by painting in the city's forgotten places, driven by the community's difficult experience during Hurricane Katrina and its struggle to rebuild. One result of the unequal rebuilding process is a city in which income inequality is greater than anywhere in the United States except Atlanta.New Orleans "is No. 1 on a lot of wrong lists," Mr.
  Instance 3: Instead, Mr. Odums says, the wrecking ball reflected the reality of a city in continual transformation.Today, Mr. Odums provides younger New Orleanians, many of whom have spent their whole lives in Hurricane Katrina's long aftermath, the tools they need to create art. Eternal Seeds, a nonprofit he founded, has worked on a range of projects - including, recently, painting small Bloom Fist sculptures cast from Mr. Odums' own hand.
  Instance 4: These pieces went on sale recently during the city's Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival to benefit Eternal Seeds, which gives young artists experience in producing and managing artistic projects. Mr. Odums says Eternal Seeds is geared in part at showing emerging artists how to make a living in a city of "beautiful contradictions.""Our purpose," he adds, "is to go beyond the very limits of imagination and find a way to make peace with the present." For more visual storytelling that captures communities, traditions, and cultures around the globe, visit The World in Pictures.CSM-a285995b1edce203d812d7bf4ce6af54CSM2025urn:contentItem:6GGW-R2Y3-RRXS-10KH-00000-0079452025-08-14Copyright 2025 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedThe Christian Science MonitorAugust 14, 2025 ThursdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHCC000A7BDWALLS ASNAICS531120 LESSORS OF NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS (EXCEPT MINIWAREHOUSES)SIC6512 OPERATORS OF NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGSSTX001970TRENDS &amp; EVENTSSTX000302CIVIL RIGHTSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST00098X3CUSTOMS &amp; CULTURAL HERITAGEST00096URINCOME DISTRIBUTIONSTX002143SCULPTUREST0009VC0ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERSSTX001763TROPICAL STORMSSTX000672EXHIBITIONSST0009U58HISTORYSTX001220NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONSST000DRP2ECONOMIC INEQUALITYSTX000707FESTIVALSST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX002143SCULPTUREST000DS85ABANDONED REAL ESTATEST0009VC0ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERSSTX000672EXHIBITIONSST000DSQPCULTURAL TOURISMSTX000707FESTIVALSPE0009WKJJOHN LEWISGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGS134LOUISIANA, USAGC343UNITED STATESReal Property LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Fixture CharacteristicsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REQzNzE5RTIxNDM5NEFGODhCN0Y1NUMyMTUzNzYyNkY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDU4RjI2RDFERjFFNDkxODg4NDg1NjE0MDE0MjA0Qzk

Bush's infamously disastrous handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.'Do you know who this person is? It's okay if you don't,' Maddow began Monday's episode of 'The Rachel Maddow Show,' showing a photo of FEMA Director David Richardson in Texas this past weekend. The MSNBC host then went on a small detour to discuss Michael D.
  Instance 3: You definitely don't want to make the kinds of insensitive mistakes that other people have very famously made after disasters like this in our country.' While displaying another photo of Richardson watching the Texas wreckage from a helicopter side by side with Bush's infamous Katrina plane image, Maddow added, 'Make sure you don't make any of these exact same mistakes.''Have I mentioned that Trump's FEMA pick is the first person to run FEMA since Brownie who has no disaster response or emergency management experience at all?' Maddow added. 'He did remember that great photo of George W.

It was the first time passenger rail funding was part of a surface transportation reauthorization bill.Because of Senator Wicker's guidance, Congress created the Gulf Coast Working Group in the FAST Act to perform a Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) administered study. This study was to determine whether passenger rail service should be reintroduced in the Gulf Coast and how it should be designed.In 2016, Senator Wicker participated in the Gulf Coast Rail inspection trip, the first passenger train since Hurricane Katrina.Senator Wicker received the "Golden Spike" award from the National Association of Railroad Passengers in recognition of his leadership and support of passenger rail in the bipartisan FAST Act.In 2019, the Southern Rail Commission was awarded $42.8 million in federal funding that helped lay the groundwork for the Mardi Gras Service.

Wicker's Statement on the Official Return of Amtrak to the Gulf Coast [6]
  Instance 1: Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, issued the following news release:* * *Wicker's Statement on the Official Return of Amtrak to the Gulf Coast*Click here for photos.TUPELO - U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., released the following statement after Amtrak's Mardi Gras Service began running full passenger rail service through Mississippi's Gulf Coast."At last, passenger rail has returned to the Mississippi Gulf Coast. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina shuttered the line that carried tourists and travelers along our shore. Today, after 20 years of effort, that changes. The Mardi Gras Service is one of the final pieces of the recovery puzzle from Hurricane Katrina.
  Instance 2: In 2005, Hurricane Katrina shuttered the line that carried tourists and travelers along our shore. Today, after 20 years of effort, that changes. The Mardi Gras Service is one of the final pieces of the recovery puzzle from Hurricane Katrina. In the Senate, I spent nearly ten years securing federal investment, continuing conversations with stakeholders, and pressing Transportation Secretary nominees and federal rail officials about their commitment to Gulf Coast rail. Serving as the lead Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee helped me to advocate effectively for Gulf Coast rail.
  Instance 3: In the Senate, I spent nearly ten years securing federal investment, continuing conversations with stakeholders, and pressing Transportation Secretary nominees and federal rail officials about their commitment to Gulf Coast rail. Serving as the lead Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee helped me to advocate effectively for Gulf Coast rail. Reconnecting the Gulf Coast to the nationwide passenger rail network will not only turn a page on Hurricane Katrina, but will expand opportunity in our state for years to come."Below is a timeline of the effort that went into securing the return of the Mardi Gras Service.* In 2008, Senator Wicker gave his maiden Senate speech in which he spoke extensively about the need to rebuild the Gulf Coast and called it Mississippi's number one issue.* In 2015, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act was signed into law after it was passed under Senator Wicker's leadership of the Senate Commerce Committee. It was the first time passenger rail funding was part of a surface transportation reauthorization bill.* Because of Senator Wicker's guidance, Congress created the Gulf Coast Working Group in the FAST Act to perform a Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) administered study. This study was to determine whether passenger rail service should be reintroduced in the Gulf Coast and how it should be designed.* In 2016, Senator Wicker participated in the Gulf Coast Rail inspection trip, the first passenger train since Hurricane Katrina.* Senator Wicker received the "Golden Spike" award from the National Association of Railroad Passengers in recognition of his leadership and support of passenger rail in the bipartisan FAST Act.* In 2019, the Southern Rail Commission was awarded $42.8 million in federal funding that helped lay the groundwork for the Mardi Gras Service.

This funding was awarded with support from Senator Wicker.* In 2021, Senator Wicker urged the Chairman of the STB (Surface Transportation Board) to restore service between New Orleans and Mobile. He argued that a twice daily service would provide a "huge economic life" to the cities along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.* In 2022, Senator Wicker testified before the STB advocating for the Amtrak application to restore service to the Gulf Coast to be approved.

He stated: "For the Mississippians who lost a transportation option along with so much else to Hurricane Katrina, this case is not an abstract policy question. It's about continuing and completing the recovery. Freight and passenger railroads must work together to achieve benefits for both elements of rail transportation along the Gulf Coast."* In 2023, Senator Wicker announced the award of $178.4 million in Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements Program funding critical to restore passenger rail service along the Gulf Coast, replacing the earlier $33 million award.

This funding was used to complete necessary construction in Mobile and other portions of the rail line.* In 2025, the Federal Rail Administration announced a $21,117,115 grant for Gulf Coast Rail with the support of Senator Wicker. The grant supported the operating cost of Amtrak's services returning to the Mississippi Gulf Coast.* On August 16, 2025 Amtrak hosted the inaugural ride of Mardi Gras Service.***Original text here: https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2025/8/wicker-s-statement-on-the-official-return-of-amtrak-to-the-gulf-coastCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-9362832 MSTRUCKTNS-PR9362832TARGET2025urn:contentItem:6GHW-3G53-RS4N-9354-00000-002992192025-08-187:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedTargeted News ServiceAugust 18, 2025 MondayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHCC0001P9KNATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORP (AMTRAK)NAICS482111 LINE-HAUL RAILROADSSIC4011 RAILROADS, LINE-HAUL OPERATINGST000A7ISASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINASTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSSTX001372PRESS RELEASESN67891011CHRONOLOGIESST000DN6KTRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTSST000DQI9BIPARTISANSHIPSTX001020LEGISLATIONST000DA1DUS CONGRESSSTX000108APPROVALSSTX000966INTERSTATE COMMERCEN921100MMUS FEDERAL GOVERNMENTST0009TD5US REPUBLICAN PARTYN921120CCLEGISLATIVE BODIESST000DN6RPUBLIC OFFICIALSST0009F7UHURRICANESN482005BCLONG DISTANCE PASSENGER RAILST000DN6KTRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTSST000955MRAIL TRANSPORTATION REGULATION &amp; POLICYSTX002177RAIL TRANSPORTATIONST000CA1VTRAINSPE000A1UGROGER F WICKERGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGR215SOUTHEAST USAGS140MISSISSIPPI, USAGC343UNITED STATESBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0US Surface Transportation BoardZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzVDQ0ExQjI1MTdCNDFCMEEyQzdCN0VCOERCRUY2RTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkIwQUVGRDJCQTgyNDIyOEE4ODYyMzkzRkEwNzE4MTkRules &amp; RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEY5ODFEODg0RTA0NDAxNUIyNzU3MUQ1NTBCMUI3OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzVDQ0ExQjI1MTdCNDFCMEEyQzdCN0VCOERCRUY2RTkRates &amp; TariffsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzU4ODMyNDc1QzM0NEZFQzk3MTY5RUM0N0EzMzYyNzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQConsolidation &amp; MergerZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RENDNzc4RDg0RkE1NDA3Mjg0ODMwRTFFMzZBMDcwMjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQRailroad CommissionsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFERkNDQUM0Njk3NEJCMUE2NTQ5QkM3MUM4NkJCNkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQMaintenance &amp; SafetyZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjVBRDIyNTg1MDRFNDJDOTg0MEU5RTI3M0UxREU4NzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQState &amp; Local RegulationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDY4RDQ0RkFDRkQ1NEY2OUIzMkQwNDFENDdEQ0NDNTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQRoutes &amp; ServicesZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDNENDJFNUNGNUIwNDY1NEExQTJEOTEzQTNBRDBFNTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQTransportation LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0AmtrakZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDZFNDdDMkYzOTI1NDY3Nzg1MTE0RTRERjI1RENEQjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQPersonnelZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUZDRUQwMUM4OUFGNDdEN0FDQzMzQzk0QUIyMjVCNEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEM3QUY1QUY0RDMwNDZDRUJBQTMwMkEyQUZEODEzRkUUS Surface Transportation BoardZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzVDQ0ExQjI1MTdCNDFCMEEyQzdCN0VCOERCRUY2RTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkIwQUVGRDJCQTgyNDIyOEE4ODYyMzkzRkEwNzE4MTkRules &amp; RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEY5ODFEODg0RTA0NDAxNUIyNzU3MUQ1NTBCMUI3OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzVDQ0ExQjI1MTdCNDFCMEEyQzdCN0VCOERCRUY2RTkFundingZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTFFNkIxMEVFQTA2NERDMDhDRUUwNUY2NEQ4MTYyOUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjVCODE3RDNEMENDNDkxRjg5MzBBNTJFQkNCRDlFOEURates &amp; TariffsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzU4ODMyNDc1QzM0NEZFQzk3MTY5RUM0N0EzMzYyNzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQDefinition of CommerceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTcwNjhEMjUzQUFFNDgzRDg3RTdCRjg1M0Y3QTRCMjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkIwQUVGRDJCQTgyNDIyOEE4ODYyMzkzRkEwNzE4MTkConsolidation &amp; MergerZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RENDNzc4RDg0RkE1NDA3Mjg0ODMwRTFFMzZBMDcwMjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQRailroad CommissionsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFERkNDQUM0Njk3NEJCMUE2NTQ5QkM3MUM4NkJCNkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTA0MzBBMUI0MkVCNDIzNDkxNkY4MTU5REUxOTE0ODA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzkMaintenance &amp; SafetyZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjVBRDIyNTg1MDRFNDJDOTg0MEU5RTI3M0UxREU4NzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQState &amp; Local RegulationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDY4RDQ0RkFDRkQ1NEY2OUIzMkQwNDFENDdEQ0NDNTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQRoutes &amp; ServicesZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDNENDJFNUNGNUIwNDY1NEExQTJEOTEzQTNBRDBFNTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQ

The organization—which has assisted tens of thousands of animals around the world in the aftermath of disasters including hurricanes and tornadoes in the U.S., earthquakes in Turkey, flooding in India and wildfires in Australia—works to preserve the human-animal bond amid crisis through preparedness actions, rescue and response. Remember, if it's not safe for people, it's not safe for animals.In 2024 alone, Humane World for Animals assisted thousands of animals while responding to Hurricanes Milton and Helene in the U.S., Hurricanes John and Milton in Mexico, flooding in India, Viet Nam and Nepal, and an earthquake in Ecuador.
  Instance 2: The organization's response work typically includes:Search and rescue to find animals stranded or trapped by floods, rubble, fires and more.Providing essential veterinary care and pet supplies which typically includes setting up pop-up veterinary clinics and distribution sites.Supporting emergency animal sheltering by helping create and operate temporary shelters. Transporting animals who were already up for adoption out of shelters in impacted areas to shelters that have capacity away from the disaster zone. Providing emergency grants to partner groups on the ground."Hurricane Katrina raised awareness about the importance of the human-animal bond in disaster response worldwide," said Kitty Block, president and CEO of Humane World for Animals. "Whether we are responding to a hurricane, earthquake, flood, fires or other disasters, we've seen time after time that the well-being of people is closely tied to the well-being of their animals. Being able to reunite people with their animals after disaster, or better yet, providing the tools to keep them together every step of the way, makes a lifesaving difference and brings vital comfort to disaster survivors."Less than two years after Hurricane Katrina, Humane World for Animals was instrumental in passing federal legislation, the PETS Act, to support the inclusion of animals in disaster-related planning.

However, it remains essential for the public to create personal disaster preparedness plans which include their pets and any animals they are responsible for.Key preparedness tips:It is critical that you make a disaster plan that includes your animals before disaster strikes. That plan should include locations you can evacuate to with your animals and identifying a friend, neighbor or family member who your animals are comfortable with and giving them a key in case you are stranded or unable to get home.
  Instance 4: As the leading voice in the animal protection space, we work to end the cruelest practices, care for animals in crisis and build a stronger animal protection movement. Driving toward the greatest global impact, we aim to achieve the vision behind our name: a more humane world.humaneworld.org  View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hurricane-katrinas-20-year-anniversary-disaster-response-and-preparedness-saves-lives-302444327.htmlSOURCE Humane World for Animals.

Entire neighborhoods disappeared, families were scattered, and lives were split into "before" and "after." Nearly 20 years later, the haunting images of submerged rooftops and boat rescues remain vivid.The Surge That Shattered New OrleansOn Aug.
  Instance 2: Hyde continues, "Many homes were in low-lying, flood-prone areas, and residents often lacked access to reliable transportation, making evacuation difficult or impossible."Georgia's Changing Landscape: Migration and ImpactKatrina displaced hundreds of thousands and claimed a staggering toll of more than 1,800 lives. Georgia quickly absorbed many evacuees, reshaping its demographics and infrastructure. "Hurricane Katrina led to one of the largest displacements of people due to a natural disaster," says Shatakshee Dhongde, a professor of economics. "It changed the demographics of Georgia in measurable ways, from school enrollment to the labor market."The U.S. Census Bureau tracked this migration, noting spikes in Louisiana-born residents in metro Atlanta.
  Instance 3: "It's also about ensuring the communities receiving evacuees have the resources and support systems to integrate them successfully."Finally, Hyde stresses the importance of engaging youth and communities in preparedness efforts. "Youth advocacy programs, like those we're piloting in Georgia, empower young people in marginalized neighborhoods with knowledge and agency to build long-term resilience. Disaster planning must be a community effort, inclusive and forward-looking."SNS-1127298076SNS2025urn:contentItem:6GJ0-20R3-SG0H-V1DF-00000-0080582025-08-19Copyright 2025 States News ServiceStates News ServiceAugust 19, 2025 TuesdayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST000DRN1NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWSST0009P1YSOCIAL SCIENCE EDUCATIONST000DT12TECHNOLOGYN920000CCGOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONN541330GMCIVIL ENGINEERINGST00096KOHOUSING MARKETSTX000517DIVESTITURESST0008XANDISPLACED PERSONSST000DLA3ECONOMICSST000DN4DLABOR MARKETST00096VMDEMOGRAPHIC GROUPSST00090NTECONOMIC CONDITIONSST0009SCBSOCIOLOGYSTX001937ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORSST0009G89REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTSSTX001938EDUCATION &amp; TRAININGSTX000622ENGINEERINGSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSSTX001826WEATHERSTX001946IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP &amp; DISPLACEMENTSTX001906FLOOD ZONESST0009P0DSCHOOL DISTRICTSSTX000551ECONOMIC NEWSSTX001960PUBLIC POLICYSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX001965SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLESTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST0009U58HISTORYST0009U56HUMANITIES &amp; SOCIAL SCIENCEN921000CCGOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICESST000DEUISEVERE WEATHERSTX000272CENSUSST0009HPFEDUCATION SYSTEMS &amp; INSTITUTIONSST000A1SOBUSINESS EDUCATIONST000DM8YBUSINESS NEWSST000DRP2ECONOMIC INEQUALITYSTX000506DISASTER PLANNINGST0009JY5COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORSST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001455REAL ESTATESTX000247CANALS &amp; WATERWAYSST00096KLRESIDENTIAL PROPERTYN541330GMCIVIL ENGINEERINGST00096KOHOUSING MARKETST0009S2VCONSTRUCTION OVERVIEWST000A2W7REAL ESTATE OVERVIEWSTX000622ENGINEERINGSTX001906FLOOD ZONESST0009HPFEDUCATION SYSTEMS &amp; INSTITUTIONSST0009JY5COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORSN230000CCCONSTRUCTIONGX555ATLANTA, GA, USAGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGS126GEORGIA, USAGS134LOUISIANA, USAGC343UNITED STATESBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Coastal ZoneZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzZBOUJENENCRjk2NDk0MDhCQUNEQkJERUNDQzc3RTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REM3NjlCMTNCRkNCNDc1Mzk5MzlGNjBBN0I2N0NENDUEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Coastal ZoneZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzZBOUJENENCRjk2NDk0MDhCQUNEQkJERUNDQzc3RTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REM3NjlCMTNCRkNCNDc1Mzk5MzlGNjBBN0I2N0NENDUTransportation LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjY5QTJBMDg0MzE0NDFGMUI2MUMyMjU1NjlBMUQ1QzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRBRTk5NEIyQzA2NEI4MTk0NDI2RTFEMjdCMTg0RTg
Assessing and Treating PTSD in the Wake of Natural Disasters: Lessons From Katrina to Today [6]

The physical destruction was staggering, but for many survivors, the emotional aftermath has proven just as enduring. As we mark the 20th anniversary of Katrina, the recent catastrophic flooding in Texas underscores that these events are no longer rare outliers but increasingly common realities in a warming world.
  Instance 2: PTSD can develop in any individual exposed to a traumatic event. Still, certain groupschildren, older adults, individuals with prior trauma histories, and those with fewer social or financial resourcesface a heightened risk. Research following Hurricane Katrina revealed PTSD prevalence rates as high as 30% in the most severely affected populations.1 These rates were often accompanied by comorbid anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, complicating treatment and recovery. Clinically, PTSD manifests in 4 symptom clusters: intrusive reexperiencing (eg, flashbacks, nightmares), avoidance of trauma reminders, negative alterations in cognition and mood (eg, guilt, detachment), and hyperarousal (eg, insomnia, irritability, hypervigilance). In the context of a disaster, these symptoms may be exacerbated by ongoing stressors such as unstable housing, financial loss, and disrupted support networks.2 Moreover, many survivors are hesitant to seek psychiatric care, either due to stigma or because basic needs such as shelter, food, and employment understandably take precedence.
  Instance 3: In 2024, NOAA reported 27 weather/climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion in the United States. While physical damage is often front page news, the psychological toll can be quieter, deeper, and more lasting. The trauma of Hurricane Katrina continues to reverberate 2 decades later, both in the lives of survivors and in the lessons it taught the mental health field.There is a growing need for scalable, telehealth-based interventions that can provide timely mental health support. As we respond to the Texas floods and prepare for future crises, we must prioritize trauma-informed mental healthcare at every stage of disaster response and recovery. This means embedding screening into emergency response systems, funding community-based mental health efforts, and training providers to recognize and respond to disaster-related PTSD with empathy and expertise.

  Instance 5: The physical destruction was staggering, but for many survivors, the emotional aftermath has proven just as enduring. As we mark the 20th anniversary of Katrina, the recent catastrophic flooding in Texas underscores that these events are no longer rare outliers but increasingly common realities in a warming world. For mental health professionals, the challenge lies not only in addressing immediate psychological distress but also in anticipating and mitigating the long-term mental health consequences that can follow a disaster.PSCTME-60229896F0F7867D27A8BAD89FE2CFFDF4D9837916B5E151E45F7E30202508130F28DAF289308311 PSCTME2025urn:contentItem:6GGV-X563-RRHP-F4SB-00000-004836572025-08-14Copyright 2025 MJH Life Sciences® All Rights ReservedPsychiatric TimesAugust 2025JournalIndustry Trade PressENGLISHST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST0008X6LRELOCATIONSSTX000103ANXIETY DISORDERSST000DHVKPROFESSIONAL WORKERSSTX001113MENTAL ILLNESSSTX001355POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDERST000DXSYPSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMASTX001579SLEEP DISORDERSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST000DIF5ADULTSSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSSTX002120PSYCHOLOGYSTX002021SAFETYSTX000735FLOODS &amp; FLOODINGST000DVNXHOUSING SECURITYSTX002136SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENTST000DLFXPSYCHOLOGICAL STRESSSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX002119PSYCHIATRYSTX000511DISEASES &amp; DISORDERSSTX001644SUBSTANCE ABUSESTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX002052DEPRESSIONSTX000290CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENSSTX000093ANNIVERSARIESST000DT01TRAUMA INFORMED CARESTX002098MENTAL HEALTH PRACTICEST000A8A4LEVELS OF CAREST000DMYZEMOTIONSST000D15WTHIS DAY IN HISTORYN611110QMPRIMARY SCHOOLSST000D05YMENTAL HEALTHST0009OZRPRIMARY &amp; SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERSN621399CCHEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALSSTX000508MORBIDITY RATESST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX002120PSYCHOLOGYSTX002119PSYCHIATRYSTX002098MENTAL HEALTH PRACTICEN611110QMPRIMARY SCHOOLSN621399CCHEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALSSTX000508MORBIDITY RATESEvidenceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUVGQkU0QjJFMTIzNDNBM0FCNTVEQjAxQTM3RDcwOTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0AllocationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkE0QjVFMTA5QkNGNDIzOTlCNUFGMTYwMjc1QUFDMTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkM1QzY2Q0E0NUNFNDBEMDg5QjUzRDIwM0UxQ0QxRTEFamily LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI4M0U5Qzg3RTk0NDdBRUJGNDRGNkZEQkU3RDdFNDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0ProceedingsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTZDMDNFMDRCRDY5NDlCMkJEODdCNkYxQTk5MjU2MjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkE2MkE5MTUwMzk5NEJFN0E5RUFCRUIyNDg3RkU4RjcHealthcare LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkUxMkVDQjJDOEY5NDVDQ0E5NTFEMTlDMjIwNzVERjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkVBOTZDMzQ2MUE4NDA1N0E0NDQyMUNBNzE1QUVCREQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkUxMkVDQjJDOEY5NDVDQ0E5NTFEMTlDMjIwNzVERjcPublic Health &amp; Welfare LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwRTY1MDg3MTk5NDUyNkFFRDI1RjJBRERGQ0UxNzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjdDOTFFQjY0OTM1NEUyNEI5OEYwODE0RTA4RENEQkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTA2N0I2MjA4MEMwNEExNjlBQzkzRjBGOTAxODRCNkYCommitment of ChildrenZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDhEOUU4MDAzRjFCNEQ0NzgyRjFGOUE0MEFERjFCMTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkQzMjQzQzhBQUQ2NDRBQTg4MjYwMzQ0QTI0N0E3RTQ

It's a perfect example of how we can honor our past while investing in our community's future."An undated photo of the Touro Shakspeare Home.

How a Hurricane Katrina victim is helping the smallest survivors of the Texas floods [4]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6G9B-1203-RWMN-G1VX-00000-00How a Hurricane Katrina victim is helping the smallest survivors of the Texas floods2025-07-19T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:19:44ZLexisNexisHow a Hurricane Katrina victim is helping the smallest survivors of the Texas floodsBy Chelsea Bailey, CNN(CNN)             (CNN) - Most people don't expect Mimi Hymel to remember Hurricane Katrina. After all, she was only 3 when the Category 5 storm slammed into her Louisiana home in 2005.But nearly 20 years later, as Hymel watched news of the floodwaters inundating Texas Hill Country and saw the harrowing images of destruction from Camp Mystic, she said those memories came back with sharp clarity.She can still recall the moment her family decided they couldn't ride out Katrina and the sinking feeling she felt as her mom placed Hymel and her sister in their car and drove away, leaving their dad behind to work at a nearby hospital.But most of all, Hymel said, she remembers how she struggled to fall asleep for days after they escaped the storm because she didn't have her favorite stuffed animal."I just had no idea if my dad was OK or even coming home at all," she recalled. "I had a teddy bear named Cuddles that I didn't get to take in the car with me.
  Instance 2: She reached out to Comfort Bears on social media and within hours they had a game plan.Gully's donation drive was covered on the local news and "that day alone, I think we collected 600" stuffed animals, she said.After three days they received more than 1,100 donations to be distributed throughout the state."Children don't really have an outlet to help" after a crisis, Gully said.

How New Orleans can fix its low voter turnout [3]

It increased to 39.9% for the general election that followed in May."Many residents believed that the new interest in civic life ... would spill over into politics.
  Instance 2: The 2006 mayor's election turned out to be a 20-year highwater mark."Voter participation  has declined since, even while social cohesion -engagement with things like social clubs, nonprofits, mutual aid groups and other grassroots organizations - deepened.The intrigue: Collins says the drop in voter participation is likely the result of a broken feedback loop.Put simply, people do things when they get rewarded, and they stop doing them if they don't.It becomes easy to think, "I voted [but] my house still floods when we have a minor hurricane, and I still get overcharged by Sewerage and Water, and my electricity still goes out sometimes on a summer afternoon even when there's no weather, and I still can't get the services I need with garbage pickup," he says.The bottom line: So, how do we fix it?We need "a new generation of political leaders that actually  promise and deliver," Collins says. "When you promise and deliver, it resets the feedback loop."Link to the original story.NWTXAX-AXIO1000954401K2CE1FKD5FF2MK9JGEGGXYHEAXIO-10009544urn:contentItem:6GG7-9W23-RSC0-134B-00000-004842262025-08-1111:20 AM ESTDelivered by Newstex LLC.

Historically, August has produced some of the most intense and damaging hurricanes, including Hurricane Andrew in 1992 that struck Florida as a Category 5 on Aug. 24, as well as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 which devastated New Orleans and the central Gulf Coast on Aug. 29.But that doesn't mean September will be quiet.

  Instance 10: And Marty was the only person with FEMA on the ground in New Orleans when the storm made landfall.And one of the things he told me, and this isn't in the film, is that after Katrina, FEMA learned some lessons. And part of what they learned was, and it's, I guess, a bit of a dirty word these days, but that you have to take equity into how you approach these disasters on the front end and the response on the front end, which is to say that these disasters affect everyone, but they affect some people more than others.And that the people who are most vulnerable for whatever reasons, whether class, age, disability, on the front end of the storm are the people who are going to have the hardest time recovering on the back end of the storm.So, if you center the needs of those people in the way that you prepare and respond, it not only helps them, it helps everyone. And I'm sorry to say that it feels like that that sort of approach has fallen out of favor under the current administration and the current understanding of FEMA and what its roles and responsibilities are.CORNISH: Traci Curry is the director of the new docuseries, Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time.

REP. CARTER SENDS LETTER TO TRUMP URGING A REVERSAL OF NEW ORLEANS LEVEE INSPECTIONS BEING SUSPENDED [3]
  Instance 1: President, Director Vought, and Assistant Secretary Telle:As the Founder and Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Congressional Disaster Preparedness and Recovery Caucus and Representative for Louisiana's 2nd Congressional District, I am writing to express my deep concern over the recent decision to suspend regular U.S. Army Corps of Engineers inspections of the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) in the New Orleans region for the next two years. This vital federal investment, built after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, protects the New Orleans metropolitan region from major hurricanes and storm surge. I respectfully urge you to reconsider this decision and restore funding for these inspections in FY2025 and to prioritize funding for maintenance and inspection in FY2026.Louisiana has more than 3,100 miles of levees the largest leveed area in the United States protecting nearly one-fifth of the state's land area from flooding. The New Orleans metropolitan region depends on HSDRRS, an intricate network of levees and floodwalls to shield millions of residents, major ports, refineries, and other critical infrastructure from hurricanes, storm surge, and tidal flooding.

Rep. Carter Sends Letter to Trump Urging a Reversal of New Orleans Levee Inspections Being Suspended [3]
  Instance 1: President, Director Vought, and Assistant Secretary Telle:As the Founder and Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Congressional Disaster Preparedness and Recovery Caucus and Representative for Louisiana's 2nd Congressional District, I am writing to express my deep concern over the recent decision to suspend regular U.S. Army Corps of Engineers inspections of the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) in the New Orleans region for the next two years. This vital federal investment, built after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, protects the New Orleans metropolitan region from major hurricanes and storm surge. I respectfully urge you to reconsider this decision and restore funding for these inspections in FY2025 and to prioritize funding for maintenance and inspection in FY2026.Louisiana has more than 3,100 miles of levees -- the largest leveed area in the United States -- protecting nearly one-fifth of the state's land area from flooding. The New Orleans metropolitan region depends on HSDRRS, an intricate network of levees and floodwalls to shield millions of residents, major ports, refineries, and other critical infrastructure from hurricanes, storm surge, and tidal flooding.

Historical precedent suggests significant insurance rate increases will follow this disaster, affecting California and the entire country.The ripple effects of major disasters on insurance markets are well-documented. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans residents faced insurance rate increases of up to 100%. The impact extended far beyond Louisiana:•Florida experienced a 41% increase in insurance rates between 2005 and 2007•New York saw an 11% rise during the same period•National homeowners insurance rates have already increased by over 10% in the past yearBroader Economic ImplicationsThe LA wildfires are occurring against a backdrop of increasing natural disasters and rising insurance costs. The recent seismic event in Asheville has contributed to this challenging environment.
  Instance 4: Insurance companies spread their risk and losses across their entire customer base, meaning catastrophic events in one region ultimately affect insurance rates nationwide.The human cost of these disasters cannot be overlooked, as communities face emotional trauma and financial hardship. The combination of loss of life, property destruction, and economic disruption creates long-lasting effects that ripple through the national economy.Frequently Asked QuestionsQ: How will the LA wildfires affect insurance rates outside of California?Insurance companies typically distribute significant losses across their entire customer base, which means major disasters can lead to premium increases nationwide. Historical patterns suggest that nationwide states may see gradual insurance rate increases over the next few years.Q: What makes the LA wildfires potentially more costly than Hurricane Katrina?The high property values in the Los Angeles area and the extensive reach of the wildfires contribute to the massive potential losses. With 500,000 homes worth $300 billion at risk, the financial impact could exceed previous natural disasters.Q: When can homeowners expect to see changes in their insurance rates?Insurance rate adjustments typically occur gradually over several years following major disasters. Based on previous patterns, significant changes could appear within 6-12 months and continue for several years as insurance companies assess and adjust to the full scope of losses.

  Instance 2: Wright charter director Sharon Clark; Xavier University professor Renee Akbar; Crescent City Schools CEO Kate Mehok; New Schools for New Orleans CEO Dana Peterson; Ben Franklin teacher and United Teachers of New Orleans representative Lauren Lastrapes; Black Education for New Orleans executive director Adrinda Kelly; Cowen Institute policy director Vincent Rossmeier; and New Orleans Public Schools Superintendent Fateama Fulmore.“This is a pivotal moment to take stock of what we’ve learned and what lies ahead,” said Douglas Harris, director of the Education Research Alliance for New Orleans. “We now have nearly two decades of data and lived experience to help us understand the full impact of this unprecedented transformationand how it might inform education policy going forward. ”In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the state assumed control of most public schools in New Orleans and converted them into independently operated charter schools overseen by New Orleans Public Schools. Today, 73 of the city’s 74 public schools operate under this charter model  a system that remains unique in the United States.At the Aug. 23 event, ERA-New Orleans will release 12 key findings from more than a decade of research on the city’s education reforms.
  Instance 3: According to the organization, the data highlights both academic gains and persistent challenges, including concerns over community trust and equity.Panelists are expected to address topics ranging from school vouchers and shifting demographics to hurricane preparedness and the role of politics in shaping education policy. Discussions will also explore whether traditional performance metrics adequately capture the needs and outcomes of students in the city’s schools.The forum is free and open to the public, with registration available online.Copyright © 2025 BridgeTower Media.

WILL FEMA EVER LEARN FROM FAILING TO PREPARE? [4]
  Instance 1: Criticism has fallen squarely on the Trump administration's efforts to greatly cut funding to FEMA. Reporting done in the weeks since the flooding revealed that FEMA exempted Camp Mystic from numerous flood regulations, including removing several camp buildings from FEMA's flood map. That flood map ensured that buildings and structures in a flood's path have certain safety precautions in place.Have government officials at FEMA learned nothing from the failures of the Bush administration in the wake of Hurricane Katrina's path of destruction in New Orleans? Probably not. The same mistakes keep happening again, and government leaders expect things to actually work out.
  Instance 2: (Today, FEMA almost exclusively deals with natural disasters.) FEMA employs 20,000 peopleexperts on addressing issues with natural disastersand is headquartered in WashingtonD.C.FEMA's main activity is distributing aid to state and local governments after natural disasters. Additionally, FEMA provides grants to states for disaster preparedness, and it operates the National Flood Insurance Program.Historically, FEMA has had a lot of issues when it comes to responding to emergencies. Most famously, FEMA failed in the wake of Hurricane Katrina to do what it was supposed to do: help victims of natural disasters.The United States Government Accountability Office released a report in 2019 about improvements FEMA had made since Hurricane Katrina. The report found FEMA was still lacking in several areas: (1) it still can't ensure that it has enough staff, (2) it still has not assessed national gaps in emergency preparedness, (3) it faced trouble implementing its recovery programs in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, and (4) it is not doing enough to assist older Americans and those with disabilities. These failures can be categorized into two areas: communication breakdown and a lack of direction for the recovery effort.Cuts to FEMA will result in more disasters like the one at Camp Mystic.
  Instance 3: Hopefully, soon. But if recent history is a lesson, then the same mistakes will be made again.FEMA needs to get its act together so that it can efficiently manage during times of emergency. In the midst of an emergency should not be the time to figure out that something wrong has happened.SNS-1127267365SNS2025urn:contentItem:6GD4-JR53-RWJC-C52M-00000-0080582025-08-01Copyright 2025 States News ServiceStates News ServiceJuly 28, 2025 MondayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHAMERICAN SOCIETY FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONSTX001851WOMENSTX001871YOUTH CLUBS &amp; ACTIVITIESSTX000008ACCIDENTAL FATALITIESST000A7ISASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAN924120QCOCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICESSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSSTX002021SAFETYN920000CCGOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONSTX001826WEATHERST000D1BYEXECUTIVESSTX000735FLOODS &amp; FLOODINGSTX001906FLOOD ZONESSTX001763TROPICAL STORMSN624230EGDISASTER &amp; EMERGENCY AGENCIESSTX001865WRITERSSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSN921000CCGOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICESSTX000669EXECUTIVE ORDERSN921100MMUS FEDERAL GOVERNMENTST000DN6RPUBLIC OFFICIALSST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001906FLOOD ZONESSTX001865WRITERSPE0009THXDONALD TRUMPPE0009VYYJIMMY CARTERGX512SAN ANTONIO, TX, USAGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGS159TEXAS, USAGS134LOUISIANA, USAGC343UNITED STATESPublic Health &amp; Welfare LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwRTY1MDg3MTk5NDUyNkFFRDI1RjJBRERGQ0UxNzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Emergency ServicesZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0E1M0VGRUVDNkJENDMyMkJGQjE5OThCMTVGNUMyREU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDZDNTZENUNCRjVBNEY4OEIyQzVBNjRDRTcyOEQ4NDQTortsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0HotelsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0M5NDA0ODAxMUU0NDU1Mjg3MzYzOTdBREU0N0E4Q0Q7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzdGNzdBRUJBQ0IxNEMxN0JENkZCOTc4NURCNjE2NkY

George suffered a head injury in the storm when an object fell on him as Katrina ripped apart his family's house. He didn't see what was coming as it happened and, to this day, is not sure what caused the injury."I remember our house flooding and collapsing.
  Instance 2: As they entered the tri-state area, George recalls his first exposure to the Rutgers R."As we got closer to what would be home, I kept seeing all these red Rs everywhere and I wondered what they meant. Now all these years later, I've been indoctrinated into the R family. Clearly it was meant to be," George humors.SNS-1127141174SNS2025urn:contentItem:6FTG-VCY3-RSWR-V04F-00000-0080582025-05-15Copyright 2025 States News ServiceStates News ServiceMay 14, 2025 WednesdayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHCC000834WBEST INCRUTGERS UNIVERSITYSIC5999 MISCELLANEOUS RETAIL STORES, NECBEST (NYSE)ST000A5KEFILM SCHOOLSST000C46MHEAD INJURIESST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSST000DEUISEVERE WEATHERST000C47HWOUNDS &amp; INJURIESSTX001753ARTS FESTIVALS &amp; EXHIBITIONSST0009UV1FILMST000DICXFILM FESTIVALSSTX001970TRENDS &amp; EVENTSST0008XAAVISUAL ARTISTSSTX000707FESTIVALSN611310SSCOLLEGES &amp; UNIVERSITIESN611310GMCOMMUNITY COLLEGESN611310IMHISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGESST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST0009HPZSTUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFESTX000150AWARDS &amp; PRIZESST0009JXSARTS &amp; HUMANITIES EDUCATIONST000DMYZEMOTIONSSTX001796VERDICTSST0009X8YSINGLE PARENTSST0009ZCSTWINS &amp; MULTIPLE BIRTHSST000A38CSPEECH THERAPYST000A5KEFILM SCHOOLSSTX001753ARTS FESTIVALS &amp; EXHIBITIONSST000DOOGCAMERASST0009UV1FILMST000DICXFILM FESTIVALSST0008XAAVISUAL ARTISTSSTX000707FESTIVALSN611310SSCOLLEGES &amp; UNIVERSITIESN611310GMCOMMUNITY COLLEGESN611310IMHISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGESST000A4XTMOVIE FILMINGST000D1W3GULFPORT, MS, USAGS146NEW JERSEY, USAGS140MISSISSIPPI, USAGR215SOUTHEAST USA
Behind-the-scenes of Edward Buckles' Essence magazine covers [3]
  Instance 1: Newstex and its re-distributors expressly reserve the right to delete stories at its and their sole discretion.Chelsea BrastedJuly 3rd, 2025 ( Axios  - Delivered by  Newstex )When  Essence magazine twice wanted to represent New Orleans on its covers over the past two years, it turned to Edward Buckles.Why it matters: The New Orleans native opted to put locals in the spotlight.Catch up quick: In 2024,  Essence Fest celebrated its 30th anniversary with a " love letter" to New Orleans for its July/August magazine.And this year, Essence offered an ode to the city's post-Katrina revival.Buckles snapped the photos for both, using local crews and production while working with creative director  Chike Ozah.What he's saying: The models, Buckles tells Axios New Orleans, are "the people who I thought were reviving the spirit of New Orleans, who are culture bearers doing their own version of rebuilding the city post-Katrina."Edward Buckles promotes "Katrina Babies" at the Zurich Film Festival in 2022. Photo: Joshua Sammer/Getty Images for ZFFZoom in: Buckles, who grew up in Algiers, Uptown and in the 7th Ward, is a photographer and filmmaker. He made a national name for himself with his " Katrina Babies" documentary on HBO in 2022.The project had Buckles talking with people who, like him, were young New Orleanians at the time the storm hit.Before and since then, he's thought a lot about the cultural weight of rebuilding."I wanted to highlight children who are currently carrying the torch of New Orleans, which are children not even born during Hurricane Katrina," he says.The end result is a pair of surrealistic cover photos taken at dusk, steeped in golden pinks and purples.In one, a young ballerina leaps uncannily high into the air above an empty lot, and in the other, a young trumpet player levitates just off an empty porch. Read the cover story."We wanted to have the kids levitating above these places that were once underwater because that's my biggest hope for them: I want them to rise above all this. ..
  Instance 2: Read the cover story."We wanted to have the kids levitating above these places that were once underwater because that's my biggest hope for them: I want them to rise above all this. .. I want them to know their history and understand they are still very much impacted by Hurricane Katrina ... but still very much rise above all that," Buckles says.What's next: Buckles is working on a new documentary with his alma mater, Edna Karr High School about cultural preservation, he says.

EQS-News: Wildfires and severe thunderstorms in the US drive global insured losses to USD 80 billion in first half of 2025, Swiss Re Institute estimates (english) [2]
  Instance 1: Forecasts indicate near- to above-average activity, with three to five major hurricanes - above the long-term average of three. For insurers and exposed communities, the key factor determining the scale of losses is where a hurricane hits. The 20-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina serves as a reminder that tropical cyclones, in particular major hurricanes, pose substantial risk to the eastern and Gulf Coasts of North America, as well as the Caribbean. For coastal communities, preparation and advance resilience are essential to minimise the impact. Balz Grollimund, Swiss Re's Head Catastrophe Perils, says: "Reinsurers not only act as a shock absorber for peak risks.

The settlement involved the replacement of certain educational facilities located in Louisiana that were damaged by Hurricane Katrina, the US Department of Justice said in a statement. FEMA provided institutional applicants, such as schools and universities, with public assistance funds for the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Funding was limited to the cost of repairing a damaged facility, unless that cost exceeded 50% of the facility's replacement cost, in which case full-replacement funding was available. Between 2006 and 2010, AECOM served as a technical assistance contractor in support of FEMA disaster recovery efforts following Hurricane Katrina.
  Instance 4: FEMA provided institutional applicants, such as schools and universities, with public assistance funds for the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Funding was limited to the cost of repairing a damaged facility, unless that cost exceeded 50% of the facility's replacement cost, in which case full-replacement funding was available. Between 2006 and 2010, AECOM served as a technical assistance contractor in support of FEMA disaster recovery efforts following Hurricane Katrina. In this role, AECOM prepared requests for public assistance funds on behalf of applicants that included, among other things, damage descriptions, estimates of the cost to repair damage and estimates of the cost to replace structures. The settlement resolves allegations that an AECOM project officer deployed to Louisiana for the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort submitted to FEMA fraudulent requests for disaster assistance funds for several educational facilities in New Orleans, which resulted in certain applicants receiving public assistance funds in excess of what FEMA rules permitted, including in some cases because the facility was entitled only to repair rather than replacement costs.
  Instance 5: Between 2006 and 2010, AECOM served as a technical assistance contractor in support of FEMA disaster recovery efforts following Hurricane Katrina. In this role, AECOM prepared requests for public assistance funds on behalf of applicants that included, among other things, damage descriptions, estimates of the cost to repair damage and estimates of the cost to replace structures. The settlement resolves allegations that an AECOM project officer deployed to Louisiana for the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort submitted to FEMA fraudulent requests for disaster assistance funds for several educational facilities in New Orleans, which resulted in certain applicants receiving public assistance funds in excess of what FEMA rules permitted, including in some cases because the facility was entitled only to repair rather than replacement costs. The facilities included the gymnasium, student center and electrical grid at Xavier University of Louisiana and a cafeteria building at the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans' St. Raphael the Archangel School.
  Instance 6: As part of the settlement with AECOM, the whistleblower, Robert Romero, will receive more than $2.4 million. The United States has now recovered nearly $25 million in connection with the disaster assistance applications prepared by AECOM.

The most expensive by far was Hurricane Katrina, the devastating tropical cyclone of 2005 which led to massive loss of life and economic damage, particularly in the city of New Orleans.The estimated insured losses alone for Hurricane Katrina were more than $100 billion, according to Aon.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (see graphic), its total costs were just shy of $200 billion, ahead of Hurricane Harvey (2017), Hurricane Ian (2022), Hurricane Maria (2017) and Hurricane Sandy (2012).Fires heap pressure on California home insuranceThe wildfires are going to put major pressure on California's already embattled home insurance sector.Firms in the area are braced for tens of billions of dollars' worth of losses, including companies such as Chubb and Travelers, which typically specialize in providing insurance for expensive, exclusive properties.Some companies, such as Allstate and State Farm, recently stopped selling new home insurance in the state.

How is the climate crisis affecting affordable housing? [1]
  Instance 1: Experts call this 'climate gentrification.'"I've spoken with real estate developers who have told me that yes, they do think about elevation now when they buy long-term property for development," Taylor said. "So, we know that displacement pressure on those communities is being to some extent amplified by a concern about climate."The cost of post-disaster housingWhen disasters do strike, they can erode available housing stock and put short-term pressure on rental supply. Sometimes in entirely different cities.Los Angeles' deadly January wildfires wiped out 16,000 structures, many of which were homes, instantly impacting what was already one of the country's most expensive housing markets."We often think about success in disaster recovery as bringing back the housing units, but there's not a lot of visibility to whether that housing unit is affordable or still occupied by the same person," said McTarnaghan.In New Orleans, housing prices jumped 33% in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The storm caused $125 billion ((EURO)114 billion) in damages and killed 1,392 people. And housing costs in Puerto Rico rose 22% after Hurricane Maria hit in 2017.Maria remains the deadliest hurricane in recent US history, killing nearly 3,000 people in Puerto Rico alone and causing roughly $90 billion in damages.
EQS-News: Hurricanes and earthquakes could lead to global insured losses of USD 300 billion in a peak year, finds Swiss Re Institute (english) [1]
  Instance 1: For example, Hurricane Andrew in today's prices caused USD 35 billion in insured losses in 1992. If a hurricane were to strike the same path today, it would cause losses nearly three times higher, due to economic growth, population increase and urban sprawl. Meanwhile, Hurricane Katrina, the costliest single insured loss event for the re/insurance industry ever, would not cause the same destruction as 20 years ago. Insured losses would still reach around USD 100 billion due to rising housing and construction costs, but improved flood defences and a 20% decrease in local population along Katrina's path have significantly reduced exposure. Exposure to natural catastrophes drives US insurance claims costs  While loss severity is rising globally, the US accounted for almost 80% of global insured losses in 2024, due to its vulnerability to severe thunderstorms, hurricanes, floods, wildfires and earthquakes.
US: Hurricane Francine barrels into Louisiana [2]
  Instance 1: "It's not going to be a good night to be driving on the roads, especially when the sun goes down."How prepared is the state?Louisiana's Republican Governor Jeff Landry declared a state of emergency and requested a federal emergency declaration from President Joe Biden, who swiftly gave it."This federal assistance will be pivotal to save lives and property," said Landry on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. "As Hurricane Francine approaches Louisiana, I appreciate President Biden quickly approving this request."The Louisiana National Guard said on X that its soldiers were fuelling up vehicles in preparation for the storm, having already mobilized helicopters, boats and supplies for evacuations and search and rescue.Francine is expected to quickly weaken as it moves inland over Louisiana and neighboring Mississippi, the NHC said.The low-lying state at the mouth of the Mississippi River was hit by one of the most devastating hurricanes in US history in late August 2005. Hurricane Katrina killed more than 1,300 people as it slammed into the populous city of New Orleans, overwhelming the city's levee system and causing devastating flooding.Scientists say climate change is likely to play a role in the fast intensification of storms that feed on the energy of increasingly warm seas.rc/rm (AFP, AP, Reuters)Link to the original story.NWTXWW-DEWL10998852695242336125220600058DEWL-7826urn:contentItem:6CY5-2721-F03R-N1FC-00000-004842352024-09-1111:36 PM ESTDelivered by Newstex LLC.

Migrants in Mexico await next phase of Trump's border plan [1]
  Instance 1: But there is an explicit exception to this federal law: the so-called Insurrection Act of 1807. This was originally intended to enable the president to bring in the army to suppress uprisings. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, under George W. Bush, it was extended to cover military assistance in response to natural disasters.In his decree, Trump demands a report from the secretaries of defense and the interior within 90 days on whether the situation at the border requires said Act to be invoked. Doing so would allow Trump to launch a more extensive military operation, including large-scale deportations of people without valid residence permits.Any such step by the Trump administration would inevitably end up in court.

Fact check: Viral claims in the wake of the Hurricane Helene disaster [2]
  Instance 1: Newstex and its re-distributors expressly reserve the right to delete stories at its and their sole discretion.October 8th, 2024 ( Deutsche Welle World  - Delivered by  Newstex )Disinformation is spreading in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which has killed more than 230 people in six US states. As the next Category 4 hurricane is gearing up, DW looks at some of the most viral claims.Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 storm on September 26 and left a path of destruction in its wake, moving through Georgia, North and South Carolina, and on to Tennessee to dissipate over Kentucky. It was the deadliest natural disaster to hit the US in close to two decades since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.DW Fact check looked at some of the claims surrounding aid being provided to those affected by the hurricane. Hurricane survivors only get $750?Claim: Victims of Hurricane Helene only get $750 in aid, while more money is being spent on undocumented immigrants and on Ukraine. This claim has been widely shared in this X post by an account in support of former President Donald Trump.

Swiss Re estimates $275 billion global losses from natural disasters [2]
  Instance 1: On average, the sum had risen by 5% to 7% per year over each of the past few years. The most expensive event by far was Hurricane Ian in Florida, with insurance losses of $50 to $65 billion. According to their records, it was the most expensive catastrophe after hurricane Katrina in 2005, which hit the US city of New Orleans and the surrounding area. Swiss Re also cites hail damage in France (more than $5 billion) and winter storms in north-eastern Europe (more than $4 billion). Inflation has driven up costs, the company said.
  Instance 2: In richer countries, however, the infrastructure is more expensive. That, along with the fact that more people are insured, is why the losses are higher there.

Swiss Re estimates $275 billion global losses from natural disasters [2]
  Instance 1: Less than half of that - $125 billion - was covered by insurance, the company announced on Wednesday.It was the second year in a row that the mark of more than $100 billion in insured losses was broken. On average, the sum had risen by 5% to 7% per year over each of the past few years.The most expensive event by far was Hurricane Ian in Florida, with insurance losses of $50 to $65 billion. According to their records, it was the most expensive catastrophe after hurricane Katrina in 2005, which hit the US city of New Orleans and the surrounding area.Swiss Re also cites hail damage in France (more than $5 billion) and winter storms in north-eastern Europe (more than $4 billion).Inflation has driven up costs, the company said. Increased prices had made buildings, vehicles and the like more expensive, thereby also driving up insurance claims.Natural disasters are often more severe in poorer regions of the world and usually claim more lives there than in industrialized countries. In richer countries, however, the infrastructure is more expensive.

Fact check: Are artificial hurricanes targeting Republicans? [2]
  Instance 1: "Yes, they can control the weather," claimed Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, an ardent supporter of Donald Trump, just days before. Her tweet has been viewed over 43 million times.DW Fact check: False.The shift is called Eyewall Replacement Cycle that is a normal occurrence in hurricanes of this magnitude. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 had also formed a double eyewall before hitting the coast and was about to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle, scientists found. As the inner wall weakened, the outer one gained strength, picking up intensity."In addition to large and rapid intensity swings, eyewall replacement cycles usually cause hurricanes to grow larger," hurricane experts explained.Aircrafts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) repeatedly fly into the storms to collect atmospheric data. NOAA had already said back in May that it was predicting above-normal hurricane activity in the Atlantic basin this year."We have had unlucky stretches before with back-to-back storms," meteorologist Matthew Cappucci told DW.
  Instance 2: She also mentioned fake evacuation maps she's seen and how those were harming people while they were fleeing a natural disaster."It confuses people when they need to find help and they don't know who to call," she said. Ultimately, "they don't trust anyone."Tetyana Klug contributed to this report.Edited by: Matthew Agius, Rachel BaigLink to the original story.NWTXWW-DEWL10998852943313981325220500174DEWL-7826urn:contentItem:6D57-3001-JCMN-Y1GT-00000-004842352024-10-104:42 PM ESTDelivered by Newstex LLC.

As the inner wall weakened, the outer one gained strength, picking up intensity."In addition to large and rapid intensity swings, eyewall replacement cycles usually cause hurricanes to grow larger," hurricane experts explained.Aircraft from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) repeatedly fly into the storms to collect atmospheric data. NOAA already said back in May that it was predicting above-normal hurricane activity in the Atlantic basin this year."We have had unlucky stretches before with back-to-back storms," meteorologist Matthew Cappucci told DW.

At the city's airport, wind gusts had reached 100 kilometres per hour.Citizens in the state of Louisiana and the city of New Orleans are being asked to brace for heavy rain, a life-threatening storm surge, catastrophic winds and extended power outages, the NHC said.The storm comes 16 years to the day since the state was battered by Hurricane Katrina, which caused the deaths of more than 1,800 people, alongside catastrophic damage and flooding in and around New Orleans.Editorial contactsEditing by: Coman Hamilton, &lt;international@dpa.com;DPA-2108299914309DPA2021urn:contentItem:63GJ-3RJ1-JB0G-F2FD-00000-001442452021-08-296:49 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Deutsche Presse-Agentur All Rights Reserveddpa international (Englischer Dienst)August 29, 2021 SundayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHweatherST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001826WEATHERSTX000317COASTAL AREASST000DEUISEVERE WEATHERST0008X9CGOVERNORSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINASTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSN924120QCOCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICESSTX001763TROPICAL STORMSST000D15WTHIS DAY IN HISTORYSTX001832WETLANDSSTX000735FLOODS &amp; FLOODINGSTX002021SAFETYSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESSTX001359POWER FAILURESPE000DOG1JOHN BEL EDWARDSGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGS134LOUISIANA, USAGC343UNITED STATES

History in the Big Easy: The New Orleans' Civil Rights Museum [2]
  Instance 1: All other states in the Deep South, however, have long documented the history of their civil rights movements in museums.In Memphis, Tennessee, for example, the Lorraine Motel, the site of Martin Luther King's assassination on 4 April 1968, has been the location of the National Civil Rights Museum since 1991. Georgia, Alabama, Texas and even ultra-conservative Mississippi all have comparable museums or institutes, as well. In Louisiana, however, plans were repeatedly put on hold - with Hurricane Katrina one of the reasons.Although this has now been rectified, the external setting for the museum seems strange when you see it for the first time, as it's located in the wing of the city's convention centre. The reason being, there was a rush to get the museum open, and there was no other suitable building.The complex is named after Ernest Morial, who, after his time as an activist, steered the fortunes of New Orleans as mayor from 1978 to 1986. To this day he is considered one of the best politicians in the city's history, which dates back to 1718.A symbolic locationFor many years, Morial remained the only black man whose name adorned a public building in New Orleans, a predominantly black and African American city.
  Instance 2: In October the Republicans recaptured the only governorship in the Deep South held by a Democrat. Jeff Landry, a conservative hardliner endorsed by Donald Trump, is now at the helm.However, the opening of the museum, which was pushed through by Nungesser, can no longer be stopped or even reversed. New Orleans and Louisiana finally have a dignified place for remembrance.DPAFNT-728275DPAFNT2024urn:contentItem:6C45-NSG1-DYHY-54YD-00000-004757512024-05-3112:12 PM GMTCopyright 2024 dpa Deutsche Presse-Agentur All Rights Reserveddpa trends &amp; featuresApril 16, 2024 TuesdayNewswireENGLISHCivil Rights LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Protected RightsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQSTX000302CIVIL RIGHTSST000DTNMACTIVISMST0009J49HUMAN RIGHTS &amp; CIVIL LIBERTIES LAWSTX000035AFRICAN AMERICANSN921000CCGOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICESST0009ZU5MARDI GRASST0009U58HISTORYST0008ZBZHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSSTX001444RACE &amp; ETHNICITYST000DA0CRACISM &amp; XENOPHOBIAST0009P09SCHOOL DESEGREGATIONST000DPKDSYSTEMIC RACISMST0009TD5US REPUBLICAN PARTYST0008X84US STATE GOVERNMENTST0008X9ICITY GOVERNMENTST000CYBPCONSERVATISMSTX002003ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001669TALKS &amp; MEETINGSST000CM6CSLAVERYST000DRDXNEGATIVE MISC NEWSN922120CCLAW ENFORCEMENTN921100JQMAYORSSTX001434PUBLIC SCHOOLSST0008X9EMARSHALSN712110MMMUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIESN721110GMHOTELS &amp; MOTELSSTX001482RESTAURANTSSTX001434PUBLIC SCHOOLSPE000D1CIMARTIN LUTHER KING JRGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGX564BATON ROUGE, LA, USAGX606MEMPHIS, TN, USAGS134LOUISIANA, USAGS116ALABAMA, USAGS126GEORGIA, USAST000A2VVMISSISSIPPI RIVERGS140MISSISSIPPI, USAGR215SOUTHEAST USAGS158TENNESSEE, USAGS159TEXAS, USAGC343UNITED STATES

Why are weather forecasts often inaccurate? [1]
  Instance 1: In my view, it wasn't a problem of 'incorrect models', but a problem of incorrect reporting.This kind of misreporting of ensemble forecasts may result in some of the problems that lead to our day-to-day understanding of how the weather's going to look.But it doesn't fully explain why some major weather events have catastrophic consequences and others of the same scale don't.Predicting extreme weather doesn't prevent catastropheA year ago, massive floods in the Ahr valley region killed nearly 200 people in Germany.That's despite the fact that the German Weather Service predicted them ahead of time. Shortly after the flood event, German prosecutors launched a probe against a district chief in the region for negligent homicide after failing to warn residents soon enough.This is just one example of what can happen when people aren't warned about dangerous weather far enough in advance. Countless others can be observed across the world, from Hurricane Katrina in the southern US in 2005, to the 2015 heat wave in India.Forecasting and prediction is only a part of the warning process, Nigel Arnell told DW. You need to have good mechanisms in place to disseminate those warnings both to public authorities' infrastructure or service operators, and the exposed public.He added that the authorities also need to know what to do when they receive such a warning, and that the public needs to take it seriously. In countries like Germany, where large inclement weather events like excess flooding or extreme heat don't happen on a regular basis, that's not always a given.Edited by: Carla BleikerLink to the original story.NWTXWW-DEWL109988170740293408825876100179DEWL-7826urn:contentItem:6B8Y-VJH1-F03R-N4PR-00000-004842352024-02-082:29 PM ESTCopyright 2024 Newstex LLC All Rights ReservedNewstex Blogs Deutsche Welle WorldFebruary 8, 2024 ThursdayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsEnglishScienceST0009XT1METEOROLOGYST0008YXDEARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCESTX001826WEATHERN924120QCOCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICESST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYSTX001964SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGYSTX001154MODELING &amp; SIMULATIONST0009JY5COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORSSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSSTX001154MODELING &amp; SIMULATIONST000DQAVSPACE DATA INDUSTRYSTX000358COMPUTER SIMULATIONST0009JY5COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS
Hurricane Ida makes landfall in Louisiana as Category 4 storm [3]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:63GK-39D1-JB0G-F2G1-00000-00Hurricane Ida makes landfall in Louisiana as Category 4 storm2021-08-30T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:10ZLexisNexisHurricane Ida makes landfall in Louisiana as Category 4 stormChristoph Zeiher in Berlin and Juergen Baetz in WashingtonWashington (dpa) -Hurricane Ida made landfall in the US state of Louisiana as a Category 4 storm on Sunday, bringing maximum wind speeds of around 240 kilometres per hour as it reached the coast from the Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said.The NHC warned that a hurricane of such strength usually causes catastrophic destruction on land - a grim warning for Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, who said that Ida would be the most difficult test yet for the flood protection of New Orleans.The coastal city has made massive investments in flood protection since the devastating Hurricane Katrina hit the city exactly 16 years ago, Edwards told broadcaster CNN on Sunday.Although Edwards said Ida will be "the most severe test" of the city's storm defences, he was optimistic the system will hold against the anticipated storm surge and massive rainfall.Edwards said he was more concerned about the areas south-west of the city that do not have as developed flood protection, where many of the residents had already left their homes and headed for safety.Several districts have imposed a curfew to ensure residents who haven't already left will stay in their homes in the face of extreme wind gusts and possible flooding. East Baton Rouge, where 440,000 people live, were under curfew from Sunday night to Monday morning.Ida is expected to lose strength as its centre moves towards the city of Baton Rouge, but it's still likely to be at least a Category 1.In a bulletin at 4 pm (2000 GMT), the NHC warned that Ida remained an "extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane ... Rapid weakening is expected during the next day or so, however Ida is forecast to remain a hurricane through late tonight and remain a tropical storm until Monday afternoon."The first serious signs of the storm system reached the coast south-west of New Orleans at noon on Sunday, with local media broadcasting footage of flooding and violent gusts of wind.By midday, the NHC had already measured a two-metre rise in the water level in a coastal wetland south of New Orleans.
  Instance 2: At the city's airport, wind gusts had reached 100 kilometres per hour.Citizens in the state of Louisiana and the city of New Orleans are being asked to brace for heavy rain, a life-threatening storm surge, catastrophic winds and extended power outages, the NHC said.In advance of the storm's landfall, US President Joe Biden approved Emergency Declarations for Louisiana and neighbouring Mississippi, "authorizing emergency preparation and protective measures," the White House said."To the people of the Gulf Coast: Please follow the instructions of local officials during this dangerous time," Biden later tweeted. "As soon as Hurricane Ida passes, we will put this country's full might behind your rescue and recovery."Tens of thousands of households have lost power due to Ida, with "widespread power outages" reported by the New Orleans Metropolitan Emergency Operations Centre just over an hour after it made landfall.The local utility Entergy showed that at least 170,000 households were without electricity. In a statement, the company warned that residents of the hardest-hit areas "could experience power outages for weeks."According to the website Poweroutage.us, around 504,000 customers were without power across the state at about 5 pm.The storm comes 16 years to the day since the state was battered by Hurricane Katrina, which caused the deaths of more than 1,800 people, alongside catastrophic damage and flooding in and around New Orleans.Editorial contactsEditing by: Miranda Lee Murray and Chiara Palazzo, &lt;international@dpa.com;DPA-2108309917157DPA2021urn:contentItem:63GK-39D1-JB0G-F2G1-00000-001442452021-08-2900:24:44+02:00Invalid date found for VDI: (VDI not available) XCEDOCID: 0 LNI: 63GK-39D1-JB0G-F2G1-00000-00.

Hurricane Ida: One dead, one million households without power in US [3]
  Instance 1: Repair work is ongoing but power is not expected to be restored quickly, the supplier said.The first storm-related fatality was reported in Prairieville, south of the city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana's state capital. The local sheriff's office announced the death on Facebook, saying the victim was killed Sunday evening by a falling tree.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) had warned earlier that a hurricane of such strength usually causes catastrophic destruction on land.Photos and videos showing massive flooding and damage from the hurricane, while local media reported homes were destroyed, streets flooded and trees and utility poles downed.The storm ripped off parts of a hospital roof in the town of Galliano. No one was injured.While it has been downgraded to Category 2 storm, gusts were still reaching speeds of up to 175 kilometres per hour as of late Sunday, according to the NHC.Ida is expected to keep losing strength as its centre moves towards the city of Baton Rouge, but it's still likely to be at least a Category 1.The storm comes 16 years to the day since the state was battered by Hurricane Katrina, which caused the deaths of more than 1,800 people, alongside catastrophic damage and flooding in and around New Orleans.Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards told CNN Ida would be "the most severe test" of New Orleans' storm defences, but said he was optimistic the system would hold.The city has made massive investments in flood protection since Hurricane Katrina hit exactly 16 years ago.Edwards said he was more concerned about the areas south-west of the city that do not have as developed flood protection, where many of the residents had already left their homes and headed for safety.Several districts imposed a curfew to ensure residents who haven't already left will stay in their homes in the face of extreme wind gusts and possible flooding.

The NATO Response Force was last activated around 16 years ago to deliver relief supplies in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in the United States and to help following a major earthquake in Pakistan. The personnel are located at various sites where refugees are being hosted in Europe, according to the same official. More than 20 of the 30 NATO countries are contributing to these efforts in some form or other, the source said.
  Instance 2: There are no more NATO troops in Afghanistan itself, following the US-led decision to leave the country after almost 20 years on the ground. The alliance signed off the deployment of troops from its Response Force on August 24, the NATO military official said, around a week after the militant Islamist group seized power in Kabul.

In its wake, it has left at least one person dead, millions without power and widespread damage.Fears were high as Ida approached, coming as it did on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which savaged New Orleans and left hundreds dead.

But meteorologists warned that it was still packing winds of 95 km/h.
  Instance 2: But meteorologists warned that it was still packing winds of 95 km/h. It is also moving very slowly, meaning communities in its path will be subjected to extreme winds for longer periods of time.The state of Louisiana has been hit hardest, according to the website poweroutage.us.At least one person died and power outages hit more than 1 million customers in the United States as Ida hit the country's south.Around 996,000 households lost electricity in the state, while some 36,000 customers were affected in neighbouring Mississippi.All of New Orleans lost power, the city's emergency preparedness campaign (NOLA Ready) said, citing utility firm Entergy."The only power in the city is coming from generators," NOLA Ready tweeted.

Germany helps fuel explosion in US gas exports [1]
  Instance 1: The magnitude of the proposed buildout of LNG over the next several years is staggering, the letter said. Approving CP2 and other LNG projects will undermine your stated goals of meaningfully addressing the climate crisis and put us on a continued path toward escalating climate chaos. Another lettersigned by 60-odd of Biden's fellow Democratic lawmakers in November asked the Department of Energy to consider the aggregate impact that the explosive growth in US LNG exports is having on climate, communities, and our economy.Hundreds of protesters marched in New Orleans last week against the expansion of Venture Global's nearby Plaquemines Parish LNG facility.Communities living close to the plant who are predominantly people of color will be especially impacted by pollution if severe storms hit the facility, said Bishop Wilfret Johnson, a Plaquemines Parish pastor who opposes the buildout.The hurricanes come all the time, that plant is in the flood zone, he told DW, reiterating the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2006. Has Biden bowed to pressure?Such pushback from climate-concerned constituents may have influenced the Biden administration.The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the government is set to delay a permit for Venture Global's CP2 facility by expanding a Department of Energy review to include more climate standards. Citing three unnamed sources close to the matter, the report said another 16 proposed LNG export projects could be delayed as a result.
U.S. Consumer Sentiment Drops Much More Than Initially Estimated In March [2]
  Instance 1: The consumer sentiment index is now down sharply from the final February reading of 101.0, reflecting the fourth largest one-month decline in nearly a half-century. Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin noted the steepest monthly drop was the 12.7-point nosedive seen in response to the deepening recession in October 2008. Curtin said there were also two 12.2-point slumps in response to the 1980 recession and Hurricane Katrina in September 2005. 'The 1980 and 2008 collapses in consumer confidence sparked long and deep recessions,' Curtin said. 'The Katrina decline was reversed within three months, and some observers compared that 'V' shaped economic episode to the expected impact of the coronavirus.'  He added, 'What didn't show a 'V' shape response was the recovery of New Orleans, a closer comparison to today's national economy.'  The report said the current economic conditions index tumbled to 103.7 in March from 114.8 in February, while the index of consumer expectations plummeted to 79.7 from 92.1.

The report said the current economic conditions index tumbled to 103.7 in March from 114.8 in February, while the index of consumer expectations plummeted to 79.7 from 92.1. On the inflation front, one-year inflation expectations fell to 2.2 percent in March from 2.4 percent in February, while five-year inflation expectations were unchanged at 2.3 percent.

Biden Picks Former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu To Oversee Infrastructure Law Implementaton [2]
  Instance 1: In this role, Landrieu will oversee the $1 trillion plan, working through the National Economic Council, the White House said. Landrieu, 61, has served as New Orleans Mayor from 2010 to 2018. When he took office, the city was still recovering from Hurricane Katrina and in the midst of the BP Oil Spill. He led the city in fast-tracking more than 100 projects and securing billions in federal funding for roads, schools, hospitals, parks and critical infrastructure, turning New Orleans into one of the United States' great comeback stories. In 2015, Landrieu was named "Public Official of the Year" by Governing, and in 2016 was voted "America's top turnaround mayor" in a survey of mayors.
  Instance 2: Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle who negotiated the original framework of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will attend the signing ceremony. According to the economic experts, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is going to ease inflationary pressures, lowering the cost to working families.

Insured losses from natural catastrophes break through USD 100 billion threshold again in 2022 [2]
  Instance 1: Hurricane Ian main loss driver in 2022 Insured losses were largely driven by Hurricane Ian, by far the year's costliest event. Making landfall in Florida in September as a category 4 storm, Ian resulted in estimated insured losses of USD 50?65 billion. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Ian ranks as the second-costliest natural catastrophe insured loss event on sigma records. In February 2022, a cluster of storms (Eunice, Dudley, Franklin) in north-western Europe triggered combined insured losses of over USD 4 billion, bringing the total for this category to almost double the previous 10-year average. Meanwhile, France saw the highest ever annual loss (USD 5 billion) from hailstorms.

EQS-News: Hurricane Ian drives natural catastrophe year-to-date insured losses to USD 115 billion, Swiss Re Institute estimates (english) [2]
  Instance 1: In this complex environment, Swiss Re is ready to support clients with our strong balance sheet, risk capacity and expertise."  Hurricane Ian is this year's costliest natural catastrophe with estimated preliminary insured losses of USD 50-65 billion. The category 4 hurricane made landfall in western Florida in late September with extreme winds, torrential rain and storm surge. Swiss Re Institute estimates it to be the second-costliest insured loss ever on sigma records after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. This highlights the threat potential of a single hurricane hitting a densely populated coastline, in an otherwise benign hurricane year. Furthermore, in February, a series of winter storms hit Europe and prompted estimated insured losses of USD over 3.7 billion, bringing this key peril back on the insurance industry's agenda.

Managed retreat: Moving before the sea swallows your home [2]
  Instance 1: After Sydney also flooded in April, the premier of the state acknowledged that such extreme weather was "becoming more common," and it would be necessary to "respond to the changing environment."  What is a managed retreat? Managed retreat means permanently moving people and buildings away from vulnerable areas — either in a preventative way or, as is more often the case, after a disaster. That's been the case in New Orleans, ever since Hurricane Katrina devastated the low-lying city at the mouth of the Mississippi River in 2005. "Climate change is affecting people all over the world, and everyone is trying to figure out what to do about it," said A.R. Siders, a disaster researcher at the University of Delaware, in a June 2021 study.

  Instance 1: Fear and loathing in LA and beyond Other elements more difficult to tally are the costs of things that didn't happen like canceled flights, trains stopped in their tracks, workers on sick leave with respiratory problems, long-term health issues and other lost economic activity, either because a shop or warehouse burned down or there is no one left there to buy the goods.Personal safety is also something to consider. Though US housing sales are on a high, after so many natural disasters California may soon been seen as too dangerous a place to live or do business. In the end people may leave the coast for other, safer places.Rebuilding is a lot of work and some may not be up to the challenge and may never come back as happened in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Higher insurance premiums for risky areas could help with these decisions.In many ways these wildfires could not have come at a worse time. Besides scorched land, the coastal states will have less money to spend since their economies have been hit by coronavirus-related downturns.

"We're still paying attention. We understand," Bush said at thefirst elementary school to reopen in the Ninth Ward, the section ofthe city most affected by Katrina.
  Instance 2: The Bush administration has requested 7.6 billion dollars fromCongress for the reconstruction effort for the 2009 fiscal year, theWhite House said. The federal government has allotted more than 114billion dollars to the region during the last two years. Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States twoyears ago, wreaking havoc along the southern shores of Alabama,Mississippi and Louisiana and leaving more than 1,800 people dead. The Bush administration was heavily criticized for not reactingquickly enough to evacuate the population and provide relief in theaftermath of flooding in New Orleans after the popular city's vastlevee system failed. Bush said some of the money designated for 2009 will go toward thelevees, which will be reconstructed to protect the city for 100years.
  Instance 3: "We fully understand that New Orleans can't be rebuilt untilthere's confidence in the levees," Bush said. "It's one thing toplan, it's another thing to convince people that the levees willwork."  Bush highlighted the progress that has been made in reopeningschools and pointed to the millions of Americans who donated money orvolunteered to help in the days following the storm.

The Corp of Engineers designed, built and maintained theMississippi River Gulf Outlet canal in 1965  as a short cut betweenthe river and the Gulf of Mexico.
  Instance 3: Attorney Pierce O'Donnell, another plaintiff lawyer, said it wasthe first time ever the Corps of Engineers had been "held responsiblefor its monumental negligence."  In its arguments before the court, the Corps said the city'slevees were the problem, and were inadequate to withstand Katrina'sstrong force. Duval found that the Corps was aware of the danger and evenconsidered remedial action just two years after finishing theproject, but abandoned the idea as not economically justified.

Taking up the hurricane's August 29 anniversary in his weeklyradio address, Bush renewed earlier admissions that Katrina caughtfederal, state and local governments "unprepared to respond to suchan extraordinary disaster."  Katrina, which flooded the jazz city of New Orleans and wiped outvirtually everything along a 125-mile stretch of Mississippi coast,exposed glaring breakdowns in the nation's emergency response systemand undermined Bush's image as a strong leader in an era of crisis. The government's slow, disorganized response raised questionsabout US preparedness for another major terrorist attack, since theproblems centred on the vast Homeland Security Department createdafter the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Why is the ICJ silent about the gender aspect of climate justice? [5]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6GGV-R9S3-RT1F-03SD-00000-00Why is the ICJ silent about the gender aspect of climate justice?2025-08-14T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:14ZLexisNexisWhy is the ICJ silent about the gender aspect of climate justice?Reporting by:The Daily Star                      DHAKA (The Daily Star/ANN)-On July 23, 2025, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a landmark advisory opinion on states' obligations related to climate change, a long-awaited milestone in the global push for climate justice. However, the opinion falls short in addressing crucial justice dimensions, particularly from a feminist perspective.The ICJ addressed two key questions: what legal obligations states hold concerning climate change, and what consequences arise from failing those obligations, especially for vulnerable populations and future generations. The court confirmed that these obligations stem both from climate treaties and customary international law, human rights law, and general principles of international law.Substantively, the court affirmed that all states must act to prevent "significant harm" to the environment and to human rights threatened by climate change.
  Instance 2: It emphasised that states could bear international responsibility for failing to act in accordance with scientific evidence and well-established legal norms. This pressurises countries to enhance their next Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and scale up financial and technical support for developing countries, based on the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities.The ICJ's recognition that climate-vulnerable nations like Bangladesh and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) can retain legal personality even if rising seas physically submerge them is groundbreaking. It enhances their legal standing in climate negotiations and opens the door to potential reparation claims in case of climate inaction by states or corporations.However, the ICJ's opinion stops short of addressing one of the most persistent blind spots in global climate governance: the gendered dimensions of climate justice.From a feminist lens, the opinion remains overly abstract and state-centric, failing to recognise how intersecting vulnerabilities shape real-world experiences. Although it references "vulnerable groups," it does not disaggregate or meaningfully analyse how women, indigenous peoples, gender minorities, and those at the margins of poverty and displacement face disproportionate climate impacts.Feminist legal scholars argue that this was a missed opportunity to incorporate gender-specific obligations into the climate governance framework. By not applying an intersectional approach, the opinion risks reinforcing structural inequalities rooted in patriarchal systems that govern access to resources, political voice, and burdens of unpaid labour.
  Instance 3: Feminist principles can be embedded into the architecture of mechanisms like the Loss and Damage Fund and the Green Climate Fund at forums like the COP negotiations.Whether ICJ's opinion leads to a more just climate order will depend on how civil society, legal practitioners, and policymakers push its boundaries. Without centring those most impacted by climate breakdown, the law risks becoming a tool of legitimacy rather than liberation. Thus, the ask at national level is, Bangladesh should adopt a climate justice legislation that is gender-sensitive and transformational.Farah Kabir is country director at ActionAid BangladeshViews expressed in this article are the author's own.ASIANN-newsmldpacom2009010125081499733509ASIANN2025urn:contentItem:6GGV-R9S3-RT1F-03SD-00000-004601732025-08-19Copyright 2025 Asia News Network All Rights ReservedAsia News NetworkAugust 14, 2025 ThursdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST0009J49HUMAN RIGHTS &amp; CIVIL LIBERTIES LAWST0008ZBXINTERNATIONAL LAWST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTX000404CORPORATE GOVERNANCEST000DZIFREPARATIONSST000DRN1NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWSST000DS4VSEA LEVEL CHANGESST000DV4ZACCESS TO FOODST0008ZBZHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSSTX000483DEVELOPING COUNTRIESST0008XMRLAW &amp; LEGAL SYSTEMST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONST0009QUFISLANDS &amp; REEFSN924110GJAIR QUALITY REGULATIONSTX000873HUMAN RIGHTSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSSTX000632ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES &amp; AGREEMENTSSTX001623STANDING TO SUEST0008X7KINDIGENOUS PEOPLESST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYST000DNUOCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICYST000D89FFEMINISM &amp; WOMEN'S RIGHTSST000DIURMINORITY GROUPSN922110EMINTERNATIONAL COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALSST000DH0QAGREEMENTSGX023DHAKA, BANGLADESHGC514BANGLADESHBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0LegislationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhGMTVENjdEQTUzNDVGMDlBMjQzMTE3MDRCQ0UwQUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAGreenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0LegislationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhGMTVENjdEQTUzNDVGMDlBMjQzMTE3MDRCQ0UwQUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAGreenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkVGNUU3RDc3MUVENDYwRjkxMEQwMDVGNTcxRTJDODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REZDN0NDN0QzNDUwNDA4NjlENDAxODkzMUNGOUNCQTMInternational LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdDODU0RjdGQ0JENEQ5RkI0MEU5MDA3NUMxQzEwNTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkNBOTBFMURCNEE3NEE5OEIwNjA1MDE4OTIxNEU1ODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTYzQjQyOTBDNzNDNEI2QUIyOTE2MEYyMTdBQTlDMzIGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTUzQTNGNUEzODNDNDhCRTg2MDNCNDE3MkU4NkE1NjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTZCMUU5OEUyREYzNDM4MjkzMkFCQzA0MTM3QUY1NjQTribunalsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkIxQTU1MkJBMEY1NDY4MDhBODUxRTJBNjVCREFDRDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjhBNEU2OUVGMEJGNDQzNUFEODk2MUY5QTRFMThCQjUJurisdictionZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjAxNThGMjZDN0E2NDlEMzg3RUI5MTAwNDY1OUU1QTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzY4MUJFQkI2ODRDNDYzOTlDMUMzNTAwOTcyNEI4NzYSources of International LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjlFOTNDODdFMzdFNDBFNjk2NTI0RjZBM0UxMTcwMjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ

The case could set a worldwide precedent for corporate responsibility and climate justice.In summer, Saul Luciano Lliuya grows corn, potatoes and quinoa. In winter, he takes tourists up to the icy heights of the Peruvian Andes. Now the farmer from the mountain village of Huaraz is in the global spotlight.
  Instance 3: How much responsibility should big polluters take? This case is basically about the polluter pays principle, says lawyer Roda Verheyen, who is representing Lliuya. "There is someone who does something - it may be permitted, it may be prohibited - but it leads to really unbelievably large and unacceptable consequences, in this case climate change." According to a 2014 study by Greenpeace and the environmental law non-profit Climate Justice Program, RWE is responsible for a total of 0.47% of climate-damaging emissions since the beginning of industrialization. Lliuya is, therefore, calling for the company to contribute a corresponding share to the financing of protective measures. These include drainage systems that allow meltwater to run off the glacier lagoon and an enlargement of the dam.
  Instance 4: In France, the fossil fuel giant TotalEnergies was sued in a case demanding it align business practices with the Paris Climate Agreement. According to Minnerop, negotiating questions of responsibility for climate risks exclusively at a national level is not enough in the long term. "Climate justice can only be achieved if we see it as a serious task within the framework of international law and pursue it with the priority that results from the scientific evidence," she said. If he loses, Lluiya fears that he and his village will end up without protection from flooding. He says that although the Peruvian authorities have plans for a dyke, there is no knowing whether it will be built, and that money from RWE and international attention for the construction could be helpful.If he wins, Lluiya says it will be a happy moment because it will signify "progress in the legal field," but it will not "stop the glaciers from melting." The court may decide as early as this week whether the proceedings will continue.

The Charter will serve as a blueprint for the planned Himalayan Climate Committee (HCC), expected to launch in 2026. As the world grapples with glacier melt, water insecurity, and rising climate impacts, the Himalayan region – often referred to as Earth’s “Third Pole” – is increasingly seen as a frontline requiring urgent global attention and cross-border collaboration.
Climate crisis pushes Indonesian youths out of school [1]
  Instance 1: Frequent evacuations due to natural disasters also expose girls to harassment at shelters."It is us girls who are often catcalled, insulted, harassed or asked for our phone numbers," said Vina, another pseudonym, in the report.Warnings from environmentalistsUli Arta Siagian, campaign manager of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi), said the findings align with her group's own research linking the climate crisis to more ecological disasters, worsening economic conditions and declining children's health."The climate crisis impacted the quality and quantity of our farmers' agricultural produce, which caused the community's economy to suffer. [...] Furthermore, it also directly impacts children's nutritional needs," Uli told the Post on Wednesday, adding that Walhi has documented reduced harvests of coffee, staple crops and local produce in multiple regions.Uli warned the trend would worsen unless there are "fundamental changes in policies and real actions" from the government.Under President Prabowo Subianto's administration, Indonesia has made several climate pledges, including achieving net-zero emissions by 2060 and retiring all coal-fired power plants by 2040.However, Uli criticized several laws for enabling "the destruction of nature in the name of investment", singling out the Job Creation Law, which has faced backlash for potentially weakening environmental protections. She urged its repeal alongside the passage of long-delayed legislation such as the Indigenous Rights bill and a proposed Climate Justice bill."Future generations will inherit a dire situation if nothing changes," Uli said.Read also: Climate action delivers when benefits are visible: UNFCCCRepresentatives from the Environment Ministry did not immediately respond to the Post's request for comments.Meanwhile, Save the Children has urged the government to address these threats by improving climate literacy in schools, ensuring disaster-affected children receive balanced nutrition, and strengthening food security through climate-resilient farming, among other measures.Child psychologist Annelia Sari Sani also stressed the importance of protecting children's education, warning of the cascading effects of disruption."When children are cut off from education, they will find it hard to develop their cognitive capacity, which will then lead to their difficulties in finding jobs. It's a never-ending cycle," Annelia said on Thursday.

  Instance 2: In 2024, the Philippines was selected to host the L&amp;D Fund Board to strategize fund disbursement and address urgent climate needs.John Leo Algo, National Coordinator of Aksyon Klima, a civil society network for climate action, emphasized that the L&amp;D Fund must function as a grant, not a financing agreement."Funds disbursed from the L&amp;D Fund should not further burden countries that are already vulnerable to the climate crisis," he told DW, calling such a scenario "unacceptable and unjust."Bridging the funding gapAlgo stressed that the fund should prioritize climate-affected communities, ensuring accessibility and availability during peak emergencies.While hosting the L&amp;D Fund Board doesn't give the Philippines priority access, it highlights the country's frontline experience with the climate crisis."Our role is to inform the board about emerging loss and damage trends worldwide, as we've experienced some of the highest risks and vulnerabilities in recent years," Mark Dennis Joven, board member of the Fund Responding to Loss and Damage, told DW.Joven, however, acknowledged the critical funding gap, with only $750 million ((EURO)725 million) in pledges secured globally - far short of the billions needed. "We need to act fast so we don't lose momentum," he noted. "Operationalizing the fund and deploying funds quickly will encourage stronger commitments from donor countries."Joven emphasized the importance of mainstreaming L&amp;D as the third pillar of climate financing, alongside mitigation and adaptation."Unlike project-linked finance, L&amp;D allows for rapid deployment and direct budget support, critical to achieving climate justice," he said.Domestic measures As international talks on the L&amp;D Fund continue, advocates in the Philippines continue to push for the Climate Accountability (CLIMA) Bill, which aims to hold carbon polluters accountable by creating a fund for climate loss and damage victims and linking reparations to corporate responsibility.The CLIMA Bill is similar to recent legislative actions in the United States.Under a bill signed into law last week, the US state of New York will fine fossil fuel companies $75 billion over 25 years to cover climate damage costs, with funds directed at mitigating impacts like adapting infrastructure.New York follows Vermont, which passed a similar law this summer, both modeled on superfund laws that require polluters to pay for toxic waste cleanup.This push for accountability echoes global efforts, with advocates like Virginia Benosa-Llorin stressing the need for polluters to face the consequences. "Every nation must ensure the biggest polluters pay. Without action, life-and-death climate impacts will become the new normal." Virginia Benosa-Llorin, senior campaigner for Greenpeace Philippines, told DW.Edited by: Keith WalkerLink to the original story.NWTXWW-DEWL10998853659022254625202100016DEWL-7826urn:contentItem:6DSW-Y8J3-S30D-537K-00000-004842352025-01-0112:46 PM ESTDelivered by Newstex LLC.
Why is critical thinking not included in Bangladesh's curriculum? [1]
  Instance 1: You'll find students rewarded for copying textbook paragraphs verbatim.Science, meanwhile, is less about discovering the world and more about memorising definitions like a corporate compliance manual. Religion is taught as moral absolutes with minimal room for interpretation. And civic education-formally lumped into "Bangladesh and Global Studies"-remains stuck in the glorious past of the Liberation War, with little engagement on democratic values, constitutional rights or climate justice. The idea that a student might question why freedom of expression is only celebrated in textbooks and not tolerated in classrooms is, frankly, revolutionary-and not in a way the authorities would appreciate.And speaking of values: where is the conversation around consent, gender equity or mental health? We have an entire generation going through puberty with the emotional intelligence of a brick because the word "sex" still sends policymakers into a shameful panic.
Disaster-wary Philippines leads push for climate justice [3]

  Instance 2: In 2024, the Philippines was selected to host the L&amp;D Fund Board to strategize fund disbursement and address urgent climate needs.John Leo Algo, National Coordinator of Aksyon Klima, a civil society network for climate action, emphasized that the L&amp;D Fund must function as a grant, not a financing agreement."Funds disbursed from the L&amp;D Fund should not further burden countries that are already vulnerable to the climate crisis," he told DW, calling such a scenario "unacceptable and unjust."Bridging the funding gapAlgo stressed that the fund should prioritize climate-affected communities, ensuring accessibility and availability during peak emergencies.While hosting the L&amp;D Fund Board doesn't give the Philippines priority access, it highlights the country's frontline experience with the climate crisis."Our role is to inform the board about emerging loss and damage trends worldwide, as we've experienced some of the highest risks and vulnerabilities in recent years," Mark Dennis Joven, board member of the Fund Responding to Loss and Damage, told DW.Joven, however, acknowledged the critical funding gap, with only $750 million ((EURO)725 million) in pledges secured globally - far short of the billions needed. "We need to act fast so we don't lose momentum," he noted. "Operationalizing the fund and deploying funds quickly will encourage stronger commitments from donor countries."Joven emphasized the importance of mainstreaming L&amp;D as the third pillar of climate financing, alongside mitigation and adaptation."Unlike project-linked finance, L&amp;D allows for rapid deployment and direct budget support, critical to achieving climate justice," he said.Domestic measures As international talks on the L&amp;D Fund continue, advocates in the Philippines continue to push for the Climate Accountability (CLIMA) Bill, which aims to hold carbon polluters accountable by creating a fund for climate loss and damage victims and linking reparations to corporate responsibility.The CLIMA Bill is similar to recent legislative actions in the United States.Under a bill signed into law last week, the US state of New York will fine fossil fuel companies $75 billion over 25 years to cover climate damage costs, with funds directed at mitigating impacts like adapting infrastructure.New York follows Vermont, which passed a similar law this summer, both modeled on superfund laws that require polluters to pay for toxic waste cleanup.This push for accountability echoes global efforts, with advocates like Virginia Benosa-Llorin stressing the need for polluters to face the consequences. "Every nation must ensure the biggest polluters pay. Without action, life-and-death climate impacts will become the new normal." Virginia Benosa-Llorin, senior campaigner for Greenpeace Philippines, told DW.Edited by: Keith WalkerLink to the original story.NWTXWW-DEWL10998853659442261125201200056DEWL-7826urn:contentItem:6DSX-3WP3-S2T7-F1NX-00000-004842352025-01-0112:46 PM ESTDelivered by Newstex LLC.
Thunberg and other activists continue their journey to Gaza by sea [1]
  Instance 1: The 22-year-old has become famous for her determined fight for more action on climate change. However, she has long been committed to the cause of the Palestinian people. The ship's aid mission is part of "a global movement for social and climate justice, liberation and decolonization," Thunberg wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of herself on board. "If we are to stand on the right side of history, it is our duty and about time that we join this movement," the post said. Israel has blocked the delivery of food, medicine and other essential goods to the Gaza Strip for almost three months as part of its war against the Palestinian Islamist Hamas movement but has recently eased the blockade somewhat.

400+ EPA Grants Canceled In Fourth Round Of Spending Cut With DOGE [1]
  Instance 1: "It is our commitment at EPA to be exceptional stewards of tax dollars."  The EPA Administrator has been working with other agencies to establish accountability and oversight regarding $20 billion parked at a financial institution by the Biden Administration in a rushed effort to obligate money with reduced oversight. The Justice Department and FBI are investigating and the money is currently frozen by the financial institution. Further, Zeldin cancelled grants and contracts related to DEI and environmental justice in the first round of spending cuts, terminated a $50 million Biden-era environmental justice grant to the Climate Justice Alliance, and ended more than $1 million in media subscriptions.

EPA Cancels 21 Additional Grants In Third Round Of Cuts With DOGE [1]
  Instance 1: We will not stop until we ensure every taxpayer penny spent is to advance clean air, land and water and Power our Great American Comeback for all Americans," Administrator Zeldin said. Last week, Zeldin announced the cancellation of 20 grants for wasteful DEI and environmental justice programs saving more than $60 million. Prior to that, the Administrator cancelled nine DEI and environmental justice contracts resulting in nearly $60 million of taxpayer savings, terminated a $50 million environmental justice grant?to the Climate Justice Alliance, and ended ?more than $1 million in ?media subscriptions. EPA uncovered extensive troubling developments with $20 billion in gold bars the agency parked at an outside financial institution to rush out the door and circumvent proper oversight. As has been reported, the Justice Department has an ongoing investigation regarding these funds, parked during the Biden administration.

Women's rights face unprecedented threats worldwide, UN study finds [1]
  Instance 1: However, it notes that almost three quarters of all members of parliament are still men.It also shows that 1,531 legal reforms have sought to advance gender equality around the world since 1995. Nonetheless, it finds that women still have only 64% of the legal rights of men.Progress on maternal mortality has slowed, the report notes, falling by a third between 2000 and 2015 but remaining roughly the same since then.Meanwhile, it finds that the number of cases of sexual violence in conflicts has risen by 50% since 2022 - with women and girls making up 95% of the victims.In the report, UN Women presents an action agenda for gender equality consisting of six pillars. These include a digital revolution for women and girls, as well as measures to address poverty, violence, peace and security, and climate justice.Editorial contactsEditing by: Flora Bell, +49 30 2852 31472, &lt;international@dpa.com;DPA-25030699135643DPA2025urn:contentItem:6F8H-Y9S3-RSS3-B382-00000-001442452025-03-0612:36 PM GMTCopyright 2025 Deutsche Presse-Agentur All Rights Reserveddpa international (Englischer Dienst)March 6, 2025 ThursdayNewswireNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHrightsLabor &amp; Employment LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTE3QUQwOTA0MUYzNDlCMEFFMjUwRUNDM0RDRkM5QzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjZGMEFCRjUyRjE3NDhFRkFFMTA0NTA1OTZGMTYyNjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDVFOTg1MzBEN0U0NDNENzgzNzBBMjY4MjRCMjk3MkISTX001851WOMENST000D89FFEMINISM &amp; WOMEN'S RIGHTSSTX001477RESEARCH REPORTSST000D7R3GENDER EQUALITYSTLL000CVGECHILDREN'S RIGHTSST000CYDJDISCRIMINATIONST00097Z3GENDER &amp; SEX DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENTSTX000873HUMAN RIGHTSST000DRN1NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSST000DRDXNEGATIVE MISC NEWSSTX001965SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLESTX000607EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATIONST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST000DIEGGENDER &amp; SEX DISCRIMINATIONST0008XMRLAW &amp; LEGAL SYSTEMN921120CCLEGISLATIVE BODIESSTX001110MENSTX001852WOMEN'S HEALTHSTX000425DEATH RATESST000A7ISASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONSN921000CCGOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICESSTX001555SEX OFFENSESSTX001372PRESS RELEASESST000DT41MATERNAL MORTALITYST000DRDOPRESS AGENCY RELEASES

The Peruvian farmer taking on global energy giant [2]
  Instance 1: How much responsibility should big polluters take? This case is basically about the polluter pays principle, says lawyer Roda Verheyen, who is representing Lliuya. "There is someone who does something - it may be permitted, it may be prohibited - but it leads to really unbelievably large and unacceptable consequences, in this case climate change." According to a 2014 study by Greenpeace and the environmental law non-profit Climate Justice Program, RWE is responsible for a total of 0.47% of climate-damaging emissions since the beginning of industrialization. Lliuya is therefore calling for the company to contribute a corresponding share to the financing of protective measures. These include drainage systems that allow meltwater to run off the glacier lagoon and an enlargement of the dam.
  Instance 2: In France, the fossil fuel giant TotalEnergies was sued in a case demanding it bring business practices into line with the Paris Climate Agreement. According to Minnerop, negotiating questions of responsibility for climate risks exclusively at a national level is not enough in the long term. "Climate justice can only be achieved if we see it as a serious task within the framework of international law and pursue it with the priority that results from the scientific evidence," she said. If he loses, Lluiya fears that he and his village will end up without protection from flooding. He says that although the Peruvian authorities have plans for a dyke, there is no knowing whether it will be built, and that money from RWE and international attention for the construction could be helpful.If he wins, Lluiya says it will be a happy moment because it will signify "progress in the legal field," but it will not "stop the glaciers from melting." The court may decide as early as this week whether the proceedings will continue.

Peruvian farmer heads to Germany for legal battle with RWE [1]
  Instance 1: Energy giant RWE has said it doesn't understand why it's being singled out.Peruvian farmer Saul Luciano Lliuya said he had faith in the German justice system at a Wednesday press conference ahead of his flight to the German city of Hamm, where his case is about to be heard."I have full confidence in these processes," he told journalists in Lima.The hearing, scheduled to begin on March 17, is next step culmination of a nearly ten-year legal battle between Lliuya, 44, and German energy giant RWE over the effect climate change is having on his village in Peru's northern Ancash region.Why RWE?Lliuya is seeking assistance from RWE to address the effects of climate change on his village of Huaraz, where a glacier lake is swelling due to melting snow and ice, putting the entire town at risk.His claim is based on a 2013 Carbon Majors Study that found RWE responsible for 0.5% of climate change since industrialization began. Therefore, he is asking that the company pay for about 0.5% of the cost of protecting Huaraz, some (EURO)17,000 ($18,400)."What I am asking is for the company to take responsibility for part of the construction costs, such as a dike in this case," the father of two said in Lima, adding that "the melting of the glaciers is very evident."For its part, RWE has said it doesn't know why it was being singled out, having never operated in Peru and saying it has plans to be carbon neutral by 2040.Case will 'set a huge precedent'The judicial process has been an uphill battle for Lluiya, with the case first being dismissed by a court in the city of Essen in 2015, before the Hamm court agreed to hear an appeal two years later. Proceedings were further delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.The hearing later in March will see the court deciding what evidence is admissable in the final trial, the first time a climate case against a major polluter has gotten this far in Germany.Andrea Tang, a lawyer for the NGO Germanwatch, who is paying Lliuya's legal fees, said that the case "would set a huge precedent for the future of climate justice... something that could be applied in other civil cases, in other countries as well."Edited by: Darko JanjevicLink to the original story.NWTXWW-DEWL10998854214562320725204400022DEWL-7826urn:contentItem:6F8K-7HD3-RSDJ-X1MT-00000-004842352025-03-067:54 PM ESTDelivered by Newstex LLC.

Women's rights under attack amid democratic erosion: UN [1]
  Instance 1: Domestic violence continues to be an alarming issue, the report found."Globally, violence against women and girls persists at alarming rates. Across their lifetime, around one in three women are subjected to physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner or sexual violence by a non-partner," it said.Meanwhile, gender gaps at work remain stagnant and women do 2.5 times more unpaid care work than men.What should be done?The report outlined an agenda meant to improve women's rights. A six-point action plan touched on tasks including a digital revolution for women and girls, freedom from poverty, a zero violence policy and complete and equal decision-making power.It also called for climate justice for women."We must prioritize women's and girls' rights in climate adaptation, center their leadership and knowledge, and ensure they benefit from new green jobs," a statement accompanying the report said.With a new roadmap based on the report's finding, UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous said the agency hopes the world will be closer to the UN's goal of achieving gender equality by 2030.

Reflecting on 2024, the stated that "hope has been hard to find", with wars causing enormous pain, suffering and displacement, and inequalities and divisions fuelling tensions and mistrust. The Secretary-General said that even in the darkest days he has "seen hope power change."  In this regard, he saluted activists of all ages who are raising their voices for progress, as well as "humanitarian heroes overcoming enormous obstacles to support the most vulnerable people."  The Secretary-General said he also sees hope in developing countries fighting for financial and climate justice, and in the scientists and innovators breaking new ground for humanity. The Secretary-General concluded by stating that there are no guarantees for what lies ahead in 2025. He pledged to stand with all those working to forge a more peaceful, equal, stable and healthy future for all people.

  Instance 2: Construction work, moreover, causes climate emissions - and the exported goods drive unsustainable growth in countries with higher incomes.The construction of new highways or major dams is similarly destructive. The forests are disappearing, giving way to industrial interests. Logging, plantations and open-pit mining are causing massive harm.In view of the ecologic and social disasters, demands for climate justice lack credibility unless African elites reconsider their own attitudes as well. They obviously bear some responsibility for the state of the continent. Two things matter in particular:We need a healthier approach to the natural environment.
  Instance 3: We need universal health care and good education opportunities even in remote villages.

Landmark climate hearings conclude at world's top court [2]
  Instance 1: What impact could a top court decision have? With hearings at The Hague ending today, a court decision is expected early next year.While its opinion is not binding, it is expected to have wide repercussions in clarifying states' obligations under international law, as national courts often look to the top court for guidance. "The ICJ's opinion could shape the trajectory of global climate litigation, paving the way for a new era of decisive action to tackle the global climate crisis," said Joy Reyes, climate justice lawyer and policy officer at the London School of Economics' Grantham Institute. "As the world's highest court, the world court's proceedings carry significant authority and moral weight."Even before a decision is reached, campaigner Houniuhi called the proceedings a milestone in climate justice as the first time the voices of frontline communities will be weighed equally alongside those of major polluters.

Germany's green crossroad: Climate takes backseat on campaign trail [1]
  Instance 1: BERLIN (dpa-AFX) - As Germany prepares for elections on February 23, a striking shift has emerged: climate action, a defining issue in the last national vote just over three years ago, has nearly disappeared from the campaign discourse this time. Polls indicate that German voters are divided on climate policy. A recent survey by Climate Alliance Germany, a climate justice advocacy group, found that 53% of voters want the next government to do more to protect the environment. However, other polls suggest that climate action ranks only fourth among voter priorities, behind migration, economic stability and security concerns. Migration is a dominant issue as some regions feel the strain on the asylum system due to the amount of irregular arrivals, fuelling intense national debate.

Countries with low incomes are most exposed to its impacts, have the least resources for adapting to the change and have contributed least to making the crisis happen.The disparities between world regions are great, but the greatest disparity today is between the global rich and the global poor. According to the Climate Inequality Report the richest one percent of the world population causes more climate gas emissions in absolute terms than the poor half of humankind.
  Instance 2: They did not cause the crisis, but they will suffer its escalating impacts. The young generation's future looks increasingly dark. Climate justice requires that those who are most affected by the climate crisis get a say in how societies respond to it.We need a dramatic transformation. High-income nations in particular must reduce emissions much faster than they have done so far. Moreover, they must fulfil their promise of transferring $ 100 billion in annual climate finance to less fortunate countries.
  Instance 3: Policymakers cannot allow entire regions or population groups to drop into poverty. It is obvious, however, that not every inconvenience is preventable.The lifestyles of the richest people is compounding the climate crisis. For the sake of climate justice, their excessive privileges are not acceptable. State action can reduce extreme inequality. Prudent taxation is one option, and it would boost government revenues.
Germany's green crossroad: Climate takes backseat on campaign trail [1]
  Instance 1: Experts and environmentalists warn that this shift could put Germany's ambitious green transition at risk.Once a top priority, climate action has faded to the background in Germany's upcoming elections as migration, economic stability and security take centre stage. Experts and environmentalists warn that this shift could put Germany's ambitious green transition at risk.As Germany prepares for elections on February 23, a striking shift has emerged: climate action, a defining issue in the last national vote just over three years ago, has nearly disappeared from the campaign discourse this time.Polls indicate that German voters are divided on climate policy.

At the same time, economic worries - driven by inflation and high energy costs - have shifted public focus to the cost of living and job security.Additionally, security concerns stemming from the ongoing Ukraine war and debates over defence spending have further dominated the political agenda.Critics say the silence on climate issues on the campaign trail has been deafening.Stefanie Langkamp, climate policy director at umbrella group Climate Alliance, said: "The challenges of climate protection remain enormous, but the parties remain silent on the matter - or advocate regression."Germany's green transition at risk?Germany's green transition, or "Energiewende," is considered one of the world's most ambitious national shifts from fossil fuels and nuclear power to renewable sources.In 2024, roughly 58% of the country's electricity generation came from renewables - wind, solar, biomass and hydropower - up from about 40% in 2021 and about 6% in 2000, according to official figures.Data from the intergovernmental International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) shows that Germany ranks fifth globally in installed solar capacity and third in wind energy capacity.However, Germany's transition efforts are also being used as a cautionary tale in some circles.A recent study published by US-based think tank Baker Institute points to Germany's "Energiewende" warning that "misguided energy policies can have far-reaching implications.""Germany's recent efforts to implement bold renewable energy policies risk undermining its long-standing position as a European economic powerhouse and global leader in manufacturing," it stated."By prioritizing energy transition speed over economic stability, Germany's new energy policy includes many missteps, such as relying heavily on Russia to supply natural gas [and] shutting down all nuclear plants, among others," it reported.Conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz, the frontrunner to become Germany's next chancellor, has framed the election as a "referendum on failed green economic policies," slamming Economy Minister Robert Habeck, a Green, for his "disastrous economic and energy policy."Scholz's climate legacyWith the Greens poised to exit government, according to recent polls, environmentalists are concerned that ambitious climate policies pursued under the current centre-left coalition could now be at risk.The government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz is credited with expanding renewable energy sources and successfully phasing out nuclear power by the end of 2023, all while maintaining energy stability amid economic and security crises.The Russian invasion of Ukraine further forced Germany to rapidly reduce its reliance on Russian gas, prompting an urgent diversification of energy supplies.In 2023, the government amended the Climate Action Act - intended as a cornerstone of Germany's climate policy - accelerating the carbon neutrality goal to 2045 and raising its 2030 emissions reduction target to 65%, with coal set to be phased out by 2038.However, a controversial heating law mandating the phaseout of fossil fuel heating systems in some buildings triggered widespread public backlash and partly led to the implosion of Scholz's coalition.Cutting through election noiseClimate policy has not been completely sidelined from the current election campaign. However, observers note the discourse has been polarized rather than productive.Speaking at an Alternative for Germany (AfD) party conference, the far-right party's top candidate, Alice Weidel, said to great applause: "When we are at the helm, we will tear down all wind turbines.

  Instance 1: Charles Ross, a textile specialist based at the Royal College of Art in London and columnist for OIC, praised the move, saying, “This is not just nice; this is where a lot of work has been done to allow the whole of the OIA membership to up the bar of quality towards the planet that the whole industry are partners with. Hats off to Andrew [Denton] and Co. for making it easier for who they represent to collectively do good!” Founded in 2002, 1% for the Planet encourages companies to donate 1 percent of their annual sales to environmental causes, with a wide range of impact areas, including climate justice, conservation, and supply chain sustainability. The partnership strengthens OIA’s role in fostering a greener, more responsible outdoor recreation industry.OICOM-110911OICOM2024urn:contentItem:6D3W-9G01-DYSC-R2TB-00000-004770702025-08-20Copyright 2024 EDM Publications GmbH All Rights ReservedThe Outdoor Industry CompassIssue 4October 6, 2024NewspaperNewspapersENGLISHN813910MMBUSINESS &amp; PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONSST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTX000403CORPORATE GIVINGST000CUVUCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITYST0008XKJBUSINESS ETHICS &amp; CORPORATE CITIZENSHIPST000DRNCESG FACTORS - SOCIALST000D1BYEXECUTIVESSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESST000DL6MSUSTAINABILITYSTX001965SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLEST000DRO4GREEN SUPPLY CHAINSSTX001660SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTST000DT0ISUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION &amp; PRODUCTIONN924120CCCONSERVATIONSTX000406CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITYST000DLONCORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITYST000DRO4GREEN SUPPLY CHAINSSTX001660SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTST000DT0ISUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION &amp; PRODUCTIONGX106LONDON, ENGLANDBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0State Conservation ActsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUYwQjdGRDFCOUJBNEQ5REJDMjA4QTg1MzIyOEI3RjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTAwOTgyMTVBNkJFNENFMzgyODE3NEYxNzdBQTU4RkMBusiness &amp; Corporate LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjA4OEVGODBENzY4NDcxM0IyQzA1OTEwQzVDODRBOUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzQwNjJBMUVBRDAwNEVFNUIwNjE0M0JFQ0IwNjk5MDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTBBOERFMzlGNEE5NDI2OUEwMUFDNkNFOURENTQ5MDQGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkYzRTkxNkJFRTVCNDMzMjhCOUU4QjgzRkU3QkZGRkQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUY4M0Q1RThCNkEyNDgzOTlCNEU2QkY4QkYzNEYzRjcGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzZCNTdCQ0Q2OTRDNDYxOTg2MTY2NTREQUVGNjBBQzE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYwRjBDQTc2RUU5NDVGQkEwNjMwMTExRkI4QjQwNEQEnergy &amp; Utilities LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0State Conservation ActsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUYwQjdGRDFCOUJBNEQ5REJDMjA4QTg1MzIyOEI3RjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTAwOTgyMTVBNkJFNENFMzgyODE3NEYxNzdBQTU4RkMEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUyRkJDQzI5NkU3NDY1NUJEMENGMkUwRTBDNDBENjk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTQ2RTNCMEZCMTYwNENFRkJDRjkwQkIzNkVDMEIxQzcGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkJDMzEzRDkxMDVBNDA3N0FDRjNDODI2NUIzMzZDMDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjI3QUU4NUZEQzZFNEYzRThENkZBRTA1MkUyQTAwQTAInternational Trade LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkJBQ0VFNDdFQkRFNENBMDlEOUUzM0ZDNzVGNkVBMTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEQwM0JDMjg2MjJBNDYyNjlFREQ0QzY3NDhCREZGRkU
Rights critics condemn Azerbaijan's COP29 host role [2]
  Instance 1: He cannot go back to his homeland for fear of ending up in prison like the dozens of other government critics and environmental activists currently behind bars in Azerbaijan.NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW) said repression has worsened in the tiny petrostate over the past two years. The group urged the European Union to spotlight the "deteriorating human rights situation" when world leaders descend upon Baku for the COP29 conference to discuss climate action and fair financing for global climate protection.As host and lead negotiator, Azerbaijan says it wants to promote the goals of the historic Paris Agreement. It will focus on compliance with the 1.5-degree Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) temperature limit, more climate protection, financial support for developing countries and climate justice, according to official documents sent to the nearly 200 participating states.Oil and gas are 'a gift from God'Traditionally, the climate conference host acts as a kind of mediator in negotiations and can set the tone of the talks. Azerbaijan's president Aliyev has already made clear where his priorities might lie at the negotiating table."I have always said that having oil and gas deposits is not our fault. It's a gift from God," Aliyev told Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock and chancellor Olaf Scholzat the Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin in April.At the meeting, Aliyev said he would defend the right of countries to invest in and promote fossil fuels as a way to help drive his country's prosperity and fight poverty.The COP host's electricity mix is made up of 93% fossil fuels.
  Instance 2: But it continues to rely on Azerbaijan's gas, even if the petrostate is a minor oil and gas player compared to Saudi Arabia, China, and the USA.Environment activists and journalists in dangerAway from the negotiations at the UN climate summit in Baku, the situation for government critics and environmentalists on the ground is bad. HRW says climate protests are violently suppressed, and activists are arrested on fictitious grounds.In April, for example, police arrested human rights and climate activist Anar Mammadli outside a kindergarten for alleged smuggling of counterfeit cash. Just before his arrest, Mammadli co-founded an initiative to campaign for civil rights and climate justice in Azerbaijan, said HRW. He's still in prison.Reprisals against critics have been intensifying ahead of the climate conference, said HRW. As has brutality against journalists.
'Even that red line no longer exists' [1]
  Instance 1: By providing economic and military support, western countries are giving these governments enormous power over global events and ultimately contributing to instability and armed conflicts, as can be seen in Iran, Syria, Turkey, Israel or Russia.Let's take a look into the future. In 2025, the Beijing Declaration, which promotes equal rights for men and women, will turn 30; UN Resolution 1325, on women, peace and security, will turn 25. How can we use this anniversary year to promote women's rights?Particularly in times of anti-democratic policies, we must loudly and clearly demand the political will and the necessary funds for sustainable development, positive peace and gender and climate justice. We have to confront decision-makers with the fact that neither current funding levels nor the condition of the world are adequately supporting women. But we can only overcome polycrises with women's help.DECOOP-DEVCOOP2901202500001DECOOP2025urn:contentItem:6F12-VM23-RSP1-23RM-00000-004337012025-01-30Copyright 2025 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights ReservedDevelopment and CooperationJanuary 29, 2025 WednesdayMagazineMagazines &amp; JournalsEnglish USCivil Rights LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Protected RightsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQST000D89FFEMINISM &amp; WOMEN'S RIGHTSSTX001851WOMENST000DH0QAGREEMENTSSTX000873HUMAN RIGHTSST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSST000DTNMACTIVISMST000DNALGENDER BASED VIOLENCEST000DM4KMISOGYNYST000DRDXNEGATIVE MISC NEWSST000DRN1NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWSST000CURUTALIBANSTX002018TERRORISM &amp; COUNTERTERRORISMST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX000524DOMESTIC VIOLENCESTX000949INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONSSTX001218NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONSST000DL87DEMOCRACIESST000CYDJDISCRIMINATIONST0009J49HUMAN RIGHTS &amp; CIVIL LIBERTIES LAWST0008ZBZHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSST00099LRMUSLIMS &amp; ISLAMST000DNCCPATIENT RIGHTSSTX001965SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLESTX001852WOMEN'S HEALTHSTX002003ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICSST000D73FEUROPEAN UNIONST0008ZBXINTERNATIONAL LAWSTX001346POLITICSSTX001758TREATIES &amp; AGREEMENTSST000DL5QTYPES OF GOVERNMENTSTX000950INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSN921120CCLEGISLATIVE BODIESSTX001333PLATFORMS &amp; ISSUESST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSSTX001020LEGISLATIONST000DI7ESINGLE SEX EDUCATIONST000A7ISASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONSN621399CCHEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALSSTX001464RELIGIONSTX000425DEATH RATESN621399QCPHYSICIANS &amp; SURGEONSST00096VNPOPULATION CHARACTERISTICSST000DT41MATERNAL MORTALITYSTX002299MIGRANT WORKERSST000DNCCPATIENT RIGHTSN621399CCHEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALSN622000CCHOSPITALSN621399QCPHYSICIANS &amp; SURGEONSGC508AFGHANISTANGT115EUROPEST0009XYUKOSOVOST00099QFEUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES

What's been said at the landmark ICJ climate hearings? [1]
  Instance 1: The United Nations had requested that the ICJ outline any legal consequences for states that damage the climate. But the US played down the court's authority to enforce climate compensation claims on large emitters, for example.Taylor said the ICJ should not weigh whether countries have "violated obligations" in the past regarding climate policy. "Nor would it be appropriate," she said, for the court to decide whether states have a "responsibility for reparations."Vishal Prasad, director of the Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, said the United States was seeking to "evade its responsibilities as one of the world's largest polluters," and had a "blatant disregard for the pressing urgency of the climate crisis." "The US is content with its business-as-usual approach and has taken every possible measure to shirk its historical responsibility, disregard human rights, and reject climate justice," he said.On the first day of hearings, Saudi Arabia, like the United States, urged the court to be cautious in its legal opinion, arguing that UN treaties on climate change already provided a comprehensive blueprint for state climate action.China, the biggest global greenhouse gas emitter, insisted that existing UN climate negotiations should remain the "primary channel" to govern action, a position also backed by fossil fuel powerhouse Australia. Ralph Regenvanu of Vanuatu expressed disappointment at efforts to limit the ICJ's jurisdiction on climate under the guise of maintaining current accords. "These treaties are essential, but they cannot be a veil for inaction or a substitute for legal accountability," the special envoy said.

COP29: World agrees to $300bn deal for developing countries [1]
  Instance 1: "This deal will keep the clean energy boom growing and protect billions of lives.""It will help all countries to share in the huge benefits of bold climate action: more jobs, stronger growth, cheaper and cleaner energy for all. Like any insurance policy, it only works, if the premiums are paid in full, and on time."A resistent few attempted to restrict progressGermany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock made a lengthy statement on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, following the agreement acknowledging that resistance to meeting the issues of climate change had been fought back during COP 29."Yes, our agreement here tonight is not enough, due to resistance from a few," she wrote. "Those who have come here to prevent progress and prevent more climate justice and to weaken our multilateral UN system altogether, have failed - badly." Bearbock also added that the most vulnerable nations were not being abandoned and the $300 billion a year agreement was just a starting point."Nobody forgot about historical responsibility," she added. "As a member of a younger generation, it is also clear: We cannot tackle the challenges of the future with the solutions of the past. We know that our decisions today won't alone be enough to meet all the needs."Developing nations react with disappointmentDespite the agreement being met with applause from those in the room in Baku, there was also disappointment at the final figures agreed.India's representative Chandi Raina said the Asian country rejected the document, adding: "We are disappointed in the outcome which clearly brings out the unwillingness of the developed country parties to fulfill their responsibilities.""I regret to say that this document is nothing more than an optical illusion.
Why Africa needs a strong green growth [1]
  Instance 1: We need appropriate pricing of goods that reflects the environmental impact of processes and products. We need transparency in government reporting on water use, pollution, CO2 emissions, et cetera. And we need strong civil societies to keep governments in check.Your paper emphasises the role of climate justice in evaluating growth models. How can African nations better advocate for equitable climate policies on the international stage?There needs to be more respect. Many feel that Africa is still being patronised.
Germany's Greens push to retain power [1]
  Instance 1: Her election is proof that the Greens' national campaign will be very much tailored around the lead chancellor candidate.Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, the party's top candidate in the 2021 election campaign, expressed interest in keeping her position even after the snap election. The aim is to defend the country and democracy against threats from within and without, above all, right-wing extremists and populists, she told party delegates."Our responsibility as a progressive party is now, above all, to give security, to protect what is dear and sacred to us," she said. Baerbock also claimed that the enemies of democracy, progress and freedom played on people's insecurities by "badmouthing Germany every day."Focus on climate change, infrastructure and housingGuest speaker Luisa Neubauer, Germany's most well-known climate activist from the Fridays for Future movement, reminded the Greens not to forget their key issue of combating climate change in their quest for power."If you do not honestly and clearly name what is happening in terms of the climate crisis and what still needs to be done in the matter of climate justice, then everyone else will hide behind it." she said.She called on Habeck's team to engage in "a real climate election campaign that nobody else is doing otherwise."The Greens also want to address the housing shortage and renew the country's ailing infrastructure. These are all projects the center-left coalition had resolved to do, but could not implement.The Greens have clearly switched into election campaign mode. "Given the situation in the world, the crises and conflicts, Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine, we would have liked more responsibility for the continuation of this alliance," Britta Hasselmann, the Greens' parliamentary leader in the Bundestag, told DW.

German border city prepares for flood [1]
  Instance 1: The Green Party is only polling at around 5% in the state, though it is still part of the coalition government, and Green Environment Minister Axel Vogel has instigated several legal efforts to protect the Oder.On the campaign trail, however, Green Party candidates have not found that voters are particularly interested. "I haven't got that impression," said Damus. "What we hear at the campaign stands, or when we hand out flyers, it's always other questions: War and peace, energy prices, and border controls."Local climate activist Rosa Skiba, of Students for Climate Justice, has found the same: She is very disappointed by how little the climate crisis is being brought up by Frankfurt mayor Ren Wilke, even though the link between a warming climate and extreme weather is well-known. "Occasionally, scientists are asked for their assessment in news reports. But the threat posed by the climate crisis, which manifests itself in the dangers of flooding, is generally relegated to the background," she saidMany locals do want to protect the river that gives the city its name, Skiba added: "But it often happens that the climate crisis is perceived as a very abstract global problem and that when people get upset about local flooding, no connection is made between this and the local impacts of the global climate crisis."Uwe Meier admits that "climate denialism is very widespread in Germany," to the extent that he has encountered some Frankfurters who even deny the flooding itself.
Hurricane Beryl aims at Jamaica after flattening Caribbean islands [1]
  Instance 1: The airports in Kingston and Montego Bay were to be closed overnight.Disaster in GrenadaBeryl was temporarily upgraded to a "potentially catastrophic" category 5 - the highest level - late on Monday, but has since lost some of its intensity, the NHC said.With sustained maximum winds of 230 kilometres per hour, Beryl is now a category 4 storm, just below the threshold of 251 km/h for category 5.Beryl made landfall on Monday in the south-eastern Caribbean islands of Carriacou, with around 6,000 inhabitants, and Petite Martinique, with about 900. Both belong to Grenada.Terence Walters, coordinator of Grenada's National Disaster Management Agency, said at a press conference late on Tuesday that 98% of the buildings on the two islands were damaged or destroyed.Numerous trees and power poles have been toppled, and there is no electricity, water, or mobile phone reception. The entire vegetation on Carriacou has also been destroyed, said Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell."This hurricane is a direct consequence of the climate crisis, at the forefront of which are Grenada, the Caribbean and other small island developing states," Mitchell emphasized.Grenada will demand climate justice from the international community, he added. Mitchell stated that island states will no longer accept having to take out loans to rebuild year after year while the countries responsible for the climate crisis remain inactive.UN spokesman Stephané Dujarric told journalists in New York that seven agencies based in Grenada and nine in St Vincent and the Grenadines "will be augmented by additional UN emergency teams in the coming days."Also hit hard was Union Island, with around 5,000 residents, which belongs to the country of St Vincent and the Grenadines. According to the government, around 90% of the infrastructure on the island was damaged.Grenada has so far reported three deaths due to the storm, Venezuela two, and St Vincent and the Grenadines one.Venezuelan vice president hit by treeNeighbouring island states were also battered by heavy rains and strong winds, including St Lucia and Venezuela.Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was struck by a falling tree during Hurricane Beryl, according to the government."She was hit hard, but she is conscious," Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said in a speech to supporters.Rodríguez had travelled to the northern coastal state of Sucre to oversee the clean-up of damage caused by Beryl.More danger aheadBeryl is the first hurricane of the season, which starts at the beginning of June.According to experts, never before has a hurricane of this magnitude been recorded in the Atlantic this early in the year.The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) expects an unusually strong hurricane season this year amid rising water temperatures due to climate change and La Niña, a season of cooler water temperatures in the Pacific expected to set in this year.The eye of the storm is forecast to pass over or near the Cayman Islands from overnight Thursday.

Life360 Names COO Lauren Antonoff as Chief Executive Officer [1]
  Instance 1: "Chris has been an amazing partner, and I'm thankful to him and the Board for the trust and confidence they have placed in me. I'm energized and honored to lead the company forward, staying grounded in our mission and focused on delighting our members with products that deliver real peace of mind."Hulls' impact is reflected in every aspect of Life360-from the product experience to its values-driven culture. As Executive Chairman of the Board, Hulls will continue championing the free member experience, supporting breakthrough initiatives, and partnering closely with Antonoff to shape the company's long-term vision."What started as an idea in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, to help families reconnect in moments of crisis, has become a platform trusted by millions around the world. I could not have imagined how far we'd come, or how many families we'd impact," said Hulls. "Lauren and I share a bold vision for Life360, and we knew early on it would require a shift in operations to support the scale and speed at which we want to move.
As FEMA Shrinks, a Grassroots Disaster Response Is Taking Shape [2]
  Instance 1: Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate in the final weeks of his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, fanned the flames with some false or misleading claims about the federal response. The experience further weakened trust in FEMA, whose reputation took perhaps its worst hit after its botched response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. "The people we took care of didn't really care if they existed or not," said Mike Toberer, the owner of Mountain Mule Packer Ranch in Mount Ulla, N.C., referring to FEMA. "But I would say they do have a role if it's done correctly."       Mr.
  Instance 2: He also helped deliver supplies last month in eastern Kentucky, after deadly tornadoes. "We just want to get help to the people and that's it," he said. Newer groups need to develop detailed protocols and reliable funding streams to make sure that their work is sustainable and reputable, and that it doesn't hinder the work of local officials, said Brian Trascher, the vice president of the United Cajun Navy, which formed in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. Members of his group worked with some of the groups in Kentucky after the tornadoes. "We've turned into a full-fledged logistical disaster response group," he said, adding that the organization's practices had been shaped over the years by lessons learned in each successive disaster.
Searching for Meaning at the Thunder Ranch Gun School [1]

Mr. Hay grew up in New Orleans and experienced the lawlessness that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and turned his hometown into a "free fire zone," he said. "In my younger life, I didn't feel confident in my own abilities to defend or take care of myself," he said. 'There Has to Be Something Better'On the last day of class, Mr.
Student gospel singers take stage at New Orleans festival known for celebrity acts [2]

Yet it's also become a showcase for lesser-known talent: local schoolchildren.Gospel choirs from area high schools took the stage Friday at the festival’s famed Gospel Tent, continuing a decades-long tradition for Louisiana students.First up to perform was the Eleanor McMain choir, jolting the audience with a blast of musical joy, from the rollicking call-and-response of “Melodies From Heaven” to an a cappella rendition of the “Battle Hymn of the Republic.”Choir member Chloe Bailey, 18, said the performance is about pride.“Not only do I get to make myself proud, my parents proud, I get to make the whole world proud and have a look of how beautiful it is to see Black people and Black children thriving and going up higher, because we don’t get a lot of opportunities like this,” she said.In a city with a rich music heritage, the festival is a prized opportunity to celebrate arts that teachers say do not receive the attention they once did in schools.Music education suffered in New Orleans in the 1990s due to funding cuts, said Matthew Sakakeeny, a professor of music at Tulane University. Up until then, majority Black schools typically had at least one full-time music teacher, even when schools were segregated, but dozens of teachers lost their jobs and offerings were “drastically cut back,” he said.Hurricane Katrina was another blow, leading to the city's traditional public schools being replaced with charter schools. Sakakeeny said there’s enormous pressure to focus on core academics, rather than arts, as they’ll get shut down if their test scores are not good enough.“It’s just ironic that we’re the birthplace of jazz, yet middle school students, elementary school students might not even go to a music class,” said Emeka Dibia, the choir director McDonogh 35, the first public high school established for Black students in New Orleans.Gospel has been an integral part of Jazz Fest since it began in 1970, headlined by gospel legend Mahalia Jackson. Students from McDonogh 35 started performing in the 1970s, and more schools followed, Dibia said.
  Instance 2: I thank God that he gave me the opportunity to sing,” said Wesley.Yet even for kids who have performed at the Superdome, there's something about the Gospel Tent stage. There may have been millions of people watching the Super Bowl, but Jazz Fest represents New Orleans’ soul.“I don’t even know what kind of feeling it is,” said Leah. “It’s a very big feeling, I can say that.”AFRICN-httpswwwafricanewscom20250426studentgospelsingerstakestageatneworleansfestivalknownforcelebrityactsutmsourcelexisnexisutmcaignfeedscultureutmmediumreferralAFRICN2025urn:contentItem:6FND-TV33-RRV5-4005-00000-004786712025-04-2612:59 PM ESTCopyright 2025 Euronews SA  All Rights ReservedAfricanews (English)April 26, 2025 SaturdayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsENGLISHTULANE UNIVERSITYUnited StatesAmericas, Northern AmericaLouisianaSTX000707FESTIVALSST0009UHVMUSICSTX001753ARTS FESTIVALS &amp; EXHIBITIONSSTX000268CELEBRITIESSTX000290CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENSST000DS9JCONCERTS &amp; MUSIC FESTIVALSST00098X3CUSTOMS &amp; CULTURAL HERITAGEST0009UGEJAZZ &amp; BLUESST0009JZVMUSIC EDUCATIONN711130MMMUSIC GROUPS &amp; ARTISTSST0009OZRPRIMARY &amp; SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERSST000A4JWSINGERS &amp; MUSICIANSST0009HPZSTUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFESTX001691TEACHING &amp; TEACHERSSTX001970TRENDS &amp; EVENTSST0009VC0ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERSST0009HPFEDUCATION SYSTEMS &amp; INSTITUTIONSST0009P0GEDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEESST0009JZHHIGH SCHOOLSSTX001434PUBLIC SCHOOLSST00099LPCHRISTIANS &amp; CHRISTIANITYN611110QMPRIMARY SCHOOLSSTX001388PRIVATE SCHOOLSST0009P09SCHOOL DESEGREGATIONST00098PNPRIMARY &amp; SECONDARY EDUCATIONN611110GMSECONDARY SCHOOLSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST0009JY5COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORSST0009JZ0FAITH BASED SCHOOLSST000D7G9MIDDLE &amp; JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLSSTX001010LAYOFFSST0009EOFCORE CURRICULUMSTX001981LAYOFFS &amp; DISMISSALSSTX000279CHARTER SCHOOLSSTX000707FESTIVALSSTX001753ARTS FESTIVALS &amp; EXHIBITIONSSTX000268CELEBRITIESST000DS9JCONCERTS &amp; MUSIC FESTIVALSN711130MMMUSIC GROUPS &amp; ARTISTSST000A4JWSINGERS &amp; MUSICIANSST0009VC0ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERSST0009HPFEDUCATION SYSTEMS &amp; INSTITUTIONSN610000CCEDUCATIONAL SERVICESST0009JZHHIGH SCHOOLSSTX001434PUBLIC SCHOOLSN611110QMPRIMARY SCHOOLSSTX001388PRIVATE SCHOOLSST00098PNPRIMARY &amp; SECONDARY EDUCATIONN611110GMSECONDARY SCHOOLSST0009JY5COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORSST0009JZ0FAITH BASED SCHOOLSST000D7G9MIDDLE &amp; JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLSSTX000279CHARTER SCHOOLSPE000CNW5LIL WAYNEGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGS134LOUISIANA, USAGC343UNITED STATES
2024's record ocean heat revved up Atlantic hurricane wind speeds: study [2]

In the Gulf of Mexico, these emissions made sea surface temperatures around 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.4C) hotter than they would have been in a world without climate change.This rise fuels stronger hurricanes.The increased temperatures intensified storms like Debby and Oscar, which grew from tropical storms into full-fledged hurricanes. Other hurricanes were pushed up a category on the Saffir-Simpson scale, including Milton and Beryl which escalated from Category 4 to Category 5 due to climate change, while Helene climbed from Category 3 to Category 4.Each rise in category corresponds to a roughly fourfold increase in destructive potential.Helene proved particularly devastating, claiming more than 200 lives, making it the second deadliest hurricane to strike the US mainland in over half a century, surpassed only by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.The new analytical approach allows researchers to hone in on a given storm's track -- showing for example that, at Hurricane Milton's point of peak intensification before landfall, climate change made the warm sea surface temperatures 100 times more likely to occur than otherwise, and increased maximum wind speed by 24 mph.Gilford and his colleagues also published a peer-reviewed study in the journal Environmental Research Climate examining hurricane intensities from 2019 to 2023. They found that 84 percent of hurricanes during that period were significantly strengthened by human-caused ocean warming.While their two studies focused on the Atlantic Basin, the researchers said that their methods could be applied to tropical cyclones globally.Climatologist Friederike Otto of Imperial College London, who leads World Weather Attribution, praised the team's methodology for advancing beyond previous research that primarily linked climate change to hurricane-related rainfall.Otto warned that these climate supercharged storms are occurring with the world at just 1.3C (2.3F) above pre-industrial temperatures, and that the impacts are likely to worsen as temperatures rise beyond 1.5C (2.7F)."The hurricane scale is capped at Category Five -- but we might need to think about, should that continue to be the case just so that people are aware that something is going to hit them that is different from everything else they've experienced before," she said.RENWSE-RENWSE2024urn:contentItem:6DFY-TFP1-F19C-X0M2-00000-003505052024-11-20Copyright 2024 ETX Studio All Rights ReservedETX Daily Up (English International Version)HOUSE &amp; HOMENovember 20, 2024 WednesdayNewspaperIndustry Trade PressENGLISHST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001826WEATHERSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYSTX000594EMISSIONSST000DS5VOCEAN HEALTHSTX001235OCEANSSTX001763TROPICAL STORMSSTX001477RESEARCH REPORTSST0008YXDEARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCEST00097R4ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCHST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINASTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSST0009RLPRESEARCH INSTITUTESST000D8B1GREENHOUSE GASESSTX001865WRITERSSTX000594EMISSIONSN511000CCPUBLISHINGSTX001865WRITERSST000A2L6ATLANTIC OCEAN

Disaster preparedness for animals, time for EU to act says non-profit group [Advocacy Lab Content] [2]
  Instance 1: The study found that forced separation between humans and their animals during crises can have profound mental health consequences."One of the most excruciating situations is forced separation when people are compelled to leave their pets behind," said Tetiana Yeskova, Head of the Project Management Office at the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. "Many people refuse to leave their homes and pets behind. This bond provides emotional stability in times of crisis."This dilemma often forces individuals to stay in dangerous situations rather than abandon their animals.Research from Hurricane Katrina in 2008 found that the loss of a companion animal during a disaster was linked to increased anxiety, acute stress, and long-term mental health issues.Ukraine: a case study in animal welfare at war The war in Ukraine has underscored the urgency of including animals in disaster response frameworks. "This has been the biggest war conflict in Europe since the Second World War," said Lithuanian MEP Petras Austrevicius of Renew Europe and Vice President of the Intergroup of the Welfare and Conservation of Animals."It has not only shattered cities and displaced civilians but also left deep scars on the lives of ordinary people and the animals who shared their homes."Millions of animals have been abandoned, and bombed-out shelters, farms, and zoos paint a grim picture of war's impact beyond human casualties. "Many of those fleeing from Russian attacks refused to leave their pets behind," Austrevicius added, "Animals don't abandon people - sometimes, people abandon animals."Humane World Europe and its partners have worked to mitigate this crisis.
  Instance 2: "But the next step is ensuring that policymakers see disaster planning for animals not as a luxury, but as a necessity."He pointed to the broader impact on human welfare: "We know that leaving animals out of emergency plans leads to mental health issues, delayed evacuations, and additional trauma for those affected. The EU has the tools to change this - it just needs the political will."[Edited By Brian Maguire | Euractiv's Advocacy Lab ]EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionhealthconsumersnewsdisasterpreparednessforanimalstimeforeutoactsaysnonprofitgroupEURCOM2025urn:contentItem:6F6D-WM53-RTY0-2022-00000-003981612025-02-24Copyright 2025 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

"This has been the biggest war conflict in Europe since the Second World War," said Lithuanian MEP Petras Austrevicius of Renew Europe and Vice President of the Intergroup of the Welfare and Conservation of Animals."It has not only shattered cities and displaced civilians but also left deep scars on the lives of ordinary people and the animals who shared their homes."Millions of animals have been abandoned, and bombed-out shelters, farms, and zoos paint a grim picture of war's impact beyond human casualties. "Many of those fleeing from Russian attacks refused to leave their pets behind," Austrevicius added, "Animals don't abandon people - sometimes, people abandon animals."Humane World Europe and its partners have worked to mitigate this crisis.
  Instance 2: "But the next step is ensuring that policymakers see disaster planning for animals not as a luxury, but as a necessity."He pointed to the broader impact on human welfare: "We know that leaving animals out of emergency plans leads to mental health issues, delayed evacuations, and additional trauma for those affected. The EU has the tools to change this - it just needs the political will."[Edited By Brian Maguire | Euractiv's Advocacy Lab ]EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionhealthconsumersnewsdisasterpreparednessforanimalstimeforeutoactsayshumanitariangroupEURCOM2025urn:contentItem:6F5R-C713-S5NX-3420-00000-003981612025-02-21Copyright 2025 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

New Orleans' Striking Advantage in the Age of Climate Change [3]
  Instance 1: It means settling for the best of bad options. But it does not mean blindly submitting to fate. The shrewdest product of this line of thinking is the Coastal Master Plan, Louisiana's grand unified theory of coastal restoration, land creation and retreat, developed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The most impressive aspect of the master plan is not its advertised $50 billion cost (likely a gross underestimate), nor its relentlessly forward-looking framework: It renews every five years, rendering it a 50-year plan in perpetuity. Nor is it the plan's Genesis-like ambition to make dry land appear out of the gathering waters, harnessing the force of the Mississippi River to build tens of thousands of acres of land to buffer against future storms.
  Instance 2: The grace period bought by the plan is intended to be the difference between a deliberate, gradual retreat over generations and a sudden one marked by chaos and excessive suffering. The same stringent honesty underlies the $14.5 billion post-Katrina flood protection system. A marvel of modern engineering, if not as ambitious as the system Louisianans pushed for after Hurricane Katrina, it claims to reduce risk from 100-year storms. This may sound reassuring until you realize that risk reduction means something very different from risk prevention, and that, by the end of the century, New Orleans can expect to experience a 100-year flood as frequently as once every five years. Like the master plan, the fortress defending greater New Orleans is not a solution.

For Some Children, Hurricane Helene's Ruin 'Could Take Years to Get Over' [3]
  Instance 1: In California, wildfires forced more than 220 schools to temporarily close between September and the first three days of October alone, according to the state's Education Department. These disasters can upend students' lives in and out the classroom, researchers say. Perhaps the starkest example is that of Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in August 2005. An estimated 50,000 students did not return to their classrooms for the entire school year. Young children process death and destruction in different ways.
  Instance 2: "It's heartbreaking," he said. Douglas N. Harris, a Tulane University professor who has lived in western North Carolina and studied the impact of Hurricane Katrina on students, said it all "has to be pretty disheartening" for educators. "They had to go through Covid. Then they had to try to catch students up," he said.
  Instance 3: "These kids have been through so much already," Ms. Ozuna said, while watching Amaya play on a school front lawn. "She is very resilient."

Canada and Mexico hit back as Trump tariffs trigger trade war between allies [2]
  Instance 1: They also risked throwing the global economy and Trump's political mandate into turmoil just two weeks into his second term.Trump declared an economic emergency in order to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada. Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a 10% rate. Trump's order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates charged by the US against retaliation by the other countries, raising the specter of an even more severe economic disruption."The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together," Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a somber tone as he announced Saturday that his country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155 billion in US imports, including alcohol and fruit.He channeled the betrayal that many Canadians are feeling, reminding Americans that Canadian troops fought alongside them in Afghanistan and helped respond to myriad crises from wildfires in California to Hurricane Katrina."We were always there standing with you, grieving with you, the American people," he said.Mexico's president also ordered retaliatory tariffs. China did not immediately respond to Trump's action."We categorically reject the White House's slander that the Mexican government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any intention of meddling in our territory," Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum wrote in a post on X while saying she had instructed her economy secretary to implement a response that includes retaliatory tariffs and other measures in defense of Mexico's interests."If the United States government and its agencies wanted to address the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities, which they don't do and the laundering of money that this illegal activity generates that has done so much harm to its population."The premier of the Canadian province of British Columbia, David Eby, specifically called on residents to stop buying liquor from US "red" states and said it was removing American alcohol brands from government store shelves as a response to the tariffs.The tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, setting up a showdown in North America that could potentially sabotage economic growth. A new analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale laid out the possible damage to the US economy, saying the average household would lose the equivalent of $1,170 in income from the taxes.
  Instance 2: We don't want to be here. We didn't ask for this, but we will not back down in standing up both for Canadians and for the incredible successful relationship between Canada and the United States," Trudeau said.(FRANCE 24 with AP)FR24EN-473336929FR24EN2025urn:contentItem:6F1W-58R3-RXRV-T2VF-00000-004077712025-02-02Copyright 2025  FRANCE 24 Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

From Fires to Mudslides, Catastrophe Has Defined Newsom's Tenure [1]
  Instance 1: Cuomo won national praise, at least initially, as the governor of New York for his daily briefings on the Covid pandemic. By contrast, George W. Bush faced derision for his tentative response after Hurricane Katrina flooded large swaths of New Orleans in 2005. And Mr. Newsom himself was ridiculed in the midst of the Covid pandemic, after he advised residents to stay home and wear masks but was photographed mask-less attending a crowded birthday dinner for a political adviser at the French Laundry, one of the country's most expensive restaurants.
Hurricane Milton Is Terrifying, and It Is Just the Start [2]
  Instance 1: The compounding forces of climate change are worsening the effects, too. Storms now carry vastly more precipitation - and can dump more than 40 inches of rain in just a few days, as Hurricane Harvey did in Houston in 2017. Storm surge rides on an elevated sea level, flooding coastlines with walls of water up to 25 feet high, as Hurricane Katrina did in New Orleans in 2005. If Superstorm Sandy had occurred in 1912 instead of 2012, it probably would not have flooded Lower Manhattan because the sea level was so much lower then, among other reasons, according to Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at M.I.T. By the end of this century, the number of major hurricanes is expected to increase by 20 percent.

Randy Newman Is Great. He Deserved a Better Biography Than This. [1]
  Instance 1: The Pixar work brought him new fans but baffled old ones. It was like learning that Ambrose Bierce or Lenny Bruce had written a picture book about a bunny. For Newman - to co-opt a line from his mighty song "Louisiana 1927," which has been a beloved standard in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005 - the money rolled all day, the money rolled all night. Newman, 80, is a serious, complicated man who deserves a serious, complicated biography. Robert Hilburn's new book, "A Few Words in Defense of Our Country: The Biography of Randy Newman," is not that book.
Pam Bondi's Journey From Traditional Republican to Warrior for Trump [1]
  Instance 1: Bondi later said doing so had been a mistake. During her 2010 campaign, the news media extensively covered a 16-month custody fight over a St. Bernard dog that she had adopted from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Ms. Bondi tried to keep the dog after its original owners, Dorreen and Steven Couture, surfaced and said they wanted him back.
Behind the Election Anger May Be Something Else: Lingering Covid Grief [1]
  Instance 1: They also said they were disheartened by a resistance to safety measures in the name of personal freedom. "I lost a lot of faith in humanity for a while, but I just had to learn that I can only control myself and I can try to educate people, but I want my mental health and my peace," they said. Shannon Lee Dawdy, a professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago, studies what happens to people after traumatic events, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Reactions varied wildly at the time, even within families, she said. Some wanted to throw everything away, move and start over, while others wanted to salvage or replicate every lost household item and return life to how it was before.
Another Hurdle in Recovery From Helene: Misinformation Is Getting in the Way [1]
  Instance 1: "Misinformation is a grave threat in the aftermath of a storm like Helene," Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina said in a statement, warning that it could be "deadly."       The falsehoods have prompted pushback from lawmakers and officials from across the country. Mayor Glenn Jacobs of Knox County, Tenn., said to his followers, "if everyone could maybe please put aside the hate for a bit and pitch in to help, that would be great." And Kevin Corbin, a Republican state representative in North Carolina, pleaded on Facebook, "PLEASE help stop this junk."        Much of the misinformation has been aimed at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was heavily criticized during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 for its leaders' failures in emergency response. Since then, the agency has brought on more experienced emergency managers, including its current administrator, Deanne Criswell, who used to lead New York City's emergency management department. But its efforts to address racial disparities in aid programs and overhaul its disaster assistance programs have made FEMA a larger target for disinformation.
'Twisters' Is a Great Escape Until It Happens to Your Town [1]
  Instance 1: We may cheer the big-screen storm wrangler as he leads his heroic crew in his geared-up pickup truck to shoot fireworks into the tornado's funnel. But we never see him or his crew cleaning up the wreckage in the ensuing weeks, filling out insurance forms or praying for the return of air-conditioning in sweltering heat. From Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans to Superstorm Sandy in New York, we've seen time and again how the full scope of a climate disaster isn't contained in the moment the levees break or the oceans surge. Even as we thrill to escapist fare like "Twisters," insurance companies are pulling back on policies in flood- and fire-prone areas, which is like an ominous movie trailer for the disasters yet to come. There is one element of "Twisters" that rings true emotionally in my experience as a storm-battered Houstonian.
An Artist Faces Climate Disaster With Hard Data and Ancient Wisdom [1]
  Instance 1: Facing climate change, planners often default to "solutionism, or engineering ourselves out of catastrophe," Ruiz said, adding, "we're hoping to open up different ways to engage."       To face down disaster is something of a New Orleans specialty. The city was once the largest slave market in North America, and its culture has been shaped by the long effects of colonization and enslavement. Oil extraction has transformed the region's land and waterways; petrochemical plants along the Mississippi River form what is known as "cancer alley." Hurricane Katrina, the Deepwater Horizon explosion in 2010 and the ravages of the pandemic continue the litany of challenges. Brown was a teenager when Katrina's floodwaters overwhelmed the family's house in the Mid-City area. She finished high school on the East Coast then attended Columbia University, studying anthropology with an art minor.
United States: Archdiocese of New Orleans to shut, merge parishes [2]
  Instance 1: There are four instances where two parishes are merging into one, and one instance where three parishes are merging into one. In all, the changes will affect 16 parishes, 11 of which will merge with others to form five new ones. This is the archdiocese’s largest restructuring plan since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. At that time, the archdiocese merged 40 parishes and closed 27 of its churches.The Archdiocese of New Orleans, which filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in 2020 because of the clergy abuse scandal, faces 500 sex abuse claims that could cost the archdiocese more than US$100 million. The archdiocese is already in the process of selling off some of the real estate it owns or controls, assets that have been estimated in insurance documents at more than $2.2 billion.
  Instance 2: “The impact of the Chapter 11 reorganization on Parish Pastoral Planning is limited to the fact that the administrative offices of the archdiocese, because of its own financial situation and its need to maintain a balanced budget, can no longer supplement parishes and ministries that are struggling financially,” the statement said. "For decades the Archdiocese has simply paid bills that could not be paid or forgiven debts that could not be met at the parish or ministry level. The administration as well as all parishes and ministries of the Archdiocese of New Orleans must strive for vitality - being fully alive in Christ - including financial responsibility," it added.Link to ImageLCRXIN-18626LCRXIN2023urn:contentItem:69J3-9XW1-F105-V17T-00000-004386472024-02-11Copyright 2023 Bayard-Presse All Rights ReservedLa Croix Internationalhttps://international.la-croix.com/news/religion/united-states-archdiocese-of-new-orleans-to-shut-merge-parishes/18626November 2, 2023 ThursdayNewspaperWeb-based PublicationsENGLISHBankruptcy LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDJGRTFGMTM4NkMwNDhEMEE5NUU0QUZCN0QyMjlEREY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUFEMzQyRUFEQzlENDA4MUE3RUUyOEI4NjhFRTFGRjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EzRUQ4NDQ0QjhDNDc2QzgwQkY3OUQyQzkzNDZGNEISTX001464RELIGIONSTX000309CLERGY &amp; RELIGIOUS VOCATIONSST000A0RHCATHOLICS &amp; CATHOLICISMST00099LPCHRISTIANS &amp; CHRISTIANITYST000DRDXNEGATIVE MISC NEWSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX000228BUSINESS INSOLVENCY &amp; BANKRUPTCYSTX000166INSOLVENCY &amp; BANKRUPTCYST000CTIZSCANDALSST000A5OFUS CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCYST000DNVTABUSE &amp; NEGLECTSTX000405CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST000DL5ARELIGIOUS FACILITIESST0009QD4NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWSSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSSTX001826WEATHERST000DQGECOVID CORONAVIRUSST000DOTHCOVID-19 CORONAVIRUSSTX000912INFECTIOUS DISEASESTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX001763TROPICAL STORMSSTX002064EPIDEMICSSTX001455REAL ESTATEST000A2W7STX001888PROPERTY &amp; CASUALTY INSURANCEST00098QKREAL ESTATE INSURANCEST0009ESXINSURANCE PREMIUMSGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGC343UNITED STATES
Europe's 'armed wing' of the energy transition pivots to Asia [1]
  Instance 1: They'd keep their eyes "on the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz." On minerals, he announced a new initiative.A "Critical Minerals Security Program" to address that "currently we are not able to keep up with the demand" for minerals like copper, cobalt and lithium, Birol explained. And "the ability of manufacturing these critical minerals is concentrated in one single country or two," he stressed.To stabilise oil prices and ensure sufficient supply, the IEA can coordinate a release of oil stocks of member countries to calm the market. The group had to take such drastic measures five times in its history: ahead of the Gulf War, Hurricane Katrina, the Libyan Civil War, and twice following Russia's attack on Ukraine.A mechanism for critical minerals could be expected to work similarly. It would "provide a safety net," according to the IEA chief.On the climate, he stressed that "achieving net zero while ensuring affordability and security is a clear mission for the International Energy Agency" and that the IEA would "do everything we can to help the world to achieve net zero by mid-century." A 'special friendship'"This is the celebration of an extraordinary friendship," said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who'd flown in for the occasion. "Since I took office as president of the European Commission, you have been the most trusted of partners," von der Leyen said about Fatih Birol, the IEA's president.
Habitat for Humanity Helped Them Get Homes. An Insurance Crisis May Take Them Away. [1]
  Instance 1: The financial review is thorough, and instead of a down payment, a home requires 250 hours of "sweat equity," or volunteering for the organization. Yet as Habitat saw it, families who met such standards showed that they were ready to take on the responsibility. At one point, Habitat's leaders said it was one of the busiest homebuilders in the city, having constructed hundreds of homes in the New Orleans area since Hurricane Katrina ravaged much of the affordable housing stock in 2005. Now, what seemed a dream outcome for many of the homeowners has been upended, becoming yet another casualty of Louisiana's property insurance crisis. Habitat has already started foreclosure proceedings against 15 homeowners over the past year.
Why It's Hard to Explain Joe Biden's Unpopularity [2]
  Instance 1: Trump's unpopularity was understood to reflect his chaos and craziness and authoritarian forays. The story of George W. Bush's descending polls was all about Iraq and Hurricane Katrina. When Barack Obama was at his polling nadir, most observers blamed the unemployment rate and the Obamacare backlash, and when Bill Clinton struggled through his first two years, there was a clear media narrative about his lack of discipline and White House scandals. With Biden, it has been different.

The Tragedy at This Year's Hajj Is Just the Beginning [2]
  Instance 1: In Palm Springs, Calif., temperatures reached a record 124 degrees, Las Vegas broke its own previous record by three degrees and in Death Valley, Calif., temperatures reached 129, within one degree of the all-time, anywhere-in-the-world modern record. Across the West, temperatures routinely registered 15 to 30 degrees above average, and in California, at the beginning of a "historic" heat wave made five times more likely by climate change, scientists predicted a statewide death toll of about 100 each day. In his vivid book "The Heat Will Kill You First," Jeff Goodell describes one worst-case scenario as "the Hurricane Katrina of extreme heat," echoing the words of the researcher Mikhail Chester: a dayslong blackout in metropolitan Phoenix coinciding with a now-routine heat wave and half of the city requiring medical attention. This is, admittedly, an unlikely set of circumstances - the whole city going fully dark for a few days, then taking a few more to get power up and running again. But suspected heat deaths in Phoenix have nearly doubled since last year, when temperatures reached 110 or more for 31 straight days and the city's burn centers were filling up with people who had fainted or fallen and been scalded by asphalt.
  Instance 2: Further Reading"No one knows exactly how many people are dying from extreme heat": Bloomberg's Zahra Hirji and Preeti Soni on the epistemological challenge of heat death. "These results indicate that a significant portion of the world's population will experience - for the first time in human history - prolonged exposures to uncompensable extreme moist heat": a comprehensive survey of the risk of future temperatures on human health published last year in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."Can we air condition our way out of extreme heat?" asks Andrew Dessler at the Climate Brink. (And previous posts by Dessler about how heat kills and comparing deaths from extreme cold to those from extreme heat.)

More than 5,000 people were killed in Libya after torrential rains caused two dams to burst near the coastal city of Derna, destroying much of the city and carrying entire neighborhoods into the sea, local authorities said on Tuesday. Libya, a North African nation splintered by a war, was ill-prepared for the storm, called Daniel, which swept across the Mediterranean Sea to batter its coastline.
  Instance 2: al-Mismari said, calling the scenario "completely unexpected." Conditions were making it difficult to orchestrate rescue and aid operations, with all roads to the most affected areas either cut off or nearly cut off, he said. Citizens who escaped Derna left the city "as if they were born today, with nothing," he said. The flooding recalled the effects of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the storm struck Louisiana and became a calamity after levees in New Orleans ruptured, inundating vast parts of the city. It also underscored how climate change can combine with political conflicts and economic failure to magnify the scale of disasters. Libya is divided between the internationally recognized government based in Tripoli, the capital, and a separately administered region in the east, including Derna - where the main power broker is the Libyan National Army and its commander, Khalifa Hifter, a longtime militia leader.
  Instance 3: "The residents of Derna are searching for the bodies of their loved ones by digging with their hands and simple agricultural tools."

The Heat Wave Scenario That Keeps Climate Scientists Up at Night [2]
  Instance 1: Of the at least eight deaths reported as a result of the storm, none were from heat exposure. But if this storm had arrived several days later, perhaps over the Memorial Day weekend, when the temperature in Houston hit 96 degrees, with a heat index as high as 115, it might have been a very different story. "The Hurricane Katrina of extreme heat," is how Mikhail Chester, director of the Metis Center for Infrastructure and Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State University, once put it to me, echoing the memory of the catastrophic 2005 hurricane that struck Louisiana, devastated New Orleans and killed more than 1,300 people. Most people who died in Louisiana during Katrina died from drownings, injuries or heart conditions. But Dr.

The state depends heavily on oil and gas.Emmanuel Macron will also meet with cultural figures in the city, which is famed as the cradle of jazz music. Thursday's gala dinner at the White House featured a performance by virtuoso pianist Jon Batiste, who comes from a family of musicians from New Orleans.Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.

  Instance 1: It dawned on Ms. Medley that you could study a region by way of its food in 2005, when she landed at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where she began a master's program in Southern studies. Hurricane Katrina hit the day after she started. She spent the next several months traveling the state to cover the devastation for The New York Times, her journeys fueled by rural gas stations. They often run on a Southern "get 'er done" attitude.

He spoke briefly with women holding signs in support of protests in Iran.During an impromptu press briefing, he praised "a land of creolization" where "French is loved," and later announced a program to broaden access to French language training.US and French Presidents pledge 'unwavering' alliance, but trade dispute loomsHe had said in Washington that he wanted to renovate the image of French in the United States, where it is "sometimes seen as elitist."Before taking off from Washington earlier Friday, Macron attended a breakfast with representatives of digital companies during which he, according to the Elysee, recalled "all the efforts" made since his first term to "make France the leading European country in tech."Once a French colonial city, New Orleans was sold to the United States by Napoleon as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, and Macron has called it "the quintessential francophone land."Energy and climateBesides celebrating French-American ties, Macron paid tribute to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people in and around New Orleans and caused billions of dollars in damage in 2005.Accompanied by French film director Claude Lelouch and dancer and choreographer Benjamin Millepied, Macron met local artists and prominent cultural figures of New Orleans, known as the birthplace of jazz.Shortly after his arrival, Macron and European Affairs Minister Catherine Colonna met with Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards. As Macron looked on, Colonna and Edwards signed an accord to promote and carry out joint clean energy initiatives.EU puts massive China investment deal on holdThe visit came on the heels of a lavish dinner hosted by President Joe Biden at the White House, headlined by master jazzman Jon Batiste, who comes from a family of New Orleans musicians.Macron's state visit – the first such formal occasion since Biden took office in January 2021 – symbolized how Washington and Paris have buried last year's bitter spat over the way Australia pulled out of a French submarine deal in favor of acquiring US nuclear subs instead.The visit featured a full military honor guard for Macron, including service members from the marines, army, air force and even a detachment of soldiers in 18th-century Revolutionary War garb.(AFP)Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.

Extreme weather events increase violence against women and LGBTQIA+ people, study finds [2]
  Instance 1: But, according to a new study, these events are also a source of increased violence against girls, women and people from the LGBTQIA+ community.How can hurricanes or forest fires contribute to an increase in sexist and homophobic violence? According to researchers from the University of Cambridge, who conducted a study published in the journal The Lancet Planetary Health, the driving factors are linked to economic shock, social instability and other factors that contribute to stress in populations."Extreme events don't themselves cause gender-based violence, but rather they exacerbate the drivers of violence or create environments that enable this type of behavior," said Kim van Daalen, of the University of Cambridge's Department of Public Health and Primary Care. Extreme events can both increase new violence and increase reporting, unmasking existing violence, the study says.The research is a meta-analysis that reviewed around 40 studies on several types of extreme events, such as storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves and wildfires, as well as gender-based violence, such as sexual harassment, physical violence and forced marriage.One of the concrete examples cited is Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which led to an increase in violence against women, particularly domestic violence. This climatic disaster also had homophobic repercussions. Blamed for the hurricane (which some called "God's punishment"), the gay community in New Orleans was discriminated against by being prevented from accessing aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
  Instance 2: It's crucial that it's informed by the women, girls, and sexual and gender minority populations affected and takes into account local sexual and gender cultures and local norms, traditions and social attitudes," says Kim van Daalen. Examples of on-the-ground interventions cited by the researchers include providing restricted-access shelters and relief services to women and sexual and gender minorities, educating young girls about their rights, and implementing emergency response teams specifically trained in the prevention of gender-based violence.

All six were placed in pre-trial detention.The door with the artwork was cut out and taken in January last year at the Bataclan, where Islamic State gunmen massacred 90 people in 2015.French and Italian police said on June 10 this year that they found the work in an abandoned farmhouse in Italy's central east Abruzzo region.One of the French policeman who intervened in the 2015 Bataclan attack was present when the door was found, and was overcome with emotion, according to the French crime unit.Works by Banksy, known for their distinctive style, irreverent humour and thought-provoking themes, have been found on walls, buildings and bridges from the West Bank to post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans.At auction, they have sold for more than $1 million.RENWSE-RENWSE2020urn:contentItem:6078-GCY1-JDVB-60MR-00000-003505052021-03-31Copyright 2020 ETX Studio All Rights ReservedETX Daily Up (English International Version)ENTERTAINMENTJune 27, 2020 SaturdayNewspaperNewswires &amp; Press ReleasesENGLISHSTX000112ARRESTSST0009FJKNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSST000CFSUART THEFTSTX001932CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONSSTX001717LARCENY &amp; THEFTST000DKERNOVEMBER 2015 PARIS ATTACKSST000CZUTSTREET ARTSTX001970TRENDS &amp; EVENTSN922120CCLAW ENFORCEMENTST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST000DL49MASS SHOOTINGSST000DRRCPRETRIAL DETENTIONST0009F7UHURRICANESST000DN4KPRELIMINARY COURT PROCEEDINGSST0009PWMPROPERTY VACANCIESSTX001464RELIGIONST0008X5LPERFORMING ARTS CENTERSST0009PWMPROPERTY VACANCIESPE000DN69BANKSYGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGX115PARIS, FRANCEGC317FRANCEGC321ITALY
New Orleans Mayor Moves Past Failed Recall Effort, but Unease Persists [3]
  Instance 1: But after easily winning re-election in 2021, Ms. Cantrell was besieged by new crises, most notably Hurricane Ida - after which trash pickup collapsed and has yet to fully recover - and a crime rate that continued rising through 2022. The number of murders last year, while falling far short of the peak in the early 1990s, was the highest since Hurricane Katrina. Fears over carjackings, in particular, grew as thieves roved the city. Exasperation mounted with crater-pocked roads and error-ridden, runaway utility bills.
  Instance 2: Carter said. The mayor is still occasionally viewed as a political outsider, having grown up in Los Angeles and moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier University of Louisiana. She married into a prominent judicial family and led the Broadmoor Improvement Association, a nonprofit in her Uptown neighborhood, overseeing the neighborhood's redevelopment after Hurricane Katrina. She was elected to the City Council in 2012. Ms.
  Instance 3: Cantrell is a lack of confidence in the city's ability to flourish no matter who is in charge. "It's time for someone new," Ms. Flowers said, before adding with barely a pause, "but the next one isn't going to be able to do anything."

Mr. Burnett, who gave the men an extra $500 on their last day working for him, said, "If these people are willing to do this, making a little bit of money helping people they don't know, they should have the world."       The leader of the group, a man from Honduras named Rogelio who has worked on storm cleanup since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, said they had decided to risk travel to Florida, "trusting in God to protect us."

One Thing Not to Fear at Burning Man [2]
  Instance 1: Intrigued, I dived into the sociology of disasters and found that this was the common trajectory after similar misfortune. Rebecca Solnit's book "A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities That Arise in Disaster" documents many such experiences - people altruistically cooperating in the aftermath of earthquakes, hurricanes and other catastrophes - and how the authorities often assume the opposite and go in to restore law and order but end up doing real harm. One of the most egregious recent examples of this involved rumors of conditions after Hurricane Katrina in the Superdome in New Orleans - where tens of thousands of people unable to evacuate earlier had gathered. The police chief told Oprah Winfrey that babies were being raped. The mayor said, "They have people standing out there, have been in that frickin' Superdome for five days watching dead bodies, watching hooligans killing people, raping people." There were reports that rescue helicopters were being shot at.

How dark tourism takes vacationers to disaster zones [1]
  Instance 1: These include Fukushima in Japan, of course, but also the lesser-known Pripyat in Ukraine -- a ghost town next to Chernobyl -- or Semey (formerly Semipalatinsk) in Kazakhstan, a former site for Soviet nuclear testing. Note, however, that tourists venturing into these areas potentially put their health at risk, as, for their part at least, the effects of radioactivity are still bound by the borders between pleasure tourism and dark tourism. Other travelers have a passion for visiting prisons, such as Alcatraz off the coast of San Francisco or the Tuol Sleng prison in Cambodia, where the detainees of the Khmer Rouge police were imprisoned.From genocide to drug lordsWhile some have no qualms about visiting disaster zones like New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 -- just for fun -- others are tempted by tours of questionable taste. In Medellín, Colombia, for example, tourists can visit the city "in the footsteps of Pablo Escobar." In Rwanda, unscrupulous tourism companies offer tours taking in the great apes as well as the Tutsi genocide. Finally, some people are ready to pay good money for a chance to stumble across a corpse in the Aokigahara forest, better known in Japan as the "suicide forest."So while curiosity and remembrance are an integral part of tourism, travelers can decide for themselves just how dark they're prepared to go...RENWSE-RENWSE2021urn:contentItem:631S-NBN1-F19C-X3TW-00000-003505052021-06-30Copyright 2021 ETX Studio All Rights ReservedETX Daily Up (English International Version)TOURISMJune 30, 2021 WednesdayNewspaperIndustry Trade PressENGLISHSTX001922ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST0008YXRLEISURE TRAVELST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST0008ZBZHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSST0009RC2CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR DISASTERSTX001197NATURAL DISASTERSSTX001963SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001865WRITERSST000D9R3ETHNIC CONFLICTSST0009S69GENOCIDESTX001647SUICIDESTX000535CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIMEST0009QD4NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWSST0008WVIDESTINATIONS &amp; ATTRACTIONSST0008YXRLEISURE TRAVELSTX001916TRAVEL, HOSPITALITY &amp; TOURISMST0009RE0ST0009RC2CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR DISASTERSTX001865WRITERSGX084MEDELLIN, COLOMBIAGX608NEW ORLEANS, LA, USAGX513SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USAGS127HAWAII, USAST000DAVUTOHOKU, JAPANGC306JAPANGC581UKRAINEGR114CARIBBEAN ISLANDSGC573KAZAKHSTANGC554RWANDAGC502CAMBODIA
Cockroaches and Mountains of Trash Plague Acapulco After Hurricane [1]
  Instance 1: Piles of garbage left outside can attract mosquitoes and rats, which can then spread infectious diseases. A lack of power can also lead to contaminated food, raising the risk of stomach infections and illnesses. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported skin lesions, diarrhea and pneumonia among evacuees. Health problems linked to uncollected trash are "more common than we anticipate," said Amber Mehmood, an associate professor of public health at the University of South Florida who focuses on global health and disaster management. Debris and waste, she said, can become a "breeding ground for mosquitoes that can carry malaria and Zika virus."       "There are plenty of reasons to be worried," Ms.
It's Been a 'Summer of Disasters,' and It's Only Half Over [2]
  Instance 1: "I can't give you the why, but I know what we do in response to it. And the answer is everything we can."       It used to be, when the scariest climate impacts were more common in models than on television screens, that climate advocates sometimes found themselves wondering what scale of disaster might shake the world from its basic complacency. Then, when large disasters did strike - Hurricane Katrina, for instance, or Hurricane Sandy, or the Camp Fire - without much altering the shape of public concern, they sometimes wondered if it would take a string of disasters. The intervals between such events are now shorter than ever. The world is finally moving to decarbonize, but haltingly, and too slowly to offer real protection from warming.
  Instance 2: We have only in the last decade passed beyond the range of temperatures that encloses all of human history and begun a new kind of experiment, testing our global capacity not just to lessen the impacts of perennial disasters but of disruptions of a much larger scale. Even as policymakers have made great progress with some interventions and early warning systems, mistakes and miscalculations are not at all unusual. The $14 billion levees built in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, for instance, were not even designed to withstand a Category 5 storm, and may not offer "adequate" protection as soon as next year. Last October, the journal Nature published an article assessing global adaptation efforts. Its top-line finding?
Verisk's AIR Worldwide Estimates Insured Losses for Hurricane Ida Will Range from USD 17 Billion to USD 25 Billion [3]
  Instance 1: The storm's first landfall was near Port Fourchon about 60 miles south of New Orleans, with a maximum sustained wind speed of 150 mph; its second landfall was southwest of Galliano, with a maximum sustained wind speed of 145 mph. Around the time of landfall, the storm was undergoing an eyewall replacement. In practical terms, New Orleans experienced strong winds on the order of 90 to 100 mph due to the large windfield and a slow decay of the storm.The storm surge Ida produced was along expected lines and generally not as severe as Hurricane Katrina's-particularly in Mississippi and New Orleans (the latter of which was fully protected by the city's levee system)-but some areas of southeastern Louisiana with insufficient protection experienced severe storm surge during Ida. According to analysis by Wood Mackenzie, a sister company in the Verisk family, Hurricane Ida has had a significant impact on Louisiana refinery operations and Gulf of Mexico production, causing a historic U.S. crude supply chain disruption.
  Instance 2: An additional source of uncertainty related to materials cost demand surge is the cost of diesel fuel, which has been impacted by the shutdown of refineries during Ida; this fuel would be used to transport materials. While some of these facilities were undamaged, the uncertainty around the timing of the restoration of the power grid and lack of electricity in the meantime is going to keep some of them from coming back online and contributing to the diesel fuel supply. One other important aspect of demand surge to note is that after Hurricane Katrina, about half of the population of New Orleans moved away and the city never returned to pre Katrina population levels. This mass migration probably mitigated economic demand surge, which was not as great as it might have been after that storm.

In a Debut Novel, a Family Legacy of Resistance [2]
  Instance 1: The Han army later returned and defeated the sisters, who, according to Vietnamese chronicles, jumped into the Hat Giang River, choosing suicide over surrender. That drowning reverberates as an ancestral force, echoing into the modern day. Trac sees a vision of her mother being submerged in the Mississippi River during Hurricane Katrina. Nhi, in Vietnam for TV filming, follows a little girl who twice leads her to the Saigon River, where the girl disappears. And Trieu dives into a pool to save a kitten that fell in, "buffeted up" to the surface with "the force of a thousand hands lifting her through the water."       These events recall the defiant deaths of the past Trung sisters, but they also allude to the founding of the Vietnamese zodiac, which, as the myth goes, was determined by a race between animals competing to be immortalized.

Erika Dickerson-Despenza Wins Blackburn Prize for 'cullud wattah' [2]
  Instance 1: "It's a really affirming moment," she said, "not only for me as an emerging playwright, but also for the way that I am doing my work as a queer Black woman who has intentionally decided to write about Black women and girls."       Her career, like so many others, has been upended by the pandemic. "cullud wattah" is on hold, but a spokeswoman for the Public said the theater still hopes to produce it once it resumes presenting in-person productions. In the meantime, she has been working on a 10-play cycle about the effects of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005. The second play in the cycle, "[hieroglyph]," was staged (without a live audience), filmed and streamed earlier this year by San Francisco Playhouse and Lorraine Hansberry Theater. And next week the Public Theater will introduce an audio production of "shadow/land," the first installment of her Katrina cycle.
  Instance 2: The play imagines the effect of the water crisis on three generations of women. "I had a wall full of Flint, and I didn't know what to do with it," she said. "The play is not so much about Flint, as it is about how an apocalypse makes everything else bubble to the surface."

As Climate Shocks Multiply, Designers Seek Holy Grail: Disaster-Proof Homes [1]
  Instance 1: Veazey, a retired oil worker, said. Dr. Max Bégué lost his house near New Orleans to Hurricane Katrina. In 2008, he built and moved into a dome on the same property, which has survived every storm since, including Hurricane Ida. Two features give domes their ability to withstand wind.
Review: 'Black Odyssey' Sails Through Black Past and Present [1]
  Instance 1: But Ulysses jittering around with desire as he's seduced by Circe, Nella going angry-Black-mother on Malachai, and Malachai giving woke Gen Z-style speeches to his elders are all, in their comedy, more compelling than in their moments of sorrow and joy. In general, when the play leans to parody, offering sirens styled as Dream Girls and the blind prophet Tiresias as a funky, supa-dupa-fly afro-wearing bus driver (Alfred, clowning around wholesomely), it becomes a whole different production - entertaining, though from left field. Because otherwise, the work's copious name-dropping, and its conflation of characters and events from Black history, transforms it into a game of Black bingo: Check references to the Scottsboro Boys, the Birmingham church bombing, the Middle Passage, Hurricane Katrina and the spirituals (though beautifully performed, particularly by Woods and Gladney) for the winning card. And "black odyssey" has a lot of fun with naming, in the same spirit as its source text (in the Odyssey, Odysseus says he is "Nobody" or "No one") - but between Malachai Malcolm Little Lincoln and Circe Tubman Sojourner Rosa Ida B. Nzinga, among others, even that touch of humor becomes little more than an overdone declaration of the play's Blackness.
Beauty, Serenity, Stillness: An Ode to the Final Miles of the Mississippi River [3]
  Instance 1: In its heyday, Pilottown was a thriving community of guides, trappers and fishermen. By the time I first made it there, only three permanent residents remained. In August of that year, Hurricane Katrina sent a 15-foot storm surge into Pilottown, destroying nearly every structure in the settlement. The Associated Branch Pilots, an association whose pilots guide ships from the Gulf to Pilottown, chose to rebuild upriver in Venice. The Crescent Port Pilots, whose pilots guide ships from Pilottown to New Orleans, stayed in Pilottown, with no permanent residents returning.
  Instance 2: Ghost towns such as Olga, Oysterville and Burwood all have their own vanishing stories. Collectively they make up the fading history of Plaquemines Parish. I was living full-time with my family in a camp in the Lake Catherine area of Orleans Parish when Hurricane Katrina hit. I remember thinking we'd be gone maybe three days, and would come home to the camp after New Orleans survived another near miss from a major storm. Instead, Katrina took the camp and everything in it, including all my darkroom gear and a small box of negatives from early in this project.

Climate Shocks Are Making Parts of America Uninsurable. It Just Got Worse. [1]
  Instance 1: 'Just not enough wealth'Florida, despite its challenges, has an important advantage: A steady influx of residents who remain, for now, willing and able to pay the rising cost of living there. In Louisiana, the rising cost of insurance has become, for some communities, a threat to their existence. Like Florida after Andrew, Louisiana's insurance market started to buckle after insurers began leaving following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Then, starting with Hurricane Laura in 2020, a series of storms pummeled the state. Nine insurance companies failed; people began rushing into the state's own version of Florida's Citizens plan.
Where Have All the Grown-ups Gone? [1]
  Instance 1: It didn't start with Trump. We've been heading this way for a long time. Back in 2006, in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq on false pretenses and the botched response to Hurricane Katrina, I wrote about the "mensch gap" - the unwillingness of the people then running the country to accept responsibility for their own failures, their eagerness to blame others when things went wrong. Later, during the Obama era, it was striking how many critics on the right refused to acknowledge error when their predictions of runaway inflation or the abject failure of Obamacare failed to come true. But now the transformation of American conservatism - the same movement that complains about liberal "snowflakes" - into a collection of malignant whiners seems to have reached apotheosis.
What are resilient cities? [2]
  Instance 1: A variety of dramatic events have seen populations worldwide follow similar patterns: healing their wounds before getting up and carrying on with life. With 20,000 buildings flooded and some 150,000 people affected, the 1910 Great Flood of Paris was a major natural disaster. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina was one of the world's deadliest hurricanes, as well as proving the costliest natural disaster in history for the USA. Since then, Typhoon Haiyan has wreaked havoc in the Philippines, and Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Irma and more have caused destruction elsewhere. Then there's the 2005 London bombings, the 2015 Paris terror attacks, and the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic in late 2019 in China.
  Instance 2: And this plan of action seems to be here to stay. Across the Atlantic, the city of Edinburgh is focusing on a digital strategy to help solve social and environmental problems.

Peruvian farmer demands 'climate justice' from German energy giant [3]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6FC3-WCB3-RRPT-355M-00000-00Peruvian farmer demands 'climate justice' from German energy giant2025-03-17T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:24ZLexisNexisPeruvian farmer demands 'climate justice' from German energy giantA Peruvian farmer taking a German energy giant to court said Monday he is battling for "climate justice" and wants the company to pay for the consequences of rising temperatures.Saul Luciano Lliuya, 44, argues that electricity producer RWE -- one of the world's top emitters of carbon dioxide -- must share the cost of protecting his hometown, Huaraz, from a swollen glacier lake that is at risk of overflowing from melting snow and ice.He wants the German company to pay 17,000 euros ($18,400) towards flood defences for his community, arguing that the fossil fuels the firm has used to generate electricity make it partly responsible for the flood risk."The reality is the glaciers are melting and sadly the mountains are suffering, and that has consequences," he told reporters outside a regional court in the west German city of Hamm."It's a risk for me. It's a risk for the more than 50,000 people who live in the danger zone."Lliuya first filed a lawsuit in 2015 but a court in the western German city of Essen, where RWE is headquartered, dismissed it the following year.In 2017, however, the Hamm court allowed an appeal.After a delay due to the Covid pandemic, hearings are scheduled on Monday and Wednesday.Roda Verheyen, Lliuya's lawyer in the case, expects proceedings to conclude at the end of next year.'Experts recognise risk'Monday's hearing asked if Lliuya's property in Peru's Ancash region is at substantial risk of flooding, examining evidence collected by court-appointed experts who travelled to the area in 2022.If judges confirm the risk, subsequent hearings would look at the question of RWE's responsibility.Noah Walker-Crawford, a researcher advising Lliuya's legal team, said he was satisfied with the first day of proceedings."What's important to say is that the experts recognise that there is a risk," he said. "There is a possibility of a flood wave from the melting glaciers hitting the plaintiff's house."A ruling on the issue of flood risk could come as soon as Wednesday, but more likely in the coming weeks.Lliuya bases his legal claim on a 2014 study that concluded RWE was responsible for 0.47 percent of all global carbon emissions since the start of the industrial era.RWE, which has never operated in Peru, should pay that share of the 3.5 million euros it would cost to lower the waters of Lake Palcacocha, he says.'Fair contribution'Founded in 1898, RWE now uses a variety of power sources, including gas and coal as well as solar and wind.Christoph Bals, head of policy at Germanwatch, an environmental campaign group supporting Lliuya in the case, said they came across his plight after being put in touch by a consultant advising Lliuya on how to manage the rising waters."They (the farmers in Huaraz) got talking and they said: 'It's not right.

With only 280 spots available this year, thousands are expected to miss out.More than 80 percent of Pacific nation Tuvalu's population is seeking a landmark climate visa to live in Australia as rising seas lap at its shores, official figures showed Wednesday.Australia is offering visas to Tuvalu citizens each year under a climate migration deal Canberra has billed as "the first agreement of its kind anywhere in the world".Read moreNearly a third of Tuvalu citizens seek Australian climate visas to escape rising seas"We received extremely high levels of interest in the ballot with 8,750 registrations, which includes family members of primary registrants," the Australian high commission in Tuvalu said in a statement.The figure is equal to 82 percent of the country's 10,643 population, according to census figures collected in 2022."With 280 visas offered this program year, it means that many will miss out," the commission said.One of the most climate-threatened corners of the planet, scientists fear Tuvalu will be uninhabitable within the next 80 years.Two of the archipelago's nine coral atolls have already largely disappeared under the waves.The figures were released hours before a landmark decision by the world's top court in The Hague laying out what legal obligations countries have to prevent climate change and whether polluters should pay up for the consequences.The case, which has been brought by Pacific nations, could reshape climate justice, with major impacts on laws around the world.'First agreement of its kind' Australia and Tuvalu signed the groundbreaking Falepili Union in 2024, part of Canberra's efforts to blunt China's expanding reach in the region.Under that pact, Australia opened a new visa category specially set aside for citizens of Tuvalu who will be selected at random."Australia recognises the devastating impact climate change is having on the livelihoods, security, and wellbeing of climate vulnerable countries and people, particularly in the Pacific region," Australia's foreign affairs department told AFP last month."This is the first agreement of its kind anywhere in the world, providing a pathway for mobility with dignity as climate impacts worsen."It will also provide Tuvaluans the choice to live, study and work in Australia.Tuvalu citizens, including those living outside the country, were eligible to be included in the ballot if they are aged over 18 and pay a Aus$25 fee (US$16).The visa deal has been hailed as a landmark response to the looming challenge of climate-forced migration.The Falepili pact commits Australia to defending Tuvalu in the face of natural disasters, health pandemics and "military aggression"."For the first time, there is a country that has committed legally to come to the aid of Tuvalu, upon request, when Tuvalu encounters a major natural disaster, a health pandemic or military aggression," Tuvalu Prime Minister Feleti Teo said at the time."Again, for the first time there is a country that has committed legally to recognise the future statehood and sovereignty of Tuvalu despite the detrimental impact of climate changed-induced sea level rise."The agreement also gives Australia a say in any other defence pacts Tuvalu signs with other countries, raising concerns at the time that the Pacific nation was handing over its sovereignty.Tuvalu is one of just 12 states that still have formal diplomatic relations with Taipei rather than Beijing.(FRANCE 24 with AFP)FR24EN-500145189FR24EN2025urn:contentItem:6GB6-12W3-RRPT-F0SV-00000-004077712025-07-23Copyright 2025  FRANCE 24 Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Because it’s these industrialised countries in their race to develop who have caused these greenhouse gasses,” she said.Faye highlighted that fact that global warming has had a very negative impact, particularly on women in the rural world.This year has seen record-breaking floods in Senegal affecting tens of thousands of people and damaging more than 1,000 hectares of crops in the north and east of the country.The activists say the countries responsible for greenhouse gas emissions owe Africa for the suffering caused by the effects of climate changeKhady Faye is an activist who travelled to Dakar from her home near Senegal’s Saloum Delta, a region which has suffered devastating coastal erosion.Production at the Sangomar oil fields, Senegal’s first offshore drilling site near the Saloum Delta, started this year.Australian group Woodside Energy has an 82 per cent stake in the project.“Think about the suffering of these communities. Try to leave our delta alone, try to leave the gas at Sangomar underground, to let the community live normally.

Because that is what’s at the root of all the catastrophes that Africa is suffering from,” she said.AFRICN-httpswwwafricanewscom20241103senegalesewomencallforclimatejusticeaheadofcop29summitutmsourcelexisnexisutmcaignfeedsnewsutmmediumreferralAFRICN2024urn:contentItem:6DBB-2H81-F03F-K0WM-00000-004786712024-11-039:07 AM ESTCopyright 2024 Euronews SA  All Rights ReservedAfricanews (English)November 3, 2024 SundayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsENGLISHAzerbaijan &amp; SenegalAsia, Western AsiaAfrica, Western AfricaST000DTNMACTIVISMST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONST000DSTYENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISMST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST000D8B1GREENHOUSE GASESSTX000594EMISSIONSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGESTX000365CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONSST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSST000DRM1OFFSHORE ENERGYSTX000735FLOODS &amp; FLOODINGSTX000796GLOBAL WARMINGSTX001348POLLUTIONSTX000647EROSIONSTX001511RURAL COMMUNITIESST000DSFNAGRICULTURAL LANDSST000DBMJOFFSHORE OIL &amp; GAS EXPLORATION &amp; EXTRACTIONSTX000317COASTAL AREASSTX000594EMISSIONSST000DRM1OFFSHORE ENERGYSTX001240OIL &amp; GAS INDUSTRYSTX000796GLOBAL WARMINGST000DSFNAGRICULTURAL LANDSST000DBMJOFFSHORE OIL &amp; GAS EXPLORATION &amp; EXTRACTIONGX286DAKAR, SENEGALGT111AFRICAGT113ASIAGC555SENEGALGC569AZERBAIJANGR112WESTERN AFRICAGR140WESTERN ASIA
Climate change - UN court rules countries must treat climate change as an 'existential threat' [1]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6GBB-10R3-RRYM-M136-00000-00Climate change - UN court rules countries must treat climate change as an 'existential threat'2025-07-23T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:24ZLexisNexisClimate change - UN court rules countries must treat climate change as an 'existential threat'RFIThe UN's top court on Wednesday ruled climate change an "existential problem of planetary proportions" and said countries had a legal duty to act or face consequences.The International Court of Justice's (ICJ) advisory opinion is not legally binding but was unanimous and is expected to have major legal ramifications for courts, companies and communities across the world.The United Nations had tasked the ICJ with outlining which obligations countries are under to curb planet-heating emissions – and to lay out possible consequences for failing to do so.The global climate should be protected for both the current population but also for future generations, the court ruled, describing the climate system as "an integral and vitally important part of the environment and which must be protected for present and future generations".In his opening remarks, ICJ president Yuji Iwasawa said the consequences of climate change "are severe and far-reaching: they affect both natural ecosystems and human populations. These consequences underscore the urgent and existential threat posed by climate change."He added that the adverse effects of climate change may significantly impair certain human rights, including the right to life."Greenhouse gas emissions are unequivocally caused by human activities which are not territorially limited," he said.As a result, the court ruled that states have a legal obligation to tackle climate change and that failing to do so was a "wrongful act" that could open the door to reparations.Push from VanuatuThe push for a court opinion was spearheaded by the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, amid growing frustration at sluggish progress in UN climate negotiations.'Survival' at stake as Vanuatu uses ocean summit to press ICJ climate caseRalph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's climate change minister, said the ICJ ruling could be a "game-changer" in the fight against global warming."We've been going through this for 30 years... It'll shift the narrative, which is what we need to have," Regenvanu told French news agency AFP.The United Nations tasked the 15 judges at the ICJ with answering two fundamental questions:-  First: what must states do under international law to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions "for present and future generations"?-  Second: what are the consequences for states whose emissions have caused environmental harm, especially to vulnerable low-lying island states?While critics argue that major polluters are likely to disregard these, others highlight the court's significant moral and legal authority.They express hope that its opinion will influence national climate policies and strengthen ongoing legal efforts to address climate change.Andrew Raine, deputy director of the UN Environment Programme's law division, said the ICJ should "clarify how international law applies to the climate crisis".Legal and political weightAnalysts say Wednesday's ruling is the most consequential of a string of recent rulings on climate change in international law, as courts become a battleground for climate action.Outside the court in The Hague, around 100 demonstrators waved flags and posters bearing slogans such as "No more delay, climate justice today".In the decade up to 2023, sea levels rose by a global average of around 4.3 centimetres, with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels.Simply having the court issue an opinion is the latest in a series of legal victories for the small island nations.Earlier this month, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found that countries have a legal duty not only to avoid environmental harm but also to protect and restore ecosystems. Last year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change.In 2019, the Netherlands' supreme court handed down the first major legal win for climate activists, when judges ruled that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change was a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens.(with newswires)RFIENG-500217988RFIENG2025urn:contentItem:6GBB-10R3-RRYM-M136-00000-004078472025-07-24Copyright 2025  Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.
Failure to tackle climate change could be a violation of international law, UN court finds [1]
  Instance 1: States must ACT NOW.” Afterward, others emerged laughing and hugging.“Today, the tables have turned. The world’s highest court provided us with a powerful new tool to protect people from the devastating impacts of the climate crisis — and to deliver justice for the harm their emissions have already caused,” former UN human rights chief Mary Robinson said in a statement.“The ICJ’s decision brings us closer to a world where governments can no longer turn a blind eye to their legal responsibilities. It affirms a simple truth of climate justice: Those who did the least to fuel this crisis deserve protection, reparations, and a future,” said Vishal Prasad, director of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change.Activists could bring lawsuits against their own countries for failing to comply with the decision.“What makes this case so important is that it addresses the past, present, and future of climate action. It’s not just about future targets -- it also tackles historical responsibility, because we cannot solve the climate crisis without confronting its roots,” Joie Chowdhury, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, told AP.High stakes“The stakes could not be higher. The survival of my people and so many others is on the line,” Arnold Kiel Loughman, attorney general of the island nation of Vanuatu, told the court during hearings in December.In the decade up to 2023, sea levels rose by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters, with parts of the Pacific rising higher still.
OCEAN SUMMIT 2025 - 'Survival' at stake as Vanuatu uses ocean summit to press ICJ climate case [2]

Sea levels in parts of the Pacific are rising faster than the global average of 4.3 centimetres per decade, and warming oceans are causing widespread coral bleaching, acidification and biodiversity loss.Niue, the tiny island selling the sea to save it from destruction"The single greatest cause of the destruction that's happening in the oceans...
  Instance 2: is the heating of the ocean, which is caused by greenhouse gas emissions," Regenvanu said."So it's the single greatest threat to the ocean right now."The ICJ case builds on long-standing frustration with slow progress at climate summits."We've been involved in the UNFCCC process, the COPs, for like 30 years. And we're not seeing the right ambition and change in the international community," Regenvanu said."We are looking to speed that up, to raise that ambition, to get things to happen faster."Defining the consequencesAt issue is whether countries have violated existing international laws – not just climate treaties, but also human rights law, the law of the sea and key environmental principles such as the duty to prevent harm and act with due diligence."Climate change is not occurring in a legal vacuum," Aguon explained. "It is governed by a wide body of international law."The court has been asked not only to clarify those obligations, but also to outline the consequences when they're breached."This case does, in fact, represent a watershed moment in legal accountability for climate change," Aguon said."We can move into a new era of binding obligations and the consequences for failure to take those obligations seriously."The big blue blindspot: why the ocean floor is still an unmapped mysteryAsked whether Vanuatu is seeking "reparations" for the damage already done, Regenvanu emphasised that the case is about climate justice – holding those who caused the crisis responsible for fixing it."Justice means if you cause a problem, you are responsible for dealing with it and making up for it," Regenvanu said. "And I think reparations is a word you could use. It is to do with fixing the problem you created."A strong opinion delivered by the ICJ could open the door to a new wave of legal challenges and lay the groundwork for countries like Vanuatu to pursue compensation through national or regional courts."It becomes a legal precedent that can be used in any court.
Activism - Forty years after the Rainbow Warrior bombing, activists still under attack [1]
  Instance 1: It builds strength".The organisation quickly dispatched another vessel to Moruroa, ensuring the protests went ahead as planned.The Rainbow Warrior became a potent symbol of resistance, and the incident is widely credited with strengthening the anti-nuclear movement in the Pacific and beyond."It is much more than just a ship that was bombed by the French," Christensen told RFI."They tried to silence a movement, an opposition to their plans to do nuclear testing in the Pacific. And the aftermath showed that Greenpeace just grew stronger, as did the movement."Wake-up call for France as climate experts push for new action on emissionsIn the years since, Greenpeace has expanded its operations, becoming one of the world's best known environmental groups.The lessons of the Rainbow Warrior have shaped its approach: a stubborn commitment to non-violent direct action, meticulous security protocols and a determination to expose environmental wrongdoing, regardless of the risks.Today, the Rainbow Warrior rests on the seabed off New Zealand's coast, transformed into a living reef.Intimidation and attacksMeanwhile, the repression of environmental activists persists in new forms.According to a statement issued by Greenpeace on 9 July, Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International faced a "record-breaking" Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP) in the US, launched by oil and gas company Energy Transfer, resulting in a €563 million fine.Worldwide, according to NGO Global Witness, one environmental defender is killed every two days. The UN Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders also expressed concern over the disproportionate use of force during environmental protests, including in France.According to Greenpeace, attacks on activists – whether physical, legal, political or media-driven – "reflect a clear intent to silence those who challenge exploitative and destructive models".Fighting for the Ocean: Paul Watson on activism, repression and hope"The numerous attempts to intimidate non-violent activists underscore the urgent need to guarantee freedom [of expression], protect whistleblowers and defend all those working for climate justice, the preservation of life and fundamental rights," said Jean-François Julliard, executive director of Greenpeace France.Forty years after the Rainbow Warrior attack, the organisation says its "determination remains undiminished".Throughout the summer, activists from the organisation's local groups are mobilising across France to pay tribute to activists, calling on the public to join the Time to Resist campaign, the aim of which is to "ignite a global wave of resistance to push back against billionaires' greed, legal bullying and attacks on our right to protest and speak up for the planet – and for each other".RFIENG-498209600RFIENG2025urn:contentItem:6G7C-RC03-S2F3-K2PN-00000-004078472025-07-10Copyright 2025  Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.

The Dreaded Speed UpAmid their frustration, many Amazon engineers have joined a group called Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, which is pressuring the company to reduce its carbon footprint and has become a clearinghouse for workers' anxieties about other issues, like return-to-office mandates. (Amazon said it is working to reduce carbon emissions from its data centers; the climate justice group is pushing it to provide more information on how.)       The group's organizers say they are in touch with several hundred Amazon employees on a regular basis and that the workers increasingly discuss the stress of using A.I. on the job, in addition to the effect that the technology has on the climate.

See for example the country's return to the Paris Agreement, or the the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivises clean energy production.Harris has long been a voice who championed the environment during her years as a public prosecutor, US senator, and most recently vice president.Harris's green backgroundIn 2005, as a prosecutor, Harris created what she said was the first environmental justice unit in the US. "Environmental crimes are crimes against communities, against people who are often poor and disenfranchised", she said when the unit was set up.During her mandate and subsequently, as Attorney General of California, Harris prosecuted Plains All-American Pipeline following an oil spill off the Californian coast in 2015 and obtained a criminal indictment against the company.She won an $86 million settlement from Volkswagen following allegations of cheating on diesel emissions tests and investigated Exxon Mobil over concerns that the company misled the public and shareholders about climate change risks.Elected as a senator in 2017, Harris was an early co-promoter of the Green New Deal, a precursor to green growth policies subsequently adopted in the US and Europe.

Climate change poses significant threats to agriculture in Senegal, where only 7% of cultivated land is irrigated, rendering the country's agriculture highly reliant on rainfall.The protest precedes the upcoming COP28 summit scheduled to take place in Dubai, starting November 30th."Fighting climate change is very difficult, and requires human, material and financial resources that the women don't have. That's why they're here today to remind the decision-makers who will be attending the next Convention of the Parties in Dubai that last year, at COP27, they were promised a green fund to support the fight against climate change," defended Mouhamadou Lamine Seck, environmental lawyer.

The agricultural sector has had to undergo substantial changes, with the groundnut industry, historically a cornerstone of the Senegalese economy, experiencing a severe crisis.This crisis prompted a shift to the cultivation of cereals like millet, rice, and corn, along with the production of fruits, vegetables, and manioc.Notably, this marks the third demonstration organized by Senegalese women advocating for climate justice.AFRICN-httpswwwafricanewscom20231126senegalruralwomenadvocateforclimatejusticeaheadofcop28summitutmsourcelexisnexisutmcaignfeedsnewsutmmediumreferralAFRICN2023urn:contentItem:69R6-2HS1-JCMC-W0KW-00000-004786712023-11-262:12 PM ESTCopyright 2023 Euronews SA  All Rights ReservedAfricanews (English)November 26, 2023 SundayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsENGLISHSenegal &amp; United Arab EmiratesAfrica, Western AfricaAsia, Western AsiaDakar &amp; DubayIND: LEGUMES &amp; NUTSSUB: COVID CORONAVIRUSGEO: UNITED ARAB EMIRATES; DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATESSUB: CLIMATE CHANGESUB: COVID-19 CORONAVIRUSSUB: NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSSUB: PROTESTS &amp; DEMONSTRATIONSIND: FRUIT &amp; NUT FARMINGSUB: ECONOMIC CRISISIND: FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLESSUB: ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEIND: AGRICULTURESUB: SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLESUB: RURAL COMMUNITIESSUB: CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONSSUB: ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESIND: AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING &amp; HUNTINGSUB: NEGATIVE ECONOMIC NEWSSUB: AGRICULTURAL LANDSIND: AGRICULTURAL LANDSGEO: SENEGALSUB: EPIDEMICSSUB: INFECTIOUS DISEASEGEO: UNITED ARAB EMIRATESGEO: DAKAR, SENEGAL; SENEGALEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGESTX001511RURAL COMMUNITIESST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSSTX001421PROTESTS &amp; DEMONSTRATIONSSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESSTX000365CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONSSTX001965SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLEST000A51FECONOMIC CRISISST000DQGECOVID CORONAVIRUSST000DOTHCOVID-19 CORONAVIRUSSTX002064EPIDEMICSSTX000912INFECTIOUS DISEASEST000D1FRNEGATIVE ECONOMIC NEWSST000DSFNAGRICULTURAL LANDSST000DSOYLEGUMES &amp; NUTSN110000CCAGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING &amp; HUNTINGSTX000049AGRICULTUREST00097GYFRUITS &amp; VEGETABLESN111300CCFRUIT &amp; NUT FARMINGST000DSFNAGRICULTURAL LANDSGX286DAKAR, SENEGALST0009TXVDUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATESGC555SENEGALGC354UNITED ARAB EMIRATESGT111AFRICAGT113ASIAGR112WESTERN AFRICAGR140WESTERN ASIA

But new economic and security challenges have changed that. Over the last 20 years, as the geopolitical balance has shifted, the Indo-Pacific idea has acquired new significance.
  Instance 2: And what about other countries which suffer the same fate?Given agreements such as the Falepili Union, it looks as if the disappearance of some countries could benefit the big contributors to global warming who caused it.But the Pacific countries are not resigned to this fate, and their representatives are doing their level best to take advantage of the high-pressure geopolitical competition. Despite fragile regional unity and major obstacles, cooperation has strengthened within the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF, the main regional organisation in Oceania, of which French Polynesia and New Caledonia are full members because of their status under international law) (6).This cooperation has enabled member states to make their voices heard, through declarations such as that of August 2021 on maintaining maritime zones and the rights relating to them notwithstanding the effects of sea-level rise. Their fight for climate justice has brought about important developments: Vanatu’s request to the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion clarifying state responsibility for acting on climate change (pending) attracted widespread regional support and was subsequently backed by a resolution at the March 2023 UN General Assembly.Island countries, conscious of the threats they face, are rejecting an externally imposed, artificial rhetoric of the Indo-Pacific, and seeking to free themselves from Australia and New Zealand’s paternalistic talk of ‘good neighbours’ and a ‘Pacific family’ (7). They are realistic about the huge economic resources needed to counter the threats, but they also have legitimate expectations of recognition and justice. Above all, they are unwilling to be dragged into a conflict that is not theirs.

This disparity leads to increasingly frequent and severe poverty, displacement, and infrastructure losses in the Global South.Calls for Just Climate SolutionsProtesters demand that the COP29 negotiations focus on “loss and damages” funding to support countries that lack the resources to adapt to or recover from climate disasters. Last year, the establishment of a Loss and Damage fund was a significant step forward, yet only around USD 700 million has been pledged, far short of the estimated USD 580 billion needed by 2033.Climate justice advocates insist that a solution to the climate crisis must include voices from the Global South, indigenous communities, and frontline defenders of the environment. They argue that these groups, who have contributed the least to GHG emissions, possess invaluable knowledge for climate adaptation.AFRICN-httpswwwafricanewscom20241114protestersdemandrichcountriespayfairshareinclimatefinanceamidcop29negotiationsutmsourcelexisnexisutmcaignfeedsnewsutmmediumreferralAFRICN2024urn:contentItem:6DDN-RH71-JCMC-W0KM-00000-004786712024-11-149:25 AM ESTCopyright 2024 Euronews SA  All Rights ReservedAfricanews (English)November 14, 2024 ThursdayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsENGLISHACTIONAID INTERNATIONALEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQST000DR4JGREEN FINANCEST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST000DTNMACTIVISMST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGESTX000594EMISSIONSST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST000D8B1GREENHOUSE GASESST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSST000DRDXNEGATIVE MISC NEWSST000DQQAPOLITICAL &amp; SOCIAL IDEOLOGIESSTX001444RACE &amp; ETHNICITYST000DPKDSYSTEMIC RACISMST000DL5QTYPES OF GOVERNMENTSTX000483DEVELOPING COUNTRIESST000DRP2ECONOMIC INEQUALITYST000CA1XENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGYSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSST000DEUISEVERE WEATHERST000DL6MSUSTAINABILITYST0009SI7ENVIRONMENTALISMST000DPKLENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYST000DS4VSEA LEVEL CHANGESST0008X7KINDIGENOUS PEOPLESN115310MMREFORESTATIONST000CA2HPOVERTY &amp; HOMELESSNESSST000DR4JGREEN FINANCESTX000594EMISSIONSSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESST000DPKLENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYSTX001466ALTERNATIVE &amp; RENEWABLE ENERGYN115310MMREFORESTATION

Climate change - United Nations adopts landmark resolution for global climate justice [4]

And while the court's opinions are not binding, they carry significant legal and moral weight, and are often taken into account by national courts.An ICJ opinion "would assist the General Assembly, the UN and member states to take the bolder and stronger climate action that our world so desperately needs," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.Carbon emissions hit record high in 2022 despite jump in renewablesDuring negotiations on the Paris Agreement, US diplomats secured the addition of language specifying that the text "does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation."But the backers of the new resolution backers hope other instruments, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, could offer pathways for enforcement.US representative Nicholas Hill said of Wednesday's resolution that it "could complicate our collective efforts and will not bring us closer to achieving these shared goals" of reducing emissions, adding that he prefers diplomacy to "a judicial process".Climate in courtThe ICJ's advisory opinion could be a vital input to a growing number of climate-driven lawsuits around the world – some 2,000 cases are pending worldwide.On Wednesday the European Court of Human Rights opened its first ever cases against governments for alleged climate inaction. France and Switzerland are accused of failing to protect the environment.Last week the UN's IPCC panel of climate experts warned that global average temperatures could reach 1.5 degrees Celcius above pre-industrial levels by 2030-2035 unless emissions are halved by 2030, underlining the need for drastic action this decade.(with wires)Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.
Shell ruling shows Big Oil's reckoning in court is here [1]
  Instance 1: Unless fossil fuel lobbyists and countries gathering in Baku stop propping up fossil fuels with investments and billions in subsidies, they will face increasing legal challenges. Instead they should focus on shifting these funds to climate action and plan for a full and fair fossil fuel phaseout to fulfill their obligations to the Global South. The court's suggestion that new fossil fuel investments may be incompatible with their legal duties puts them on notice.This ruling is one battle in a broader campaign for climate justice. The court has provided new tools for the continuation of this fight, affirming fundamental principles about fossil fuel corporations' responsibility for driving the climate crisis. The evidence against the fossil fuel industry grows stronger every day, as does the legal framework for holding them accountable.One thing is certain: this wave of climate litigation is just getting started.EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectioneetopinionshellrulingshowsbigoilsreckoningincourtishereEURCOM2024urn:contentItem:6DG9-TVG1-JCMC-W46J-00000-003981612024-11-22Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

It began on Monday and is expected to last for two weeks.Arguments will revolve around the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) that obliges countries to prevent pollution of the oceans and to protect the marine environment. It has been ratified by 168 nations.Oceans treatyThe UN treaty defines pollution as the introduction by humans of "substances or energy into the marine environment" that harms marine life.But it does not spell out carbon emissions as a specific pollutant, and the plaintiffs argue that these emissions should qualify."This is the opening chapter in the struggle to change the conduct of the international community by clarifying the obligation of states to protect the marine environment," the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Gaston Browne, told the court."The time has come to speak in terms of legally binding obligations rather than empty promises that go unfulfilled."The race to defend or delay deep-sea miningSea change at last for world's fragile oceans in need of rescueOcean ecosystems create half the oxygen humans breathe and limit global warming by absorbing much of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities.But increasing emissions can warm and acidify seawaters, harming marine life.If the islands' request is successful, the court's decision could lead to wide-ranging claims for damages.(with AFP)Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.
Europe's moment of truth at COP29 [1]
  Instance 1: This has to stop. It's time too for the EU to support a COP29 conclusion that includes a "no" by all countries to building new coal power plants.COP29 should be the moment that the EU announces that it will include ambitious, 1.5°C-aligned fossil fuel phase-out dates in its upcoming Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).This action is crucial to safeguarding our planet's ability to provide essential ecosystem services. Binding targets for at least 50% renewables by 2030 and 100% by 2040 within the EU are essential.Recommitting to human rights and equityThere is no climate justice without human rights. The EU must ensure that international and national climate processes protect human rights and that civil society and frontline communities can participate meaningfully.Policies must reflect the lived experiences of those most affected, incorporating gender-responsive, disability-inclusive, and socially just approaches. The EU should also center human rights and environmental safeguards in all climate-or-trade-related agreements with third countries.Independent civil society oversight of transnational climate governance is essential to the success of the UNFCCC process.

CLIMATE JUSTICE - Oil, gas giants could pay climate damage and still profit: report [2]

State-owned firms contribute to huge sovereign wealth funds in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, the host of this year's Cop28 talks."This fossil wealth is here to stay while the world suffers from the devastating consequences of climate change for centuries to come," the report's lead author Carl-Friedrich Schleussner told journalists.The contrast was particularly striking last year, the authors of the report said.As energy prices sky rocketed due to Russia's war in Ukraine, major oil and gas companies posted record profits.The $161 billion profit of Saudi Arabia's state-owned Aramco in 2022 was "probably the highest net income ever reported in the corporate world," its CEO Amin Nasser has said.Aramco was one of seven companies that posted profits almost twice the amount of the estimated damage caused by their emissions, according to the report.Human health at 'grave risk' from climate inaction, major report warnsPetrochemical industry joins global talks to agree plastic pollution treatyWorld 'failing to get a grip' on planet-heating emissions, UN report claims'Flaunting their profits'The researchers calculated damages for the world's biggest emitters by using estimates for the social cost of carbon from 1985-2018, which amounted to $185 per tonne of carbon dioxide.They compared this number with company profits from the same period.The researchers then split the damages in three to account for the responsibility of governments and consumers.State-owned oil companies in Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran, China and the UAE showed both the most damaged caused -- and the largest financial gain.ExxonMobil topped the list for private companies, followed by Shell, BP and Chevron.Half of the sovereign wealth fund of Cop28 host the UAE could cover the climate damage from its fossil fuel industries and still have $700 billion left over, the report said.At last year's Cop27 talks in Egypt, nations agreed to set up a dedicated fund to help vulnerable countries cope with "loss and damage" from climate disasters such as extreme weather.The details have yet to be worked out, however, and the fund will be a key point of negotiation at this year's COP28 talks.Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, whose Caribbean island nation is threatened by rising sea levels, has called for a 10 percent tax on the profits of oil and gas companies to go into such a fund.The UN estimates that developing countries will need over $300 billion per year by 2030 to combat the impacts of climate change.The COP28 talks will be held during what is widely expected to be the hottest year on record."Oil and gas companies are meanwhile unabashedly flaunting their profits, some even walking back on their climate commitments," said report co-author Marina Andrijevic.Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.

Cop29 - Developing nations blast $300 billion Cop29 climate deal as insufficient [1]
  Instance 1: That earlier goal was met two years late, in 2022, and expires in 2025.The deal also lays the groundwork for next year's climate summit, to be held in the Amazon rainforest of Brazil, where countries are meant to map out the next decade of climate action.The summit cut to the heart of the debate over financial responsibility of industrialised countries - whose historic use of fossil fuels has caused the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions - to compensate others for worsening damage from climate change.It also laid bare divisions between wealthy governments constrained by tight domestic budgets and developing nations reeling from costs of storms, floods and droughts.Negotiations had been due to finish on Friday but ran into overtime as representatives from nearly 200 countries struggled to reach consensus. Talks were interrupted on Saturday as some developing countries and island nations walked away in frustration."We are leaving with a small portion of the funding climate-vulnerable countries urgently need. It isn't nearly enough, but it's a start," said Tina Stege, Marshall Islands climate envoy.Nations have been seeking financing to deliver on the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - beyond which catastrophic climate impacts could occur.Podcast: Africans push food systems and climate justice at Cop29The world is currently on track for as much as 3.1 C of warming by the end of this century, according to the 2024 UN Emissions Gap report, with global greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuels use continuing to rise.Sunday's deal failed to set out detailed steps for how countries will act on last year's UN climate summit pledge to transition away from fossil fuels and triple renewable energy capacity this decade. Some negotiators said Saudi Arabia had attempted to block such a plan during the talks."There's definitely a challenge in getting greater ambition when you're negotiating with the Saudis," said US climate adviser John Podesta.A Saudi official did not immediately provide comment.What counts as developed nation? The roster of countries required to contribute - about two dozen industrialised countries, including the US, European nations and Canada - dates back to a list decided during UN climate talks in 1992.European governments have demanded others pay in, including China, the world's second-biggest economy, and oil-rich Gulf states.
Climate justice - World's largest climate fund seeks cash for developing nations [2]

It is a matter of justice."The GCF says Thursday's conference will allow it to invest more through a decade it sees as critical for climate action.Its current portfolio of projects is mostly dedicated to Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America and the Caribbean.Rolling out solar panels in Pakistan and making Philippine agriculture more resilient in the face of unpredictable weather are among projects that have been approved.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz hailed the GCF as "an important point for many of the most vulnerable countries"."Let's make 2023 a turning point for climate action," he said in a video address.The GCF has laid out a "50by30" vision to manage $50 billion by 2030 – almost triple its current capital of $17 billion.It aims to focus efforts in developing countries between next year and 2027.This year, Britain and Germany pledged billions of dollars to the GCF, while France followed suit last month with a commitment of €1.61 billion (around $1.7 billion).Rich nations pledge to unlock hundreds of billions for climate fightAustria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Iceland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea and Spain have also made commitments.But a huge gap remains to be plugged, with the United States yet to announce how much – if anything – it will offer.It pledged around $3 billion for the fund's first resource mobilisation in 2014 under former president Barack Obama, but his successor Donald Trump gave nothing five years later.'Fractured landscape'The GCF currently has more than 100 implementing partners and various financial instruments. A first tranche of replenishment funds worth $10 billion was pledged for the 2020-2023 period.According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), developed countries helped to supply $83.3 billion in climate finance in 2020.But experts say the real needs in developing countries are much higher.Why winning the climate fight in Africa is a win for the worldThe UN's Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance last year estimated developing nations would need more than $2 trillion a year by 2030 to fund climate resilience and development priorities."The GCF has a critical role to play but to date has struggled to define its function and comparative advantage within a fractured climate financing landscape," said the Lowy Institute, an Australian international policy think tank.(AFP)Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.
Why Oil Companies Are Walking Back From Green Energy [1]

Repression Intensifies in the Country Hosting a Major Climate Meeting [1]
  Instance 1: Some of the arrests, he said, appeared to be an effort to "eliminate everything that could lead to criticism around COP," as the climate change meeting, officially the Conference of the Parties, is known. Those arrested have included at least 12 journalists for at least three prominent independent media outlets, human rights watchdogs say. They have also included well-known activists like Anar Mammadli, who was arrested weeks after he co-founded a group in February called the Climate Justice Initiative that aimed to use the climate summit to pressure the government to improve human rights and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Aliyev has dismissed international criticism of the arrests as a "smear campaign" intended to distract from "our noble mission to cope with the negative impacts of climate change." The authorities have cited alleged financial crimes and violations of Azerbaijan's stringent code for nongovernmental organizations as reasons for the arrests.
The World Took a Bold, Toothless Step Forward on Climate Justice [4]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:66XY-GHP1-JC85-N3P8-00000-00The World Took a Bold, Toothless Step Forward on Climate Justice2022-11-25T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:24ZLexisNexisOPINIONThe World Took a Bold, Toothless Step Forward on Climate JusticeDavid Wallace-WellsABSTRACTThe two big developments out of COP27 suggest that the story of climate geopolitics may be shifting.FULL TEXTThe United Nations climate conference that concluded last weekend in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, did not appear, at the outset, poised to deliver a major breakthrough. Unlike last year's meeting in Glasgow, this year's was not designed to produce new emissions pledges, and so the countries that pollute the most weren't under particular pressure to offer any new promises. Beyond Secretary General António Guterres's fiery opening remarks, there were few high-profile rhetorical performances at COP27 by world leaders like those last year by Boris Johnson and then-Prince Charles of England, who engaged in a sort of Olympics of climate hyperbole.
  Instance 2: Taken together, the two developments - progress on justice but not decarbonization - suggests the possibility that the story of climate geopolitics may be shifting, with the project of emissions reductions falling increasingly to industries and nation-states to undertake on their own. The mission of addressing climate injustice is meanwhile falling to international institutions, like the United Nations, that seemed not that long ago somewhat incapable of fulfilling that mandate. One of the central themes of the big-picture state-of-climate-change essay I published a couple of weeks before the conference was that the path forward on emissions looked clear and somewhat encouraging, and that the emerging story on climate justice and the brutal inequalities of warming looked far uglier and harder to manage. The most obvious narrative was that encouraging global momentum was finally pushing the project of decarbonization somewhat rapidly forward, but not rapidly enough to avoid hard distributional questions about who would face the most intense climate impacts and what other countries might do to help those on the front lines survive them. And if you had asked me what that implied about the prospects for COP27, I would probably have predicted a simple extension of both narratives: some amount of limited but insufficient good news on emissions and some conspicuous and maddening lack of action of climate justice, climate finance and loss and damage.

'Despite the progress made in 30 years since the first COP' climate justice is lagging [5]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:673S-RF51-F00C-6239-00000-00'Despite the progress made in 30 years since the first COP' climate justice is lagging2022-12-16T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:24ZLexisNexis'Despite the progress made in 30 years since the first COP' climate justice is lagging At COP27 there was a multitude of competing interests and voices that sought the world's attention. But one thing that became clear was the chorus of small and often vulnerable states demanding justice now and at scale to address their concerns and the challenges they face. Despite the progress we have made in the 30 years since the first COP in Rio, the crucial issue of climate justice remains off track.At its heart, climate justice aims to support the most vulnerable people and places that face the direct and most dramatic impacts of the climate crisis.It considers the outsized role that some actors have played in causing the crisis and their responsibility in supporting those most affected.To address this injustice, while also meeting ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions to net zero, we will need an estimated $4trn each year by 2030.This includes unprecedented investment in the deployment of technologies to speed the energy transition.However, climate finance flows in 2021 only reached around $630bn: just a sixth of what is required.Clearly, this is not sufficient, and it is skewed: private actors who are currently the main source of capital are operating in only a handful of countries.'Existential crisis'While being home to a small fraction of the world's population and contributing less than 1% of greenhouse gas emissions, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face an existential risk from climate change, for them, climate justice is a matter of survival.And yet they remain consistently under-represented in access to climate finance, attracting only 2% of the global total for 2013-2018.Funding for the ocean is pitiful: Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 is the least funded of all SDGs with less than 2% of the Green Climate Fund allocated to ocean actions.If we are to tackle climate change we have no choice but to mobilise and scale up all sources of climate finance.Governments must play their part and keep their promises, but the private sector must too.Developed nations historically pledged at COP15 in 2009 to provide $100bn a year to less wealthy nations by 2020 to help adaptation and mitigation efforts.However, developed nations have fallen well short of fulfilling this promise and this systemic failure on the part of developed nations to honour their commitments strikes a discordant note.Despite the new promises and pledges, this unreliability has been well noted by those who were depending on that promise.Climate funding shortfalls are dramatically exacerbating current economic hardships faced by Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and SIDS.The expected losses from climate change for SIDS are estimated to be up to 6.5 % of annual GDP, in stark contrast to a global average of 0.5%.Although the historic outcome from the COP27 summit with the establishment of a loss and damage fund is a very welcome step, the threats faced by LDCs and SIDS continue to intensify.'Making headlines'At COP27, the  Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley made headlines with the ambitious Bridgetown Initiative, a policy systems initiative that aims to collaboratively work with stakeholders to redraw the global financial architecture to truly reflect vulnerability and breakdown many of the current climate-funding roadblocks for LDCs and SIDS.Too often the debate on financing for climate change and other development issues are reduced to the limited analysis of raw GDP numbers or debt ratios rather than a more nuanced understanding of how economies work and the unique challenges faced by smaller more vulnerable nations.To contribute to this debate the Commonwealth Secretariat launched its Universal Vulnerability Index (UVI) (2021) which is geared to capture more refined insights on the state of a nation's vulnerability and resilience.The UVI separates measurements for structural resilience and structural vulnerability, therefore putting less emphasis on the snapshot of nominal GDP and building in a flexible ranking of a country's ability to rebuild.The Commonwealth Secretariat is taking targeted action through initiatives such as the Commonwealth Climate Finance Access Hub a successfully tried and tested Commonwealth initiative to help small and vulnerable member states access to finance and scale up climate action.The Hub was launched in 2016 and has already supported member states to mobilise millions of dollars of climate finance with hundreds of millions in the pipeline.Another recent project the 'Their Future, Our Action' project, is a collaboration between the Commonwealth Secretariat and the University of Cambridge's Centre for Resilience and Sustainable Development (CRSD), embarks on ground-breaking action-based research to support the deployment of greater sustainability-related funds into SIDS by redesigning altogether how climate and resilience finance is accessed.The project has already borne fruit, unlocking more than $10m of private financing for Small Island Developing States.A key outcome, so far, from the research, is the recognition of SIDS vast untapped assets in their young populations and in their natural assets which could be leveraged to catalyse greater climate finance flows into SIDS.A key part of the project is developing investment measures that reward SIDS for good stewardship of their natural assets.'Honour commitments'If the world is to come together and tackle the real and pressing issues faced by LDCs and SIDS, it is essential that developed countries honour their commitments and pledges to deliver financing and related technical assistance.Every promise needs to be kept and every option explored to enable the Commonwealth Member States - indeed all countries everywhere - to adequately deal with the immense task of climate change.Because if we fail in this task, and fall into disharmony and discord, we will fail not just this generation but all future generations and inevitably see the diverse chorus of small and vulnerable states succumb to the worst effects of climate change and lose their voices forever.AFREPO-AFRREPORT161220220000503AFREPO2022urn:contentItem:673S-RF51-F00C-6239-00000-004342042022-12-17Copyright 2022 The Africa Report All Rights ReservedThe Africa

UN adopts landmark resolution on climate justice [2]

two critical points that have been missing from much of the dominant discourse," Shaina Sadai of the Union for Concerned Scientists advocacy group told AFP.Describing the new resolution as "the most important global move since the Paris Agreement feels accurate," Sadai said, adding that it was an "incredibly important next step" particularly for guidance for "lawsuits being brought in courts around the world."The adoption comes the same day that cases opened before the European Court of Human Rights against France and Switzerland over alleged failings to protect the environment, marking the first time governments are in the court's dock for alleged climate change inaction.Although ICJ opinions are not binding, they carry significant legal and moral weight, and are often taken into account by national courts.'Bigger than our fears'Vanuatu and its supporters hope that the forthcoming ICJ opinion, expected in about two years, will encourage governments to accelerate their action, either of their own volition or because of legal recourse.The enthusiasm however is not shared by all."I see scenarios where this request would be counterproductive," Benoit Mayer, a specialist in international law at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told AFP.He warned of a possible "disaster scenario," if the ICJ opinion is "clear and precise, but contrary to what the supporters of the request wanted."The UN resolution notably asks the ICJ to clarify the "legal consequences" for states which "have caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment."It specifically asks the court to weigh obligations to "small island developing States," which are "particularly vulnerable" to climate change, as well as obligations to future generations.The adoption marked an emotional moment for the Pacific youth who spearheaded the initiative."This was an opportunity to do something bigger than ourselves, bigger than our fears, something important for our future," said Cynthia Houniuhi, president of the group Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change.Link to ImageYouths sue European states over treaty protecting fossil fuelsFive young people who count themselves as victims of climate change filed lawsuits on Tuesday (21 June) at the European Court of Human Rights against European states for letting the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) delay the green transition.EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionclimateenvironmentnewsunadoptslandmarkresolutiononclimatejusticeEURCOM2023urn:contentItem:67WR-R861-F03F-K498-00000-003981612023-03-30Copyright 2023 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

Guterres warns of catastrophic rising seas in the Pacific island nations [1]
  Instance 1: About 90% of the region's people live within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of the rising oceans, he said.Since 1980, coastal flooding in Guam has jumped from twice a year to 22 times a year. It's gone from five times a year to 43 times a year in the Cook Islands. In Pago Pago, American Samoa, coastal flooding went from zero to 102 times a year, according to the WMO State of the Climate in the South-West Pacific 2023 report.“Because of sea level rise, the ocean is transforming from being a lifelong friend into a growing threat,” Celeste Saulo, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, told reporters in Nuku’alofa on Tuesday.While the western edges of the Pacific are seeing sea level rise about twice the global average, the central Pacific is closer to the global average, the WMO said.Sea levels are rising faster in the western tropical Pacific because of where the melting ice from western Antarctica heads, warmer waters and ocean currents, UN officials said.Guterres said he can see changes since the last time he was in the region in May 2019.While he met in Nuku'alofa on Tuesday with Pacific nations on the environment at their leaders' annual summit, a hundred local high school students and activists from across the Pacific marched for climate justice a few blocks away. One of the marchers was Itinterunga Rae of the Barnaban Human Rights Defenders Network, whose people were forced generations ago to relocate to Fiji from their Kiribati island home due to environmental degradation. Rae said abandoning Pacific islands should not be seen as a solution to rising seas.“We promote climate mobility as a solution to be safe from your island that’s been destroyed by climate change, but it’s not the safest option,” he said.
CLIMATE JUSTICE - French, Swiss climate policy goes on trial in European rights court [2]

COP27 - ENVIRONMENT - Will climate justice be yet another victim of the energy crisis? [3]

New Global Financial Pact takes small steps towards climate justice [2]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:68HY-29W1-F03F-K3WJ-00000-00New Global Financial Pact takes small steps towards climate justice2023-06-23T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:24ZLexisNexisCLIMATE CHANGE NEWS &amp; FRANCE NEWSNew Global Financial Pact takes small steps towards climate justiceSilvia Ellena, Théo Bourgery-GonseHeads of state and civil society representatives committed on Friday (23 June) to work towards a "fundamental reform" of the international development aid framework, agreeing on several measures to aid the green transition - but fell short of commitments on international carbon taxation.Leaders gathered at the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact, held in Paris on Thursday and Friday, to discuss financing for Global South development aid and the climate transition."No country must be left to choose between poverty reduction and fighting against climate change," said French President Emmanuel Macron, who co-hosted the summit with Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley.Participants committed to a roadmap to scale up actions for 'debt distressed' countries, by increasing the financing firepower of both public and private institutions for low-income nations and pausing debt repayments in case of climate disasters.The summit "broke taboos" and achieved a high representation of the countries most vulnerable to climate effects, said William Ruto, president of Kenya."For the first time ever, as we leave Paris, we have agreed that we have to rethink [the entire international financial infrastructure]," he added.While all welcomed the summit as a way to renew international financing, which experts claim is needed at a scale of $4 trillion every year, they failed to unify around the implementation of an international carbon tax and stressed that the reform urgently needed to translate into concrete steps.Link to ImageSummit for a New Global Financing Pact: What it is and why it mattersParis will be hosting a one-of-a-kind 'Summit for a New Global Financing Pact' on 22-23 June, in an effort to secure financing for Global South development aid and climate transition, and enshrine the need for a review of multilateral institutions.World Bank announces new 'crisis preparedness' toolkitFollowing months of technical conversations, World Bank chief Ajay Banga, in post for only three weeks, announced an "expanded toolkit for crisis preparedness" and response.The kit includes the complete pausing of debt repayments for a minimum of two years and a 'new rapid response' option to repurpose lending facilities when a country is hit by a climate-related disaster, alongside new 'climate resilient debt clauses' and insurance policies.This follows an explicit demand by Mottley, who slammed the current system as one that penalised countries most impacted by climate change, which focused their spending towards debt servicing rather than economic development.Special drawing rights - ambitions on the upIn conjunction with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), world leaders called on richer countries to reallocate 40% of their special drawing rights (SDRs) to poorer counterparts, up from the previous target of 30%.SDRs are a monetary instrument that act as international liquidity reserves, from which IMF member countries can benefit. However, the amount allocated to each country is determined in part by the size of its economy: the richer the country, the more SDRs it can claim, while poorer countries can only access a small portion of SDRs.In 2021, leaders committed to reaching $100 billion worth of SDR reallocation, which was achieved on Friday for the first time.It is time "we lift our ambitions", IMF director Kristalina Georgieva said at the summit, stating that the 'future of humanity' is at stake.Hesitations on carbon tax and shipping levy"There is no flying chance that we will meet the 1.5°C target with no international carbon tax," IMF's Georgieva said.However, leaders fell short of concrete announcements on the creation of a carbon tax or shipping levy, agreeing only to launch a "task force to examine possible new financial resources through taxation", according to the meeting's summary."A discussion about carbon tax is a must-have," Kenya's Ruto echoed, calling on all countries to pay an equitable amount. Otherwise, "the conversation over who has not paid [becomes] energy-sapping", Ruto said.In conversation with EURACTIV, European Jacques Delors' Director General Geneviève Pons called for a $100 per tonne of CO2, which could bring up to $200 billion in additional international public resources.Regarding shipping, a list of 23 countries from across Africa, the Caribbean and Europe supported "the adoption of the principle of a levy on the greenhouse gas emissions of [the maritime] sector", according to the summary.Link to ImageGlobal Financing Pact: Macron's diplomatic tour de forceThe Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris on Thursday and Friday (22-23 June) could strengthen France's "green diplomacy" and position President Emmanuel Macron as a key player when it comes to financing international development aid.Country-specific advancesAmid international pledges were also some country-specific advances.Senegal, supported by the 'International Partners Group' - including France, Germany, the EU, the UK and Canada - launched a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) to further its renewables capacities to 40% by 2030, with an extra (EURO)2.5 billion in financing.JETPs, first announced at COP 26 in Glasgow, are new financing tools to help emerging economies that are heavily-coal-dependent emerging economies phase out the fossil fuel's use.Moreover, the US and China managed to strike a deal to restructure Zambia's debt, which amounts to $6.3 billion and is mostly owned by Beijing.

State administrations are accused of failing to take decisive action to reduce climate change, which the plaintiffs argue is a violation of their fundamental rights.The court in the French city of Strasbourg is due to hear three cases involving more than 30 countries. It is the first time the European body has been asked to consider whether inadequate climate change policies could constitute an infringement of the European Convention on Human Rights.The first case, which begins arguments on Wednesday morning, was brought by a collective of Swiss women aged over 75 who say that global warming has damaged their health, especially during the heatwaves that are becoming more severe and more frequent across Europe.By failing to take the measures necessary to cut carbon emissions in line with international targets, they contend, Switzerland has failed to meet its obligations to protect their right to life.France is also in the dock.
Politicians must support EU Nature Restoration Law for future generations [17]
  Instance 1: These costs will translate into increased pressure on businesses, potential job losses and a deterioration in the quality of life of all EU citizens.Worsening climate change and the loss of biodiversity resulting from the lack of supporting ambitious and solid policies, such as the Nature Restoration Law, will cause additional costs to our economy and will therefore weigh on our workers.The youth movement has been arguing that the climate emergency, nature conservation and food security are intrinsically linked issues.The MEPs, if they decide to oppose the restoration of nature, are not fighting to protect consumers from high prices. Nor are they fighting to defend the interests of farmers. And they're certainly not fighting for our future.Rather, their opposition is aimed at maintaining a destructive system that allows industrialists to enrich themselves at the expense of citizens and farmers.The rejection of the Nature Restoration Law would also put in question the EU's position as a global leader of sustainability transition.Just a few months ago we pushed for ambitious goals in Montreal, where most of the world's countries agreed to protect at least 30% of all ecosystems by 2030.If less developed countries will see the EU giving up on its ambitions it will probably lower their motivation to contribute to the common effort.Signatories: •Chloé Mikolajczak, climate justice activist (Belgium)•Adélaïde Charlier, climate justice activist (Youth For Climate Belgium)•Camille Étienne, climate justice activist (France)•Luisa Neubauer, climate justice activist (FFF Germany)•Laurie Pazienza, climate justice activist (Belgium)•Lucie Morauw, climate &amp; human right activist (Belgium)•Dominika Lasota, climate justice activist (FFF Poland)•Pablo Flye, climate activist (FFF France)•Alice Dubois, climate avtivist (FFF France)•Matisse de Rivières, climate justice activist (France)•Mila Sirychenko, climate justice activist and MA in Environmental Science and Policy (FFF Ukraine)•Ronja Hofmann, climate justice activist (FFF Germany)•Tobias Schied, young farmer, climate activist (FFF Germany)•Sommer Ackerman (FFF Finland)•Martina Comparelli, climate justice activist (FFF Italy)•Falco Weichselbaum, meteorologist and climate justice activist (Germany)•Valentine Hendrix, climate justice activiste (Youth for Climate Belgium)•Szmo Kacprzak, climate activist (Mlodziezowy Strajk Klimatyczny / FFF Poland)•Daniel Shams, climate justice activist Fridays For Future Austria•Arthur Villers, climate justice activist (Youth for Climate Belgium)•Valerie Peer (Fridays for Future Austria)•Jonathan Auer (FFF Germany)•Helena Mathis (FFF Austria)•Samuel Egger (XR Austria)•Giacomo Zattini, climate justice activist (FFF Italy)•Gerrit Osabal (Fridays for Future Austria)•Laila Kriechbaum (Fridays For Future Austria)•Magdalena Sedlmayr, climate justice activist (FFF Ireland)•Marceline Raineri, climate justice activist (FFF France)EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionenergyenvironmentopinionpoliticiansmustsupporteunaturerestorationlawforfuturegenerationsEURCOM2023urn:contentItem:68NH-JWB1-JCMC-W214-00000-003981612023-07-10Copyright 2023 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

In 2022, he officially moved on from his work as a barber and began working full time as a climate justice organizer with the environmental nonprofit Healthy Gulf. But much work remains for Lincoln Beach to thrive again. That includes resolving how to redevelop the recreation area.
Cop28 Climate summit - Mary Robinson urges politicians to make science a force of nature [3]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:69TY-VFX1-F11P-X4NN-00000-00Cop28 Climate summit - Mary Robinson urges politicians to make science a force of nature2023-12-09T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:24ZLexisNexisCop28 Climate summit - Mary Robinson urges politicians to make science a force of natureAmanda MorrowAs the UN warns that trillions of dollars are being poured into activities that directly harm nature, prominent climate advocate Mary Robinson has called on governments to take science more seriously amid efforts to bring about nature-based solutions to the climate crisis.The former Irish president was speaking in Dubai at the Cop28 climate summit during its themed "nature day" on Saturday, 9 December.The UN Enviroment Programme chose the day to sound the alarm that investment in activities that promote a stable climate and healthy land was at least 30 times lower than investment in projects that are detrimental to nature.Robinson – co-chair of the Elders group of former world leaders established by Nelson Mandela – said expertise on nature needed to be taken far more seriously by those in power."The Governments that did well in Covid listened to their chief medical officers … and took the tough decisions from the beginning," Robinson told a side event at Cop28."When I was president of Ireland from 1990-1997 I didn't make any speeches about climate. It was not an issue in Ireland at that time."Carbon capture a 'dangerous excuse' for burning more fossil fuelsClimate justiceRobinson said it was only when she later became the UN's high commissioner for human rights did she understand the seriousness of the climate crisis – but she still wasn't clear on how it impacted her own work at the time."Another part of the UN was dealing with it [the issue of climate] and frankly I missed how important it was for my portfolio of human rights, gender equality rights of indigenous peoples and rights of people with a disability," Robinson said."It was when I started working in African countries in 2003, 2004 and 2005 – with a very small NGO – that I saw through the lens of human rights the impact of climate."And that brought me to climate justice – not climate change, but climate justice."Feud over 'loss and damages' fund risks derailing climate talksAdaptation dealRobinson is among a chorus of voices at Cop28 pushing for a strong global goal on adaptation (GGA). The idea was established under the Paris Agreement in 2015 but has not yet been properly defined.Unlike the 1.5°C temperature limit, it's less clear what an adaptation target would look like.The GGA is being discussed as part of the summit's flagship global stocktake assessment, but progress has been slow on a fair and equitable finance agreement for climate adaptation."We're nowhere near where we should be on finance," Robinson warned."Money is going towards subsidising what's harming us ... rather than getting us back to a harmonious relationship with nature."This too, she added, was a question of science."That's why we need a global adaptation target … because countries do not have the science."Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.

A prophetic challenge to rich nations, a call for climate justice [5]

And my daughters used it on a banner they made for me.For many of those who gathered in Glasgow for the UN Climate Change Conference, COP26 was a cathartic experience. There was a sense of having done something.Done something in solidarity with an amazingly diverse group of people -- of all ages, genders, religious affiliations (and none), nationalities -- although everyone was conscious of the missing presence of many from the Global South.In Glasgow I encountered many, many people who were seeking to live Gospel values - love of neighbour, especially the poor and marginalised, and love of Mother Earth.
  Instance 2: They are that "new people for a new world" that the late Bishop Pedro Cassaldáliga, the Spanish Claretian Missionary to Brazil, spoke of. They are a manifestation of hope.The Opening Ceremony was blessed by a moment of hope through the contribution of Elizabeth Wathuti from Kenya who described the reality of climate related starvation and asked if we had the "grace to fully listen" and the capacity to open our hearts and then act.It was a call to conversion. The Youth March was another manifestation of hope - the young people's passion, creativity, knowledge, demands - all lifted your heart, and tears flowed as you sensed a new future may be possible if we would be daring enough and free ourselves from the economic and political structures that have led us to this climate emergency.It was inspiring to see primary school children proudly affirming key aspects of the Scottish curriculum - they are responsible citizensand that is why they are on the streets.Talking to them you realised the knowledge they had of the situation and of the changes needed to ensure climate justice for all.Their chant -- "What do we want? Climate Justice! When do we want it?

Climate Justice! When do we want it? Now!" -- articulated so well their sense of urgency.But sadly the "adults" at the "big table" did not seem to have that sense of urgency and it made you wonder what would the Gospel look like if COP26 had to sign off on it?
  Instance 4: Through the “Homestay Network’ they opened their homes to climate activists from around the world. Marchers at COP26 boldly proclaimed the chant that will resonate through the streets of Glasgow for several years:  “Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here!” That chant echoed through the Pollokshields area of Glasgow last May when a Home Office deportation raid in Kenmure Street was met with a sea of solidarity, which eventually led to the release of two men who had been detained in a police van.All of Scotland, like Glasgow, has a proud history of welcoming refugees and asylum seekers. It rejects the attempt to create a "hostile environment" for our sisters and brothers who want to live their life in our country.Climate justice is a Gospel imperative. And we are called to stand in solidarity with all those whose values and actions are in harmony with the dream and mission of Jesus by becoming a new people for a new world. Rab Burnett is a Laudato si' animator in Glasgow and an adviser for "Care of Creation Office"of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland.

  Instance 2: This will ignite the much-needed action and foster empathy among communities. By incorporating art and activism, educators and institutions are making the necessary changes to help people recognize the environmental injustices that exist around the globe. This way, they are not only raising awareness but also empowering people to bring meaningful and lasting change.This article covers how art is not just an expression of personal thoughts and ideas, but when combined with activism, serves as a vital tool in climate justice education.Understanding Climate JusticeBefore we cover how art and activism can help spread awareness and impact climate injustices around the world, let's understand what climate justice is.Apart from the core of the issue, climate justice goes beyond the environmental concerns of the communities at the brink of collapse. It grapples with the uneven burden of climate change on certain populations, such as those in the Global South or states at the periphery of the modern economic world.Climate justice calls for fair treatment in environmental policies and promotes community-driven solutions to address disparities in the face of global warming. Across academic settings, the concept is intertwined with the curricula where art serves as the perfect medium for conveying intricate issues.The Role of Art in Climate Justice EducationIf we take art out of the activism in the climate justice education, it is left with boring statistics with nameless people and localities whose names are too hard to pronounce.

Here are some examples of how artistic interventions can only result in more fuel for the cause.Many artists of color have harnessed the power of creativity to have their voices heard in climate narratives. They have built a community based on empathy and connection using art.Some are now experimenting with  AI writing tools like ChatGPT to help translate their artistic visions into grant proposals, artist statements, and educational materials that reach wider audiences.Youth organizers are not left behind in the cause, as many have reared advocates in the space by providing a platform to discuss the problems and come up with solutions.Instead of using mere stats and facts, events feature musicals, storytelling, and first-personal dramatized accounts to build a narrative for ecological struggles.Art in Educational ProgramsApart from the casual artists and organizations, educational institutions are embracing art to catalyze climate action among youth.
  Instance 6: The pieces motivate viewers to act today to save tomorrow.Integrating Activism in EducationWhen you need to bridge the gap between theory and practice of art, activism comes into play. It encourages learners to tackle the real-world inequalities with organization and exhibitions, from stories of horror to tales of resilience and solidarity.Activist Approaches and PartnershipsStarting with visual activism, it hooks students with real-world applications that result in changemakers. On top of that, climate movements provide internal learning opportunities where participants can deepen their knowledge through connecting with peers as well as hands-on advocacy.The activist approach is more about seeing climate justice as it is, rather than as a pathway for communities to confront injustices head-on. Partnerships in this space are crucial for equity and ownership.Supporting Research and ScholarshipEducational strategies, when combined with art and activism, get a further boost through research and creative scholarship. Here is how it all comes together:Scholars widely employ art, literature, and policy to show the world that climate change and injustice are than just fancy terms.

Art and artistic research are vital in this context not just because they can help to imagine other ways of being in the world, but because they can foster meaningful dialogue and collaborative practices across disiplinary, geographical, and cultural borders.

The relative role of private actors in climate policy, governance and accountability mechanisms is expanding rapidly. As it has become increasingly clear that implementation of climate policy is falling far short of meeting the Paris Agreement goals, civil society has prevailed on the private sector to adopt climate commitments and engage in private climate governance.
  Instance 3: And states are using public law and policy to enhance and support private climate governance through green procurement policies, mandatory sustainability or climate disclosure requirements, and similar policies. And, as the impacts of climate change manifest with devastating regularity, in parallel to discussions between states about compensation for loss and damage, efforts to directly impose accountability on private climate actors are proliferating. Most notably, plaintiffs are suing corporate entities directly for climate damages.Private climate governance and efforts to impose corporate climate accountability have the potential to obscure, erase, and even undermine public commitments to common but differentiated responsibilities and North-South climate justice. This article critically examines one aspect of private climate accountability by using a North-South climate justice lens to evaluate efforts to obtain compensation (court-ordered damages) for climate harms directly from private actors, in particular United States of America (US) carbon majors, alleged to have contributed to climate change (climate damage cases). The article begins by providing background information about global climate change litigation and the US climate damage cases.

  Instance 5: It then explains why suits seeking climate damages brought by plaintiffs from the Global South, including India, could be less likely to result in the award of enforceable damages against an important subset of particularly culpable and well-resourced defendants, US fossil fuel companies. The application of the doctrines of forum non conveniens and judgment recognition and enforcement by federal courts reticent to disturb the climate policy prerogative of the political branches stand as potential obstacles to recovery for Global South climate plaintiffs.

It hangs suspended from the ceiling with the point of the tipi cone facing the floor. The accompanying placard provides the following context:Cannupa Hanska Luger proposes: “This installation is not inverted .
  Instance 6: While the differentiated nature of responsibilities remains contested, countries have accepted the core precepts of common but differentiated responsibilities in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, which find a place in the preamble: ‘[T]he largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries, that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs.’ Article 3, paragraph 1 then provides:The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Accordingly, the developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof.2In 2015, the world transitioned, in the Paris Agreement, to a bottom-up approach to international climate action, wherein countries set their own commitments through the submission of Nationally Determined Contributions and those commitments are subject to international scrutiny.3 The Paris Agreement reiterated that the concept of common but differentiated responsibilities lies at the centre of evaluating the relative sufficiency of state climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. It exhorts that developed country Parties ‘should continue taking the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets,’ while ‘[d]eveloping country Parties should continue enhancing their mitigation efforts, and are encouraged to move over time towards economy-wide emission reduction or limitation targets in the light of different national circumstances’ and repeatedly describes higher expectations for developed country Parties (including explicitly recognising that peaking of greenhouse gas emissions ‘will take longer for developing country Parties’).4 The Nationally Determined Contributions are meant to reflect a Party’s ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.’5The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as conceptualised on a North–South axis6 with respect to state responsibility is one aspect of climate justice.7 Commitments to climate justice more broadly—both domestically and viewed internationally through a North–South lens—anchor the development of climate policy, serving as a widely accepted normative imperative.8 ‘[C]limate justice fundamentally is about paying attention to how climate change impacts people differently, unevenly, and disproportionately, as well as redressing the resultant injustices in fair and equitable ways.’9 And, in a North–South context, uneven climate impacts can be traced in large part to colonial and post-colonial history and international economic systems:[E]nvironmental justice has important North–South dimensions. North–South environmental inequities manifest themselves in the form of distributive, procedural, corrective, and social injustice. The North–South divide is grounded in distributive injustice because the North reaps the economic benefits of natural resource exploitation with little concern for the environmental consequences.
  Instance 7: The views of Southern countries are frequently marginalized. North–South relations are marred by corrective injustice because Southern nations (such as the small island developing states facing the imminent loss of their territories due to climate change) have generally been unable to obtain compensation for the North’s prodigious contribution to global environmental degradation or cessation of the offending conduct. Finally, North–South environmental conflicts are reflective of social injustice because they are inextricably intertwined with colonial and post-colonial economic policies that impoverished the global South and facilitated the North’s appropriation of its natural resources.10Operationalisation of common but differentiated responsibilities and North–South climate justice in public climate law takes myriad forms, ranging from the international climate treaty regime’s demand for developed country leadership and funding, to informing immigration policy.11 While the precise instantiation of these commitments is subject to widely diverging interpretations and significant debate, the core commitments are foundational to public climate policy. Yet, increasingly, climate policy is being implemented through or supplemented by private entities and actors; private climate governance is now recognised as a distinct and important component of the global response to climate change.12 ‘[T]here is a clear trend away from purely intergovernmental policy-making and towards a governance system that incorporates public and private actors at all levels into norm setting, policy-making and norm implementation.’13 It is unclear whether and how commitments to common but differentiated responsibilities and North–South climate justice apply and translate outside of the context of public policy implemented by government actors. Transnational climate governance by non-state actors can be understood to ‘exist as a complement to the multilateral climate change regime’ and thus ‘may be expected to adhere to the main principles and ideas governing the multilateral climate change regime, including the notion that developed countries should lead the efforts in combating climate hanged based on their stronger financial capabilities and their higher level of historical responsibility towards climate change.’14 This raises a fundamental question: How does elevating the importance of private actors in climate policy affect commitments to common but differentiated responsibilities and/or North–South climate justice?Understanding how pursuing public climate goals through private processes and actors affects normative commitments to and substantive achievement of North–South climate justice is urgent.

  Instance 10: This loss to the African economy would be three times the amount of the development cooperation budget that the EU committed to Africa in 2021. This raises a novel question in this new era in which corporate purpose is determined beyond jurisdictional borders: Which country’s (or countries’) purpose is served when the corporate purpose of companies is shaped extraterritorially?19And, as the impacts of climate change manifest with devastating regularity, in parallel to discussions between states about compensation for loss and damage,20 efforts to directly impose accountability on private climate actors are proliferating. Most notably, plaintiffs are suing corporate entities directly for climate damages.21Private climate governance and efforts to impose corporate climate accountability have the potential to obscure, erase, and even undermine public commitments to common but differentiated responsibilities and North–South climate justice. The voluntary Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) provides one example.22 The SBTi issues standards that set corporate climate targets based either on a company reducing its emissions at the same rate as the global reduction target (the absolute contraction approach) or meeting decarbonisation goals for a specific industry (the sectorial decarbonisation approach) that SBTi determines is consistent with reductions required to meet the Paris Agreement goals.23 Companies can voluntarily commit to an SBTi target and then show that their conduct is in accordance with the Paris Agreement temperature goals. Importantly, although the SBTi is anchored in consistency with the Paris Agreement and externally marketed as such, the standards and targets that it sets for companies make no meaningful effort to factor in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, which in this context would mean that we should expect companies in the Global North to reduce their emissions and decarbonise more and faster than companies in the Global South.As summarised by one scholar, the absolute contraction approach to setting standards ‘is essentially the equal emissions reduction approach that the Paris Agreement rejected as inconsistent with CBDR [Common But Differentiated Responsibilities]’ and, under the sectoral decarbonisation approach, ‘an electric utility in the U.S.
  Instance 11: SBTi has enormous influence, covering (as of late 2022) companies with one-third of global market capitalisation, and it is poised to be incorporated into public law—the Biden Administration issued a proposed rule that would require the use of SBTi by federal contractors.25SBTi is but one example of a growing trend. There are voluntary corporate climate standards, reporting or disclosure requirements of many types, and calls to harmonise these standards across jurisdictions. These are also hardening in many places into public law requirements and being applied extraterritorially to companies in the Global South.26 If, like SBTi, these mechanisms apply the same metrics to companies from the Global North and South, it risks undermining North–South climate justice and eroding the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in the implementation of climate policy.This article critically examines another aspect of private climate accountability by using a North–South climate justice lens to evaluate efforts to obtain compensation (court-ordered damages) for climate harms directly from private actors, in particular United States (US) carbon majors, alleged to have contributed to climate change (climate damage cases).27 The analysis suggests that this mechanism for imposing private climate accountability could result in an uncomfortable exacerbation of North–South climate injustice. Namely, climate plaintiffs in the Global North may be better positioned to recoup damages from US carbon majors than climate plaintiffs in the Global South, with the practical result that ExxonMobil could be forced to pay for seawalls to protect homes in Marin County but not protect the homes of the 36 million people in India who are expected to endure regular coastal flooding by 2050.28 Given the fact that the Global South’s carbon emissions and wealth are dwarfed by those of the North while it suffers the greatest climate harms, North–South climate justice already resembles Luger’s upside-down world.This article posits that the increasing emphasis on private climate governance risks exacerbating an already unjust situation because a foundational principle of climate justice and core public policy commitment—CBDR—does not directly apply and often fails to find expression in the context of private climate governance. The article uses the example of the differential in potential damages recovery against private carbon majors by climate plaintiffs in the Global South and Global North.

The article uses the example of the differential in potential damages recovery against private carbon majors by climate plaintiffs in the Global South and Global North. Global South claimants are arguably far more vulnerable to climate harm and deserving of recompense than their US counterparts, yet they face significant additional burdens in gaining access to US courts and enforcement mechanisms.The article begins by providing background information about global climate change litigation and the US climate damage cases.
  Instance 13: It then explains why suits seeking climate damages brought by plaintiffs from the Global South, including India, could be less likely to result in the award of enforceable damages against an important subset of particularly culpable and well-resourced defendants, US fossil fuel companies.

Asymmetrical recovery by climate damage plaintiffs in the Global North would invert North–South climate justice, but this outcome can be avoided.Global climate change litigation and the US climate damage casesGlobal climate change litigationClimate litigation—‘cases before judicial and quasi-judicial bodies that involve material issues of climate change science, policy or law’— has proliferated globally with over 2000 cases filed in 65 jurisdictions as of December 2022.29 Climate suits are far more numerous in the Global North, and particularly in the US, but climate litigation is now a global phenomenon with a growing number of cases brought in the Global South. As of December 2022, there were 1,522 cases filed in the US and 658 in all other jurisdictions.

As of December 2022, there were 1,522 cases filed in the US and 658 in all other jurisdictions. ‘If considering the cases in the United States of America, cases in the Global North represent 89 per cent of the of the total number of climate litigation cases.
  Instance 15: Even fossil fuels exclusively American in provenance, distribution, and use—in that they were extracted, sold, and combusted solely within the US—exacerbated climate change and harm from climate change worldwide. Moreover, many of the defendants engaged in the same or similar conduct in myriad non-US jurisdictions, including in the Global South, through the extraction, refinement, and sale of fossil fuels in those non-US jurisdictions, and the conduct and impact of the sprawling climate disinformation campaign likewise crossed borders.Based solely on a consideration of the conduct and harm and viewed through a corrective justice lens, non-US climate plaintiffs would seem to be as deserving of compensation as US plaintiffs. Coupled with considerations of North–South climate justice and distributive justice, non-US plaintiffs from the Global South would seem to be far more deserving of compensation. However, for the reasons described below, the ability of climate plaintiffs in the Global South to collect meaningful damages from US fossil fuel companies will be largely dependent on the treatment of their claims by US courts. And, for a variety of reasons, it may be difficult for a plaintiff in the Global South to obtain damages for climate harms from US corporate climate defendants, perhaps more so than for a plaintiff in the US.Gatekeeping by US courtsThe US courts’ gatekeeping control over the ability of Global South climate plaintiffs to obtain damages from US corporate climate defendants results from a complex interplay of history (in part colonial) and economic and political systems; the geographic distribution of key fossil fuel defendants’ assets; and the interstices of legal (primarily procedural) doctrines that determine when foreign plaintiffs can bring their claims in US courts and when judgments obtained outside of the US can be enforced by US courts.
  Instance 16: ..We therefore agree with the district court that any federal common law claim against the Producers that is not displaced by the Clean Air Act nonetheless still fails under the reasoning supplied by Kiobel and Jesner and the need for judicial caution in the face of delicate foreign policy considerations.79To summarise, Global South plaintiffs would likely end up in federal court; federal courts have demonstrated marked reticence to involve the federal judiciary in climate controversies that they view as having significant implications for federal and global climate policy; and the doctrines that federal courts would apply to determine whether Global South climate plaintiffs can obtain recourse through the US court system and provide plausible doctrinal reasons for federal courts to avoid hearing the claims of or enforcing judgments obtained by plaintiffs from the Global South. It is legally possible for Global South plaintiffs to sue and obtain damage judgments against US fossil fuel defendants. But, as compared to US climate damage plaintiffs, plaintiffs from the Global South face significant practical and procedural headwinds, which should raise concerns about the North–South justice implications of corporate climate accountability.Climate justice deficitsApplication of the current doctrines that govern hearing foreign claims and enforcing foreign judgments in US courts could lead to a result that would offend North–South climate justice: Asymmetrical climate damage recovery where US climate plaintiffs obtain compensation for their climate harms from US carbon majors while plaintiffs from the Global South cannot. This outcome would be substantively and highly unjust—an inversion of North–South climate justice. Residents of the US, already overall better equipped to adapt through geographic accident and economic development fuelled in part by high emissions and a fossil fuel economy, would sequester even more adaptive resources, gilding the lily of an already enhanced adaptive capacity.

An even greater North-favouring asymmetry could be imagined: Some have proposed that US plaintiffs sue emitters in India.80While North-favouring asymmetrical climate damage recovery is a real possibility/risk, there are some reasons to think that it is unlikely to manifest.
  Instance 18: An even greater North-favouring asymmetry could be imagined: Some have proposed that US plaintiffs sue emitters in India.80While North-favouring asymmetrical climate damage recovery is a real possibility/risk, there are some reasons to think that it is unlikely to manifest. First, the cases brought by US plaintiffs against the US carbon majors may fail. In that case, the inability of Global South plaintiffs to obtain damages is, while still unjust, not such a stark inversion of North–South climate justice. Strong arguments can be made that the US fossil fuel companies’ wrongdoing—from a corrective justice perspective—is even more pronounced with respect to Global South plaintiffs. The fossil fuel companies were well aware that the impacts of climate change would manifest first and most severely in the Global South.Second, there could, at least theoretically, be an asymmetrical recovery in the opposite direction—there are paths through which Global South climate damage plaintiffs might succeed in obtaining climate damages from US carbon majors even where US plaintiffs cannot.
  Instance 19: For this to occur, either a US court would have to apply the law of a Global South country to order an industry-altering damage judgment against a US carbon major or a US court would have to enforce an industry-altering damage judgment produced by a court in the Global South against a US carbon major—against the backdrop of US plaintiffs being unable to obtain damages. Even if the judiciary would do so (and recall the various ‘outs’—the forum non conveniens and judgment enforcement doctrines), US fossil fuel defendants could still lobby Congress seeking legislative liability protection—i.e., a law immunising them from damage claims. The fossil fuel industry has often lobbied for such liability protection, often in the context of negotiations over the adoption of climate law.Climate damage plaintiffs from the Global South could also sue or seek to enforce a judgment obtained in their home jurisdiction against US climate defendants in other jurisdictions, in particular jurisdictions where the US climate defendants (or a subsidiary) have significant assets.86 And some US climate defendants will have some assets in Global South jurisdictions that could support the enforcement of a judgment.However, even if the inversion of North–South climate justice in the form of asymmetrical North-favouring recovery does not in fact manifest, recognising the possibility and risk that the existing legal system allows (if not invites) this result highlights the extent to which achieving North–South climate justice requires affirmative work to recognise and correct underlying systems that perpetuate North–South injustice. Once we recognise the systemic contribution to injustice, we can also see ways to correct it.In the present context, the easiest correction may simply be to equip advocates to frame arguments that persuade judges in the US to be mindful of the implications for justice when evaluating climate damage claims brought by Global South plaintiffs. For example, a court resolving a motion to dismiss a climate damage claim brought by a Global South plaintiff on the grounds of forum non conveniens could impose (a) condition(s) on the dismissal, for example condition dismissal on the defendant's consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a foreign court and/or on the defendant's agreement to satisfy any foreign judgment entered against it.87 Indeed, some circuits might require that a court ‘impose conditions if there is a justifiable reason to doubt that a party will cooperate with the foreign forum.’88 In Carijano v Occidental Petroleum Corporation, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a district court abused its discretion by dismissing a claim brought by Peruvian plaintiffs and an American non-governmental organization for forum non conveniens without imposing as a condition that Occidental would satisfy a Peruvian judgment, observing that ‘[w]hen there is reason to think that enforcing a judgment in a foreign country would be problematic, courts have required assurances that a defendant will satisfy any judgment as a condition to a forum non conveniens dismissal.’89Additionally, as jurisdictions contemplate adopting climate compensation legislation,90 they should be mindful about structuring such legislation to avoid North-favouring asymmetrical recovery.

(Jurisdictions might even consider honouring North–South climate justice by adopting rules that produce South-favouring asymmetrical recovery.) While this article focuses on damage remedies, significant North–South justice issues may attend requests for injunctive relief as well. As explained eloquently by Kim Bouwer,it is not clear that seeking to shut down fossil fuel operations—a significant source of revenue for African countries—is necessarily consistent with climate justice. This reflects a universalizing perception of what is required in the climate response, which is not necessarily consistent with the contribution that is required by African states.91ConclusionIn late June of 2021, a climate change-fuelled heat wave hit the Pacific Northwest.
  Instance 21: For example, a court resolving a motion to dismiss a climate damage claim brought by a Global South plaintiff on the grounds of forum non conveniens could impose (a) condition(s) on the dismissal, for example condition dismissal on the defendant's consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a foreign court and/or on the defendant's agreement to satisfy any foreign judgment entered against it.87 Indeed, some circuits might require that a court ‘impose conditions if there is a justifiable reason to doubt that a party will cooperate with the foreign forum.’88 In Carijano v Occidental Petroleum Corporation, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a district court abused its discretion by dismissing a claim brought by Peruvian plaintiffs and an American non-governmental organization for forum non conveniens without imposing as a condition that Occidental would satisfy a Peruvian judgment, observing that ‘[w]hen there is reason to think that enforcing a judgment in a foreign country would be problematic, courts have required assurances that a defendant will satisfy any judgment as a condition to a forum non conveniens dismissal.’89Additionally, as jurisdictions contemplate adopting climate compensation legislation,90 they should be mindful about structuring such legislation to avoid North-favouring asymmetrical recovery.

This reflects a universalizing perception of what is required in the climate response, which is not necessarily consistent with the contribution that is required by African states.91ConclusionIn late June of 2021, a climate change-fuelled heat wave hit the Pacific Northwest. For several days, temperatures broke records, in many places exceeding a prior high-temperature records by 5°C.92 In Multnomah County, Oregon (US), 69 people died from hypothermia and deaths from all causes doubled.93 In 2023, Multnomah County sued select fossil fuel companies, including US carbon majors ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Conoco Phillips, seeking $1.55 billion in climate change damages for ‘the costs of actions Multnomah County has already taken, expenditures made, and losses incurred to protect the public health, safety, and property of the County and its residents from extreme heat weather events and wildfire smoke’94 and $50 billion for an abatement fund to provide ‘resources necessary to adequately prepare the County and its citizens for a new normal—heat domes, blocking events, periods of high heat and/or wildfire so severe that they kill and sicken inhabitants, destroy property, and weaken—sometimes cripple—critical infrastructure’ including:renovating buildings to withstand extreme heat, fitting cooling units into buildings, providing cooling units in the community, providing additional cooling shelters for heat emergencies, installing air filtration systems, planting of greenspaces to reduce the temperature in heat islands, reroofing buildings with materials that better manage heat, repave roads and fortify bridges.95Climate change-fuelled heatwaves hit communities in India with regularity.
  Instance 22: In 2013, Ahmedabad engaged in an extensive process, working with an international partnership, to prepare India’s first heat action plan. The heat action plan prioritises low-cost preparations for extreme heat, including community education, early warning systems, and enhancements to health care capacity.99 Ahmedabad regularly updates the plan, and studies suggest that it has effectively reduced heat deaths.100 But advocates fear that more involved measures, including changes to Ahmedabad’s built environment, may be necessary as temperatures continue to rise.101 Developing heat action plans and other interventions to deal with heatwaves across India will require significant resources.Yet, Ahmedabad has not sued the US carbon majors, and likely has to persuade US courts either that US courts are a suitable forum to entertain Ahmedabad’s claims or that US courts should enforce a judgment that Ahmedabad obtains in India. This sits uncomfortably next to the facts and principles that animate North–South climate justice. India has contributed far less to climate change than the US and benefited far less from fossil fuel capitalism. By accident of geographic fate, it will experience more and earlier severe climate impacts.

Justice is also slow and sudden, as the verdict freeing Peter Sullivan, who spent 38 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, makes clear. Climate justice for those injured by polluters has the same rhythm. What do I mean?A major case against RWE, Germany-s power giant is reaching its conclusion. Almost a decade ago Saul Luciano Lliuya, a farmer and mountain guide from Peru, took RWE to court in the Andean city of Huaraz.READ MORE: Gillian Martin: We must stop thinking Scotland's safe from climate disasterLuciano Lliuya and the people of Huaraz face a life-threatening flood risk.
  Instance 3: Those hearings took place in March. The Appeal Court is now scheduled to rule on May 28. Thus, next week, will see gradual then (hopefully?) sudden climate justice.Let-s be clear. It is still probable the court will back away from finding RWE financially liable for the risk Luciano Lliuya and his neighbours face.But the broader directional shift in climate justice is visible, not just for RWE, but also for other companies, such as Shell, BP, and British Gas. The courts cannot overlook climate reality in favour of short-term commercial considerations for much longer.

In the US last year, Montana-s Supreme Court upheld a landmark climate ruling that found the state was violating residents- constitutional right to a clean environment by permitting oil, gas and coal projects without regard for global warming.The case, thought unwinnable by many, was a huge victory for the young people behind it and a shocking rebuke to the powerful Montana coal barons.As climate risks and costs rise, fossil fuel companies and their boards will find legal liabilities and commercial risks increasing. New research in the journal Nature makes this clear.
  Instance 6: The same research estimated BP pollution caused losses of $1.5tn.Like Mike, in Hemmingway-s tale, the end of fossil fuel companies denying climate reality will be gradual, then sudden. Trillions of dollars in stranded assets will be seen. Vast quantities of oil and gas will be left in the ground - as they must be if climate crises are to be averted.For the sake of all our futures, we should support these legal cases.As global CO2 levels reach 429ppm, a number last recorded between 14-16 million years ago, and temperatures exceed 1.5C above pre-industrial times, we need to reach a climate justice breakpoint before the planet hits climate tipping points of no return.Stuart PM Mackintosh is author of Climate Crisis Economics: A Race Of Tipping PointsTHENTL-25172407THENTL2025urn:contentItem:6FV8-RPT3-RRPT-X15M-00000-004373792025-07-04Copyright 2025 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights ReservedThe National (Scotland)May 19, 2025 MondayNewspaperWeb-based PublicationsENGLISHCC0001Y4ERWE AGCC000C55JBRITISH GASNAICS221310 WATER SUPPLY &amp; IRRIGATION SYSTEMSNAICS221121 ELECTRIC BULK POWER TRANSMISSION &amp; CONTROLNAICS221210 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTIONRWE (FRA)Civil Rights LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Protected RightsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYSTX001883DECISIONS &amp; RULINGSST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTX000735FLOODS &amp; FLOODINGSTX001021GLACIERS &amp; ICEBERGSST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSST000DRDXNEGATIVE MISC NEWSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX000104APPEALSST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX001040LITIGATIONN922110GJAPPEALS COURTSSTX000166INSOLVENCY &amp; BANKRUPTCYN922110GQINSOLVENCY &amp; BANKRUPTCY COURTSSTX000105APPELLATE DECISIONSST000DNUOCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICYSTX001932CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONSSTX001941ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION &amp; POLICYST0008XMRLAW &amp; LEGAL SYSTEMN922110CCLAW COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALSST000DEUISEVERE WEATHERSTX000631ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERSSTX000659EVIDENCESTX000734FLOOD INSURANCESTX001906FLOOD ZONESSTX001035LAKESSTX001796VERDICTSSTX001348POLLUTIONST000DN4KPRELIMINARY COURT PROCEEDINGSSTX001648SUITS &amp; CLAIMSST0009ZVDSUPREME COURTSSTX000900TSUNAMISST000A4J3JAIL SENTENCINGSTX001385AVALANCHESN921000CCGOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICESST0009RTQMOUNTAINSSTX001240OIL &amp; GAS INDUSTRYSTX000734FLOOD INSURANCESTX001906FLOOD ZONESN510000CCMEDIA &amp; TELECOMMUNICATIONSGC353PERUGC676SCOTLANDGC343UNITED STATESGC318GERMANYGC322NETHERLANDSGT115EUROPE

FoE highlighted strong public backing for climate justice and fair energy policies among the 2,097 adults surveyed across Great Britain from 26 to 27 June, 2025.The findings also show broad backing for measures aimed at strengthening British industry, the environmental group said.

UK renewable energy transition                   FoE said the results show that “recent moves to fracture the political consensus on the climate do not reflect the public mood” in the UK.It comes after Reform UK, which is leading opinion polls, promised to scrap support for renewable energy projects  and oppose infrastructure such as pylons and solar farms. FoE head of science, policy and research Mike Childs said the polling shows that “transformative climate policies remain popular with voters of all stripes”.“Britain’s a global leader when it comes to offshore wind, but we still hold enormous untapped potential,” Childs said.“Taking full advantage of our homegrown renewable resources can guarantee our energy security, bring bills down and even position the UK as a leading manufacturing power.“If we’re to secure these benefits and lock the UK into a more prosperous future, then it’s vital the government’s climate plan, due in October, is both bold and fair.”The poll comes as the UK government prepares to publish a new climate action plan in October, following asuccessful legal challenge by FoE and other groups over the adequacy of the previous Conservative government’s strategy.

This historic ruling sets a precedent for other governments to be held accountable for their climate measures.Jayesh/DigitalVision Vectors/Getty.This case is the first of its kind in Asia, and the complainants included children and young people. The part of the ‘Carbon Neutrality Act’ (the Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth for Climate Crisis Response; hereafter, the Act) that was declared unconstitutional is Article 8.1, the part that set national targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.The court ruled that Article 8.1 failed to uphold constitutional environmental rights by omitting quantitative reduction targets for 2031–2049.
  Instance 3: Without legally mandated interim goals, future governments might prioritize short-term economic or political interests over long-term climate objectives. This omission risks leaving future generations disproportionately burdened by the escalating consequences of climate inaction. The court underscored the constitutional imperative to provide adequate environmental protections for current and future citizens, and emphasized the principle of intergenerational equity as central to climate justice.The principle of statutory reservation requires that essential matters that affect fundamental rights are explicitly legislated rather than delegated to subordinate regulations. The court ruled that climate targets of the nature included in the Act must not depend on administrative discretion, which is subject to political changes and short-term priorities.The court also highlighted structural inequities in democratic systems, where future generations — the primary stakeholders in climate policy — have no representation in current decision-making processes. This inherent limitation imposes a heightened duty on legislators to enact robust legal protections that secure long-term environmental justice.
  Instance 4: The ruling explicitly noted that elected lawmakers, rather than temporary administrations, must take responsibility for setting ambitious and concrete reduction targets to safeguard the rights of both present and future citizens.This landmark decision has profound implications for South Korea’s climate governance and the global climate movement. Domestically, it strengthens the constitutional mandate to protect environmental rights as fundamental human rights. By requiring the legislative incorporation of long-term goals for greenhouse gas reductions, the ruling bridges the intergenerational equity gap — a central issue in climate justice — and ensures that future governments remain accountable for their climate commitments.The decision also elevates the principle of intergenerational equity from a moral guideline to a constitutional mandate, which aligns with international norms such as sustainable development. First articulated in the 1987 Brundtland Report, sustainable development emphasizes meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs4. South Korea’s ruling reinforces this principle, which underscores the necessity of legally binding frameworks to institutionalize long-term climate accountability.By embedding long-term climate goals in legislation, the ruling promotes broader societal consensus on climate action.

The burden of these marginalized groups might be further exacerbated by poorly designed or inadequately implemented climate change mitigation policies.
  Instance 3: The burden of these marginalized groups might be further exacerbated by poorly designed or inadequately implemented climate change mitigation policies. For instance, carbon pricing without compensation might widen the income gap and increase inequality.

In this issue of Nature Climate Change, Charles Ogunbode and colleagues present a study spanning both the global north and the global south that reveals the widespread public endorsement of climate justice beliefs. The findings show that the public acknowledge the disproportionate impact of climate change on impoverished communities and underscore the roles of capitalism and colonialism in the climate crisis. Despite strong support for climate justice principles, they find that global awareness of climate justice remains low, with two-thirds of respondents indicating they had never heard of climate justice.
  Instance 6: In this issue of Nature Climate Change, Charles Ogunbode and colleagues present a study spanning both the global north and the global south that reveals the widespread public endorsement of climate justice beliefs.

Despite strong support for climate justice principles, they find that global awareness of climate justice remains low, with two-thirds of respondents indicating they had never heard of climate justice. Also in the issue, Kristian Nielsen and colleagues investigate the perceptions of carbon footprint inequality across four diverse countries and show that the public often underestimate the extent of inequality, particularly the footprints of the top income groups.Such underestimations can be due to a lack of information or awareness of inequality, or the complexity of estimating inequality. Perceived inequality is also influenced by ideologies, social norms and individual beliefs, as well as socioeconomic and contextual issues,.
  Instance 7: Age may also be an influential factor as adolescents might not yet have fully developed the cognitive skills needed to process complex information effectively. In addition, the wealthy often perceive themselves as poorer than they actually are, while the less wealthy tend to believe they are better off than they actually are.Public perception of equity and justice matter for climate change mitigation objectives. Climate justice perceptions are associated with increased engagement in online activism, pro-environmental behaviours and support for climate policies. Perceptions of the fairness of specific policies are a strong determinant of acceptability of the policy. Similarly, underestimating carbon footprint inequality can lead to reduced support for climate policies (as shown by Nielsen and colleagues).
  Instance 8: Perceptions of the fairness of specific policies are a strong determinant of acceptability of the policy. Similarly, underestimating carbon footprint inequality can lead to reduced support for climate policies (as shown by Nielsen and colleagues). Ethical responsibility is another reason to promote climate justice, to ensure that the most vulnerable and least responsible for climate change are treated fairly in both its impacts and the solutions developed to address it. Therefore, it is important to encourage inclusive mitigation and adaptation policies that recognize and address climate justice, while also improving public understanding and awareness of justice. Climate science education in schools as well as social media, online platforms and community events that offer greater exposure to information can help foster awareness of climate justice (as discussed by Ogunbode and colleagues).To reach climate goals, governments need to gain support from the public for policy interventions.

Almost 350 rural and urban groups, towns and tribes were selected by the EPA from 2,700 applicants, through a rigorous process that included longterm accountability and oversight over the funds.In February, Zeldin’s EPA, under the direction of the Trump administration, began terminating the entire ECJ program, as part of a broader assault  on climate science, climate action and environmental justice measures.In June, 23 grant recipients  sued after the entire block grant was terminated and the funds frozen overnight.The plaintiffs come from every region of the country and include the Indigenous village of Pipnuk in Alaska, the Deep South Centre for Environmental Justice in New Orleans, Appalachian Voices which works with legacy coal communities and Kalamazoo county in Michigan.Several non-profit legal advocacy groups – EarthJustice, Southern Environmental Law Center, Public Rights Project and Lawyers for Good Government – filed the proposed class action lawsuit alleging that the wholesale termination violated the separation of powers and is therefore unconstitutional. They also argue that the Trump administration’s decision was both “arbitrary and capricious” – in other words, made without proper reasoning or consideration of the consequences, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.On Tuesday, attorneys representing the coalition will argue for preliminary relief at the US district court for the District of Columbia (DDC), to force the EPA to immediately reinstate the ECJ program and unfreeze the funds.“This was an unlawful action that went against the will of Congress and violated the separation of powers,” said Ben Grillot, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.
Forget polar bears – the new Friends of the Earth boss prefers talking about Palestine [3]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6GHY-WJG3-RSS7-T3H1-00000-00Forget polar bears – the new Friends of the Earth boss prefers talking about Palestine2025-08-19T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:43ZLexisNexisNEWSVersion:2Forget polar bears – the new Friends of the Earth boss prefers talking about PalestineBy Emily RetterAsad Rehman, the environmental body’s new chief executive, aims to reframe the climate campaign around class, race and social justiceThose polar bears still clinging to sea ice might want to cover their ears.Friends of the Earth, the environmental campaign group, has a newly appointed chief executive with a bold vision for climate action  – one that, surprisingly, doesn’t put saving our Arctic pals at the top of the list.For Asad Rehman, a lifelong social justice activist  who has built a career hopscotching between causes ranging from poverty to police brutality, and who this month has taken the helm of the 56-year-old eco organisation, tackling the climate crisis isn’t about saving bears.Nor, as he has explained in the past, is it about “the right light bulbs” or avoiding “plastic straws ”.In fact, the working-class activist from Burnley, Lancashire – the group’s first leader of colour – who began campaigning as a boy in the 1980s when he organised school strikes of Asian children in response to abhorrent racist abuse, has described himself as a “reluctant environmentalist”.In an interview with The Guardian in 2021 he said tokenistic approaches to the climate crisis never resonated with him or with many from his background: “It was framed as about saving polar bears or whatever, and of really only being a concern to white, middle-class environmentalists.”So, those worried about the future of our planet might ask: what does chime?Well, the fate of Palestine  certainly ranks high among his concerns. A glance at Rehman’s X feed shows a “Stop Genocide , Save Palestine” emblem in place of a profile photograph, alongside a string of posts about this month’s arrests of protesters  under what he calls “draconian anti-terror legislation”.He has taken the cause to climate conferences, too. At Cop28  in Dubai in December 2023, he faced restrictions on a speech calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, stating that “the Palestinian struggle is woven into every struggle for justice, including climate justice”.Rehman also posts regular messages about racial and social injustice on social media. And in an interview with Times Radio earlier this month, he stressed the importance of diversity, arguing that the climate movement has become too white and middle class. “If we want to be a force for change, you have to look like and be part of the fabric of this country – and that is diverse and it’s diverse in class, it’s diverse in ethnicity, diverse geographically,” he said.Although he spent 10 years as Friends of the Earth’s “head of international climate” before moving in 2017 to his role as director of the anti-poverty charity War on Want, Rehman is clear he is no traditional green campaigner.
  Instance 2: And in an interview with Times Radio earlier this month, he stressed the importance of diversity, arguing that the climate movement has become too white and middle class. “If we want to be a force for change, you have to look like and be part of the fabric of this country – and that is diverse and it’s diverse in class, it’s diverse in ethnicity, diverse geographically,” he said.Although he spent 10 years as Friends of the Earth’s “head of international climate” before moving in 2017 to his role as director of the anti-poverty charity War on Want, Rehman is clear he is no traditional green campaigner. Instead, he says “climate justice” cannot be achieved without first levelling the social playing field and taxing the rich proportionately.“We must show that the fight for climate and nature is inseparable from achieving true social and economic justice,” he wrote on the Friends of the Earth website when his appointment was announced. “That the same forces driving environmental breakdown are keeping many locked into poverty and hardship.”Rehman believes that the “powerful multinationals” in rich, white countries profit from the climate crisis, while those with black and brown skin, who contribute least, suffer the greatest impact. In the 2021 Guardian interview, he described this as “racialised capitalism”, adding: “You cannot understand the climate crisis without understanding that there is an arch from slavery to colonialism and imperialism to the climate crisis.”He speaks passionately and articulately – convincingly, to his supporters.
  Instance 3: Ethnic minorities, Rehman said, were blamed for the ills of industrialisation, “driven by Thatcher and neoliberalism, which was devastating working-class communities up and down the country” – communities of which they, too, were a part. After the school strikes, Rehman founded an Asian youth movement in his area.He could not have been more disconnected from environmentalism, which he viewed as a “luxury” – a disconnect he says still exists in communities that are struggling with the cost of living today.After working for the anti-racism group Newham Monitoring Project in the late 1980s, Rehman moved on to Amnesty International, campaigning heavily for reforms following the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993 and criticising the investigation into Jean Charles de Menezes, the Brazilian shot by the Met Police in 2005 after the July 7 terror attacks.Author and human rights campaigner Yasmin Khan, a friend he worked alongside during that period, has described him as a “force of nature” with “political fierceness”.Rehman joined Friends of the Earth in 2006, but admitted that his true adoption of environmentalism came when representing the organisation in 2009 at Cop15 in Copenhagen, where he saw the Sudanese diplomat Lumumba Di-Aping break down as he explained that the deal richer countries were proposing – to limit global heating to 2C – would mean 3.5C for much of Africa.“We have been asked to sign a suicide pact,” Di-Aping said. Rehman saw his causes collide.In 2012, he co-founded the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice, a network of more than 200 climate and human rights organisations. He also co-founded the Cop26 Coalition in Glasgow in 2021, marching through the streets with 100,000 protesters and addressing the crowds about the “overwhelmingly white” conference.At Cop27 the following year, he called for reparations from the West for countries badly impacted by climate change. Britain, he said, should give £1tn.However, speaking to The Telegraph this week, he explains the climate crisis using softer, more familiar rhetoric.
Nations who fail to curb fossil fuels could be ordered to pay reparations, top UN court rules [4]
  Instance 1: “These consequences underscore an urgent existential threat,” he said.The unanimous opinion covers a wide range of matters under international law. It says states are liable for all kinds of activities that harm the climate, but it takes explicit aim at fossil fuels.It says that a state’s failure to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from greenhouse gas emissions, including through the production and consumption of fossil fuels, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licences or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies, “may constitute an international wrongful act which is attributable to that state”.Climate campaigners and representatives of vulnerable countries were delighted with the outcome. Speaking outside the court, Vanuatu’s minister for climate change, Ralph Regenvanu, said it was a milestone moment for climate justice. “It has confirmed what vulnerable nations have been saying and have known for so long,” he said. “That states do have legal obligations to act on climate change.”He said the document would be a vital tool in upcoming climate negotiations and was likely to inspire new lawsuits.

Advisory opinions are technically non-binding but are considered authoritative because they summarise existing law rather than create laws.Harj Narulla, a barrister specialising in climate litigation and counsel for Solomon Islands in the case, said the ICJ laid out the possibility of big emitters being successfully sued.“These reparations involve restitution – such as rebuilding destroyed infrastructure and restoring ecosystems – and also monetary compensation,” he said.Coal, oil and gas are the main cause of anthropogenic climate breakdown, but there was no mention of fossil fuels in the main text of the Paris agreement in 2015. It was not until 2023 that countries said they would “transition away” from them, and even that weaker pledge was downgraded by some governments  to optional.The court also said states were legally liable for the actions of the private sector and must regulate corporate activities that contributed to the climate crisis.The UNinstructed the ICJ  to produce this document in 2023 after years of campaigning by a group of Pacific island law students  and diplomacy led by the Pacific island state of Vanuatu.Vishal Prasad, one of the law students that lobbied the government of Vanuatu to bring the case to the ICJ, said: “This advisory opinion is a tool for climate justice. And boy, has the ICJ given us a strong tool to carry on the fight for climate justice.”UN secretary-general António Guterres hailed the opinion and said it affirms that the Paris climate agreement goal needs to be the basis of all climate policies. “This is a victory for our planet, for climate justice, and for the power of young people to make a difference,” he said.

Climate protection is a human right, International Court of Justice states [3]
  Instance 1: Though the opinion is non-binding, it carries significant legal and political weight and may shape future climate litigation and treaty negotiations.It comes amid increasing efforts to hold governments accountable for climate change through legal avenues.The Strasbourg court found that inadequate climate policy can amount to a violation of human rights, setting a precedent for similar cases across Europe.Criminalising ecocideAt the international level, discussions are underway to make large-scale environmental destruction a crime.Last year, the International Criminal Court (ICC) began formal discussions on recognisingThe proposed definition of ecocide covers acts committed with knowledge that they are likely to cause severe and widespread or long-term damage to the environment.If adopted, this would allow the court to prosecute individuals, including corporate executives and government leaders, for environmental destruction such as large-scale oil spills or deforestation.The mortality cost of carbonThe ecocide proposal, backed by several Pacific Island nations, faces legal hurdles as ecocide is not yet part of customary international law or recognised as a core international crime.Nevertheless, climate litigation is gaining momentum, driven in part by, 171 of which were attributed to the increased temperatures linked to climate change.Legal challenges are increasingly drawing on this science.The group argues that the Government's failure to prepare adequately for climate impacts breaches the rights of people in the UK, especially those most vulnerable to heat and flooding. The UK High Court previously ruled the Government's adaptation plan lawful.The ICJ's opinion adds a new layer of legal clarity on what governments are required to do to prevent climate harm. While the court cannot enforce its ruling, it reinforces the growing view that states may be held accountable for climate inaction under international law.ICJ reaction: 'A rocket boost for climate justice'Reacting to the ICJ's opinion decision, the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment's Noah Walker-Crawford said: "The ICJ's advisory opinion brings the weight of international law behind what climate science has shown for decades. By grounding states' obligations in scientific consensus and human rights law, the Court affirms that governments must not only reduce their own emissions, but also regulate companies to do the same."This creates a powerful foundation for future claims to hold both states and major emitters accountable."Power Shift Africa's director Mohamed Adow said: "This ruling is a rocket boost for climate justice. The ICJ has confirmed what Africa has long demanded: that rich nations must be held accountable for the damage their emissions have caused."For a continent like Africa - least responsible but most affected - this decision is a lifeline.

  Instance 3: It strengthens our call for reparations, debt relief, and real climate finance - not loans that deepen poverty... the law now backs our moral case.""The era of polluters hiding behind vague promises is over."Greenpeace International's legal counsel Danilo Garrido said: "This is the start of a new era of climate accountability at a global level. The ICJ advisory opinion marks a turning point for climate justice, as it has clarified, once and for all, the international climate obligations of states, and most importantly, the consequences for breaches of these obligations."This will open the door for new cases, and hopefully bring justice to those who, despite having contributed the least to climate change, are already suffering its most severe consequences."The message of the Court is clear: the production, consumption and granting of licenses and subsidies for fossil fuels could be breaches of International Law. Polluters must stop emitting and must pay for the harms they have caused."The Climate Group's executive director of government and policy, Champa Patel, said:"This is an historic affirmation that states have legal obligations to act decisively on climate change. This strengthens the mandate for national governments to accelerate their climate action in line with international law.

Environment groups are too white and middle class, says green boss [1]
  Instance 1: He said the possibility of a future Reform government, and the rise of the far right, 'keeps me awake at night'.He told The Times: 'We are heading towards, I think, a divisive, racist, dystopian future. Or we have a future which is prosperous, united, more coherent, cohesive, strong, community diverse. That's the one I'm fighting for.'Nigel Farage recently branded fracking for natural gas 'vital', and vowed to lift a moratorium on the extraction method.The controversial technique was imposed after small earthquakes in Lancashire in both 2018 and 2019.Mr Rehman said the Reform UK leader was in for 'a shock' at the backlash from rural working-class voters, if he were to run for election on a pro-fracking promise.He added that Friends of the Earth would argue an expansion of renewable energy, as well as increasing the energy efficiency of properties, are the best ways to reduce the cost of energy bills.Friends of the Earth is a top international environmental organisation with a network of member groups and local activist groups around the world.It homes in on environmental issues and promotes solutions for a sustainable future through campaigns and legal action.Friends of the Earth is well known for its work on climate justice, protecting nature, and advocating for environmental and social justice.The Daily Mail has contacted Reform UK for comment.MAILON-113732755MAILON2025urn:contentItem:6GG6-0503-RVJK-W156-00000-003971352025-08-111:10 AM GMTCopyright 2025 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Co-op installs over 6,700 solar panels at its largest distribution depot [1]
  Instance 1: depot in Biggleswade has been equipped with approximately 6,744 solar panels as part of the group’s journey to increase the amount of renewable power it directly procures.The newly installed solar panels are expected to generate 2,500MWh of renewable energy annually to help power the depot’s operations. Additionally, the panels will alleviate demand on the national grid and help drive Co-op’s commitment to become Net Zero across its operations by 2035.Heather Thomas, group property and sustainability director, said: “The completion of the solar panel installation at our Biggleswade depot is a landmark moment. This initiative underlines our dedication to sustainability and demonstrates how businesses can make impactful changes to protect the planet.“By harnessing renewable energy, we’re not only reducing emissions but also setting a strong example of best practice on how sustainable energy can be effectively integrated into day-to-day businesses.”The Co-op has been campaigning for Climate Justice since 2021 and recently published research with the Green Alliance on the role of businesses as energy consumers in the energy transition - essential not only in tackling climate change but also for energy security and therefore national security.The news of the solar power project at the depot follows on from the announcement of Co-op’s plans to install solar panels on a target of up to 700 sites across its portfolio over the next three years.CNVNCU-113433420CNVNCU2025urn:contentItem:6GCF-KBF3-RRWT-700R-00000-004737472025-07-299:50 AM GMTCopyright 2025 William Reed Business Media Ltd All Rights Reservedconveniencestore.co.ukJuly 28, 2025 MondayWeb PublicationIndustry Trade PressENGLISHN928000CCINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp; NATIONAL SECURITYSTX001477RESEARCH REPORTSST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTX001996NATIONAL SECURITYN221119IMSOLAR POWER PLANTSST000DPKUSOLAR POWER INDUSTRYST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX000619ENERGY &amp; UTILITY POLICYSTX002017NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; FOREIGN RELATIONSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST000DL6MSUSTAINABILITYSTX000175BEST PRACTICESSTX001660SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTST000DJQCCONSUMERSSTX000594EMISSIONSST000DPLVRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYSTX001878SOLAR ENERGYSTX001359POWER FAILURESN221119IMSOLAR POWER PLANTSST000DPKUSOLAR POWER INDUSTRYST000DUF8ENERGY NETWORKSN221110CCELECTRIC POWER PLANTSSTX000619ENERGY &amp; UTILITY POLICYST000DF3WDISTRIBUTION CENTERSSTX001466ALTERNATIVE &amp; RENEWABLE ENERGYSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESSTX000775NATURAL GAS &amp; ELECTRIC UTILITIESST000DTI1ENERGY SECURITYSTX001660SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTSTX000594EMISSIONSST000D1GOENERGY CONSUMPTIONST000DPLVRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYGC628ENGLANDBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Greenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjALegislationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhGMTVENjdEQTUzNDVGMDlBMjQzMTE3MDRCQ0UwQUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAEnergy &amp; Utilities LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzdCQkJDOTQxQzQyNEE5REIzRDQxMjFERTkyODlCN0U7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkYzN0Y3MzM3MTFCNDM2Qzk3QzI5NzNCRTRDM0ZCNkYSolar Power IndustryZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDlCOTMzNzhGREJBNDJENEEyM0ZGMjVFODI5Nzc4NTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDAGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEIxQzc2REQwRUFENDU3MEE1QUFDOEM0NkRGQkRDRjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0E1RURCMEU0OTk5NEREODkwRTVDQ0YxRTEwQTk5NjQEnvironmental OversightZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjlDNzU5MDBDRTIzNERFQzlDNENCN0UzNjJBNDY0OTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTYxREU4QTEwRERFNDlCNkJCRDU4RjdBQUMyNjZDRDARemedies for BreachZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0MwQ0QwRUFCMEY2NDcyNzlFRkI1MTRFOEZDODQ4OTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkYzN0Y3MzM3MTFCNDM2Qzk3QzI5NzNCRTRDM0ZCNkYGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUE5QTI3M0EzMzA2NERGRjk0NUM1RjBEMzNBMTJGMTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTY1MkM5NEQwRkY0NDEwNjgwM0JBNUQyNzNFM0QwNkYBuying &amp; Selling of PowerZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFFNTI4RkYwRjMzNDcwMTkyNDE2M0JFQTFCMDQ1NTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkU4REM5MTFCOTEzNDRDQ0IyNEEyRkNGRDQyQjM3REYEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkVGNUU3RDc3MUVENDYwRjkxMEQwMDVGNTcxRTJDODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REZDN0NDN0QzNDUwNDA4NjlENDAxODkzMUNGOUNCQTMGreenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAInitiative &amp; ReferendumZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUEyM0EzQUVENUI1NEZGRUFENjM4NERBRUIzQ0Q5MDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REM3NjlCMTNCRkNCNDc1Mzk5MzlGNjBBN0I2N0NENDULegislationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhGMTVENjdEQTUzNDVGMDlBMjQzMTE3MDRCQ0UwQUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjA
Paul McLennan MSP column: We will make sure wind farm project is done right [1]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6GFM-BPM3-RV6V-3011-00000-00Paul McLennan MSP column: We will make sure wind farm project is done right2025-08-08T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:43ZLexisNexisPaul McLennan MSP column: We will make sure wind farm project is done rightAlex ChisholmTHE First Minister emphasised recently his responsibility to advance the nation-s interests and ensure that "Scotland-s voice is heard at the highest levels of government across the world".Whether this is calling out the genocide in Gaza, or marking the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the 80th anniversary of the atomic bomb attacks, Scotland will speak out "on war and peace, justice and democracy".These fundamental values include the duty to protect the environment, address climate change, and achieve climate justice.Denying climate change (a Reform UK and Tory tendency) or backpedalling on climate policy (as Labour has done) are not options.In granting consent to Berwick Bank Wind Farm, the UK-s largest and one of the biggest in the world, the Scottish Government is taking a not-insignificant role for a country with a small population on Europe-s northern fringe.Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes set out the dual focus of the Scottish Government-s strategy as "a major step in Scotland-s progress towards achieving net zero and tackling the climate crisis, as well as supporting national energy security and growing our green economy".In economic terms, this is important for "Scotland-s renewables sector... this investment will be further built upon through the delivery of Scotland-s future pipeline of offshore wind projects under the ScotWind and the Innovation and Targeted Oil and Gas (INTOG) leasing rounds".This giant project has multiple benefits: clean, skilled jobs; cheaper green energy; greater self-sufficiency in energy offering increased protection from external energy shocks, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine.There are also challenges: a massive engineering project with potential for local disruption; a 30-year intervention in a seascape familiar since the first inhabitants were here thousands of years ago; and an impact on the environment including endangering seabirds, marine life and habitats.The Scottish Government will seek to "balance the needs of people and nature" (Kate Forbes).With current technology, Berwick Bank could generate enough electricity each year to power every household in Scotland about twice over but that must be achieved with an aggressive, effective policy on the part of the developer recognising the site-s importance for seabirds and marine life.This is the condition: Berwick Bank construction will not go ahead unless Scottish Ministers are convinced by a detailed seabird compensation plan by the developer, SSE Renewables, demonstrating how adverse impacts will be mitigated.This is my constituency. I-ll be 100 per cent vigilant on behalf of our coastline and its exceptional bird and marine life.
‘We were heard’: the Pacific students who took their climate fight to the ICJ – and won [3]
  Instance 1: It felt like a wild dream – this idea that we could go to the ICJ. But we thought, ‘Why not?’ There was youthful ambition and energy, and surprisingly – with support from across the world – we got here. Especially thanks to the international youth climate justice movement.”But it wasn’t easy. Over the years, the movement faced resistance from major emitting countries. The Pacific had to go back, gather more evidence, more testimonies – and keep pushing, despite the odds.
  Instance 2: It was clear.”“As a young Tongan, I hope we’ve helped set a healthy legal standard – a blueprint that can be replicated globally. This duty of care … it goes beyond legal obligations. It speaks to who we are in the Pacific.”The opinion didn’t just recognise states’ climate responsibilities – it tied them directly to human rights and the lives of frontline communities.Many in the Pacific and those who have been following the advisory opinion, including those who contributed to oral submissions, cheered with joy when the advisory opinion came down.Rufino Varea, director of the Pacific Islands Climate Network, said the court had handed Pacific people “legal backbone for climate justice”.“No more excuses. Those who fuel this crisis must stop the harm and help repair it,” he said.“The law now reflects the justice our communities have always demanded – and we will use this opinion everywhere we fight for our people.”Pacific feminist climate activist Tamani Rarama said the ruling offered new tools in the fight for accountability.“Now we have clarified, more nuanced international legal advice – a pathway for justice, redress and repatriation for the loss and damage our frontline communities have endured for years.”From scientific submissions provided by the Pacific Community to testimonies gathered by PISFCC in the Witness Stand for Climate Justice, every part of the case was anchored in the experiences of Pacific people.Dr Coral Pasisi, the Pacific Community’s director of climate change, reflected on what the ruling means to her personally.“My children told me before I left: there better be a decent outcome. Especially my 10-year-old son, who said, ‘Mum, you’ve been doing this for 13 years, and the adults still aren’t listening.

Urban climate experiments: Governance tensions and opportunities for justice [17]
  Instance 1: By analysing and connecting among each other key strands of debate on experimental governance, the paper identifies three main types of tensions characterising the governance of urban climate experiments, that is, socio-material, organisational and institutional (governance tensions). The analysis of the tensions is further developed by embedding a socio-ecological justice lens. Indeed, drawing insights from literature on urban climate justice, the paper shows how key dimensions of justice – namely distributive, procedural, recognition and restorative justice – run transversal to the three types of tensions. As a result, by experiencing and learning from governance tensions urban climate experiments can envision opportunities to better embed justice in their governing practices.FULL TEXTIntroductionPart of the debate on urban experimentation recognises how, in a societal context characterised by looming socio-ecological emergencies, not least the climate change challenge, urban climate experiments hold potentials for steering more sustainable and just urban transformations (Castán Broto and Bulkeley, 2013a; Monstadt et al., 2022). In fact, experiments such as living laboratories, pilots, testbeds and similar, are increasingly adopted by cities in Europe and globally (Bulkeley and Castán Broto, 2013) as key arenas in which actors engage in forms of collaborative governance, in order to co-shape alternative solutions to social and environmental challenges (Bulkeley et al., 2018).
  Instance 2: The dialectic character of the concept of tension implies that tensions usher both, barriers and dead-ends variably constraining or de-politicising transformative action, but also constructive and (pro)positive ways forward that enhance scopes of action. Reflecting the challenges highlighted above, tensions are framed in terms of socio-material, organisational and institutional (governance) tensions (see sections ‘Methodology’ and ‘Unraveling governance tensions’). Second, drawing on key pillars of the urban climate justice literature, this paper shows how justice is embedded within the three types of tensions and how urban experiments can enable transformative approaches that provide opportunities to fully address justice. In particular, by giving accent to key dimensions of justice emerging from the debate – namely, procedural, distributive, recognition and restorative justice – the analysis highlights how revisiting governance tensions through a justice lens can enhance actors’ awareness about justice-related contradictions and potential pathways forward (see section ‘Connecting governance tensions with socio-ecological justice’).MethodologyThe methodological strategy aimed at identifying and analysing sub-strands of debate on urban (climate) experiments and experimental governance with the purpose to: (a) understand in what ways literatures on urban experimentation have framed transformative challenges of urban experiments; and (b) grasp whether and how issues of justice are embedded in such analyses. In particular, drawing on core scientific contributions and systematic literature reviews on urban experimentation (see for instance Kivimaa et al., 2016; Sengers et al., 2019; Sengers et al., 2020; Ehnert, 2022; Sierhuis et al., 2023), a first distinction was made between two primary strands of scholarship on urban experimentation and its link to transformation.
  Instance 3: Such a focus on (socio)material dynamics allowed for an understanding of how organisational and institutional processes do not happen in a vacuum; on the contrary, they occur in place-based socio-material settings posing specific challenges to experimental transformations. This understanding inspired the concept of socio-material governance tensions as integrating and complementing organisational and institutional aspects. This third category of tensions is broadly defined as actors’ struggles to cope with the social and the material realities in which experiments navigate (see section ‘Unraveling governance tensions’; see Figure 1 for a schematisation of the tensions).Finally, with respect to questions of justice, the analysis highlighted how, on the one hand, there is a conspicuous debate on urban climate justice. This debate mainly investigates justice in relation to climate adaptation and mitigation policies (Anguelovski et al., 2016; Bulkeley et al., 2013) and to urban greening strategies (Anguelovski et al., 2020; Rice, 2014). Yet, on the other hand, despite relevant exceptions (see for instance Bulkeley et al., 2014b; Bulkeley and Castán Broto, 2014; Sovacool et al., 2019), scarce contributions connect justice with urban experimentation and experimental governance.
  Instance 4: Thus, questions and dilemmas pop up concerning modalities to connect experimental arenas with wider policy processes, accelerating change and producing a long-term impact.Yet, besides constraints, institutional governance tensions can also produce opportunities for collaborative and empowering action, by for instance stimulating forms of cooperative governance between bottom-up agents (e.g., grassroots initiatives, citizens) and top-down political structures (local/higher level state authorities) (Eizaguirre et al., 2017; Moulaert et al., 2019). Theories on governance and social innovation name such cooperative arrangements as ‘bottom-linked’ institutions that connect local experiments with top-down policy structures (Moulaert et al., 2019). Opportunities emerge to analyse how these kinds of collaborative arrangements operating within and beyond experimental frameworks can also incorporate questions of justice, channelling resources and developing operational frameworks accordingly (see section ‘Re-reading governance tensions under a justice lens’).Connecting governance tensions with socio-ecological justiceBy bringing socio-ecological justice at the urban scale, the urban climate justice debate sheds light on who benefits and who does not from climate interventions, unravelling how such interventions can serve to reproduce or, rather, to subvert existing inequities in cities (Anguelovski et al., 2016; Bulkeley et al., 2014b). Thus, there are opportunities to deepen the comprehension of both justice and governance dynamics, by connecting key insights from urban climate justice to the analysis of governance tensions. This connection enables reflection on how actors involved in experiments can learn from confronting with key tensions and explore ways to turn such tensions toward a better account for justice.Key Insights from the climate justice debateThe urban climate justice debate recognises how any initiative seeking to engender socio-ecologically transformative dynamics in complex and uneven societal settings needs to confront with issues of justice (Heynen et al., 2006).

This connection enables reflection on how actors involved in experiments can learn from confronting with key tensions and explore ways to turn such tensions toward a better account for justice.Key Insights from the climate justice debateThe urban climate justice debate recognises how any initiative seeking to engender socio-ecologically transformative dynamics in complex and uneven societal settings needs to confront with issues of justice (Heynen et al., 2006). Indeed, acting at the cross-roads between the material and the social, the natural and the urban, environmentally-driven interventions such as mitigation, adaptation or greening strategies, can give place to differential outcomes in terms of justice, by for instance privileging certain types of socio-ecological configurations over others (Graham and Marvin, 2001; Hodson and Marvin, 2010).

Indeed, acting at the cross-roads between the material and the social, the natural and the urban, environmentally-driven interventions such as mitigation, adaptation or greening strategies, can give place to differential outcomes in terms of justice, by for instance privileging certain types of socio-ecological configurations over others (Graham and Marvin, 2001; Hodson and Marvin, 2010). Authors have documented such dynamics, underlining how environmentally-led initiatives risk to reproduce or exacerbate socio-spatial inequalities affecting disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods and urban social groups (Anguelovski et al., 2020).
  Instance 7: Adopting critical lenses such as urban political ecology and environmental justice, which goes back to the tradition of civil right movements (Agyeman et al., 2002; Schlosberg and Collins, 2014), these contributions have documented how environmental initiatives in the form of greening strategies can overlook demands for social justice. Indeed, neoliberally oriented value systems often lay behind greening interventions promoted by state or market actors (Rice, 2014). As a consequence, without a proper account for (social) justice, these values and strategies concretise in negative material outcomes, such as disparities in access to ecological amenities, raises in property values and energy prices, triggering further marginalisation and displacement of vulnerable urban groups (García-Lamarca et al., 2021).Alongside considerations of social justice, (radical) environmental justice frameworks informing the urban climate justice debate have shed light on how ecological aspects of justice should be also considered (Schlosberg, 2013). Indeed, it has become clear that laying the basis for a healthy environment is a necessary pre-condition for the realisation of social justice (Schlosberg, 2013; Agyeman et al., 2016). Perspectives on ‘just sustainabilities’ have stressed this point by underlining the need “to ensure a better quality of life for all, now, and into the future, in a just and equitable manner, while living within the limits of supporting ecosystems” (Agyeman et al., 2016: p.
  Instance 8: These considerations suggest that embedding justice in the governance of urban climate initiatives, including urban climate experiments, means considering both, human and non-human, social and material (or ecological) aspects as matters of justice (Yaka, 2019). After all, the need to lower carbon emissions, repair environmentally damaging practices, regenerate soil and degraded resources, restore ecosystems, and so on, should be also part of the missions of urban climate initiatives, and experiments among them.A further approach that seeks to advance transformative justice is fostered by the ‘just transitions’ debate (or ‘just urban transitions’ when related to the urban scale) (Hughes and Hoffmann, 2020; Stark et al., 2023; Swilling and Annecke, 2012). Informed by multiple theoretical strands on low-carbon transitions and justice – and aligning with key tenets of (urban) climate justice – just (urban) transitions imply the ‘fusion of climate action and justice concerns (at the urban scale)’ (Hughes and Hoffmann, 2020: p. 2, brackets added). Specifically, a key element that qualifies the just transitions perspective is its normative orientation, tailored to operationalise justice (Avelino et al., 2024).
  Instance 9: Yet, this paper contends that pathways to achieving justice should not be pursued through ‘one-size-fits-all' strategies or pre-determined solutions. Instead, justice objectives should be addressed through adaptive modalities of (co)governance, tailored to the specific socio-material contexts in which they are enacted. By focusing on the socio-material, organisational, and institutional tensions, actors can gain a deeper understanding of the contextual conditions and dynamics that may either hinder or facilitate the pursuit of justice.A multi-dimensional conception of justiceBesides raising awareness about the need to combine social and ecological justice concerns, a further insight of both, urban climate justice and just transitions is the need to consider socio-ecological justice from a multi-dimensional perspective (Svarstad and Benjaminsen, 2020). Such a perspective, should, at least, consider distributive, procedural, recognition and restorative justice as interrelated dimensions (Schlosberg, 2007)2.In particular, distributive justice focuses on equity in outcomes, that is, in the fair distribution of costs and benefits of climate interventions. Contributions on urban climate justice focusing on distributional aspects put the finger on how urban climate initiatives can fail to address rooted inequities such as access to ecological amenities, or the distribution of services and infrastructures, by disadvantaged urban communities (Anguelovski et al., 2020).

Contributions on urban climate justice focusing on distributional aspects put the finger on how urban climate initiatives can fail to address rooted inequities such as access to ecological amenities, or the distribution of services and infrastructures, by disadvantaged urban communities (Anguelovski et al., 2020). Indeed, the literature highlights how governance and planning frameworks used to redress socio-spatial inequities are very often embedded in the “very institutions and development processes that reproduce uneven risk exposure and socio-economic vulnerability” (Anguelovski et al., 2016: p. 333).
  Instance 11: Consequently, restorative justice pleas for recognising and taking initiative to repair inequities that equally affect environments and disadvantaged social groups, such as minorities and indigenous people bearing historic inequities. Thus, restorative justice brings the entanglement between human and non-human, social and material (or ecological) spheres at its core. Although the debate on urban climate justice addresses restorative justice in a lower degree than the other three dimensions, restorative justice is increasingly permeating the wider environmental justice debate (Forsyth et al., 2021).Re-reading governance tensions under a justice lensSocio-ecological justice and its different dimensions run transversal to the three types of tensions and allow to better highlight the dynamic interrelations among them. Indeed, distributive and restorative dimensions of justice connect to the limits and potential of urban climate experiments to be conducive to more just socio-material (including ecological) outcomes (link to socio-material governance tensions). Procedural dimensions of justice connect with rethinking processes and organisational modalities through which experiments seek to scale out or up, potentially allowing diverse actors to benefits from processes, but also outcomes, of experimental interventions (link to organisational governance tensions).
  Instance 12: In particular, the analysis of socio-material governance tensions allowed for a more careful scrutiny of how socio-material aspects interact with the transformative aspirations of urban experiments leading to different outcomes as experiments unfold and seek to carve out spaces of action. Organisational governance tensions shed better light on how actors are ushered to devise organisational strategies as experiments develop and seek to leave a legacy that goes beyond ephemeral initiatives. Institutional governance tensions illuminated the constraining or enabling role of political arenas and institutional structures in which experiments navigate.The additional contribution of the paper was to bring on board debates on urban climate justice connecting insights from this literature to the transformative ambitions of urban climate experiments. In particular, the climate justice debate stresses the urgency to develop a socio-ecological justice lens that tackles different dimensions of justice, such as distributive, procedural, recognition and restorative justice (see section ‘Connecting governance tensions with socio-ecological justice’). Re-framed under this multi-dimensional justice perspective, governance tensions can be instrumental to make forms of inequities visible and, thus, to instigate questions of justice and normativity in the governing practices of experiments.

Ultimately, the paper invites to reflect on how, by going through different tensions, actors can re-assess their practices and become reflective on issues of justice, envisioning opportunities to embed socio-ecological justice in transformative targets.There are at least three ways in which the conceptual analysis carried out in this paper can be applied and developed.

Architects Declare: Profession 'cannot remain silent on Gaza' [1]
  Instance 1: This includes hospitals, schools and other critical infrastructure in Palestinian cities such as Gaza City, Rafah and Khan Yunis, which have been targeted by Israeli military.AD, which issued 'a sincere apology for not speaking out sooner' on the 22-month long conflict, said the mounting death toll and reports of environmental and urban devastation in the occupied territory had led to a moment 'at which silence is unconscionable'.The organisation, which subscribes to 12 pledges to tackle the climate crisis backed by more than a thousand UK signatories, said: 'We believe that point has been reached with the deliberate starvation of children and the scale of human suffering now unfolding.'As architects, we are committed to addressing the interconnected crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and social injustice.'It added: 'We cannot remain silent in the face of the ongoing, deliberate destruction of life, land and cultural infrastructure in Gaza.'The statement called on Architects Declare's signatories and the wider profession in the UK and Australia to support humanitarian organisations in Palestine; to amplify voices of groups such as the Architects for Gaza collective of registered architects; to contact their MPs; and to 'advocate for peace, environmental justice, and reparative rebuilding'.'[Architects should] be cognisant of the work we do as architects in many countries, not just in the UK, and the unintended local impacts of this', the statement added. 'There are many conflicts and humanitarian and ecological crises around the world and the ongoing destruction in Gaza should bring home to us all the need for justice in all we do.'Architects Declare has 1,402 signatories in the UK and 1,233 in Australia. The charity's 12th declaration point says that signatories should 'support those who are working for climate justice and strive to ensure equity and an improved quality of life for all'.In June, the international chapters of Architects Climate Action Network (ACAN) joined wider calls for a ceasefire. The group said in a joint statement that it was 'horrified by the relentless systematic targeting of civilians, [and] the widespread destruction of homes and infrastructure' in Gaza, which, it suggested, was suffering a 'genocide'.An estimated 1,200 Israelis, including more than 360 young people at a music festival, were killed and over 250 were taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October 2023. The pro-Palestinian group is designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and other governments.The Israeli government, led by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have consistently said that the war in Gaza is morally justified to defend Israel, free the hostages, and eliminate Hamas.It insists that Hamas, the United Nations, witnesses, aid workers and foreign governments are lying about the suffering and starvation of civilians.In a news conference conducted in English for the international media on 10 August, Netanyahu condemned  such reports, saying he wished 'to puncture the lies...

  Instance 1: 9Blooming wonderfulFLOWER BED REAFFIRMS CITY'S COMMITMENT TO FAIRTRADEDEBORAH HALLHULL'S 20th year of maintaining its Fairtrade City status has been marked with the unveiling of a special floral display.A vibrant version of the familiar Fairtrade mark is now on display in the raised flower bed on the corner of Ferensway and Freetown Way. It was unveiled on the same day that Hull City Council reaffirmed its commitment to the movement.Throughout 2025, in addition to the regular Fairtrade campaigns and events to promote the ethos of social justice that fair, ethical and sustainable trade brings, Hull Fairtrade Partnership, of which Hull City Council is an important consumer, opinion leader and key member, is linking with other initiatives to mark the milestone. This include Great Big Green Week, a celebration of community-led action on climate change, in which the message that there is no climate justice without trade justice was reinforced.Maintaining this momentum over two decades is a cause for celebration for Hull Fairtrade Partnership and this is the first time the city centre flower beds have been used to promote this. Cllr Charles Quinn, portfolio holder for environment at Hull City Council, said: "Hull has had an active group of Fairtrade campaigners and supporters since the start of the movement over 30 years ago and has demonstrated this by achieving reaccreditation as a Fairtrade City since 2005."The display in the city centre flower bed is a great way to raise awareness of Fairtrade issues and show Hull's commitment to supporting the movement. I am delighted to confirm that today (Thursday, July 17), at our full council meeting, a motion was passed to reaffirm our council's commitment to supporting Fairtrade and the values it represents."My thanks go to Hull Fairtrade Partnership members for proposing the flower bed project and to Hull City Council's Town Centre Grounds Team for their support and enthusiasm in making it happen."The Fairtrade symbol recreated in plantsHull Fairtrade Partnership continued with the unveiling of a redesigned flower bed in the city centreHULLDM-205793882HULLDM2025urn:contentItem:6G9Y-39G3-RSHF-336R-00000-001667152025-07-22Copyright 2025 Reach PLC All Rights ReservedHull Daily MailEdition 1, National EditionJuly 22, 2025 TuesdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHNational EditionSTX000297CITIESST0008X9ICITY GOVERNMENTN921120CCLEGISLATIVE BODIESST0009G89REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTSSTX001669TALKS &amp; MEETINGSST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTX001588SOCIAL JUSTICESTX001965SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLEST000DL6MSUSTAINABILITYST000DGZ6KINGSTON UPON HULL, ENGLAND

Tunisian president blasts years of mismanagement in environmental crisis [2]
  Instance 1: Municipalities are unable to fulfil their legal and practical responsibilities. Pollution from chemical substances is increasing, and we face worsening desertification."Tunisia has 13 unmanaged waste dumps, four of which, in Monastir, Djerba, Agareb and Kerkennah in Sfax Governorate, have been shut down due to social unrest. Meanwhile, unregulated hunting continues to endanger wildlife, including species that are protected or subject to seasonal hunting restrictions.Despite international efforts to protect global biodiversity, off-season hunting persists in Tunisia's Arabat Nature Reserve in Gafsa Governorate, home to endangered species such as the Dorcas gazelle and the North African ostrich, both of which are at risk across the broader desert and coastal regions of the continent.Climate justice remains a central challenge for Tunisia, particularly as it is one of the countries most vulnerable to extreme climate events in North Africa, according to the 2020 Global Climate Risk Index.The concept of climate justice requires that the world's most polluting nations bear the financial burden of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution. It also entails adopting development policies that are environmentally sustainable, moving away from past government strategies that have failed to yield results, and ensuring an equitable distribution of financial resources across all regions to confront escalating environmental threats.ARABEN-498673176ARABEN2025urn:contentItem:6G88-8F73-RS0P-D43T-00000-003908812025-07-14Copyright 2025  Alarab Online.

EU targets 90% cut in emissions by 2040 as green groups cry foul [3]
  Instance 1: Critics, including scientists, have raised fears of junk offsets that are impossible to verify or that claim carbon savings for projects that may have gone ahead anyway, a concept known as “additionality”.“If we don’t manage to do it in a way that is verifiable, certifiable and additional, then you could raise questions on whether it is actually effective,” Hoekstra said. “But humanity has done more difficult things than this, and I am absolutely convinced that we will pull it off.”The European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change had recommended the commission aim for slightly steeper cuts of 90-95%. It emphasised it should achieve them through “domestic action”, which would exclude the use of carbon offsets.The advisers said such a level of ambition was feasible and would increase the fairness of the EU’s contribution to global climate action.Mohammed Chahim, a Dutch lawmaker and climate lead for the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) grouping, said the proposals were little more than window dressing and raised questions about climate justice. “Europe risks shirking its responsibilities – polluting at home while planting trees abroad to buy a clean conscience,” he said.An EU official defended the proposal, saying the use of international credits was “politically pragmatic and economically rational”. The target would allow carbon credits to make a 3% contribution to emission reductions, in line with Germany’s position, and would be allowed only in the second half of the next decade.The official said they would “strongly advise” against buying credits in the current voluntary carbon market, but new carbon trading rules finalised at the Cop29 climate conference in Baku last year provided a very different context.

The deregulation drive has shocked observers with its scale and speed.Some industry groups were also dismayed by the proposal. The European federation of industrial energy consumers (IFIEC) said it supported the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 but found the proposed 90% target “a disproportionate and unrealistic” acceleration of the ambition.“An overly steep reduction curve ignores this reality and runs the risk of accelerating de-industrialisation in Europe and massively importing CO2 emissions,” said Hans Grünfeld, president of IFIEC.Green groups said the target fell short of the EU’s responsibilities as one of the world’s biggest historical emitters of greenhouse gases.“The European Commission will try to portray this as an ambitious step forward, but the reality is we are fast running out of room to achieve the Paris agreement,” said Colin Roche, climate justice and energy coordinator at Friends of the Earth Europe. “This target is in line neither with climate science nor with climate justice.”Thomas Gelin, a campaigner at Greenpeace EU, said the EU had a historical responsibility to cut emissions at home.“The EU’s 2040 climate targets should drive a shift away from fossil fuels, starting with an EU ban on new fossil fuel projects, towards renewables and energy saving, to cut people’s energy bills, make their homes easier to heat and cool, and clean the air they breathe,” he said. “Instead, the European Commission relies on dodgy accounting and offshore carbon laundering to pretend to hit the lower bound of what its climate scientists advise.”GUARDN-112845535GUARDN2025urn:contentItem:6G5P-T2M3-RRRY-030M-00000-001386202025-07-021:52 PM GMTCopyright 2025 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

In fact, we are paying for a bad 'karma' we did not create," he said, adding: "We have been penalised the mistakes we never made, for the crimes we never committed."Deuba also highlighted Nepal's position that many vulnerable states were not able to meet their obligations under international human rights law as actions and emissions arising from beyond their territories also affected the specific rights of their citizens.He made these remarks in reference to human rights law-related obligations of states in connection with climate change, the report said.&amp;#160;Source: The Kathmandu Post website, Kathmandu, in English 0120 GMT 11 Dec 24BBCMIR-DEC1124FST6142BBCMIR2024urn:contentItem:6DMC-VF51-JC8S-C15C-00000-00109622024-12-11Copyright 2024 British Broadcasting Corporation All Rights ReservedBBC Monitoring South Asia - Political Supplied by BBC Worldwide MonitoringDecember 11, 2024 WednesdayTranscriptNews TranscriptsENGLISHBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0LegislationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhGMTVENjdEQTUzNDVGMDlBMjQzMTE3MDRCQ0UwQUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0LegislationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhGMTVENjdEQTUzNDVGMDlBMjQzMTE3MDRCQ0UwQUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAInternational LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0TribunalsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkIxQTU1MkJBMEY1NDY4MDhBODUxRTJBNjVCREFDRDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjhBNEU2OUVGMEJGNDQzNUFEODk2MUY5QTRFMThCQjUST0008ZBXINTERNATIONAL LAWST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEN922110EMINTERNATIONAL COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALSST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSSTX000298CITIZENSHIPN921000CCGOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICESSTX000873HUMAN RIGHTSN928000CCINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp; NATIONAL SECURITYSTX002017NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; FOREIGN RELATIONSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001429PUBLIC HEARINGSSTX001932CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONSSTX001021GLACIERS &amp; ICEBERGSST000DLOJGOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERSSTX000950INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSN928120MMSTATE DEPARTMENTS &amp; FOREIGN SERVICESSTX001424PUBLIC BROADCASTINGGX229KATHMANDU, NEPALGC378NEPALGT113ASIAGR134SOUTHERN ASIA
Brazil’s president signs environmental ‘devastation bill’ but vetoes key articles [1]

The project has been championed by the president, but heavily criticised by environmentalists.Groups such as the NGO SOS Mata Atlântica welcomed the vetoes , but said they would carry out a detailed review of both the discarded and remaining provisions “to continue mobilising civil society and ensure that congress upholds the gains secured”.ActionAid’s climate justice specialist, Jessica Siviero, said that “a full veto was essential, but the points that were struck down still represent progress”.Mighty Earth’s global director, João Gonçalves, also welcomed Lula’s vetoes and said he hoped congress would uphold them, warning that “if this destructive bill becomes law – just weeks ahead of Cop30 in Belém – it threatens to erode Brazil’s credibility on the global stage.”At Friday’s press conference, Lula’s ministers appeared careful not to criticise congress, stating that there were “positive” elements in the bill, which had been backed by agribusiness and mining interests as a way to “cut red tape” and “speed up” licensing procedures.“We hope to be able to streamline licensing processes without compromising their quality, which is essential for environmental protection at a time of climate crisis, biodiversity loss and desertification,” said Silva.Should Congress overturn the president’s vetoes, environmentalists and legal experts have warned the move could trigger a wave of lawsuits – both challenging the legislation itself and contesting projects approved through self-licensing – on the grounds that they violate Brazil’s constitution.GUARDN-113695241GUARDN2025urn:contentItem:6GFM-W683-RT3V-3393-00000-001386202025-08-088:54 PM GMTCopyright 2025 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

  Instance 1: Despite explanatory plaques, booklets and other apologetic scripts being produced around the mural for years, the museum decided that hungry members of the public simply couldn't be trusted to eat next to such art. You can once more view them, but only in the context of an installation "contextualising" (ie condemning) the work.Likewise, Sir Stanley Spencer's The Resurrection, Cookham has been quietly fled away into storage after critics suggested he had used images from a "National Geographic magazine" to paint the black fgures, instead of using people he knew - despite the obvious lack of black people to befriend in 1920s Cookham.Museums are not supposed to be entertainment factories, serving the political whims of our cultural elite. These institutions seem to have forgotten their duty to curate and conserve art history in its entirety, without layering modern political fashions on to the past.In her book published last year, Gathering of Strangers, Balshaw insisted that "we should not go back to the turn of the 20th century and the Victorian civilising mission that motivated many museums", but instead look to the heroes of climate justice for direction as to which content should end up on the walls of our museums.A choice between the Victorians and Just Stop Oil? I know which exhibition I'd rather go to.TELEGR-205934026TELEGR2025urn:contentItem:6GCV-G9D3-S529-K48N-00000-0081092025-07-31Copyright 2025 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited All Rights ReservedThe Daily Telegraph (London)Edition 1, National EditionJuly 31, 2025 ThursdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHCC000475PNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINEST000D73FEUROPEAN UNIONNational EditionSTX002003ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICSSTX000777LGBTQ+ PERSONSST000DTO5POLITICAL ACTIVISMST000DQGECOVID CORONAVIRUSST0009QD4NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWSST000DTNMACTIVISMST0009UKPPAINTINGST000DKY8BREXITST000D73FEUROPEAN UNIONST0009VC0ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERSN712110MMMUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIESSTX001482RESTAURANTSST0009UKPPAINTINGST0009VC0ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERSGX106LONDON, ENGLANDST00099QFEUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATESGT115EUROPEGC329UNITED KINGDOMEducation LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0MuseumsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA2Q0M0NzJERDUwNDE0OEE2QjYzQTc0NUFFRDJFMjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTYStudent ElectionsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDY2NUJBODlCNzU1NDc2RTkzMDc4MjlFRTM1RUI2Q0Y7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzU5NjgzNzQ4QjkzNERBMjkxNjhBODEyMDQ1NjU1MzIResidency RequirementsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzNGRTQxOThBNUMyNDFCN0I5QjU4MEZERTY3OERCRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDQxNkZCNUM0Nzc0NEYwQkEwNDc5QUQxRTUzODEyNjE

Five Climate Leaders scholarships are offered every year, worth £5,000 per year of study, for students wanting to boost community engagement around climate change. And the next generation of climate-change activists can apply to Sussex&amp;apos;s new BA in climate justice, sustainability and development, which is recruiting its first students in the new admissions cycle. The university is practising what it preaches, committing to giving more than 42% of the land on its Sir Basil Spence-designed campus, which borders the South Downs, over to nature by 2027. One of the 1960s generation of universities, Sussex has plenty of the distinctive architecture for which the period was renowned, but there are also 2,000 new student rooms under development to help keep the university fresh and modern.
  Instance 2: The £2 Sussex Saver meal initiative has helped cut the cost of living, with 87,000 saver meals eaten in the past 12 months. A further 2,000 discounted meals - such as free breakfasts during exam time - have also been served. In the same vein as the new degree in climate justice, sustainability and development (see Overview above), a BSc in economics and sustainable development is also being offered for the first time in 2026. This will explore the dynamics of environmental change, human wellbeing and economic growth.Admissions, teaching and student supportMore than one in five students gaining places at Sussex last September did so with a contextual offer. These reduce a standard offer on all courses bar medicine by two to three grades for eligible applicants, which roughly translates to offers of BCC at A-level for first-year degree entry and CDD for entry into integrated foundation years.

The barrels, painted in bright, original designs, serve as practical tools for stormwater management by capturing rainwater, reducing runoff, and helping prevent property damage. Each barrel diverts an estimated 2,220 gallons of water annually from the city's overburdened drainage system."As we observe the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, we're not just reflecting, we're responding with action," said Deanna Rodriguez, president and CEO of Entergy New Orleans. "This initiative reflects Entergy's commitment to resilience, not just as a company, but as a neighbor - helping families reduce the impact of heavy rainfall."Laura Jayne, a Hollygrove resident and staff member at Loyola University, had been waiting nearly a year to receive a rain barrel for her home. She welcomed the delivery on Wednesday morning."I have been wanting to get a rain barrel for a very long time," said Jayne.
  Instance 3: She welcomed the delivery on Wednesday morning."I have been wanting to get a rain barrel for a very long time," said Jayne. "Even though I have not experienced extreme flooding, I think the rain barrels are great to help prevent potential flooding."Since its founding in 2006, Green Light New Orleans has distributed and installed more than 3,000 rain barrels across the city. The barrels not only provide cost savings to residents but also reduce stress on drainage infrastructure and contribute to the city's long-term climate goals."Entergy has been a partner with Green Light New Orleans since we first started in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and we deeply appreciate this enduring partnership," said Dr. Christian Ryan, executive Director at Green Light New Orleans. "Together, we're working to help New Orleans residents make small changes that have a big impact."This initiative is part of Entergy's broader commitment to community investment and environmental stewardship.
  Instance 4: Over the last two decades since Katrina's devastation, Entergy shareholders have invested $ 95 million to support nonprofit organizations in Orleans Parish while our employees in the area have completed more than 130,000 hours of volunteer service.In partnership with Rebuilding Together New Orleans, Entergy will hold another employee-driven Day of Service on Aug. 29, commemorating the 20th anniversary of Katrina. That initiative will focus on home weatherization efforts to improve energy efficiency and lower utility costs for some of the city's most vulnerable residents.Through acts of service and community partnership, Entergy continues to honor the past while investing in a safer, more resilient future for New Orleans.For more information about Entergy's restoration efforts following Hurricane Katrina, visit entergy.com/Katrina20.About Entergy New OrleansEntergy New Orleans provides electricity to approximately 209,000 customers in Orleans Parish, Louisiana.

  Instance 2: Even two decades later it feels relevantStar Rating: 4 starsWhat makes a disaster into a tragedy? It’s a question that looms large over the five episodes of this gripping and frequently upsetting series exploring the events that overwhelmed New Orleans in late August 2005. According to the community organiser and survivor Malik Rahim, the answer is simple: “A tragedy is when we fail to do what we should be doing.” Hurricane Katrina ’s size and ferocity meant that it was probably always going to be a disaster. Traci A Curry’s documentary explores the man-made element of the catastrophe.This isn’t the first epic series to tackle this subject and it isn’t quite the best. Made in Katrina’s immediate aftermath, Spike Lee’s 2006 masterpiece When the Levees Broke was a polemic wrenched from the soul, mining furious energy from the proximity of the event.

  Instance 4: Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time is more reflective and less visceral as those at the heart of the story now bear witness at two decades’ remove. The dominant tone has shifted from anger to resigned sadness.All the same, it still packs a powerful punch. Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time tells its story in linear fashion, as if laying out a legal prosecution case. First, it shows that there was no excuse for the city to be as unprepared as it was. New Orleans actually got lucky with Katrina.
  Instance 5: It helped to usher in the presidency of Barack Obama. But viewed from the perspective of 2025, it looks like a series of early warnings that weren’t heeded.Subsequently, the horror has been parlayed into an opportunity for some – in the final episode, we’re shown a gentrified and sanitised city, with Katrina survivors scattered  to all corners of the country. Like Netflix’s recent Grenfell: Uncovered, Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time is ultimately a story of betrayal. People largely responded to impossible situations with courage, kindness and forbearance. Stories of heroism rooted in community spirit abound.
  Instance 6: The survivors were, to their fury, called “refugees”. Even the insurance settlements favoured rich over poor. Rightly, Rahim is given the last word: “We are the canaries in this coalmine called America.” Eventually, Hurricane Katrina went beyond disaster and even tragedy and entered the realm of scandal. This documentary feels timely and resonant because, 20 years on, it still seems like unfinished business.

  Instance 3: “On the surface, New Orleans is still the New Orleans of our imagination, where there’s Bourbon Street, the French Quarter and you’re drinking in the middle of the day outside,” says the Oscar-nominated director Traci A Curry. “But for the people of this place, the people who know it, there’s New Orleans before Katrina and after Katrina. A lot of us who experienced it as spectators think of it as something that happened to America – and it wasn’t.”Curry’s solo directorial debut, Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time, re-examines the epic storm 20 years later. The five-part series, which was made for National Geographic and counts Ryan and Zinzi Coogler and Sev Ohanian as producers, isn’t a requiem in the vein of When the Levees Broke – Spike Lee’s superlative series that was just one of many works that informed this project – Curry says. Rather, it’s a tragedy thriller told through forensic analysis.
  Instance 4: Former New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin, who was made a scapegoat for the Katrina aftermath, was one high-level authority figure that the production team pursued for the film – but ultimately he declined to be interviewed. Also left out is Kanye West’s George W Bush slam or other impressions from pop culture that might reframe the disaster through that lens. Any digression in that direction, tempting as it surely must have been, probably would have distracted from Race Against Time’s central thesis: that Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath were born from a series of compounding failures, starting with the failure to protect Louisiana’s coastline. Ivor van Heerden, a respected marine scientist who warned the public and government officials about the region’s potential for a devastating hurricane long before Katrina hit, blames the booming oil and gas industry for hollowing out the wooded wetlands that once gave New Orleans some natural cover.That left the city’s levee system, the slapdash work of the US army corps of engineers, to absorb the brunt of the wind and storm surge. But long before those barriers gave way to river and lake water that wound up submerging 80% of New Orleans, Nagin could have helped himself and so many others by not waiting until the 11th hour to evacuate the city – essentially leaving New Orleans’ many elderly, infirm and poor residents scrambling.
  Instance 5: Each disaster is a reminder of not only how ill-prepared we are for such events, still, but also of how hesitant we remain to reckon with the root causes that are only going to make future weather catastrophes that much more devastating – especially in Black and low-income communities , which are still suffering in the aftermath of Katrina.“I hope this series makes us realize the urgency of recognizing that these things are going to continue to happen,” Curry says. “I know this is sort of a dirty word these days, but we need to think about equity in the way we approach preparation for disasters. Because if we center the needs of the most vulnerable people, it’s going to help everybody.”                                            Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time premieres on 27 July on National Geographic and will be available on Disney+ and Hulu afterward                                         This article was amended on 28 July 2025.

Plus, a gripping five-part documentary series to mark 20 years since the horrific Gulf of Mexico storm                     Pick of the WeekChief of War                   An epic history lesson, courtesy of the mountainous Jason Momoa. When we first meet Ka’iana (Momoa) he is something of a loner, capturing a shark with his bare hands and some rope.
  Instance 2: The drama is based on true events and great care has evidently been taken to present an authentic version of this undertold story. It is steeped in Polynesian cultural practices but it is also full of universal, action-adventure staples – namely, political machinations that periodically dissolve into prolonged outbreaks of expertly choreographed, frequently blood-curdling violence. Phil HarrisonApple TV+, from Friday 1 August***                     Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time                   Twenty years have now passed since the horrifying events surrounding Hurricane Katrina, but this gripping series brings the trauma back to life in visceral style. What began as an appalling natural disaster soon became a national crisis then an outrage of governmental negligence and structural racism which came to embody – and irrevocably taint – the final years of George W Bush’s presidency. To watch the footage now is to be reminded of how close even the most seemingly advanced societies are to breakdown and chaos.

New dramas and documentaries are set to keep TV fans entertained this week -but Rob Brydon will keep them on the edge of their seats.

  Instance 2: The Gavin and Stacey star fronts Destination X, a new game show airing on BBC One pushing thirteen individuals out of their comfort zone as they take a road trip through Europe. Davina McCall and Nicky Campbell, on the other hand, return to ITV as they catch up with foundlings from previous episodes, while Dan Snow and Kate Lister explore Pompeii for 5. Elsewhere, National Geographic and Disney+ offer an insight into the lives of those who survived Hurricane Katrina 20 years ago. But that's not all you can expect on your screens this week -get the lowdown. I Am Raquel Welch                   Saturday, Sky DocumentariesMore than a pin-up, Raquel Welch redefined what it meant to be a leading lady.
  Instance 3: Using only Facebook to gather clues, she launched a digital hunt for justice across continents. This gripping true crime documentary delves into obsession, grief and determination through one woman's search for justice. Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time                   Sunday on National Geographic, Monday on Disney+In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina tore through southeastern Louisiana, becoming one of the deadliest and most devastating natural disasters in the US. This raw five-part series brings viewers back to one of America's darkest times -when lives were lost and a city was nearly drowned. Told through the testimonies of survivors, this programme doesn't just recount events, it relives them.

  Instance 3: 24,25Hurricane Katrina scarred me... I hope I'm never that broken againTwenty years ago, one of the US's worst tropical storms devastated New Orleans. Now, ahead of a new documentary about the national tragedy and the Bush government's woeful response, survivor Lucrece Phillips shares her incredible story of rescue and resilience exclusiveJames RamptonTHE MEMORIES of Hurricane Katrina continue to haunt Lucrece Phillips like the most stubborn, malevolent ghost. But there is one particularly heartbreaking recollection of the category 5 storm that devastated New Orleans 20 years ago next month which the poet, singer and community organiser finds impossible to forget - and it involves a baby.When the hurricane, described as "the worst natural disaster ever to hit the US", smashed through the levees and tore up the city, Lucrece, now 62, was unable to escape from her home as a result of a recent operation to repair a broken back and neck.As the flood waters rose menacingly, her house was shaken free from its moorings and started to bob like a cork on the waves.Speaking exclusively to The Express from New Orleans, Lucrece recalls: "There was so much water. It was like opening a faucet.
  Instance 4: "There was a time I couldn't cross over water on a bridge," she explains. "I had to lie down on the floor of the car and ask, 'Are we over the water yet?' All I saw in that water was bodies."Lucrece's story is not unusual despite its ability to shock. Hurricane Katrina was the cataclysm that wiped out not only 80% of the city, but huge numbers of its people. Battering New Orleans with 175mph winds, the tropical cyclone was responsible for at least 1,392 fatalities (the exact number will never be known) and the cost of the damage is said to be a record-breaking $125billion.Lucrece is one of several survivors who recount their heart-rending tales in the new documentary series Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time on National Geographic this Sunday, and also on Disney+.But it was not just the residents who were deeply distressed by the cyclone. Some of the rescuers were just as traumatised.Working for the US Coast Guard, Sara Faulkner pulled 48 people to safety from her helicopter the day after the storm.

Some of the rescuers were just as traumatised.Working for the US Coast Guard, Sara Faulkner pulled 48 people to safety from her helicopter the day after the storm. One rescue is still imprinted in her mind.
  Instance 6: We were human beings who needed help and we weren't getting it from anyone. We were just discarded. We were the only ones who stuck by us."One of the most regrettable aspects of the catastrophe - in a country where extreme weather is not uncommon - is that no official lessons appear to have been learned.Traci A Curry, the director of Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time, says: "We've seen the contours of the Katrina story play out again and again. You have an extreme weather event exacerbated by man-made impacts on the environment. It then encounters an infrastructure that is not prepared for it."The outcome is that the people who are most vulnerable experience the most harm on the front end and are the least able to recover on the back end."Lucrece reflects on the calamity that laid waste to her home city two decades ago.
  Instance 7: Smiling, Lucrece adds: "I came back because I couldn't stay away. I had to come home to the love that I'm used to."?

‘A sweeping catastrophe’: 20 years after Hurricane Katrina, a photo exhibit honors Mississippi victims [6]

Making landfall as a strong category 3, the storm, which was so vast it stretched the length of the Mississippi Gulf coast all the way into Alabama, hit the Mississippi-Louisiana coastal border before continuing northward. Since then, superstorms fueled by the climate crisis have become relatively commonplace in the country, but the impact of Katrina endures to this day.
  Instance 2: But Mississippi, which received the maximum impact  from the storm surge, was largely left out of the national narrative  around Katrina.It took four weeks  for Fema and the Red Cross to arrive in the majority-Black East Biloxi neighborhood, according to then Ward 2 city councillor Bill Stallworth. About one in every three people  living in the areas hit hardest by the storm were Black.Melody Golding, a photographer from Vicksburg, aimed to document the tragedy in Mississippi, arriving in the hardest-hit part of the state shortly after the storm. Her photos captured the almost unimaginable devastation, pain and grief of survivors and resilience of the people of the Magnolia state, who came together to rebuild.Her new photo exhibit, Hurricane Katrina: Mississippi Remembers, at the two Mississippi museums in Jackson, looks back at the storm that changed the region some 20 years ago. On view through November, the free exhibit includes both Golding’s photographs and artifacts from the Mississippi department of archives and history.“[These photographers] are my personal witness to the events of this sweeping and non-discriminating catastrophe,” reads Golding’s artist statement that accompanies the exhibit.“It is an incomplete visual recording of the Mississippi coastline, all of which was very nearly wrung of life and hope after the storm. These images radically simplify what really happened.

With New Orleans's natural defences of swamps and wetlands already depleted by the side-efects of the fossil-fuel industry, shoddy workmanship left the breaching of the city's levees a matter of when rather than if.Higher-ranking contributors may be absent, but those who are interviewed - frst responders, Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) reps, residents - allow for a ground-level view of the calamity. Tonight's frst two episodes (the whole series is also on Disney+) address the storm and its aftermath, as people are rescued from rooftops and the city's Superdome, used as a shelter, is quickly overwhelmed.

Deadly storm that destroyed 80% of city and killed hundreds marks 20th anniversary [8]

But there is one particularly heartbreaking recollection of the category 5 storm that devastated New Orleans 20 years ago which the poet, singer and community organiser finds impossible to forget. It involves a baby.When the hurricane described as “the worst natural disaster ever to hit the US” smashed through the levees and tore up the city, Lucrece was unable to escape from her home after a recent operation to repair a broken back and neck.
  Instance 2: "There was a time I couldn't cross over water on a bridge,” she explains. “I had to lie down on the floor of the car and ask, ‘Are we over the water yet?’ All I saw in that water was bodies.”Lucrece’s story is not unusual despite its ability to shock. Hurricane Katrina was the cataclysm that wiped out not only 80% of the city, but huge numbers of its people. Battering New Orleans with 175mph winds, the tropical cyclone was responsible for at least 1,392 fatalities and damage estimated at $125billion – the costliest storm on record to hit the US.Lucrece is one of several survivors who recount their heart-rending tales in the new documentary series Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time on National Geographic this Sunday, and on Disney+. But it was not just the residents who were deeply distressed by the cyclone.

Battering New Orleans with 175mph winds, the tropical cyclone was responsible for at least 1,392 fatalities and damage estimated at $125billion – the costliest storm on record to hit the US.Lucrece is one of several survivors who recount their heart-rending tales in the new documentary series Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time on National Geographic this Sunday, and on Disney+. But it was not just the residents who were deeply distressed by the cyclone. Some of the rescuers were equally affected.Misinformation swirled around the city about the conduct of the 30,000 people who took shelter in the Superdome and the National Guard were called in Working for the US Coast Guard, Sara Faulkner pulled 48 people to safety from her helicopter on the first day after the storm.
  Instance 4: If we keep our heads together, we're going to live'." Lucrece was right, of course.The fate of all the people left stranded in New Orleans, however, was jeopardised by the scandalously inadequate official response to the hurricane.Local officials dubbed the painfully slow federal effort "a national disgrace". The disaster was caused as much by people as by nature.For instance, a fleet of buses meant to transport people to safety, which had been promised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency , never showed up.People died of thirst, exhaustion and violence in the days after the storm, and this only intensified the anger directed at George W Bush's government.Some have alleged that racism contributed to the delays in the federal response. For instance, during A Concert for Hurricane Relief, a benefit concert for victims of the hurricane, rapper Kanye West attacked the government's reaction to the crisis, asserting that, "George Bush doesn't care about black people."Lucrece Phillips was unable to escape from her home when Hurricane Katrina hit after a recent operation to repair a broken back and neck Malik Rahim, a community organiser who helped coordinate relief efforts, is still angry about the woeful official response to the carnage. "This didn't have to happen like this, not in America. You can't justify what happened after Katrina."He adds: "What makes a disaster a tragedy?
  Instance 5: We were just discarded. We were the only ones who stuck by us."One of the most regrettable aspects of the catastrophe is that no official lessons appear to have been learned from it.According to Traci A. Curry, the director of Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time, "The storm is something that happened to people in New Orleans in 2005, but it continues to reverberate in their lives 20 years later."She adds: "It can also be very instructive. We've seen the contours of the Katrina story play out again and again."You have an extreme weather event that is exacerbated by man-made impacts on the environment.

What's On [3]
  Instance 1: This nineparter is big on the action and authenticity of Polynesian culture but also digs into the political ambitions and positioning that underlies the bloody violence.ON THE CASE THE GONE BBC Two, Thursday, July 31, 9pm and streaming on BBC iPlayer ¦ THIS excellent Ireland-New Zealand crime drama returns for a second series after a well-received first season. The action picks up immediately after the events of series one as an Irish journalist goes missing in the New Zealand wilderness after investigating notorious unsolved killings. That prompts Irish detective Theo Richter (Richard Flood) and his Kiwi counterpart Diana Huia (Acushla-Tara Kupe) to team up once again to try to find her and solve once and for all the decades-old Mountain Murders.TRAGEDY UNFOLDING HURRICANE KATRINA: RACE AGAINST TIME Disney+, streaming now ¦ IT'S HARD to believe the natural disaster that struck the USA's southern coast and New Orleans so drastically was 20 years ago but this engrossing five-part series reminds us of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. And on top of the more than 100 fatalities and billions of dollars worth of damage, the series also looks at how those awful events were compounded by government negligence and allegations of structural racism which cast a shadow over the final years of George W Bush's presidency. What still shocks is how rapidly and easily normal life is swept away by the power of nature and then the utter chaos left in its aftermath.CLASSIC ADVENTURE THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO U&amp;Drama, Saturday, August 2, 9pm and streaming ¦ ¦ ALEXANDER Dumas's classic tale of love, betrayal and vengeance is brought to vivid life in this rip-snorting, nine-part adaptation.

The homeowners' legal team, Ron Austin Law, scored a huge victory with the court decreeing that Make It Right must hand over vital docs at the discovery stage. The Sun reported that the Inglorious Basterds star has been trying to block having to face deposition, saying that it clashed with his busy movie schedule.Brad was on the list of witnesses but his legal team filed a motion to avoid being deposed.They claimed that the Meet Joe Black star did not have any information to share that would be relevant to the case.
  Instance 3: The motion was ruled moot in June as the discovery process had not yet been completed. Brad's Make It Right Project build 109 house in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans. That area had been particularly devastated by Hurricane Katrina.Those homes were meant to be a savior for the families who lost everything in the Big Easy's poorest neighborhood.However, the homeowners' lawsuit states that many of the houses were not built properly and they've been fighting for years to make Pitt's foundation cover the cost of expensive and major repairs.The foundation is accused of making a mess of its ambitious building project, which was 'deficiently constructed' with 'defective products', according to the suit.Residents Lloyd Francis and Jennifer Decuir filed the first lawsuit in 2018 and it has since been moved to federal court.The organization is accused of fraud, breach of contract, and unfair trade practices.Homeowners have complained of 'toxic mold and high CO2 levels' in the past, which they claim caused health issues.An attorney close to the lawsuit told The Sun, 'This is obviously a very difficult situation for anyone whose home was impacted by this.''This very sad story has been told several times, so hopefully current litigation will hold the people who managed this project responsible.'In 2022 the celeb-backed eco-charity Global Green agreed to pay a $20.5 million settlement on behalf of Make It Right and Brad. That has since fallen apart as the charity didn't have the money to pay the settlement and they allegedly assumed Brad would step in and contribute in some way.Pitt has said that he never approved of the Global Green deal. 'Brad had supported Global Green many years ago, so when they approached his team stating "$20.5M in funding" had been secured by their "generous donors," there was interest in considering their proposal,' a spokesperson for Brad told The Hollywood Reporter 2023.'Global Green represented themselves as having already obtained these funds and planned to use them toward resolving all claims in the ongoing lawsuit for the benefit of the homeowners.'MAILON-110139584MAILON2025urn:contentItem:6FD1-7MP3-RT50-70M4-00000-003971352025-03-225:42 PM GMTCopyright 2025 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

The city of New Orleans in Louisiana was the worst impacted due to widespread levee breaches including in its main drainage canals, navigation channels and flood walls. This left most of the city submerged and displaced almost a quarter of a million residents.
  Instance 2: "The US has a tougher regulatory environment, but it has been able to pull communities, funders and technical experts together to do something that is better because more problems are solved and is safer because they're not just building a big wall," he says.

This extensive anniversary series seeks to put that right, digging up terrifying contemporary footage of winds and flooding that would ultimately claim more than a thousand lives, mainly in the southern American city of New Orleans. It's as much about the aftermath as the disaster itself, as residents recall waiting for help from the federal US government… which didn't arrive.
  Instance 2: Scorsese avoids any potential starchiness with his usual fluid style, expertly weaving an engaging tapestry. At the same time, there's a quiet elegance to this lavish film that makes its growing emotional devastation all the more effective.

Wildfires And Severe Thunderstorms Drive Losses To Usd80bn [2]
  Instance 1: In the US, torrential rains led to catastrophic flash flooding in central Texas in July.With the US season for SCS past its peak, the focus for the second half of the year shifts to the North Atlantic hurricane season that typically peaks in early September. Forecasts indicate near- to above-average activity, with three to five major hurricanes - above the long-term average of three.For insurers and exposed communities, the key factor determining the scale of losses is where a hurricane hits. The 20-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina serves as a reminder that tropical cyclones, in particular major hurricanes, pose substantial risk to the eastern and Gulf Coasts of North America, as well as the Caribbean. For coastal communities, preparation and advance resilience are essential to minimise the impact.Balz Grollimund, Swiss Re's Head Catastrophe Perils, says: "Reinsurers not only act as a shock absorber for peak risks. They also have a crucial role to help the world prepare and respond to the growing natural catastrophe risk by understanding, quantifying and transferring the risk.
  Instance 2: Their models and tools pave the way for partnerships in public and private sectors that provide innovative, practical answers and help communities get back on their feet faster."With 60% of annual natural catastrophe insured losses historically occurring in the second half of the year, the period ahead remains fraught with uncertainty. Losses fluctuate greatly year-on-year, with random fluctuations mostly due to natural weather variability.Should current loss trends continue, global insured losses from natural catastrophes in 2025 could exceed Swiss Re Institute's projections of USD 150 billion in 2025 prices.

TRUMP &amp; MUSK FACE BACKLASH ON FLOODS [2]
  Instance 1: Officials in Texas have criticised the weather service, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for failing to provide adequate warnings.The backlash intensified after Grok, an AI tool built by billionaire Musk's XAI, blamed its own creator and the US President for the death toll.Grok said: "Trump's NOAA cuts, pushed by Musk's DOGE, slashed funding 30% and staff 17%, underestimating rainfall by 50% and delaying alerts. This contributed to the floods, killing 27, including 20 Camp Mystic girls. Facts over feelings."Russel Honore, who led the US military response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, said Texas authorities must be quizzed about the warning system and the evacuation plans.He said: "I don't buy into the scenario that politicians are talking about it as acts of God. It's BS. This could have been prevented."Among those still missing after the Guadalupe River broke its banks in central Texas is volunteer fire chief Michael Phillips, whose his vehicle was swept off the road in the raging flood.A photo also emerged yesterday of the 13 girls and counsellors of Camp Mystic's Bubble Inn cabin, which was swept away.The bodies of 10 campers and counsellor Chloe Childress, 18, have been recovered.Counsellor Katherine Ferruzzo and three children are still missing.chris.bucktin @mirror.co.uk @DailyMirror"Trump's NOAA cuts, pushed by Musk's DOGE, slashed funding...

However, manhole covers can be displaced during heavy rainfall due to hydraulic pressure buildup in the sewer or drainage system.The city has been inundated with rain over the past week, receiving more than two inches in one night. Manhole covers, though heavy, are typically not bolted down and can be lifted by the force of rising water.Much of New Orleans sits below sea level, making its drainage system heavily reliant on pumps to remove rainwater.

In New Orleans, where folklore and spiritual traditions run deep, some residents see the manhole covers as more than just mechanical failures.'In our culture, we believe nature gives us signs,' said Marie Johnson, a longtime resident, in an interview with the online magazine HypeFresh.'These videos remind me of stories my grandparents used to tell.'However, levitating manholes are not rare in New Orleans.'I live in New Orleans and work downtown - they do this with every heavy rain,' one user posted on X.Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans on August 29, 2005, causing $125billion in damages.More than 50 breaches in the city's levee system led to flooding that submerged 80 per cent of the city.The city's Sewerage and Water Board operates a complex system designed to manage heavy rainfall. However, as climate change brings more frequent and intense storms, the infrastructure faces mounting pressure.In response to past failures, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers invested $14.5billion to upgrade the city's flood protection system, which is designed to withstand a so-called 100-year flood event.

US Air Force reveals identity of massive aircraft spotted flying over Peterborough [2]

While perhaps not obviously clear while flying above Peterborough, these characteristics make it ideal for operating in hostile environments.C17-Globemaster III’s Roll of Honour: 2005: Flew in vital supplies after Hurricane Katrina in US2010: Transported emergency supplies to Haiti after earthquake in Operation Unified Response2014- ongoing:  Support operations against ISIS2021: Evacuation of US troops from AfghanistanOngoing: Support to NATO allies and partners in various multinational exercises and operations: The C-17 Globemaster III above PeterboroughPETEVT-onecms337af1dd0e134d12968f2c3207726133PETEVT2025urn:contentItem:6G2P-Y273-RXK3-V43W-00000-003442952025-06-18Copyright 2025 JPIMedia Publishing Ltd All Rights ReservedPeterborough TodayJune 18, 2025NewspaperNewspapersENGLISHCC0002J2FBOEING COST000DIRCUS AIR FORCENAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp; SPACE VEHICLE MANUFACTURINGNAICS336412 AIRCRAFT ENGINE &amp; ENGINE PARTS MANUFACTURINGNAICS336411 AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURINGSIC3761 GUIDED MISSILES &amp; SPACE VEHICLESBOE (LSE)BA (NYSE)ST00097CMAIR FORCESST000DIRCUS AIR FORCEN928110MMARMED FORCESSTX002017NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; FOREIGN RELATIONSST00097CUINTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONSN624230CCDISASTER &amp; EMERGENCY RELIEFSTX001463RELIEF ORGANIZATIONSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX000546EARTHQUAKESST00097CMAIR FORCESST000DIRCUS AIR FORCEST000D7JMAIRCRAFTST000A7R6AIRCRAFT PILOTSN928110MMARMED FORCESSTX002257MILITARY AIRCRAFTSTX002166AIRPORT RUNWAYSN511000CCPUBLISHINGGC343UNITED STATESGC508AFGHANISTANGC365HAITI
Nine households control 15% of wealth in Silicon Valley as inequality widens [2]
  Instance 1: The nine wealthiest households in the valley control $683.2bn – a $136bn increase over the past year.At the same time, 110,000 households reported nearly none or no assets.The cost of living in Silicon Valley has risen as well: renters must earn $136,532 to afford an apartment – the highest in the nation.The report ranked San Jose No 4 in “impossibly unaffordable” cities worldwide (after Hong Kong, Sydney and Vancouver). Yet, no cities in Silicon Valley have raised the minimum wage in the past three years. The report finds that 54,582 low-income households do not have access to an affordable home in San Jose and that homelessness grew 8.2% from 2023.When they created the Silicon Valley Pain Index in 2020, shortly after the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, San Jose State University researchers were inspired by the Katrina Pain Index, which aimed to quantify the injustices New Orleans residents faced after Hurricane Katrina. The index continues to show stark racial inequalities.Hispanic workers in San Jose, Sunnyvale and Santa Clara can expect to make 33 cents for every $1 their white peers take home. And although shareholders have voiced commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion, only 3% of employees working in research and development at Apple are Black (compared with 6% Hispanic/Latino, 36% white and 50% Asian).Meanwhile, police violence remains a real concern – even years after the Black Lives Matter protests.

SKMonday Hurricane Katrina: Race Against TimeNational Geographic, 8pm &amp; 9pm If Spike Lee's superlative 2006 mini-series When the Levees Broke was a frst draft of history, this fve-part piece from Traci A Curry is a more refective but no less damning overview of the structural and systemic failures that turned the natural disaster of 2005's 2005's the Hurricane Katrina into a manmade catastrophe. With New Orleans's natural natural With defences of swamps and wetlands already depleted by side efects from the fossil-fuel industry, shoddy workmanship left the breaching of the city's levees a matter matter levees of when rather than if. Interviewees - frst responders, Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) reps, residents - - allow for a ground-level view of the calamity, which killed 1,833 people and caused approximately $161billion in damage.

The PBS series welcomed a guest with an unusual vase with a unique backstory, for expert David Rago to appraise. “It belonged to a gentleman named Jack Sawyer from New Orleans who collected antique glass and he does have an exhibit in the New Orleans Museum,” the guest explained.
  Instance 2: “I had admired the vase and told Jack that’s one of the prettiest things I’ve ever seen. “Well [Hurricane] Katrina hit, a lot of his pieces were lost but this and a bunch of others were saved and he washed them and cleaned them up. “When Jack found out that he was terminally ill, he sent this to me, so that’s all I really know about it.”Read more: Antiques Roadshow guest exclaims ‘hallelujah’ as rare brooches given top valueAntiques Roadshow guest's 'breath taken away' at saved Hurricane Katrina vase's price tag. It was then Rago’s turn to shed some light on the beautiful item, stating that it was a piece of Zsolnay pottery from Budapest with an eosin glaze that “changes as you turn it to the light”. “But what’s really special about this - because the vase itself is OK as far as Zolnay goes - but the metalwork is rather exceptional.
  Instance 3: “But what’s really special about this - because the vase itself is OK as far as Zolnay goes - but the metalwork is rather exceptional. “So we have two full peacocks on the piece, encircling it. Their tails end in the base that covers the entire bottom and then there are glass tiles inset to look like the eyes of the peacock feathers.”He went on to point out that on the bottom of the gilded pewter metal base, it is marked with “Orion” and 272 which is its shape number.An Antiques Roadshow guest was given a Zslonay vase that was rescued from the rubble of Hurricane Katrina. “So I did a little bit of research and it turns out this is a collaboration between a Hungarian Art Nouveau company and a German Art Nouveau company. “Orion was located in Nuremberg, Germany.

It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications."There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up," recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) "They had no medications and no physicians.Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data."Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.INDEXSECTION 1 DIRECT RELIEF FOUNDATION TOP MANAGEMENTSECTION 1 DIRECT RELIEF FOUNDATION TOP MANAGEMENTNameDesignationThomas Tighe,CEO &amp; PresidentJonathan SteinerCFO &amp; Vice President of FinanceMark LinehanDirectorByron ScottDirectorSiri MarshallDirectorDawn LongChief Operating Officer &amp; Senior Vice PresidentPermID: 5053501335Created by www.buysellsignals.com for News Bites FinanceNBPCOM-12082503393537890001108496NBPCOM2025urn:contentItem:6GG8-88J3-RSCK-R33V-00000-004140052025-08-11Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

  Instance 1: The dog, tail wagging furiously, was handed a chew toy, which he proudly carried as he pranced out of the rubble pile.This was a practice run, but realism is key at the SDF's 145-acre training facility in Ventura County, California. The foundation trains dogs for FEMA and state-level rescue operations. Since its founding in 1996 by Wilma Melville, a FEMA-certified canine search specialist who responded during the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, SDF-trained teams have deployed to nearly 300 disasters.Source: Company Website+   TWENTY YEARS AGO, HURRICANE KATRINA TRANSFORMED AMERICAN HEALTHCARE - AND DIRECT RELIEFWhen Janet Mentesane thinks back to the sheer scale of medical need after Hurricane Katrina, her strongest memory isn't of providers treating physical trauma or water-borne diseases.

Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily.
  Instance 3: The fire is currently about 15 percent contained and is impacting rural areas of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties.Direct Relief is based in Santa Barbara County, and has extensive experience responding to wildfires across the state. This week, the organization provided free respirators to residents at multiple locations throughout the county and will continue to respond as air quality needs continue.Source: Company Website++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Created by www.buysellsignals.comNBPCOM-15082520321978130962NBPCOM2025urn:contentItem:6GH3-0XG3-RV2T-00SH-00000-004140052025-08-15Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily.
  Instance 5: Direct Relief staff met with both groups this week to discuss supporting ongoing needs and also met with the Center Point Volunteer Fire Department, where Direct Relief delivered field medic packs that will be integrated into the fire department's response vehicles.Direct Relief staff also met with health organizations responding to flooded communities, including Fronteras Health Center, which has been providing mental health services to first responders. Direct Relief also met with La Esperanza Clinic in San Angelo, Texas, which has been providing mobile healthcare to the community.Source: Company WebsitePermID: 5053501335Created by www.buysellsignals.com for News Bites FinanceNBPBUS-12082518194690670001108496NBPBUS2025urn:contentItem:6GGD-S6T3-RSF8-54K5-00000-004140022025-08-12Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily.
  Instance 5: Direct Relief staff met with both groups this week to discuss supporting ongoing needs and also met with the Center Point Volunteer Fire Department, where Direct Relief delivered field medic packs that will be integrated into the fire department's response vehicles.Direct Relief staff also met with health organizations responding to flooded communities, including Fronteras Health Center, which has been providing mental health services to first responders. Direct Relief also met with La Esperanza Clinic in San Angelo, Texas, which has been providing mobile healthcare to the community.Source: Company WebsitePermID: 5053501335Created by www.buysellsignals.com for News Bites FinanceNBPBUS-12082518194890670001108496NBPBUS2025urn:contentItem:6GGD-S6T3-RSF8-54K6-00000-004140022025-08-12Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

  Instance 1: Quarterly revenue jumped 36 per cent year on year to $US115.4m ($176.9m) as annualised revenue rose 36 per cent, to $US416.1m.The $6.5bn company also lifted full-year guidance, forecasting revenue of between $US462m and $US482m (up from between $US450m and $US480m) and adjusted EBITDA of between $US72m and $US82m (up from between $US65m and $US75m).Local shares of the Nasdaq- and ASX-listed company were up 8.9 per cent to $41.20.Citi analysts, led by Siraj Ahmed, were positive on the result, affirming a "buy" rating and a $90 target price. User growth and a 35 per cent rise in annual revenue per paying customer were reasons for optimism, the broker said. Ms Antonoff said Life360's continued success at a time of budgetary constraint showed the importance of the service, which was founded by Mr Hulls to help families locate each other in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.TWNBUL-021caaca771211f0b2933e42a1565d18aa26da37cd28b8b5824c974c9b6c6630TWNBUL2025urn:contentItem:6GGK-NJW3-RSB5-054Y-00000-004638122025-08-12Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights ReservedTownsville Bulletin (Australia)Townsville EditionAugust 13, 2025 WednesdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHCC0002275CITIGROUP INCNAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKINGNAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUINGNAICS523150 INVESTMENT BANKING AND SECURITIES INTERMEDIATION8710 (TSE)C (BMV)C (NYSE)STX000217BROKER RECOMMENDATIONSSTX001943FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE &amp; REPORTSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAN523210MMSTOCK EXCHANGESST0008XZ7COMPANY REVENUESST000DIJWPRICESSTX000340COMPANY EARNINGSST000A3NTEBITDASTX000691FAMILYST000D1BYEXECUTIVESSTX000944INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTSSTX000714FINANCIAL RATINGSSTX001928COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp; MANAGEMENTSTX000217BROKER RECOMMENDATIONSN523210MMSTOCK EXCHANGESSTX000218BUDGETSSTX000714FINANCIAL RATINGSST000D25YSILICON VALLEY, CA, USASecurities LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Stock ExchangesZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREICredit Rating AgenciesZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTlBNTdBNTBBQjRCNEE5MDgwQTJDNUYzQzc2ODEzRjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjQxRkJCQjEzOTM2NDlGRkExRDE3QTc3MjI1RTQzQzI

It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications."There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up," recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) "They had no medications and no physicians.

(She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) "They had no medications and no physicians. Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data."Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.Source: Company Website+   DIRECT RELIEF MOBILIZES AID FOR THE CANYON FIRE IN VENTURA AND LOS ANGELES COUNTIESDirect Relief is responding to two wildfires in California-supporting communities under evacuation from the rapidly spreading Canyon Fire in Los Angeles County while continuing to address smoke-related health risks from the massive Gifford Fire on the Central Coast.The Canyon Fire, which ignited Thursday near Lake Piru, has burned nearly 5,000 acres. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily.

THE WATCHLIST [2]
  Instance 1: Colman is extraordinary (obviously), and Thewlis matches her beat for beat. A true-crime drama that refuses to play by the genre's rules - weird, elegant, and unlike anything else on TV. I've been thinking about it for years.Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time Netflix Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, this deeply upsetting five-part documentary revisits the disaster and the man-made failures that turned it into a national disgrace. Told through the eyes of survivors, organisers and officials, it lays out how environmental negligence, systemic racism and political inertia collided to produce something far worse than a natural catastrophe. There are wrenching testimonies and shocking footage, with an undercurrent of fury and sorrow.

It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications."There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up," recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) "They had no medications and no physicians.Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data."Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.INDEXSECTION 1 DIRECT RELIEF FOUNDATION TOP MANAGEMENTSECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025SECTION 1 DIRECT RELIEF FOUNDATION TOP MANAGEMENTNameDesignationThomas Tighe,CEO &amp; PresidentJonathan SteinerCFO &amp; Vice President of FinanceMark LinehanDirectorByron ScottDirectorSiri MarshallDirectorDawn LongChief Operating Officer &amp; Senior Vice PresidentSECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025August 05: BD, Direct Relief, and NACHC Award Four U.S.

Almost 20 years later, a new report offers a complex portrait of progress and trade-offs that education policymakers throughout the country are still scrutinizing.The report by Tulane University's Education Research Alliance for New Orleans summarizes more than a decade of research into 12 key lessons from the city's sweeping education reforms.
  Instance 2: In the wake of Katrina, the state of Louisiana took over most of the city's schools, resulting in a system where nearly all public schools became charter schools.The report found that student outcomes improved dramatically following the near-total overhaul of the city's public school system under the new post-Katrina system. Test scores, high school graduation rates and college attendance all rose - sometimes by double digits - after the city shifted almost all public schools to independently operated charter schools governed by performance contracts.Created by www.buysellsignals.com for News Bites FinanceNBPCOM-05062504235537890001104881NBPCOM2025urn:contentItem:6FYS-DCB3-RS2M-X4CM-00000-004140052025-06-04Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

tubi Stone stands up for sisterhood [2]
  Instance 1: 5tubi Stone stands up for sisterhoodNEVER afraid to speak her mind or seek fair compensation for her work, Sharon Stone (pictured) was long labelled a diva. However, as some of Hollywood's uglier truths have been exposed in recent years, audiences have come to view the 67-year-old more sympathetically.In the insightful Tubi documentary Sharon Stone: Survival Instinct, the Oscar nominee says of her 30-year career: "I feel like my biggest achievement is surviving, because it's a big deal to survive in a business such as this." Stone recently made headlines again when a 2023 interview with industry website Deadline resurfaced, in which she highlighted Hollywood's pay gap."When I did Basic Instinct, Michael Douglas made $14 million and I made $500,000," Stone said. "Last year, there was a $100 million film being made by a studio, and the actor, who was new, was going to be paid something like $8 million or $9 millionâ€¦ and the studio offered me again $500,000 to be the female leadâ€¦ So, I don't think it has changed much." You can appreciate Stone's ability to defy expectations in the following films: Sharon Stone: Survival Instinct: This doco explores how Stone became Hollywood's modern-day bombshell.The Quick And The Dead: Stone joins gun-slinging heavyweights Russell Crowe, Gene Hackman and Leonardo DiCaprio in this underappreciated western directed by Sam Raimi.Streets Of Blood: Set in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, this 2009 film sees Stone play a therapist trying to help shattered police detectives deal with their struggles amid the disaster.Now streaming on Tubitubitv.com Watch for freeHERSUN-HeraldSun20250615HeraldSunTV5000493078409HERSUN2025urn:contentItem:6G21-WGW3-S1MF-D347-00000-002447842025-06-15Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights ReservedHerald Sun (Australia)HeraldSunTV EditionJune 15, 2025 SundayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHST000A5F8ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSESSTX000268CELEBRITIESST000D7R3GENDER EQUALITYST000A5JPFILM DIRECTORSST000CRWXEQUAL PAYST000DHZPACADEMY AWARDSST0009V6IDOCUMENTARY FILMSST0009IR9ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDSSTX001932CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONSST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAST0009F7UHURRICANESSTX001763TROPICAL STORMSST000A5F8ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSESSTX000268CELEBRITIESST000A5JPFILM DIRECTORSST000DHZPACADEMY AWARDSST0009V6IDOCUMENTARY FILMSST0009IR9ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDSPE000DE1WMICHAEL DOUGLASPE000DORYRUSSELL CROWEPE000A38PLEONARDO DICAPRIO

  Instance 1: The $6.5bn company also lifted full-year guidance, forecasting revenue of between $US462m and $US482m (up from between $US450m and $US480m) and adjusted EBITDA of between $US72m and $US82m (up from between $US65m and $US75m).Local shares of the Nasdaq- and ASX-listed company were up 8.9 per cent to $41.20.Citi analysts, led by Siraj Ahmed, were positive on the result, affirming a "buy" rating and a $90 target price. User growth and a 35 per cent rise in annual revenue per paying customer were reasons for optimism, the broker said. Citi expects another profit beat, given it tends to do better in the second half, making its guidance appear conservative.Founded by Mr Hulls as a service that could help families locate each other in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Life360's continued success in the "anxiety economy" and at a time of budgetary constraint showed how important the service was to its customers, Ms Antonoff said."There are things that people give up first and that people give up last, and we are proving to be in the latter category," she said."We are not a luxury, we are medicine for the soul." Ms Antonoff, 55, who has worked at Microsoft and GoDaddy, has an 18-year-old son who has just qualified for his driver's licence and a 26-year-old daughter living interstate.She said she was introduced to tracking devices after the family dog ran away (it was found two days later). "I started to research trackers, and actually said to my husband â€¦ how I should go work on something like that. About a month later, Life360 called." The new pet-specific tracking products and advertising business - where Life360 struck a deal with Uber to ping Life360 customers with Uber ads when at the airport, for example - hopefully would become key pillars of the company one day, she said."Brands are interested and hungry for the (ad) product.
  Instance 2: "I'm excited about the trajectory that we're on and the things that we're doing, whether it be ads on the revenue side or pets on the member side. There's no end in sight to the value that we can create for members and shareholders." Life360 has taken "remote work to the next level" at a time of discussion over proposed work from home laws in Victoria. "After the pandemic, I got to experience how it really could be productive, and I liked it for myself," Ms Antonoff said.THEAUS-021caaca771211f0b2933e42a1565d1864e5ede4b75999e55ee72166ffe16279THEAUS2025urn:contentItem:6GGK-NJW3-RSB5-04PJ-00000-002447772025-08-12Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights ReservedThe AustralianAustralian EditionAugust 13, 2025 WednesdayNewspaperNewspapersENGLISHCC0002275CITIGROUP INCCC0002QN2MICROSOFT CORPCC0009LLQGODADDY INCNAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKINGNAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUINGNAICS523150 INVESTMENT BANKING AND SECURITIES INTERMEDIATIONSIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARENAICS513210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERSNAICS541519 OTHER COMPUTER RELATED SERVICESSIC7371 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICESSIC7379 COMPUTER RELATED SERVICES, NEC8710 (TSE)C (BMV)C (NYSE)MSFT (NASDAQ)GDDY (NYSE)STX000217BROKER RECOMMENDATIONSSTX001943FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE &amp; REPORTSST0009R5PHURRICANE KATRINAN523210MMSTOCK EXCHANGESST0008XZ7COMPANY REVENUESST000DIJWPRICESSTX000340COMPANY EARNINGSST000A3NTEBITDASTX000691FAMILYST000D1BYEXECUTIVESSTX000944INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTSSTX000714FINANCIAL RATINGSSTX001928COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp; MANAGEMENTSTX000718FINANCIAL RESULTSSTX000217BROKER RECOMMENDATIONSN523210MMSTOCK EXCHANGESSTX000218BUDGETSSTX000714FINANCIAL RATINGSST000D25YSILICON VALLEY, CA, USAST0009UE1SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREABusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Successor CorporationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0VCQkUyRUUwQzY2NDgyRjhCMzI0RTlDMTRCMjMxRUQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjJDNzk5M0ZFMDA0NERDQUFGN0RFNkIzMkM3NjdFNEELabor &amp; Employment LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTE3QUQwOTA0MUYzNDlCMEFFMjUwRUNDM0RDRkM5QzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Successor CorporationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0VCQkUyRUUwQzY2NDgyRjhCMzI0RTlDMTRCMjMxRUQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjJDNzk5M0ZFMDA0NERDQUFGN0RFNkIzMkM3NjdFNEE

It now expects revenue to be between $US462 million and $US482 million, up from prior guidance of $450 million to $480 million. While adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will be between $US72 million and $US82 million, up from $US65 million to $US75 million.While teenagers can dislike being tracked, a TikTok trend known as "fambushing" has emerged where kids track their parents' location and surprise them.Passing the batonHulls, who came up with the idea for the app while watching footage of separated families following Hurricane Katrina, reassured investors on Tuesday he would still be employed full-time to work on products and strategy.Asked by RBC analyst Wei-Weng Chen why Antonoff would be a better CEO than him, Hulls offered a candid response."I am someone who works in bursts of creativity, but as a public company, you need consistency. I have pretty, pretty severe ADHD. That's a pretty common founder trait, and it takes a lot out of me to be really consistent," he said."Lauren enjoys the systems and scaling process that I quite frankly don't really like and am not gifted at.

Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily.

  Instance 1: Don't let others take charge of it".The newsroom was a very colourful place back then, Mike said in a phone interview about the book."We had real characters," he said.Mike's dad still worked out the back, the building was full of "colourful characters" and grumpy journalists would suddenly come alive after a lunchtime visit to the pub.Mike's career in journalism would take him around the world, from drug tunnels in Mexico to the frontlines of the Arab Spring, as rebels shot down planes and overthrew Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.There were good times and bad. Mike was in New York when the two World Trade Centre towers fell on September 11, followed Barack Obama around America for his historic 2008 election victory and he  witnessed the rise  of Donald Trump.'I have all the guns ... in the car'Bendigo pops up again and again in Mike's book, often in the most unexpected places.The then-Chanel 7 journalist was troubled when covering 1997's Port Arthur Massacre to learn an Advertiser print mechanic Doug Hutchinson had been caught up in the carnage.The killer had shot Doug in the arm."A lovely man, Doug was too traumatised to talk to me about it," Mike writes.One particular Bendigo resident even got an unexpectedly up-close look at the foreign correspondent's work."This place is mad," Mike's dad Neil would say of New Orleans, after the pair's 2005 US road trip was cut short by Hurricane Katrina.Mike and Neil had been holidaying in California when the levy banks burst in New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward, unleashing monstrous walls of water that flooded 80 per cent of the city.Neil tagged along as Mike and cameraman Trent Miller barrelled into the disaster zone to find a second catastrophe in the form of a lacklustre response from government authorities.It was complete anarchy. A police officer with a rich southern drawl told them: "Son, I have all the guns I own in the car right now. And even I would not go downtown".'I don't talk about it'Neil helped Mike and Trent reach Australians who were trapped in the city, but he did not want to stay."We had to put him on a plane pretty quickly because he saw dead bodies, and he was kind of disgusted by the treatment of people over there [by American authorities]," Mike said in his interview with the Advertiser.Mike and Trent ended up saving multiple groups of Aussies that neither the Americans nor the Australian embassy seemed capable of reaching.It was a rare insight for Mike's family into the work that foreign correspondents see.So was the new book.

Milton has vacillated between a category four and five event, with category five reserved for those hurricanes of at least 252km/h.What preparations are taking place?Schools and workplaces have been closed, and evacuation orders for a million people around Tampa and Florida's east coast have been put in place. Those who are staying have been warned to get to higher ground.The most dire warning came from Florida's Attorney-General Ashley Moody, who suggested people who ignored evacuation orders would very possibly die."You probably need to write your name in permanent marker on your arm so that people know who you are when they get to you afterwards," she said.How does Hurricane Milton compare to Hurricane Katrina?Milton's wind speed has been as high as 290km/h but more recently dropped to a still-astonishing 270km/h.

How young people have taken climate justice to the world's international courts [7]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6G9T-8YH3-RRXH-N1Y7-00000-00How young people have taken climate justice to the world's international courts2025-07-21T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:58ZLexisNexisHow young people have taken climate justice to the world's international courtsSusan Ann Samuel, PhD Candidate, School of Politics and International Studies, University of LeedsFour international courts are due to deliver advisory opinions on how governments are legally responsible for climate justice.Youth activist organisations including Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change and World Youth for Climate Justice recently coordinated massive online calls across two different time zones. These two global gatherings were in preparation for a coordinated global youth movement around the release of the most anticipated advisory opinion scheduled to be delivered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on July 23 2025. An advisory opinion is a legal interpretation provided by a high-level court or tribunal with a special mandate, in response to a specific question of law.
  Instance 2: I like to think of it as a northern star - it won't change the reality but can guide potential outcomes and pave the way for future change.As one of hundreds of participants attending both the online meetings, plus in my capacity as a researcher investigating the role of youth in climate law and politics, this collective action feels momentous. The movement for an advisory opinion to ICJ began in 2019 when a few brave young people from the Pacific Islands stood up for the world. Twenty-seven law students at the Vanuatu campus of the University of South Pacific convinced their nation to champion climate action and accountability to the entire world by bringing climate justice to the world court. For these students in the Pacific, the climate crisis means losing their identity, their culture and their homes to the rising sea levels and weather catastrophes. To the young people across the globe - including me - the concern about not being heard by world leaders becomes a shared reality, even though it is our future at stake.
  Instance 3: The world is at a turning point. For the first time, four world courts or tribunals across four continents are being asked to clarify nations' legal obligations in the face of the climate crisis. The ICJ's advisory opinion is the centrepiece: but it sits within a broader push primarily by global youth and developing countries - to clarify what human rights, state responsibility and climate justice mean in law. A "quartet" of advisory opinions now spans four judicial bodies: the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the ICJ, and the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights. See the diagram below to check the timeline of each court proceeding.
  Instance 4: Their influence in empowering states across the globe to embody climate leadership is critical to pushing for political action, even amid geopolitical realities.Tracing climate litigation patterns suggests that youth are changing the environmental governance space: as youth litigators (both young lawyers and youth-led cases), youth negotiators and youth activists. Youth across these three spheres - law, politics and activism - are mutually reinforcing each other in their advocacy, unlike ever before. Themes of climate justice in litigation, negotiation, and social movements are deeply interconnected, rather than isolated from one another. Youth, who are active across all these spheres, often serve as key advocates, thereby reshaping governance dynamics in the processThe push for justice by youth is palpable, despite growing political concerns across the globe. Youth remains the common face of vulnerability, agency and promise.

FED:Climate justice push turns to leaders after court loss [3]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6G8H-D113-S89G-H3RY-00000-00FED:Climate justice push turns to leaders after court loss2025-07-16T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:58ZLexisNexisFED:Climate justice push turns to leaders after court lossBRISBANE July 16  Political leadership is needed on climate change, experts say following the rejection of a landmark case in the Federal Court. On Tuesday, the court rejected the case led by Uncle Pabai Pabai and Uncle Paul Kabai, which argued the Commonwealth owed a duty of care to protect their Torres Strait homelands from the impacts of climate change. The uncles filed the landmark case against the government in the Federal Court in 2021, seeking orders from the court that would require the government to take steps to prevent harm to their communities, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with the best available science.
  Instance 2: The case failed, Justice Wigney said, because negligence law does not allow compensation when it comes to government policy decisions. "That will remain the case unless and until the law in Australia changes, either by the incremental development or expansion of the common law by appellant courts or by the enactment of legislation," Justice Wigney said. "Until then, the only real avenue available to those in the position of the applicants and other Torres Strait Islanders, involves public advocacy and protest and ultimately recourse via the ballot box."   La Trobe University anthropology lecturer Aidan Craney, whose work is focused on understanding social change in the Pacific Islands region, said the decision shows the need for political leadership on climate justice. Dr Craney said the government's reaction to the case could influence Australia's relationships in the Pacific.

On Tuesday, the court rejected the case led by Uncle Pabai Pabai and Uncle Paul Kabai, which argued the Commonwealth owed a duty of care to protect their Torres Strait homelands from the impacts of climate change. The uncles filed the landmark case against the government in the Federal Court in 2021, seeking orders from the court that would require the government to take steps to prevent harm to their communities, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with the best available science.
  Instance 2: The case failed, Justice Wigney said, because negligence law does not allow compensation when it comes to government policy decisions. "That will remain the case unless and until the law in Australia changes, either by the incremental development or expansion of the common law by appellant courts or by the enactment of legislation," Justice Wigney said. "Until then, the only real avenue available to those in the position of the applicants and other Torres Strait Islanders, involves public advocacy and protest and ultimately recourse via the ballot box."   La Trobe University anthropology lecturer Aidan Craney, whose work is focused on understanding social change in the Pacific Islands region, said the decision shows the need for political leadership on climate justice. Dr Craney said the government's reaction to the case could influence Australia's relationships in the Pacific. "How the Australian government responds to this decision may influence the levels of support it receives from the region," he said.

Exploring climate justice within international courts is a step in the right direction.Climate change lawsuits have become a new way for countries to assert their rights against actions that degrade the environment. But African countries have yet to fully exploit this route. In the Netherlands, the court found that greenhouse gas emissions breached the rights to life and private and family life that are protected by the European Convention on Human Rights.
  Instance 3: These include the duty to avoid polluting the atmosphere and to prevent harm that takes place across borders. These principles have been used by different countries in lawsuits previously. These cases form the legal basis for many climate lawsuits today.The tribunal's advisory opinions are not legally binding, but they also contribute  to the development of international law, and again, could be useful for Africa to assert a strong, unified legal voice in the global fight for climate justice. 3. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate ChangeThis 1992 convention has been ratified by many African states.
  Instance 4: More must follow.Read more: South African communities vs Shell: high court victories show that cultural beliefs and practices count in climate casesAfrica lacks the resources to prevent the worst effects of climate change and recover from the damage caused by global warming. African countries must now take climate lawsuits forward to demand accountability, shape climate policies and safeguard the future. By embracing regional mechanisms like the African court, using international legal instruments, and developing national climate laws, Africa can assert a strong, unified legal voice in the global fight for climate justice.Oluwabusayo Wuraola is a Lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University and also a knowledge expert member of the United Nations Harmony with Nature Programme.CONAFR-256276CONAFR2025urn:contentItem:6FYJ-PGX3-RTVD-62MK-00000-004635852025-06-033:06 PM ESTCopyright 2025 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights ReservedThe Conversation - AfricaJune 3, 2025 TuesdayWeb PublicationWeb-based PublicationsENGLISHBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0LegislationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhGMTVENjdEQTUzNDVGMDlBMjQzMTE3MDRCQ0UwQUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjACivil Rights LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Protected RightsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQLegislationZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhGMTVENjdEQTUzNDVGMDlBMjQzMTE3MDRCQ0UwQUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAEnvironmental JusticeZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkEzN0MzMjlCRTM5NERFRDhFQzU0MDZBRkE1MTQ0RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEIyMDRCRTUzRURFNEQ5MDhBQ0EzNDUwNEE4QUQ0RTcN922110CCLAW COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALSST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTX001648SUITS &amp; CLAIMSST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGESTX000594EMISSIONSSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESN921000CCGOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICESST000D8B1GREENHOUSE GASESST0008ZBXINTERNATIONAL LAWSTX001040LITIGATIONST000D1F5NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSST0009ZGLCLIMATOLOGYSTX001883DECISIONS &amp; RULINGSSTX000873HUMAN RIGHTSST0009J49HUMAN RIGHTS &amp; CIVIL LIBERTIES LAWN922110EMINTERNATIONAL COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALSST000DNUOCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICYN813312MMENVIRONMENTAL &amp; WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONSSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSSTX000104APPEALSSTX000108APPROVALSST00097CHENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTSSTX000639ENVIRONMENTAL LAWST0008ZBZHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSST0008XMRLAW &amp; LEGAL SYSTEMST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSSTX001965SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLEST000DTNMACTIVISMST000A7ISASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONSSTX000691FAMILYSTX001477RESEARCH REPORTSST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSSTX001758TREATIES &amp; AGREEMENTSSTX000594EMISSIONSSTX001900ENERGY &amp; UTILITIESSTX000315COAL FIRED PLANTSN221112MMFOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTSN510000CCMEDIA &amp; TELECOMMUNICATIONSN486000CCPIPELINE TRANSPORTATIONN221110CCELECTRIC POWER PLANTSST000DUF8ENERGY NETWORKSN486110MMCRUDE OIL PIPELINESGX299JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICAGX296PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICAGT111AFRICAGR104EASTERN AFRICAGC322NETHERLANDSGC336SOUTH AFRICAGT115EUROPEGC318GERMANYGC334NIGERIAGC383TANZANIAGC563UGANDA

However, these technical approaches can be inaccessible to the public, failing to capture the experiences of those most affected. Climate narratives structured as stories that involve emotional engagement and personal anecdotes are more effective at mobilising communities, influencing policy and promoting pro-environmental actions across diverse audiences.

They can amplify the voices of affected communities and help make the case for climate justice. In an era where climate action is urgent, harnessing the power of illustration can be transformative. It can challenge dominant narratives while creating more inclusive and participatory ways of understanding climate action.I have been collaborating with Puspita Bahari, an Indonesian fisherwomen's movement to develop ways to communicate the effects of tidal floods and the importance of feminist solidarity.
  Instance 4: By drawing on 38 women's firsthand experiences, we have published an illustrated book: Tidal Floods: Women, Fisheries, and Climate Crisis in Indonesia (2024). This story about Indonesia's fisherwomen explores the intersections of gender, environmental change, activism and the future of the country's coastal regions. Here are five ways that collaborative illustrations can be used to tell female-led climate justice stories: 1. Intersectional narrationThe effects of tidal flooding on Indonesian women vary depending on location, livelihood, age and disability status. Along the coastline, women in Indonesia are involved in selling fish, processing seafood and fishing at sea, alongside domestic work.
  Instance 5: This includes planting crops, building cooperatives and holding demonstrations. Stories can play a role in moving beyond positioning women not just as victims but as people with valuable knowledge and the ability to assert their agency and drive sustainable climate action.5. Reflection and collective ownershipIn an era defined by uncertainty and rapid change, the ability to pause and reflect on climate justice is more valuable than ever. Certain images actively encourage readers to reflect on more tech-driven and infrastructure-focused responses to the climate crisis. The final pages include questions that prompt critical thinking about the links between gender, climate justice and activism.

Certain images actively encourage readers to reflect on more tech-driven and infrastructure-focused responses to the climate crisis. The final pages include questions that prompt critical thinking about the links between gender, climate justice and activism. For example, "what do you think will happen if we do not address the climate crisis?"Rather than extracting knowledge from women, especially those in Global South countries, this book is co-created. Fisherwomen's voices and narratives are central to the storytelling process.
July 08, 2025: Sidley Austin LLP H.R.1: What You Should Know About the Environmental and Energy Provisions in the "One Big Beautiful Bill" Act [2]
  Instance 1: Much of the provisions affect programs and funding originally authorized under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA"), which was former President Biden's signature budget reconciliation bill. Below, we outline some of the key features of the OBBB environmental and energy provisions.Environmental ProvisionsIn an effort to hit topline federal spending reductions, the OBBB includes funding cuts for environmental programs previously appropriated to the EPA. This includes rescinding unobligated balances for the following programs authorized under the IRA:Greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction fund (rescind unobligated balance of the $27 billion appropriated for nonprofit organizations to use for direct and indirect investment in various qualified environmental projects); Environmental and climate justice block grants (rescind unobligated balance of the $2.8 billion for grants related to environmental and climate justice activities);INDEXSECTION 1 SIDLEY AUSTIN LLP RANKINGSECTION 1 SIDLEY AUSTIN LLP RANKINGSidley Austin LLP was ranked 204 in the Forbes list of Top 216 American Private Companies by Total Revenues in 2024.PermID: 4297157801Created by www.buysellsignals.com for News Bites FinanceNBPCOM-1007252332213789000182376NBPCOM2025urn:contentItem:6G7D-J243-RRP7-24J4-00000-004140052025-07-11Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

Namely, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion on the obligations of nation states in respect of climate change. This action, sparked originally by 27 Pacific Island law students at the University of South Pacific campus in Vanuatu, asked the court to rule on the standing of the various international climate change agreements - like the 2015 Paris Agreement - which countries (virtually all of them) have signed up to, and the subsequent obligations that states had to work to reduce their climate emissions.The ICJ ruling is blunt: the multilateral climate change and environmental agreements and treaties that countries-including New Zealand-sign-up for, do contain binding obligations for states in relation to protecting the climate system from greenhouse gas emissions.
Top court rules on legal obligation to fight climate change [2]
  Instance 1: It's been welcomed by environmental groups and legal experts who say it's a victory for small islands in countries suffering from the impacts of high polluting nations. Europe correspondent Bridget Rollason reports.Protesters: What do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now!Bridget Rollason: Outside the Hague's World Court, protesters gathered to witness a historic moment in international law.
  Instance 2: President Iwasawa ruled countries harmed by climate change could be entitled to compensation and sue other countries for damage they've suffered from rising global temperatures.Yuji Iwasawa: The court considers that a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is a precondition for the enjoyment of many human rights, such as the right to life, right to health and the right to an adequate standard of living.Bridget Rollason: The landmark 500-page ruling is non-binding, but it's seen as a potential turning point in international climate law. It's been welcomed by environmental groups and legal experts, who say it's a victory for small islands and countries taking legal action against big polluting nations for failing to reduce their emissions. Senior Attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law, Joie Chowdhry, said the ruling is more than just a powerful symbol.Joie Chowdhury: It could be one of the most consequential legal rulings of our times because of the scope of the issues that it touched, which run to the very heart of climate justice, and could secure a lifeline for climate-affected communities and nations all over the world.Sabra Lane: That's Joie Chowdhury from the Centre for International Environmental Law, ending that report from Bridget Rollason.ABCAM-105565976ABCAM2025urn:contentItem:6GB9-VXF3-RRK1-82PW-00000-004733922025-07-23Copyright 2025 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights ReservedAM(ABC Transcript)July 23, 2025 WednesdayTranscriptNews TranscriptsENGLISHST000D1DRNEGATIVE NEWSST000DRMXENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEST0008XMRLAW &amp; LEGAL SYSTEMST0008X12POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp; REMEDIATIONSTX001849WITNESSESST000DSD8CLIMATE ACTIONSTX000639ENVIRONMENTAL LAWSTX001648SUITS &amp; CLAIMSST0009QUFISLANDS &amp; REEFSST000DKU4UNITED NATIONSSTX001940ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCESST00097CVUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSSTX001348POLLUTIONSTX001941ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION &amp; POLICYSTX001660SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTN922110CCLAW COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALSST000CYB9LIVING STANDARDSST0009ZVDSUPREME COURTSST000DNUOCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICYST000DRDXNEGATIVE MISC NEWSST000DH0QAGREEMENTSST0008ZBXINTERNATIONAL LAWSTX000984JUDGESSTX000659EVIDENCESTX000873HUMAN RIGHTSSTX000950INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSSTX000796GLOBAL WARMINGSTX001883DECISIONS &amp; RULINGSSTX000310CLIMATE CHANGEST000DL6MSUSTAINABILITYSTX001040LITIGATIONSTX000594EMISSIONSN813312MMENVIRONMENTAL &amp; WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONSSTX001956POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSN922110EMINTERNATIONAL COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALSSTX001660SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTSTX000796GLOBAL WARMINGSTX000594EMISSIONSGX231THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDSGT115EUROPEGC343UNITED STATESGC322NETHERLANDSBusiness &amp; Corporate ComplianceZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Greenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAEnvironmental LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0Greenhouse Gas RegulationsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI5OTcxMzRGRDM4NDFERkIyNDE5QUUxQTYwRDM3RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDM0NUNFNjVGRDVCNDEwMTgxRUQzNzlBNzkxNjYyNjAGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkVGNUU3RDc3MUVENDYwRjkxMEQwMDVGNTcxRTJDODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REZDN0NDN0QzNDUwNDA4NjlENDAxODkzMUNGOUNCQTMInternational LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkNBOTBFMURCNEE3NEE5OEIwNjA1MDE4OTIxNEU1ODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTYzQjQyOTBDNzNDNEI2QUIyOTE2MEYyMTdBQTlDMzIJurisdictionZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjAxNThGMjZDN0E2NDlEMzg3RUI5MTAwNDY1OUU1QTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzY4MUJFQkI2ODRDNDYzOTlDMUMzNTAwOTcyNEI4NzYGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTUzQTNGNUEzODNDNDhCRTg2MDNCNDE3MkU4NkE1NjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTZCMUU5OEUyREYzNDM4MjkzMkFCQzA0MTM3QUY1NjQGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdDODU0RjdGQ0JENEQ5RkI0MEU5MDA3NUMxQzEwNTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQGeneral OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjgzMDczMzQzRjk5NDBBNTk4NzlEQjVCOEEwNzc0Q0I7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkM0NDUxMEMyOUE0NDNGMjk2MTlFMzUxMEEyMDE3QUMSources of International LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjlFOTNDODdFMzdFNDBFNjk2NTI0RjZBM0UxMTcwMjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQTribunalsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkIxQTU1MkJBMEY1NDY4MDhBODUxRTJBNjVCREFDRDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjhBNEU2OUVGMEJGNDQzNUFEODk2MUY5QTRFMThCQjUInternational Trade LawZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0General OverviewZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkJBQ0VFNDdFQkRFNENBMDlEOUUzM0ZDNzVGNkVBMTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEQwM0JDMjg2MjJBNDYyNjlFREQ0QzY3NDhCREZGRkUTrade AgreementsZ3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk

Historic climate change ruling from the International Court of Justice: what it means for Africa [3]
  Instance 1: The Court accepted their arguments that developing countries have contributed minimally to greenhouse gas emissions globally, yet suffer the effects of climate change more than developed nations. The advisory opinion also highlighted that a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is necessary if people are to enjoy their rights to access to water, food and housing. These were key issues raised by African States.Read more: Climate justice for Africa: 3 legal routes for countries that suffer the most harmThe court also specifically responded to the arguments of African nations by affirming that developed countries must support developing States to adapt to climate change. Developed States are obliged to provide financial support, make new adaptation technologies available and assist vulnerable nations to build capacity to cope with global warming. The Court endorsed a rights-based approach, particularly the rights to life, health and a clean, sustainable environment and said climate change obligations are erga omnes (a responsibility for all States).
  Instance 2: Developed States are obliged to provide financial support, make new adaptation technologies available and assist vulnerable nations to build capacity to cope with global warming. The Court endorsed a rights-based approach, particularly the rights to life, health and a clean, sustainable environment and said climate change obligations are erga omnes (a responsibility for all States). This also vindicates African nations longstanding calls for climate justice, legal clarity and recognition of the unequal burden they bear. Will it help African countries sue for reparations for climate damage they didn't cause?Yes. African countries now have tools to pursue reparations for climate-related harm.
  Instance 3: Continuing to produce and consume fuels, giving out licences to mining companies to explore for fossil fuels and subsidising the fossil fuel industry may also violate international law. Within the context of State responsibility, this has serious legal implications for the 48 African countries who are still involved in these fossil fuel activities.Read more: Fossil fuels are still subsidised: G20 could push for the funds to be shifted to cleaner energyThe advisory opinion has placed these countries at a crossroads. They cannot advocate for climate justice abroad whilst expanding fossil fuels at home. A State could also be held responsible for not passing regulations to limit emissions caused by private companies under its jurisdiction. This is a step forward.

  Instance 1: Here's President of the Court, Judge Yuji Iwasawa.Iwasawa Yuji: The court notes that the consequences of climate change are severe and far-reaching. They affect both natural ecosystems and human populations. These consequences underscore the urgent and existential threat posed by climate change.Myles Houlbrook-Walk: Outside the court at The Hague, Siosiua Alo Veikune from the Pacific Island Students for Climate Change says the decision is a vindication of their long-running fight.Siosiua Alo Veikune: The discussion around the simple use or licensing of fossil fuels extraction alone already empowers so many campaigns pushing for fossil fuel phase-out in different ways.Myles Houlbrook-Walk: Vishal Prasad is one of the Pacific Island students who helped kick-start the campaign.Vishal Prasad: It's a huge tool in our toolkit now to carry the fight for climate justice forward.

ICJ To Hand Down Watershed Climate Opinion [2]

Newstex and its re-distributors expressly reserve the right to delete stories at its and their sole discretion.Richard CARTERJuly 23rd, 2025 ( International Business Times Australia  - Delivered by  Newstex )The world's top court will Wednesday deliver a landmark ruling laying out what legal obligations countries have to prevent climate change and whether polluters should pay up for the consequences.It is the biggest case ever heard at the International Court of Justice and experts say the judges' opinion could reshape climate justice, with major impacts on laws around the world."I think it will be a game-changer for the whole climate discourse we're going through," said Ralph Regenvanu, climate change minister of Vanuatu.The Pacific island nation spearheaded the push for a court opinion amid growing frustration at sluggish progress in UN climate negotiations."We've been going through this for 30 years... It'll shift the narrative, which is what we need to have," Regenvanu told AFP.The United Nations has tasked the 15 judges at the ICJ, a UN court that adjudicates disputes between nations, to answer two fundamental questions.First: what must states do under international law to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions "for present and future generations"?Second: what are the consequences for states whose emissions have caused environmental harm, especially to vulnerable low-lying island states?ICJ advisory opinions are not binding upon states and critics say that top polluters will simply ignore what comes out of the court.But others note the moral and legal clout enjoyed by the world's highest court and hope the opinion will make a tangible difference to national climate change policies and ongoing legal battles.Andrew Raine, deputy director of the UN Environment Programme's law division, said the ICJ should "clarify how international law applies to the climate crisis.""And that has ripple effects across national courts, legislative processes, and public debates," he told AFP.To help answer the two questions, ICJ judges have pored over tens of thousands of pages of submissions from countries and organisations around the world.Analysts say Wednesday's ruling is the most consequential of a string of recent rulings on climate change in international law as courts become a battleground for climate action.Outside the court in the Hague, about a hundred demonstrators waved flags and posters bearing slogans like "No more delay, climate justice today".Those bringing the cases are often from climate-vulnerable communities and countries, alarmed by the pace of progress toward curbing planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels.The Paris Agreement struck through the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has rallied a global response to the crisis, but not at the speed necessary to protect the world from dangerous overheating.In December, the iconic Peace Palace in the Hague hosted the court's biggest-ever hearings, with more than 100 nations and groups giving oral statements.In what was billed a "David Vs Goliath" battle, the debate pitted major wealthy economies against the smaller, less developed states most at the mercy of a warming planet.Major polluters, including the US and India, warned the ICJ not to deliver a fresh legal blueprint for climate change, arguing the existing UNFCCC sufficed.The US, which has since withdrawn from the Paris accord, said the UNFCCC contained legal provisions on climate change and urged the court to uphold this regime.But smaller states said this framework was inadequate to mitigate climate change's devastating effects and that the ICJ's opinion should be broader.These states also urged the ICJ to impose reparations on historic polluters."The cardinal principle is crystal clear. Responsible states are required to make full reparation for the injury they have caused," said Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh representing Vanuatu.These states demanded a commitment and timeline to phasing out fossil fuels, monetary compensation when appropriate, and an acknowledgement of past wrongs.Representatives from island states, many wearing traditional dress as they addressed the court for the first time in their country's history, made passionate pleas to the robed judges."Despite producing less than 0.01 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, on the current trajectory of GHG emissions, Tuvalu will disappear completely beneath the waves that have been lapping our shores for millennia," said Eselealofa Apinelu from Tuvalu.Vishal Prasad, director of a campaign by Pacific Island students that pushed the issue before the court, said climate change will become "catastrophic as the years go by, if we do not course-correct.""The urgency of the matter, the seriousness of why we're here, and how important this is, is not lost upon all Pacific Islanders, all small island countries," he told AFP"That's why we're looking to the ICJ."The ICJ has its seat in the historic Peace PalaceAFPLink to the original story.NWTXTA-IBTX13285701K0VNBESSRN4JD5F1G0P03FC8IBTX-132857urn:contentItem:6GB6-23K3-RRPW-C22N-00000-004842532025-07-2312:48 PM ESTDelivered by Newstex LLC.

International Court of Justice says countries failing to tackle climate change risk breaking international law [2]
  Instance 1: urn:contentItem:6GB7-5MV3-RXKH-649B-00000-00International Court of Justice says countries failing to tackle climate change risk breaking international law2025-07-23T00:00:00Z2025-08-20T19:20:58ZLexisNexisInternational Court of Justice says countries failing to tackle climate change risk breaking international lawThe opinion of the International Court of Justice is seen by some as a turning point in international climate law, with judges finding that states affected by global warming could be eligible for reparations.The world's highest court has declared states have a legal obligation to tackle climate change and that failing to do so is a "wrongful act" that could open the door to reparations.The landmark advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is seen as a possible turning point in international climate law."Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act," court president Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing."The legal consequences resulting from the commission of an internationally wrongful act may include … full reparations to injured states in the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction."The court added that a "sufficient direct and certain causal nexus" had to be shown "between the wrongful act and the injury".In its non-binding opinion, which runs to more than 500 pages, the ICJ said a "clean, healthy and stable environment" is a human right.Enshrining a sustainable environment as a human right opens the prospect of further legal action, including states returning to the ICJ to hold each other accountable, as well as domestic lawsuits and legal instruments including investment agreements.The case was prompted by a group of law students from Vanuatu, and backed by more than 130 other countries.Vanuatu's special envoy on climate change, Ralph Regenvanu, hailed the court's decision as a "landmark milestone"."It's a very important course correction in this critically important time," Mr Regenvanu said."Even as fossil fuel expansion continues under the US's influence, along with the loss of climate finance and technology transfer, and the lack of climate ambition following the US's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, major polluters, past and present, cannot continue to act with impunity and treat developing countries as sacrifice zones to further feed corporate greed."He said Vanuatu would now take the ruling back to the UN General Assembly to "pursue a resolution that will support implementation of this decision".Advocates immediately cheered upon hearing the court hand down its opinion."The ICJ's decision brings us closer to a world where governments can no longer turn a blind eye to their legal responsibilities," said Vishal Prasad, director of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change."It affirms a simple truth of climate justice: those who did the least to fuel this crisis deserve protection, reparations, and a future."All members of the United Nations are party to the court, including major emitters like the United States and China.Two questions posed to ICJ judgesThe 15 judges on the United Nations's court were tasked with answering two questions:•First: what must states do under international law to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions "for present and future generations"?•Second: what are the consequences for states whose emissions have caused environmental harm, especially to vulnerable low-lying island states?ICJ president Yuji Iwasawa said climate change was an "urgent and existential threat", adding the climate "must be protected for present and future generations" and the adverse effect of a warming planet "may significantly impair the enjoyment of certain human rights, including the right to life".The case was the biggest the ICJ had handled, with judges pouring over tens of thousand of pages of submissions from countries and organisations around the world, including Australia.Outside the court in the Hague, about a hundred demonstrators waved flags and posters bearing slogans like "No more delay, climate justice today".They watched proceedings on a big screen, clapping and cheering at times during the 2-hour hearing.When it was over, others emerged from the courtroom laughing and hugging.Courts have become a key battleground for climate action as frustration has grown over sluggish progress toward curbing planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels.The Paris Agreement struck through the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has rallied a global response to the crisis, but not at the speed necessary to protect the world from dangerous overheating.More than 100 nations and groups gave submissions at a mammoth hearing in December in the Great Hall of Justice in the Hague.Many hailed from distant Pacific Island nations and delivered impassioned appeals in the sober arena while dressed in colourful traditional attire.The debate pitted major wealthy economies against the smaller, less-developed states most at the mercy of a warming planet.Big polluters including the United States and India, as well as Australia argued that legal provisions under the UNFCCC were sufficient and a re-examination of state responsibility in relation to climate action was not necessary.But smaller states refuted this, saying the UN framework was inadequate to mitigate climate change's devastating effects and that the ICJ's opinion should be broader.These states also urged the ICJ to impose reparations on historic polluters, a highly sensitive issue in global climate negotiations.They also demanded a commitment and timeline to phasing out fossil fuels, monetary compensation when appropriate, and an acknowledgement of past wrongs.ABC/wiresASIPAC-105561282ASIPAC2025urn:contentItem:6GB7-5MV3-RXKH-649B-00000-004708262025-07-23Copyright

But the CLP seems to be leading the NT in the opposite direction, based on its budget and new policy positions. The 2025 federal election followed the second hottest summer on record in Australia.
  Instance 2: Given that one of the first things the CLP government did was to remove the Department of Climate Change entirely, this now-broken promise to constituents never seemed to be taken seriously. It is therefore even more imperative that with the re-election of the federal Labor government, election promises are upheld. In particular, the commitment to lower the prices of 30 household goods across NT remote communities to ensure that pricing is consistent with what those living in the cities pay is a critically important and long overdue policy that addresses food security, health, poverty alleviation and climate justice. Aboriginal people living in communities and homelands often have to pay at least double the cost for essential items. This injustice is further exacerbated by extreme weather-related disaster events, which are common across the Territory, and bring significant impacts to food security.
  Instance 3: Place-based approaches allows us to work from the ground up, fostering self-determination, in order to help build thriving and resilient communities. Given the impacts of climate change that are being experienced, we will continue to call for a commitment from all parties to increase investment in disaster resilience, with a dedicated funding stream to strengthen disaster resilience in vulnerable communities, including those communities disproportionately impacted by extreme heat.Jesuit Social Services are hopeful that targeted government policy will help to alleviate some of the extreme impacts of climate change facing communities across the Territory, and we will continue to work alongside communities from the ground up to foster change.

  Instance 1: Final federal approval is still pending for Woodside's massive Northwest Shelf gas project - which is set to add millions of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions every year, for decades.The Australian government must heed the message from the Hague. The days of impunity for the fossil fuel industry are coming to an end.A spark of hope from the PacificToday's ruling is remarkable for where it originated. In 2019, 27 law students at the University of the South Pacific in Vanuatu were given a challenge: find the most ambitious legal pathways towards climate justice. Each year, Vanuatufaces the prospect of cyclones, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, flooding rain and drought. Climate change compounds the risk to island communities - people who have done the least to contribute to the problem.
  Instance 2: And so began a legal campaign that travelled from Vanuatu's capital, Port Vila, through the halls of the United Nations in New York and to the world court in the Hague. In 2023 Vanuatu and other island nations succeeded in passing a UN General Assembly resolution. It asked the ICJ to give an advisory opinion on countries' obligations to protect the climate system and legal consequences for states causing "significant harm" to Earth's climate.This week's ruling delivers poetic justice to Vanuatu and other vulnerable island states.A new era for climate justiceThe court's findings are likely to influence a wave of climate litigation worldwide. It could shape legal reasoning in Australia, too. Last week, a Federal Court judge found the Australian government has no legal duty of care to protect Torres Strait Islanders from climate change.

FED:Countries have a duty to battle climate change: court [1]
  Instance 1: including mitigation and adaptation measures," judge Hilary Charlesworth, an Australian member of the court, said in a separate opinion. "The ICJ's decision brings us closer to a world where governments can no longer turn a blind eye to their legal responsibilities," Vishal Prasad, director of the Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, said. "It affirms a simple truth of climate justice: those who did the least to fuel this crisis deserve protection, reparations and a future". The 133-page opinion was in response to two questions that the United Nations General Assembly put to the UN court: what are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions; and what are the legal consequences for governments when their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? Vanuatu Minister for Climate Change Adaptation Ralph Regenvanu called the deliberation a "very important course correction in this critically important time".
