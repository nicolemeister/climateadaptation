CWU RESEARCHERS STUDY REGIONAL POLLUTION USING ICE CORE FROM NORTH CASCADES,2020,06,"ELLENSBURG, Wash., June 18 -- Central Washington University issued the following news release:
Using ice core samples retrieved from the South Cascade Glacier, CWU researchers have been able to reconstruct black carbon concentrations in the atmosphere spanning the period 1840-1991. Ice cores provide invaluable information that is used to determine past climate and environmental conditions.
""This is only the second study to publish a deep ice core record from the lower 48 states,"" said Susan Kaspari, CWU geological sciences professor, who led the research. ""It's unusual to get valuable environmental records from glaciers that are low elevation, but the black carbon record is less affected by melt, so the record stayed well preserved. We were also really lucky to be able to date the core well. One of the ways we dated the ice core was from an ash horizon from the 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption.""
Black carbon, also referred to as soot, comes from gas and diesel engines, coal-fired power plants, wildfires, and other sources. It's a major component of air pollution and an important contributor to climate change.
Kaspari and her team found that black carbon concentrations were highest during the period 1940-1960 when black carbon was 16 times higher than during pre-industrial times. The dramatic increase is attributed to domestic coal burning and forest fire emissions during those two-decades.
Kaspari and previous CWU Master of Science student Dan Pittenger, the journal article's co-author, drill a shallow ice core on South Cascade Glacier in 2014.Interestingly, the South Cascade ice core showed the period of peak black carbon concentrations in Washington was later than other regions that industrialized earlier, such as the United States' East Coast and Europe due to the relatively small population in the Evergreen State before World War II.
The ice core from the South Cascade Glacier, a small valley glacier in the North Cascades Range, was collected by United States Geological Survey scientists in 1994 and was stored at the National Ice Core Laboratory until 2013 when Kaspari and her team gained access to it.
""We're also using the ice core record to tell us about the factors contributing to glacier and snowmelt in the region,"" she pointed. ""When black carbon is deposited on snow and glacier surfaces, it darkens the surface and causes more energy from the sun to be absorbed, leading to faster melt.""
The CWU research is gaining national attention. It will be published in the June 16 issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres.

Wildfire danger diminished,2020,04,"April 21--     Apr. 21--A damp winter and early spring has western North Carolina in good shape as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows the region has no instances of drought.
That's also good news for N.C. Forest Service firefighters as the risk of wildfire continues to decrease.
A ban on open burning issued April 3 because of hazardous forest-fire conditions was lifted Monday, and the process for obtaining a burn permit is again open. While burn permits are available, state officials are asking people to be aware of the risks when burning yard debris and to consider putting it off through the end of May because careless burning is a leading cause of wildfires in the state, Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said in a press release.
""Recent rainfall across the state, especially in our western counties, has helped with dry conditions, but it is important to remember that we are still in the midst of spring wildfire season and the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Troxler said. ""Preventing escaped debris burns is something each of us can do to protect our communities and our first responders.""
Burn permits are available only online because all Forest Service offices are closed to the public because of COVID-19. Burn permits issued before the ban went into effect on April 3 were canceled, so residents who had one of those permits now have to obtain a new one before burning.
The National Weather Service's spring outlook shows an increased likelihood of above-normal temperatures through the end of May, bringing with them the slightly increased chance of above-normal rainfall. That continues a trend over the last six months of above-normal rainfall over the central and western parts of the state.
According to Forest Service data, wind speeds of more than 10 miles per hour, a relative humidity of less than 25 percent and temperatures above 60 degrees greatly influence the behavior of fire in the Blue Ridge Escarpment.
Through the first 20 days of April, the Forest Service has fought 496 fires that burned more than 1,000 acres. So far this year, NCFS has documented 1,420 fires covering 6,382.4 acres.

MEMBER OF TIMBER POACHING GROUP THAT SET OLYMPIC NATIONAL FOREST WILDFIRE SENTENCED TO 2 1/2 YEARS IN PRISON,2020,09,"TACOMA, Wash., Sept. 21 -- The U.S. Department of Justice's U.S. Attorney's office for Western District of Washington issued the following press release:
One of two men charged in a scheme to steal maple wood that resulted in a massive 2018 forest fire on the Olympic Peninsula was sentenced to prison today in U.S. District Court in Tacoma, announced U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran. SHAWN EDWARD WILLIAMS, 49, was sentenced to 30 months in prison and three years of supervised release for theft of public property and setting timber afire. At the sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge Benjamin H. Settle said that ""the consequences of your actions . . . resulted in horrendous consequences to the forests.""
According to records filed in the case, between April and August 2018, lead defendant Justin Andrew Wilke conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal. In July 2018, just days after his release from state prison, WILLIAMS joined the conspiracy, helping Wilke remove maple from the National Forest and transporting it with Wilke to a mill in Tumwater, Washington. The type of maple harvested by the defendants is highly prized and used to produce musical instruments.
On August 3, 2018, the group decided to cut a maple tree that contained a wasp's nest near the base of the tree. To remove the nest, the group sprayed insecticide and gasoline on the nest and base of the tree and then lit the nest on fire. The group failed to extinguish the fire, which developed into a wildfire later named the ""Maple Fire."" The Maple Fire consumed more than 3,300 acres between August and November 2018 and cost approximately $4.2 million to contain. WILLIAMS did not himself set the fire, but was present when others set the fire.
WILLIAMS pleaded guilty in December 2019.
In their sentencing memo, prosecutors highlighted the danger of Wilke and WILLIAMS's conduct. ""Forest fires present a dire and growing threat in this region. They destroy our forests, poison our air, and endanger responders, local residents, recreationalists, and wildlife. When this fire occurred in early August 2018, the Puget Sound region was (as it is today) already experiencing significant smoke from existing wildfires, and the high risk of fire was evident to everyone in Western Washington. Despite this atmosphere, Williams participated in taking the extreme risk of setting fire to a portion of a tree-deep in the forest, in mid-summer. The consequences of that decision-thousands of acres burned, millions of dollars in containment costs, and the release of huge amounts of smoke-were easily foreseeable.""
The case was investigated by the United States Forest Service. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Will Dreher.

Planet Alaska : Ten lessons from the fireweed,2022,01,"By Yéilk' Vivian Mork
Yes, I'm thinking about fireweed in the middle of winter. In these dark times, I close my eyes and see fuchsia blossoms buzzing with bumblebees. 2021 was the second year we've been living through this pandemic, and it's been hard. I've been feeling this sense of languishing, so I know you've probably been feeling it too. We are grieving. We've been sick and we've lost friends or family, our elders. Our jobs might've changed, our business shut down. Looking forward to a new year is hard for many of us. There's a lot of anxiety. This brings me back to the fireweed. I'm thinking about fireweed because fireweed gives me hope.
Fireweed is a gift from Tlingit Aaní. In our Lingít language it's called lóol. I look to Tlingit Aaní to help heal, to enliven, to balance my life so this leads me to consider the lessons of the fireweed. What lessons can this flower offer us as we reflect on 2021 and move forward into 2022?
Preparing: As snow keeps falling, we're not thinking about what the plants are doing in the winter, but the fireweed is there preparing for the next year. It's ever-present. It's still there under three feet of snow. The fireweed plant is an expert at preparing. This is one of the most important lessons we receive from this plant. We often think about other seasons as times to prepare for winter, but winter is also a time to prepare for our upcoming busy seasons. Fireweed tea is made from the leaves. High in vitamins A and C and there's an art to fermenting and preparing the tea for use in winter. If you're enjoying fireweed tea in the winter, you've practiced preparedness.
Growth and Tolerance: Fireweed grows along our roadsides, in disturbed areas, in our logged forests, along the borders of meadows, forests, and streams. It expands in a large and long-lived structure of shallow roots. It's tolerant of acidic, neutral, and alkaline soils. We can surely learn growth and tolerance from the fireweed. This winter, let's ask ourselves where we need to grow? In the fireweed's world there's always room for growth.
Beauty: Fireweed are determined to share their beauty. A káx yan aydél wé tl'átgi — We are stewards of the air land and sea. When we walk through a field of fireweed, we sense that the beauty in the moment is just for us, that this plant was created so we could share the world with bees and beauty. We are a part of that beauty.
Persistence: You know why I like fireweed? Because they're one of the first plants to grow up after the land has burned from forest fire. They grow in adversity where nothing else does. Yee gu.aa yáx x'wán. Be strong and have courage. Be a Fireweed!
Reclaim a place and space: Fireweed loves open spaces. It's the plant that returns and reclaims a place and beautifies it. One single plant can produce 80,000 seeds. It doesn't stop feeding places even in winter. We humans can claim a winter space too. Make space in the winter for art, storytelling, renewing relationships, planning, or learning something new. Make space for taking care of our Elders. Reclaim your winter space as a place for dreams.
Roots: Consider where we come from: our clans, the land, our ancestors. Toowú klagé haa t'aakx'í, ka haa naax sateeyí, ka haa kusteeyí. Have pride in our family and our clan and our traditions. I'm both Tlingit and Hawaiian. Alaska and Hawaii are two of my favorite places in the world and my favorite fireweed flavor combo is fireweed and dragon fruit. Fireweed teaches us to be diverse, to know who we are. Our roots are important, they're what holds us to place, and form our first relationships, which is to the land.
Endurance: Over these last few years, we've witnessed how climate change is affecting the fireweed. But still, they endure. Yee toowú klatseen. Be strong. I've seen some strange alien-looking fireweed plants with thicker stalks. I've seen fireweed ""bushes"" rather than single stalk plants. I saw a fireweed that had more than 20 new start tips growing along the entire stalk. I've never seen a single fireweed with that many tips. I've seen fireweed stalks with bent shapes, and some with curled ends, and square stalks (not round), and some with leaves bunched together. But still, they endure.
Community: We are like fireweed rhizomes. We are community so we must to tend to our community. Wooch eenx haa isteeyí, wooch dusxáni, wooch éet wutudasheeyí. When we're together, we love each other, we help each other. Our community is resilient like the fireweed. In fact, fragmenting the rhizomes stimulates the shoots to grow. By harvesting fireweed, we are tending to our community because we're going to make something with it and gift it away. We're also helping the plant community flourish. This tending to our community is important, especially in the winter. We are rhizomes growing from roots, reaching out together to make a forest of fireweed.
Peace: Whenever I walk into a field of fireweed, I sense peace. Tlél kútx i yáa wdawóodlik—Have patience. This past year, in the moments the rain stopped, I walked my dog around the neighborhood and through the fireweed meadows. I picked fireweed blossoms and dried some and infused them in honey. I picked fireweed and brewed a mixed tea of s'ikshaldéen (Labrador tea), blueberries, thimbleberry and ginger.
Healing: Winter can be healing. For our minds it can be a time of reflection. For our bodies it provides rest. Fireweed medicine is good medicine that can assist us. Fireweed can be used as a decongestion for coughs and asthma, ulcers, gastritis, and colitis. Fireweed also has anti-inflammatory properties and has been used for arthritis and rheumatism. Tlingit Aaní provides many healing plants for us.
Fireweed (Chamerion angustifolium) offers us lesson at every stage including the dormant stage as it prepares for spring. Fireweed is a member of the Evening Primrose family (Onagraceae). It's a perennial growing from 4 to 6 feet high up to 9 feet high. It's a valued food for humans and animals too like deer, moose, caribou, rabbits, and muskrats.
Fireweed is my favorite harbinger of spring and it's one of the best first spring vegetables. As soon as the snow is gone, look for it. A lot of people don't notice when fireweed shoots come up, and by the time they do, its past the edible stage. Fireweed stalks, leaves, and blossoms are good to combine with other plants and foods. I've made fireweed scones, honey, jelly, smoothies, muffins, sauces, tea, lemonade, syrup and dressings. Fireweed shoots can be pickled and steamed, and the buds can be added to salads or pickled as capers. I make teas from dried or fermented leaves.
This winter, as we inhabit this winter space, as we layer on socks and long underwear, as we clomp in our cleats across ice and shovel the driveway yet again, think of the fireweed lessons. Fireweed lessons include preparedness, growth and tolerance, beauty, persistence, reclamation, roots, endurance, community, peace, and healing. Maybe we can all try to be a bit of fireweed.

"AF PHYSICIAN ADVISES, 'FOLLOW YOUR NOSE' TO EARLY COVID-19 DIAGNOSIS",2020,04,"The following information was released by the U.S. Air Force Air Material Command:
By Gina Marie Giardina, Air Force Research Laboratory
An ear, nose and throat surgeon in the Air Force Research Laboratory assembled a multi-national team of nine other medical professionals to consolidate their front-line observations and recommendations regarding early symptoms of patients infected with COVID-19, in an article that was published online April 15 in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.
Col. (Dr.) Michael Xydakis, who works in AFRLs 711th Human Performance Wing, and this team state that during this pandemic, the sudden onset of difficulty with smell (anosmia) or taste (dysgeusia), with no other nasal congestion or other symptoms, should cause healthcare providers to exercise increased caution.
New onset anosmia likely serves as a reliable proxy marker of infection, explained Xydakis. Diagnosing asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers early and advising self-quarantine is essential to control the spread of this virus. By diagnosing patients infected by COVID-19 early in their disease process, we are essentially going after the kindling before it becomes a forest fire.
Aimed at strengthening the COVID-19 diagnostic criteria for healthcare providers, the article offers recommendations to those treating, testing and diagnosing patients presenting with rapid onset difficulty with smell or taste.
""Most concerning,"" said Xydakis, ""is the recent and compelling evidence that viral shedding and transmission may occur in asymptomatic carriers or mildly symptomatic patients, and the current screening processes for detecting COVID-19 do not include testing taste or smell functions.""
The Lancet Infectious Diseases is recognized as being a global and authoritative forum for infectious diseases research and opinion, explained Xydakis, so we hope this information is rapidly disseminated to other health care providers.
Included in the article are recommendations for healthcare providers with patients who report a sudden loss of smell or taste, but do not have nasal congestion or other symptoms that accompany allergies or the common cold.
The Lancet can be accessed at <url normalizedValue=""https://www.thelancet.com/coronavirus"">https://www.thelancet.com/coronavirus</url>.
Healthcare providers should have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in patients who present with new onset anosmia as the only symptom, Xydakis said.
The clinical research that we are conducting in AFRL is intrinsically translational and, in a time of crisis, offers the shortest path for providing senior leadership with actionable, decision-quality, operational information said Xydakis. The same holds true for the national and international partnerships we build along the way.",US

Also, remember to recreate responsibly on the Forest by following the tips below:
* Dispersed Camping - When camping outside of developed campgrounds, remember that creating new campsites kills vegetation and leads to soil erosion. If possible, use an existing site, or pick a site where vegetation is absent.
It In, Pack It Out - Inspect the campsite, picnic area, or rest site for trash or spilled foods. Pack out all trash, leftover food, and litter, leaving the place cleaner than you found it.
* Answering Nature's Call - Find a spot at least 200 feet from any water source. Dig a hole 6-8 inches deep and bury human waste. Pack out used toilet paper and feminine products to prevent animals from digging them up.
Be Considerate of Others - Respect each other and yield on the trail. Step to the downhill side of the trail when encountering pack stock. Take breaks and camp away from trails and other visitors. Avoid loud voices or noises and let nature's sounds prevail.
* Pets in the Forest - Pets should be leashed in developed recreation sites, including campgrounds, picnic areas, and trailheads. Along the trail, there may be additional signs instructing pet owners to keep pets on-leash. Remember to pick up and pack out pet waste.
* Respect Access - Stay out of closed areas. Do not trespass and do not cross private lands unless given permission. Leave gates as you found them, whether opened or closed. Do not cut fences as they keep livestock confined. Remember it is illegal to deface or destroy trees, signs, outbuildings, or other objects on federal lands.
* Ride Ethically - Always stay on designated Forest roads and trails as they are designed using industry best practices to be environmentally sustainable. Go over, not around, obstacles to avoid widening trails. Remember it is illegal to ride cross-country on NFS lands, and motorized vehicles and bicycles are not allowed in wilderness areas.

Ukrainian officials: Fires out near Chernobyl nuclear plant,2020,04,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian emergency officials said Tuesday they have extinguished forest fires in the radiation-contaminated area near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but acknowledged that grass was still smoldering in some areas.
Hundreds of firefighters backed by aircraft have been battling several forest fires around Chernobyl for the past 10 days. They contained the initial blazes, but new fires raged closer to the decommissioned plant.
Emergencies Service chief Mykola Chechetkin reported to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that rains helped firefighters put out the flames, but acknowledged that it would take a few more days to extinguish smoldering grass.
Chechetkin said emergency workers have prevented the fire from engulfing radioactive waste depots and other facilities in Chernobyl.
The 2,600-square-kilometer (1,000-square-mile) Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was established after the 1986 disaster at the plant that sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over much of Europe. The zone is largely unpopulated, although about 200 people have remained despite orders to leave.
Ukraine's emergencies service said radiation levels in the capital, Kyiv, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the plant, were within norms after the forest fires.
President Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians not to panic.
""We all remember the lessons of April 26, 1986,"" he said in an online statement Tuesday. ""No one is hiding the truth from you. Right now the truth is that the situation there is under control.""
On Monday, activists warned that the blazes were getting dangerously close to waste storage facilities.
Yaroslav Yemelyanenko, a member of the public council under the state agency in charge of the closed zone around the plant, said one fire was raging within 2 kilometers (about 1.2 miles) from one of the radioactive waste depots.
Last week, officials said they tracked down a person suspected of triggering the blaze by setting dry grass on fire in the area. The 27-year-old man said he burned grass ""for fun"" and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to spread quickly.
On Monday, police said that another local resident burned waste and accidentally set dry grass ablaze, triggering another devastating forest fire. They said he failed to report the fire to the authorities.
Blazes in the area have been a regular occurrence. They often start when residents set dry grass on fire in the early spring - a widespread practice in Ukraine, Russia and some other ex-Soviet nations that often leads to devastating forest fires.",US

Canada's airports expect massive fee increases and service reductions,2020,10,"U.S., Oct. 28 -- The failure of government and the airline industry to embrace a holistic approach to aviation support during the COVID-19 pandemic is leaving the regional and community airports of this country on the brink of financial collapse and airlines facing massive rates and fees increases in 2021.
Despite a dramatic decline in airline passenger traffic since the COVID-19 pandemic began in March, Canada's smaller airports have carried the financial burden of maintaining their runways, air terminals, and emergency services without access to any previous or current financial aid.
When governments and the public hear of dire situations in the aviation sector the focus tends to be on the major airlines and the major airports that connect Canadians in large urban areas to transborder and international destinations, and that is frustrating to the Regional Community Airports of Canada (RCAC).
""For all Canadians outside of our large urban centers it is regional and local airports that connect the vast regions of our country for essential services, and business and leisure travel"", says Brian Grant, Chair of the RCAC.
""These smaller airports play a critical role in providing remote access and a quality of life that all Canadians expect. Movement of critical food supplies, emergency health care, essential cargo, emergency evacuation, forest fire fighting services are just a few examples of what regional and community airports deliver in addition to passenger air travel"".
According to the RCAC all airports have been hit with severe reductions in revenues and reduced or canceled air service leaving them unable to meet the costs of operating the airports unless governments step in with direct financial support soon.
""2020 has been a year of deep staffing cuts and reducing services, under the pressure of exceptional revenue loses, to meet fixed operational and safety costs dictated by government regulation along with new pandemic related costs to ensure the safety and confidence of travelers"", continues Mr. Grant. ""In 2021 these airports are estimating upwards of 45-60% increases in rates and fees charged to airlines and passengers to continue operations as they exist today. In most cases reserve funds have been depleted and the only possible reductions left are closures of airport infrastructure"".
Recommendations highlighted by the national organization for effective support include:
Ensure regional and community airports' eligibility to all federal COVID assistance programs (i.e. emergency wage subsidy, debit relief and loans programs, and rent subsidy etc.) regardless of governance or ownership model.
Stabilize the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy for airports to not less than 75% for 2021 to protect the employment capabilities of these airports for employees.
Provide financial assistance to cover fixed operating costs at 2019 levels to eliminate deficits and avoid rates and fees increases in order to bolster airline and travel activity.
Increase Airport Capital Assistance Program funding to $95 mil annually (an industry request prior to the COVID-19 pandemic dating back more than two years).
Adjust the federal contribution limit to the ACAP to not less than 75% of eligible project costs and relax the eligibility requirement of commercial schedule passenger service for current eligible airports for 2021 through 2025, to ensure the protection and maintenance of essential infrastructure and equipment during the post-pandemic recovery period.

Air quality unhealthy as wildfire smoke rolls in,2020,09,"Sept. 14--     Sep. 14--It has been impossible to see even the outline of Big Mountain from downtown Whitefish since wildfire smoke rolled into the area over the weekend.
Wildfire smoke form Idaho, Washington and Oregon has been moving east, impacting Montana's air quality, according to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality. Air quality is expected to worsen as smoke continues to push eastward across the state.
On Tuesday morning the air quality for Flathead County was listed as unhealthy meaning that people with respiratory or heart disease, the elderly and children, should avoiding outdoor activity. Everyone else should avoid prolonged exertion while outside.
The Flathead City-County Health Department issued a notice encouraging residents to regularly monitor air quality conditions and restrict outdoor activity accordingly.
The county has an air quality monitoring station in Columbia Falls and results of the monitoring are posted hourly on the health department's air quality website at <url normalizedValue=""http://svc.mt.gov/deq/todaysair/"">http://svc.mt.gov/deq/todaysair/</url>.
Air quality ratings include good, moderate, unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy and hazardous.
When the air quality is anything other than good, folks should watch for symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath and reduce exertion, according to the health department.
Smoke is made up of a mixture of gases and fine particles when wood and other organic materials burn, according to the health department, and the biggest public health threat from smoke is fine particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs causing a range of health problems.
Those most at risk for health issues are the elderly, children and those with respiratory issues or heart disease, the health department notes.
An air quality alert was issued for much of the state through Tuesday morning due to the wildfire smoke.
Smoky conditions are expected to continue for the Northern Rockies through the week, the National Weather Service in Missoula said.
There's expected to be a break form the smoke by the weekend, the Weather Service predicts, when a relatively moist Pacific storm system is expected to move over the Northern Rockies.
""A change in the weather pattern will occur Friday into Saturday,"" the Weather Service said Tuesday. ""An upper low will move through the Northern Rockies and provide widespread rains.""
The relief from smoky conditions may not last long as weather forests are indicating a high pressure ridge over California will transport smoke from California and Oregon wildfires once again across the region next week.
The fire danger in Flathead County remains very high.
Interagency fire managers are asking the public to remain careful when out recreating this fall.
""It's important for everyone locally to do their part to prevent human-caused fire starts,"" said acting Flathead National Forest Fire Management Officer Andy Huntsberger. ""We need every resource available to help out our neighbors, and the more we can do to limit our local fire response, the better.""

"Patterson AFB Physician Advises, 'Follow Your Nose' to Early COVID-19 Diagnosis",2020,04,"The U.S. Air Force Wright-Patterson Air Force Base issued the following news:
Col. (Dr.) Michael Xydakis, an ear, nose and throat surgeon in the Air Force Research Laboratory, assembled a multi-national team of nine other medical professionals, who consolidated their front-line observations and recommendations regarding early symptoms of patients infected with COVID-19 in an article that was published online April 15 in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.
Xydakis, who works in AFRL's 711th Human Performance Wing, and this team state that during this pandemic, the sudden onset of difficulty with smell (anosmia) or taste (dysgeusia), with no other nasal congestion or other symptoms, should cause healthcare providers to exercise increased caution.
""New onset anosmia likely serves as a reliable proxy marker of infection,"" explained Xydakis. ""Diagnosing asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers early and advising self-quarantine is essential to control the spread of this virus. By diagnosing patients infected by COVID-19 early in their disease process, we are essentially going after the kindling before it becomes a forest fire.""
Aimed at strengthening the COVID-19 diagnostic criteria for healthcare providers, the article offers recommendations to those treating, testing and diagnosing patients presenting with rapid onset difficulty with smell or taste.
""Most concerning,"" said Xydakis, ""is the recent and compelling evidence that viral shedding and transmission may occur in asymptomatic carriers or mildly symptomatic patients, and the current screening processes for detecting COVID-19 do not include testing taste or smell functions.""
The Lancet Infectious Diseases is recognized as being a global and authoritative forum for infectious diseases research and opinion, explained Xydakis, so we hope this information is rapidly disseminated to other health care providers.
Included in the article are recommendations for healthcare providers with patients who report a sudden loss of smell or taste, but do not have nasal congestion or other symptoms that accompany allergies or the common cold.
Healthcare providers should have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in patients who present with new onset anosmia as the only symptom, Xydakis said.
""The clinical research that we are conducting in AFRL is intrinsically translational and, in a time of crisis, offers the shortest path for providing senior leadership with actionable, decision-quality, operational information"" said Xydakis. ""The same holds true for the national and international partnerships we build along the way.""

Ukrainian officials: Fires out near Chernobyl nuclear plant,2020,04,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian emergency officials said Tuesday they have extinguished forest fires in the radiation-contaminated area near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but acknowledged that grass was still smoldering in some areas.
Hundreds of firefighters backed by aircraft have been battling several forest fires around Chernobyl for the past 10 days. They contained the initial blazes, but new fires raged closer to the decommissioned plant.
Emergencies Service chief Mykola Chechetkin reported to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that rains helped firefighters put out the flames, but acknowledged that it would take a few more days to extinguish smoldering grass.
Chechetkin said emergency workers have prevented the fire from engulfing radioactive waste depots and other facilities in Chernobyl.
The 2,600-square-kilometer (1,000-square-mile) Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was established after the 1986 disaster at the plant that sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over much of Europe. The zone is largely unpopulated, although about 200 people have remained despite orders to leave.
Ukraine's emergencies service said radiation levels in the capital, Kyiv, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the plant, were within norms after the forest fires.
President Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians not to panic.
""We all remember the lessons of April 26, 1986,"" he said in an online statement Tuesday. ""No one is hiding the truth from you. Right now the truth is that the situation there is under control.""
On Monday, activists warned that the blazes were getting dangerously close to waste storage facilities.
Yaroslav Yemelyanenko, a member of the public council under the state agency in charge of the closed zone around the plant, said one fire was raging within 2 kilometers (about 1.2 miles) from one of the radioactive waste depots.
Last week, officials said they tracked down a person suspected of triggering the blaze by setting dry grass on fire in the area. The 27-year-old man said he burned grass ""for fun"" and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to spread quickly.
On Monday, police said that another local resident burned waste and accidentally set dry grass ablaze, triggering another devastating forest fire. They said he failed to report the fire to the authorities.
Blazes in the area have been a regular occurrence. They often start when residents set dry grass on fire in the early spring - a widespread practice in Ukraine, Russia and some other ex-Soviet nations that often leads to devastating forest fires.",US

Presentation
LAWSON WINDER, VP &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, BOFA SECURITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Hello, everyone. In this segment, we will hear from the only uranium company presenting today. And it happens to be Cameco, the world's second largest producer of the metal used for fuel in reactors. And joining me from Cameco today is Senior Vice President and CFO, Grant Isaac. Grant, welcome to Miami. And I'll turn the podium over to you.
GRANT E. ISAAC, SENIOR VP &amp; CFO, CAMECO CORPORATION: Great. Thank you very much. If you don't mind, I'm just going to stay here. My tremendous laziness just keeps me right in this chair. It's a good spot to be. I'll make a few opening comments, but happy to go to your questions. At the beginning of that, I just want to, a bit of a shout-out to Lawson on the work that he's been doing in our space lately. It really is a good analysis of what's going on.
Ours is a market where the fundamentals were improving. I think a lot of people saw nuclear kind of regain its place in the policy toolbox because of the decarbonization push. A lot of question marks around supply because it turns out that markets work after years of pervasive low prices. There wasn't a lot of investment in capacity, and that was starting to build momentum.
And then everything kind of changed on February 24 when Russia invaded Ukraine. And now on top of that fundamental, we're going through an unprecedented geopolitical realignment in our market, which is just code for Western customers are looking to exclude Russia from their nuclear fuel procurement going forward. And Russia is a very big player in that part of our industry. I have no idea how everything is going to work out geopolitically. But I can say with confidence that we are extraordinarily well positioned in a market that's bifurcating. And there's more Western capacity required to meet Western demand.
So that's a really important dynamic going on. Hopefully, we can get into that in a little bit more detail. But just a final comment on how we're positioned. For us, the uranium isn't a spot market. It's not one where we see strong prices for spot conversions, spot enrichment, spot uranium and we rush forward to meet it. It's one where you need to secure homes for your planned production and then you make the right decision.
So for us, it's about marketing discipline. That continues. We have lots of customers interested in supply. We're looking for those terms and conditions that make sense for us. So marketing discipline then allows you to make the production decisions afterwards that make sense, the best and most economic way to fulfill it. And we're still in supply discipline mode despite how robust everything is looking. We haven't seen the procurement cycle yet to change those supply decisions. Maybe we could see ourselves there.
But the final piece I'll mention is just what's interesting is, we're talking about being on really the early innings of a contracting cycle. And we've never started one from such high prices already. Uranium term price starting with a 5. Conversion price has never been higher than it is today. SWU price is starting to approach historic highs. We've never launched a contracting cycle from a base of this stronger prices before. So lots to talk about in our industry, happy to take questions.
Questions and Answers
LAWSON WINDER: I'd share an interesting comment that I heard from a fuel buyer I spoke with 2 weeks ago. His comment was, as this contracting cycle unwinds, people like Cameco are going to be very well placed to enjoy spot markets. Next down would be the assets that had operated but are currently on care and maintenance. And next would be the developers. So I think Cameco is very well placed. But what I wanted to talk about was the last point you made, which is on contracting activity.
So with Q4 results, obviously, you guys had a very exciting announcement of 50 million pounds of new contracting. Q1, there was nothing. I mean, you and I both know that it is very lumpy and it tends not to come on a regular basis, but it certainly surprised a lot of market participants. What I wanted to get your perspective on was when do you expect contracting to come back in a very meaningful way. And I know it's very hard to define, but kind of walk us through your framework.
GRANT E. ISAAC: Yes. Good question. And here's our expectation. But one quick clarification, we contracted 40 million pounds in Q1. We just contracted it. And we're prepared to announce it in early February when we put out our Q4 release. So Q1 actually was one of our biggest contracting quarters ever.
So just a bit of history, in 2021, utilities were really paying attention to uranium supply. We saw a lot of uranium contracting going on because of that fundamental story that we were talking about. Us and our competitors in the industry were seeing a lot of interest in uranium. But that changed also on February 24. Utilities shifted their attention from where's my long-run uranium coming from to where's my enrichment and conversion going to come from?
Just a reminder, Russia, about 40% of the global enrichment capacity is Russian. About 30% of the global conversion capacity is Russian. They're about 14% of global supply of uranium. They're 50% of the secondary supplies in our market. So utilities turned their attention from where is the uranium coming from to starting to contract the enrichment service.
We saw a 40% jump in the enrichment price 2 weeks ago. It went from $72 per unit enriched to $120 per unit enriched. That reflects the panic that's setting in among those Western fuel buyers to secure the non-Russian source of enrichment. Once they have their enrichment lined up, they then have to turn their attention to, I need the feedstock. And so their next focus will be on the conversion sector, which is already pricing strong. We expect to see more strength in conversion. We provide conversion. We're the only North American converter right now operating.
And then they will return their attention to uranium because now you need the product to which you're going to apply these services. So February 24 was a bit of a change, and it really shifted attention downstream. And so uranium contracting will pick up again when they feel comfortable with their enrichment coverage and then their conversion coverage and then we'll see the return to the uranium demand in a big way.
LAWSON WINDER: A lot of great material there. I would like to touch on blue sky. So I often get the comment from investors that Cameco, an investment in Cameco is capped because of your contract book, which I would note, it only goes out 5 years. And I would also note fails to account for the fact that you're also not fully contracted on that contract book and then there's still all the contracting that you can do beyond the year 2025 where you provide that guidance. Could you walk us through sort of the theoretical capacity that Cameco has in still uncontracted material? And I know it's probably dangerous for you to throw percentages, but that type of thing, I think, really helps investors think about what the true blue sky upside is.
GRANT E. ISAAC: Yes. On that price sensitivity table, we have figured out that there's a lot of misunderstanding about how it's constructed. It only reflects our current committed sales, and we make no representation of an assumed production rate at certain spot prices. And so really, we vigorously retain 3 points of leverage to this market.
Number one is, we have a number of existing contracts that are market-related. And so as the uranium price goes up, we get the pickup of the higher prices in those existing contracts. They have a little bit of a kicker on them, too, in that utilities tend to be procyclical. In a rising uranium market, they flex up their contracts not flex down. The psychology there is the price is obviously rising because the product is getting scarce, I should flex up and take more of it. So market-related is our first point of leverage.
Second point of leverage is exactly what you talked about. It's the pounds we haven't sold yet. I mean, we are not trying to be sold out right now. We like to be covered in year. We like to have a good comfortable amount of coverage next year. And then we don't mind that uncommitted to fall off dramatically because we think that there's a better pricing environment for those pounds. And so take, for example, the extreme supply discipline at McArthur River. 115 million pounds left in the ground when uranium was $17.75 a pound. And now it's pricing at $50 a pound. That's a pretty good investment in supply discipline by leaving that material inventory into the ground.
So that's the second point of leverage, the pounds that haven't been sold and we're far from sold out. We're still in supply discipline mode. Yes, we're bringing McArthur back, but we're going to operate it at a lower than full capacity rate. And we're planning on bringing Cigar Lake back in 2024 as well because the procurement cycle isn't quite there yet. So we will run in 2024 on current plans at 40% below our productive capacity. We make no effort to sell the remaining 40% of supply. It's not our interest right now because we want to be leveraged to that market.
But there's a third piece of leverage that's really crucial too. And that is when utilities truly go into a security of supply driven mode reflected in the conversation you had with them. They don't turn to the greenfield projects and take a chance on schedule and risk. They turn to the incumbents that they already have contracts with and they say, look, I don't have time to start a brand-new RFP. I don't have time to launch a brand-new negotiation. We already have a purchase order. Let's just expand the volumes. So we vigorously protect the market-related leverage, the pounds we haven't sold yet and that incumbent advantage because we like to put that business into an up market, not a down market.
LAWSON WINDER: Fill in the blanks a little bit on the contract book beyond 2025. How far out does it go out and how quickly does it sort of fall off?
GRANT E. ISAAC: Well, we have about, in that contract table that we announced over the next 5 years, we have about 100 million pounds under contract. But then every year, we disclose that our entire book is about 150 million pounds. So we still have a lot of volume that's outside that 5-year window. We're starting to see in our market, began to see it last year, utilities started shifting their procurement back to a traditional mode. When the spot market was so horrendously oversupplied following Fukushima, the spot market became the home for a bunch of surplus production that didn't have a home. So it got dumped into the spot market in a low interest rate environment, utilities said to themselves, hey, I don't want to pay term prices for uranium. I want to pay spot prices forward. And so they were finding financial intermediaries to buy in the spot market, carry it on a carry trade and take it into the early part of term contracting, and this broke the term price.
The term price, instead of being anchored to production economics, was anchored to the forward curve of spot. Utilities then saw Sprott enter the market and start buying a lot of material. We bought a lot of material. The spot market became very, very thin. We actually entered backwardation. And as we entered backwardation, the most expensive pounds were the carry trade pounds. So the carry trade business basically dried up, then interest rates are starting to rise, which condemns the carry trade business going forward.
So utilities have gone back to taking bigger bites out of the market. So the tenor of the contracts have gone from 2 to 5 years, 2 to 7. Now we're seeing 2 to 10. The time frames are getting bigger. We had a contract that we announced in Q1 that was 2030 to 2040. So the window that utilities are looking at is getting bigger, reflecting their confidence in their reactor programs and volumes are going up. Not just because there's more years being added, but they're taking bigger bites out of the market. So no surprise, the underlying term price of uranium is back reflecting production economics as opposed to reflecting the carry trade on spot.
LAWSON WINDER: Well said. Now a really interesting point in your Q1 results was the delayed material from Inkai. And I mean, you cited insurance concerns, but also other concerns. Maybe you could just speak to that other part. And also, why is there a delay in arranging an alternate route to get that material from Kazakhstan to the rest of the world, aside from Russia, because my understanding was you guys had already established that route. It was Caspian, Georgia, Azerbaijan into Black Sea.
GRANT E. ISAAC: Yes. So we have a joint venture with Kazatomprom. It's an extraordinary joint venture with a great partner and a partner that's doing a tremendous job in a very difficult situation. And they can explain it better than we can for sure.
From a Cameco perspective, we're very, very risk averse, and that's a part of the world we don't understand as well as our joint venture partner does. Our joint venture partner might look at forest fire risk in Northern Saskatchewan and say, that's crazy. Well, we can manage forest fire risk. We look at risk in that part of the world and we just don't understand it as well, and we're very risk averse. And so we've taken the position for a variety of reasons that range from the ability to secure insurance, the predictability of the transport system. We don't want to use the Russian route. And we've also taken the position, we shouldn't use the Russian route. And that is the exclusive route for getting Central Asian supply out of that part of the world.
There is an alternative route that's been established. It's been used by our joint venture partner. They've successfully used it. An Inkai shipment has actually successfully used it last year. But we just put that disclosure in because it's not clear to us. We can't predict at the moment when that route is going to be available for us. And so we just said, we're going to leave our material in-country. Now the good news for Cameco, we've got production sources in other parts of the world. We've got our long-term purchase program. We've got an inventory. It's a minor problem for us. It's just time and money is all it will take to get access to it.
But if you think about it from a utility point of view, it's actually a growing uncertainty and potential problem for the nuclear fuel supply because a lot of conversion facilities in the world require that material from Central Asia. So if there's delays, that's just going to delay the supply chain, which with the tightness in the market, you wonder how much it can tolerate those delays. So for us, it's a manageable problem. It's systemically a bigger challenge for the industry. It just reflects a different risk tolerance that we have because we don't understand that part of the world as well as others do.
LAWSON WINDER: That's an excellent perspective. And I'll leave it there on that topic because I think we're going to get into a bit more tomorrow on our uranium plant panel at 10 a.m. What I would like to do is ask about conversion because that is something very specific to Cameco. So one thing, conversion prices, as you mentioned, are very strong, possibly at all-time highs. What do you see as the risk or something that could actually cause that to correct? But in the current environment, how does Cameco take advantage of that?
And then secondly, in relation to that, the World Nuclear Association publishes this data on capacity and capacity utilization. They always show you guys using about 70% of your UF6 capacity utilization. Is it possible for you to displace what the rest of that unused capacity is currently being used for to take advantage of the higher prices?
GRANT E. ISAAC: Yes. A lot to unpack there. Conversion is the tightest part of the nuclear fuel cycle at the moment. Western demand for conversion, just throw a few numbers at you, 35,000 tonnes of conversion is needed. Western supply is around 20,000 tonnes. So there's a 15,000 tonne gap.
On top of that, the enrichers need more conversion because while they're going to add more capacity to displace the Russian capacity, one way they can get more enrichment out of their plant is to what's called overfeed it, which is just code for they need more UF6 going into it, use it less efficiently. And that's another 6,000 tonnes on top of that. But the good news over time for the conversion industry is, well, there's a plant in the U.S. that's at 0 today. And it will come back to 7,000 tonnes, probably 10,000. There's a plant in France that's running at half capacity and it will go up to 15,000 tonnes. We're at 12,500. And the enricher overfeed will only last until they install new capacity.
So on balance, Western conversion to 2027, 2028 could catch up or there'll just be a small gap. So for us, it isn't about jamming a whole bunch of new production into the conversion space because we live through the times when it was oversupplied and we were running our plant at half capacity. So the goal for us is to fill it up, get those margins as good as we can, lock in these historic prices, but not forget that there's capacity that needs to come back and will come back with some of these restarts.
LAWSON WINDER: Okay. That's great perspective. Thank you for the conversation today. Unfortunately, we are out of time. So thank you all for being here listening to our presentation, and thank you, Grant, for being here.
GRANT E. ISAAC: Great. Thank you.

Virginia Tech: Taking Action Against Harassment in the Field,2022,01,"(TNSjou) -- Virginia Tech issued the following news:
By Jenny Kincaid Boone
For Virginia Tech students who study forestry, the outdoors is the classroom.
Piling into university vans and heading out into the woods to study trees, wildflowers, and more is what they do, often several times a week. It's an essential component of lab instruction for many Virginia Tech faculty in the College of Natural Resources and Environment, including Carolyn Copenheaver, an associate professor who teaches forest ecology.
But because these outdoor labs don't take place in a traditional classroom, students often let their guards down.
A few years ago, Copenheaver was approached by female students sharing their experiences of harassment in the field.
That's when she realized that something had to change.
Fast forward a few years, and Copenheaver now is leading a charge to address sexual misconduct and harassment in her courses, which all involve field labs. In the process, she has become an outspoken resource for helping other faculty to maneuver this delicate topic.
In October, Copenheaver, along with three other colleagues, published the results of numerous focus group discussions with faculty at universities across the country. The discussions centered on how to address and prevent sexual harassment in higher education agriculture and natural resources programs with outdoor lab spaces.
The findings, which outline a list of best practices for faculty, were published in the North American College and Teachers of Agriculture journal: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nactateachers.org"">https://www.nactateachers.org</url>/
The work was funded by a USDA Higher Education Challenge Grant, and Copenheaver said she hopes to apply for another grant to continue this work.
She also has spoken with several professional groups about the work.
For many years, even during her own time in college, Copenheaver said she normalized some of the behavior and language that she heard in her forestry classes. She chalked up the language to the fact that the majority of students in those courses are male and some of the words were spoken as jokes. For example, in some of her classes for forestry majors at Virginia Tech, there may be only one female student among an all-male roster.
Copenheaver herself was one of few females in her master's and doctoral programs, and she now recalls being a victim of sexual harassment. She heard certain language so often that she assumed it was what women had to endure in her field.
""I didn't even know that's what it was,"" she said.
Her work over the last few years has opened her eyes to changes that she needs to make to ensure that her students feel secure.
""They [students] know how to behave in a classroom; they've been doing it since kindergarten,"" Copenheaver said. ""But we're driving to the woods, and people's informal behavior comes out. It's my job to police their language, because that's still part of the class, and I still have to create a safe space for all of my students.""
The focus groups outlined a list of best practices for faculty to address sexual harassment upfront with their students. This includes stating rules in syllabi, bringing up the topic and expectations several times with the class, and establishing a laboratory code of conduct.
Others who worked with Copenheaver for the project include Adam Coates, an assistant professor of forest fire ecology and management at Virginia Tech; Adam Downing, a Virginia Cooperative Extension agent for agriculture, natural resources, and forestry in the Northern District; and Saskia van de Gevel, department chair and professor of geography and planning at Appalachian State University.
After talking with faculty from at least 10 universities, Downing said it was clear that many found it difficult to talk about sexual harassment in front of their students.
""There are words in this realm that people don't want to say out loud,"" he said. ""We need to be able to do that to have meaningful conversations. I think just looking for opportunities to have these conversations, not just checking the boxes that 'I got my Title IX training done,' would have some good outcomes.""
After hearing from her students, Copenheaver sought help about what she could do and change from Anthony Scott, chief of inclusion and belonging in the Division of Student Affairs at Virginia Tech.
Scott said that it is essential that faculty address these issues in front of their students and see this as an important teaching opportunity.
""We are supposed to be preparing these students to go out in the world and make a difference,"" he said. ""We can no longer continue to suggest through our silence that issues of equity and diversity and inclusion and belonging, that these issues aren't just as important as figuring out a mathematical formula.""
In the fall semester, Copenheaver initiated conversations about sexual harassment with her students and included explicit expectations in her syllabi. She will continue doing this going forward.
Copenheaver's research into these topics is unique to many agriculture and natural resources programs, said Wendy Fink, who is executive director of the academic programs section, and assistant vice president of food, agriculture, and natural resources at the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. Copenheaver presented her work for a subcommittee of the APLU this past summer.
""I think her research is very much needed in the fields of agriculture and natural resources,"" Fink said. ""Raising awareness on how to prevent sexual harassment or assault, including through bystander training and creating a culture that encourages reporting, remains critical to creating safer working and learning environments for everyone.""
Natalie Hedrick, a junior who is majoring in forestry at Virginia Tech, said she appreciates that Copenheaver is talking with her classes about how to treat one another appropriately.
""I think it's a conversation that needs to happen in every major within colleges,"" she said. ""It's better to say it 1,000 times than one. The repetition is key with people our age. Especially when we go out into the field, language does change.""
Hedrick said she enjoys having professors like Copenheaver in CNRE, who are female and can relate with her. In 2018, Copenheaver received the Society of American Foresters award for outstanding forestry education, the first woman ever to do so. She also received the Virginia Tech Alumni Award for Teaching Excellence in 2020.
Hedrick said Copenheaver helps her students feel that they are a part of a community.
""You don't feel uncomfortable asking questions,"" Hedrick said.
This is the kind of environment that Copenheaver wants to continue to foster - one in which students are not afraid to come to her with any questions or concerns.
""If we're not comfortable with it, if you have a student who is a victim, they will sense that you are uncomfortable, and they will never come to you,"" she said. ""My goal is to be clear in my communication about what is acceptable and what is unacceptable in my classroom space. And my classroom space extends beyond the four walls where we have lectures. If I'm there, you're in my class.""

ECON STUDENT'S CURIOSITY HELPS ANSWER A BURNING QUESTION,2021,01,"The following information was released by the University of Oregon:
Matthew Dodier always knew he wanted to work in international development or public policy. But early in his undergraduate years, his destinationand the path to get therewas unclear.
What was clearat least to economics professor Ben Hansenwas that Dodier in 2014 displayed an impressive curiosity and work ethic in Hansen's intermediate microeconomics course.
Hansen, whose work in applied microeconomics focuses on crime, health, and labor, is always searching for standout students to undertake research projects for academic and personal growth. He quickly recognized Dodier's talent. ""Matt was one of those students,"" Hansen says, ""who was always attentive, interacted, and then would come to office hours and ask me more questions.""
RELATED LINKS
Hansen enlisted Dodier's help as a research assistant. Then, in 2015, Dodier was selected as a Ronald E. McNair Scholar, joining a federal program that prepares first-generation students with financial need and underrepresented students for doctoral studies. He was required to complete a research project of his own, and Hansen served as his mentor.
The topic emerged from Dodier's interest in development economics and environmental economics: conducting research on how forest fires impact public health.
Wildfires in Oregon were particularly intense in 2014, and as Dodier and Hansen kicked around ideas related to air pollution, ""the idea of looking at forest fires came up,"" Hansen says. ""That's something that is salient to everybody, but nobody had studied the impact on hospitalizations or its impact on pollution.""
Dodier examined the effect of wildfire smoke on respiratory health. He collected statewide data on hospital admissions for respiratory problems, forest fire statistics from the Oregon Department of Forestry, unemployment numbers from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, population data from the National Cancer Institute, and land data from the US Department of Agriculture. He then looked at the origin, size, and location of forest fires and data on local particulate matteror air pollutionto measure whether forest fires resulted in more pollution.
The research showed that the wildfire smoke emanating from forest fires indeed increased air pollution and caused hospitalizations to rise. That finding, Hansen says, ""speaks to one of the potential costs of a warmer, drier climate where we have more of these fires. And more broadly, it speaks to the role of pollution affecting the health of the local population.""
The issue takes on new relevance as researchers examine the connection between air pollution and COVID-19. A recent study from Harvard, for example, found that Americans living in more polluted areas are more likely to die from the disease than those in clearer regions.
The research was Dodier's first taste of a complex, fast-moving project with tough deadlines. The first big hurdle Dodier encountered was accessing the wealth of data he needed in a short amount of time. Then came the arduous task of merging all those disparate data sets to measure the impact of forest fires.
""Some of it was just frustrating,"" Dodier says. ""It was really stressful, and it taught me to deal with that.""
It also ignited a passion that still burns in the 2016 graduate today, as a PhD candidate in public policy at Harvard Kennedy School.
Dodier now has a clear path: he's set his sights on a career in academic research as a professor, perhaps not unlike Hansen, who helped Dodier discover where he could go with economics.
""I could talk to him about anything, not just econ,"" Dodier says. ""He was always encouraging and he gives real, honest feedback.""

If people leave, the villages will burn for sure,"" he told AFP. <br/>""For the next 40 years we will have no job and in the winter we are going to drown from the floods without the forests that were protecting us,"" he added. <br/>Addressing the criticism Sunday, Hardalias said that smoke and the wind direction and the resulting poor visibility had hampered the work of the water-dropping aircraft. <br/>But Nasos Iliopoulos, spokesman for the main opposition Syriza party, said many fires had burned out of control for days across Greece without high winds. Someone, he said, would have to take responsibility for the ""truly tragic"" devastation. <br/>Already late Saturday, Hardalias said that provisional shelter had been provided to 2,000 people evacuated from the island. <br/>In the previous 10 days alone, 56,655 hectares (140,000 acres) have been burnt in Greece, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. The average number of hectares burnt over the same period between 2008 and 2020 was 1,700 hectares. <br/>Britain, France, Spain and other countries have answered Greece's appeal for help, and on Sunday, Serbia announced it was sending 13 vehicles with 37 firefighters and three firefighting helicopters. <br/>The Greek authorities meanwhile are on high alert to prevent more arsons. <br/>Firefighters arrested three young men, aged between 16 and 21, Sunday morning at port city of Piraeus, near Athens, for attempted arson in nearby Perama. <br/>And Athens police said Sunday they had arrested a foreigner at a park in Athens trying to light napkins at the root of a tree. <br/>",US

"'State of the Climate' rally demands bolder action from Gov. Polis, lawmakers",2022,01,"<p nitf:lede=""true"">Jan 14, 2022( Colorado Newsline: <url normalizedValue=""https://coloradonewsline.com"">https://coloradonewsline.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> As Gov. Jared Polis stood in the Colorado House of Representatives to deliver his State of the State address on Thursday, dozens of Colorado environmental activists stood just yards away on the steps of the Capitol, once again demanding a more aggressive approach to the climate crisis from state government. 
<br/> Just weeks after the Marshall Fire became the latest climate-related disaster to strike the state, killing at least one person and razing more than a thousand homes in Boulder County, activists urged Polis to declare a 'climate emergency.' <br/> One sign held by a rallygoer featured an image of a burning home and asked: 'Who's next?' <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=""https://coloradonewsline.com/subscribe"">https://coloradonewsline.com/subscribe</url><br/>'We already have a humanitarian crisis here on our streets — with the fires, the tornadoes, the floods, the heat, it is coming,' said activist Harmony Cummings. 'Our elected officials are not doing enough to keep us safe.' <br/> The 'State of the Climate' rally, organized by a coalition of environmental groups including 350 Colorado, the Sierra Club, GreenLatinos and Colorado Rising, came as new data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed[1] that the last six months were Colorado's hottest on record. <br/> In a monthly summary[2] released Thursday, state climatologists with the Colorado Climate Center echoed other experts in identifying a warming climate as a key factor in the unprecedented Marshall Fire, which surpassed the 2013 Black Forest Fire to become the most destructive wildfire in state history. 'Underlying climate conditions of drought, record warmth over the previous 6 months, and near record dry air provided all the ingredients,' the report said. <br/> Inside the Capitol, Polis, too, told lawmakers that recent disasters like the Marshall Fire and last year's Glenwood Canyon mudslides underscore the urgency of 'meeting the climate crisis head-on.' <br/> 'I'm grateful for the work my administration has done in partnership with Colorado's legislative leaders to move our state toward a cleaner, more renewable energy future,' Polis said. 'We've set Colorado on a path to reducing emissions statewide.' <br/> But that path isn't aggressive enough for many environmental activists, who want to see more ambitious emissions-cutting policies — and an approach from state government that includes restricting fossil fuel extraction. Their list of demands[3] to Polis includes the development of a plan by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to phase out drilling by 2030. <br/> 'Fossil fuels are responsible for 80% of carbon emissions, but it's business as usual at the COGCC,' said Christiaan van Woudenberg, an anti-fracking activist and member of the Erie Board of Trustees. 'Not a single permit has been denied. Governor, in order to keep your promises, you need to stop issuing drilling permits.' <br/> Focus on environmental justice <br/><br/>Wednesday wasn't the first time Polis' environmentalist critics have sought to put a spotlight on these issues during his State of the State address. Two years ago, 38 protesters[4] were arrested by Colorado State Patrol officers for a variety of disruptions, including chanting and displaying banners, before and during the governor's speech in the House chamber. The disruption charges were later dropped. <br/><url normalizedValue=""https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC_0372-scaled.jpeg"">https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC_0372-scaled.jpeg</url> Abolitionist and state House candidate Elisabeth Epps addresses the crowd gathered at the Colorado Capitol for a 'State of the Climate' rally on Jan. 13, 2022. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline) <br/>'No matter how many years in jail they threaten us with, we won't stop our accountability on Polis or any leader that turns their back on us or future generations,' GreenLatinos activist Ean Thomas Tafoya, who was among those arrested in 2020, told the crowd Thursday. <br/> Activists have clashed for years with Polis and his predecessor, Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper, over the rapid expansion of oil and gas drilling activity in Colorado during the last 15 years. That's especially the case when it comes to the fossil-fuel industry's impacts on communities with a long history of pollution, like the neighborhoods that surround the Suncor oil refinery in north Denver and Commerce City or the controversial drilling site[5] near Bella Romero Academy in Greeley. <br/> Thanks in large part to legislation passed by Democrats in the General Assembly, efforts to strengthen protections for 'disproportionately impacted communities' have been launched by multiple state agencies in recent years, including the COGCC, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Colorado Department of Transportation. But now activists want to see those processes produce tangible results. <br/> 'We're tired of being harmed,' said Renee Millard-Chacon, an activist and co-founder of the Indigenous group Womxn from the Mountain. 'We've defined disproportionately impacted communities — I'm no longer here to define or be on councils. I'm here to finally bring change.' <br/> Other speakers at the rally included Elisabeth Epps, founder of the Colorado Freedom Fund and a recently declared candidate for House District 6. Epps told rallygoers that the struggle for environmental justice and efforts to reform policing and prisons are linked — noting, for example, that some of those who are hurt the most by more intense and more frequent heat waves are inmates at prisons and jails who often have inadequate air conditioning. <br/> 'There are people in this building that have never stood up to power,' Epps said. 'If you want leaders that are going to take the actions necessary to protect not just our planet but the people and cultures on it, you need to elect leaders that have already been doing that work. <br/> 'I hope this isn't too controversial — y'all, the Earth is going to make it,' Epps added. 'Do you understand that? The Earth is going to last. It's us that might not make it.' <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=""https://coloradonewsline.com/donate"">https://coloradonewsline.com/donate</url><br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.denverpost.com/2022/01/13/colorado-climate-average/"">https://www.denverpost.com/2022/01/13/colorado-climate-average/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=""https://climate.colostate.edu/monthly_summary.html"">https://climate.colostate.edu/monthly_summary.html</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=""https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/unitedforclimatedemands/"">https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/unitedforclimatedemands/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.denverpost.com/2020/01/23/colorado-climate-protest-capitol-polis-criminal-charge/"">https://www.denverpost.com/2020/01/23/colorado-climate-protest-capitol-polis-criminal-charge/</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/23/bella-romero-greeley-school-fracking/"">https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/23/bella-romero-greeley-school-fracking/</url>

World news in brief,2020,04,"Australian High Court acquits cardinal of child sex offenses
CANBERRA, Australia - Cardinal George Pell, who is serving a six-year jail sentence for child sex abuse, has been successful in his bid to overturn his conviction in the Australian High Court.
Pell, 78, will be released immediately today after more than 400 days behind bars.
The judgment was handed down by Chief Justice Susan Kiefel in a near-empty courtroom in Brisbane due to coronavirus social distancing restrictions.
The appeal was allowed and the High Court ordered Pell's ""convictions be quashed and judgments of acquittal be entered in their place,"" as outlined in a statement sent to media.
Pell was sentenced by a Victoria state County Court judge in March last year to six years in prison for sexually abusing two 13-year-old choirboys in a back room of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne in December 1996 while he was archbishop of Australia's second-largest city.
Pell was also convicted of indecently assaulting one of the boys by painfully squeezing his genitals after a Mass in early 1997. Pell would have had to serve three years and eight months behind bars before he becomes eligible for parole.
A jury unanimously convicted Pell of all five charges in December 2018, but he was spared prison for three months while he underwent replacement surgery for both knees.
The High Court examined whether the Victorian Court of Appeal was correct in its 2-1 majority decision in August to uphold the jury verdicts.
U.N.: Syria likely behind attacks on 5 facilities
UNITED NATIONS - A U.N. investigation has concluded it is ""highly probable"" that the Syrian government or its allies were responsible for attacks on five facilities in the last opposition stronghold in the northwest in 2019 - a school, two health care centers, a hospital and a child care facility.
The investigators said it is ""probable"" a sixth attack on a Palestinian refugee camp in Aleppo was carried out either by armed opposition groups or by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the strongest militant group in northwest Idlib province that is affiliated with al-Qaida.
A summary of the 185-page confidential report by a board of inquiry appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was released Monday. It was charged with investigating incidents in the northwest after Russia and Turkey agreed to establish a ""de-escalation zone"" in Idlib on Sept. 17, 2018.
Iraqis report rocket attacks on U.S. oil facility
The Iraqi military said Monday that five rocket attacks hit a U.S. oil production facility.
The rockets targeted the site of Halliburton in the Burjesia area in the oil-rich Basra province, the military statement said. Two Iraqi security officials and one official at the state-run Basra Oil Company said five rockets at struck the area. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
A rocket launcher was subsequently found on the Zubair-Shuaiba road by security forces, according to the statement, with 11 unused missiles that were later defused.
No militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the rocket fire. There was no significant damage, the military said, adding that Iraqi security forces in Basra are searching for the perpetrators of the attack.
Halliburton is an American oil service provider working in the Zubair oil field, which is operated by the Italian ENI.
Monday's attack was the first since last summer to target U.S. oil companies working in the oil-rich south. A rocket struck an oil-drilling site in Basra last June, landing inside a compound housing energy giant Exxon Mobil, Shell and ENI.
Ukrainians fight forest fire near Chernobyl nuclear site
KYIV, Ukraine - Emergency teams in Ukraine on Monday continued battling a forest fire in the contaminated area around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant that has raised radiation fears.
Police said they tracked down a person suspected of starting the blaze by setting dry grass on fire in the area. The 27-year-old man said he burned grass ""for fun"" and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to expand quickly.
Two blazes erupted Saturday in the zone around Chernobyl that was sealed after the 1986 explosion at the plant.
Firefighters said they managed Monday to put out the smaller of the two fires, which engulfed about 12 acres, but the second one continued burning, covering about 50 acres.
Authorities said that radiation levels in the area substantially exceed normal levels, but the emergencies service said radiation levels in the capital, Kyiv, 60 miles south, were within norms.
Migrants force their way into Spain
MADRID - Some 50 migrants on Monday forced their way into Spain's Melilla city over the fence that separates the European enclave in northern Africa, authorities there said.
The central government's delegation in Melilla, which borders Morocco, said that they were part of a group of around 250 migrants who launched a ""massive and violent entry"" into the city, scaling the fence and ignoring the Spanish law enforcement officers on guard.
A Red Cross spokesman in the city said that volunteers had assisted several migrants with cuts and bruises at the gates of Melilla's temporary migrant internment center, and that at least four of them had been transferred to a hospital with possible bone fractures and other ailments.
Melilla and nearby Ceuta are two tiny enclaves separated from Morocco by barbed-wire fences and constant border monitoring.
Poland will vote for president through the mail
WARSAW, Poland - Polish lawmakers voted late Monday to conduct the country's forthcoming presidential elections exclusively through postal voting due to the lockdown imposed for the coronavirus pandemic.
Parliament also empowered house speaker Elzbieta Witek to push back the date of the election, if necessary. Both decisions by parliament require approval from the Senate and from President Andrzej Duda, who is seeking reelection.
Time was pressing for a decision on whether and how to hold the election that had been scheduled - before the pandemic hit - for May 10. Accelerating infections and strict containment measures would make it impossible for people to vote as usual, at polling stations.

Focus of government not to just conserve forests quantitatively but to qualitatively enrich it: Shri Bhupender Yadav
Posted On: 13 JAN 2022 2:51PM by PIB Delhi
Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Bhupender Yadav, today released the India State of Forest Report 2021 prepared by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) which has been mandated to assess the forest and tree resources of the country.
Sharing the findings, the Minister informed that the total forest and tree cover of the country is 80.9 million hectare which is 24.62 percent of the geographical area of the country. As compared to the assessment of 2019, there is an increase of 2,261 sq km in the total forest and tree cover of the country.
The Minister expressed happiness over the fact that the present assessment reveals that 17 states/UTs have above 33 percent of the geographical area under forest cover and stated that the focus of the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is not just to conserve the forests quantitatively but to enrich it qualitatively.
The ISFR-2021 provides information on forest cover, tree cover, mangrove cover, growing stock, carbon stock in Indias forests, forest fire monitoring, forest cover in tiger reserve areas, above ground estimates of biomass using SAR data and climate change hotspots in Indian forests.
MAJOR FINDINGS
The total forest and tree cover of the country is 80.9 million hectare which is 24.62 percent of the geographical area of the country. As compared to the assessment of 2019, there is an increase of 2,261 sq km in the total forest and tree cover of the country. Out of this, the increase in the forest cover has been observed as 1,540 sq km and that in tree cover is 721 sq km.
Increase in forest cover has been observed in open forest followed by very dense forest. Top three states showing increase in forest cover are Andhra Pradesh (647 sq km) followed by Telangana (632 sq km) and Odisha (537 sq km).
Area-wise Madhya Pradesh has the largest forest cover in the country followed by Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Maharashtra. In terms of forest cover as percentage of total geographical area, the top five States are Mizoram (84.53%), Arunachal Pradesh (79.33%), Meghalaya (76.00%), Manipur (74.34%) and Nagaland (73.90%).
17 states/UTs have above 33 percent of the geographical area under forest cover. Out of these states and UTs, five states/UTs namely Lakshadweep, Mizoram, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya have more than 75 percent forest cover while 12 states/UTs namely Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Goa, Kerala, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Assam, Odisha, have forest cover between 33 percent to 75 percent.
Total mangrove cover in the country is 4,992 sq km. An increase of 17 sq Km in mangrove cover has been observed as compared to the previous assessment of 2019. Top three states showing mangrove cover increase are Odisha (8 sq km) followed by Maharashtra (4 sq km) and Karnataka (3 sq km).
Total carbon stock in countrys forest is estimated to be 7,204 million tonnes and there an increase of 79.4 million tonnes in the carbon stock of country as compared to the last assessment of 2019. The annual increase in the carbon stock is 39.7 million tonnes.
METHODOLOGY
In tune with the Government of Indias vision of digital India and the need for integration of digital data sets, FSI has adopted using the vector boundary layers of various administrative units upto districts level as provided by Survey of India along with digital open series topo sheets, in order to ensure comprehensive compatibility with the geographical areas as reported in Census, 2011.
The biennial assessment of forest cover of the country using mid-resolution Satellite data is based on interpretation of LISS-III data from Indian Remote Sensing satellite data (Resourcesat-II) with a spatial resolution of 23.5 meters with the scale of interpretation 1:50,000 to monitor forest cover and forest cover changes at District, State and National level.
This information provides inputs for various global level inventories, reports such as GHG Inventory, Growing Stock, Carbon Stock, Forest Reference Level (FRL) and international reporting to UNFCCC targets under CBD Global Forest Resource Assessment (GFRA) for planning and scientific management of forests.
Satellite data for the entire country was procured from NRSC for the period October to December 2019. The satellite data interpretation is followed by rigorous ground truthing. Information from other collateral sources are also used to improve the accuracy of the interpreted image.
The accuracy level achieved in the current assessment is the significantly high. The accuracy of forest cover classification has been assessed 92.99%. The accuracy of classification between forest and non-forest classes has been assessed 95.79% against internationally accepted accuracy of classification of more than 85%. A rigorous QC and QA exercise was also carried out.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT FEATURES of ISFR 2021
In the present ISFR 2021, FSI has included a new chapter related to the assessment of forest cover in the Tiger Reserves, Corridors and Lion conservation area of India. In this context, the decadal assessment of change in forest cover within Tiger Reserves, Corridors and Lion conservation area helps in assessing the impact of conservation measures and management interventions that have been implemented over the years.
For decadal assessment, change in forest cover, during the period between ISFR 2011 (data period 2008 to 2009) and the current cycle (ISFR 2021, data period 2019-2020) within each Tiger Reserves has been analysed.
A new initiative of FSI has also been documented in the form of a chapter, where the Above Ground Biomass has been estimated. FSI, in collaboration with Space Application Centre (SAC), ISRO, Ahmedabad, initiated a special study for estimation of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) at pan-India level, using L- band of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The results for the States of Assam and Odisha (as well as AGB maps), were presented earlier in ISFR 2019. The interim results for AGB estimates (and AGB maps) for the entire country are being presented as a new chapter in ISFR 2021. The detailed report will be published after completion of the study.
FSI in collaboration of with Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani, Goa Campus has performed a study based on Mapping of Climate Change Hotspots in Indian Forests. The collaborative study was carried out with the objective to map the climatic hotspots over the forest cover in India, using computer model-based projection of temperature and rainfall data, for the three future time periods i.e. year 2030, 2050 and 2085.
The report also contains information on various parameters State/UT wise. Special thematic information on forest cover such as hill, tribal districts, and north eastern region has also been given separately in the report.
It is expected that the information given in the report would provide valuable information for policy, planning and sustainable management of forest and tree resources in the country.",US
CITADEL STUDENT FINDS RARE PLANT FOR THE 1ST TIME IN CHARLESTON COUNTY,2021,01,"McCLELLANVILLE, Jan. 4 -- The Citadel issued the following press release:
A Citadel student recently discovered new populations of Carolina birds-in-a-nest, a relative of the mint plant with a showy pink flower that had never before been recorded in Charleston County.
The plant, which grows a few feet off the ground and can be hard to spot when it's not in bloom, prefers a wet, sunny environment.
Celie Dailey, who is pursing a master's degree in biology, stumbled on several thickets of the plant in bloom this summer at a conservation site on the Black River in southern Georgetown County.
The rare wildflower lives in a limited range in the coastal plains from Georgia to North Carolina. The federal government considers it an ""at-risk"" plant, and will decide whether it should be listed as threatened or endangered in 2023. Dailey reported the sighting to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
""They were really excited to find it,"" Dailey said. ""It turned out, it was kind of a monster population.""
But shortly after, Dailey spotted this rare plant again in an unexpected place - a roadside ditch in McClellanville. It was the first recorded population ever found in Charleston County.
Celie Dailey in 2019 with a patch of Carolina birds-in-a-nest, or Macbridea caroliniana, which she has found in several new spots around Charleston and Georgetown County. April Punsalan/Provided Joel Gramling, a Citadel professor and Dailey's adviser, said the discoveries are important in part because the plant, with the Latin name Macbridea caroliniana, is hard to keep track of. A 2016 survey couldn't find about 45 percent of the Macbridea population at previously discovered locations in South Carolina, Gramling said.
""We see this trend where we aren't able to find these populations, and now, all of a sudden, here's (Dailey) in several different counties, finding new populations,"" he said.
It's possible that the plant has been hard to detect because it blends in with other flora when it's not blooming. If previously sunny areas become shaded by new trees or shrubs, it may also recede into simple green stems.
Thriving populations are found in ""disturbed"" areas, which may have been cleared of larger plants by natural causes, such as a forest fire, or man-made ones, such mowing in a drainage ditch.
One of its main habitats - the edges of a swamp or inside a bog - can also be hard to access when the telltale blooms are out. Dailey said that in trips to the Black River site, she had to push through thickets of grass taller than she was, and was showered with ticks in the process.
""Nobody wants to be in a swamp in July,"" Dailey said. ""It's just nasty.""
But she said that the plant, though unassuming, is not just rare, it's special to the state. South Carolina has the biggest population of the plant among the three states in which it's been found.
It's just one of several overlooked plants that make up the state's biodiversity, she said.
""I just love these wild places because they are just so diverse,"" Dailey said. ""Roadside places where you have so-called 'weedy' plants growing wild, people just want to cut these areas down ... those types of areas are so cool to me, to see the abundance of life there.""
Residents who spot Carolina birds-in-a-nest can report it to the Fish and Wildlife Service office in Charleston at (843) 727-4707.

"Homes, lives spared in fire that raged across Sheepback Mountain",2022,04,"Apr. 5—MAGGIE VALLEY — A fire on Sheepback Mountain above Maggie Valley that originated from a brush fire Monday afternoon raged through the night and into Tuesday — threatening homes, forcing dozens of evacuations and consuming more than 300 acres before finally being quelled by rain.
Firefighters on the ground mobilized quickly when the fire broke out with a concerted strategy to save homes in the fire's path. Crews soaked down the perimeter of homes in advance of the fire and then hunkered down as it closed in, hoping it would sweep around them as it continued its march across the mountainside.
""We've got tanker trucks next to all the homes being threatened, and they are individually protecting each home,"" Allison Richmond, public information officer for Haywood Emergency Services, said Monday evening. ""We hope the rain that's coming will extinguish it pretty well. In the meantime, we are doing a good job keeping it away from people's homes.""
Fire departments from across Haywood County and beyond battled the blaze through the night, along with support from the N.C. Forest Service, National Park Service and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.
""Crews are working around the clock. They are coming in from all over Western North Carolina lending a hand,"" said Christina Esmay, public information officer for the Haywood County Sheriff's Office.
Brenda Mancuso, who lives on Sheepback Mountain, was grateful to the crews who put themselves in harm's way to stop the fire.
""It was a rough night. I didn't sleep at all,"" said Mancuso, who stayed with a friend after having to evacuate her RV. ""I just kept reminding myself no matter what happens to me I am on God's plan, and I don't have control over it. You just have to trust in God. So that's what I did.""
Tuesday morning, emergency officials allowed Mancuso to return to her property and see how it had fared. Speaking by phone as she pulled up to her RV, she broke into tears upon finding it had been spared.
""If I had lost everything, it would have been catastrophic. I think it would have broken me,"" she said.
She had to evacuate so quickly Monday, she only had time to grab her two cats and her dog.
""I kind of just froze. I couldn't think of what to bring,"" said Mancuso.
Evacuations
An evacuation notice was sent out via the Haywood County Emergency Text alert system shortly after the fire broke out. Responders followed up by going door-to-door.
Mark Jones, who lives on Sheepback Mountain Road, returned home from work Monday afternoon to find the road leading to his home barricaded and the mountainside billowing with smoke and flames.
""They wouldn't let me get up the hill at first, but when I told them I had pets to go after, they drove me up in a utility vehicle,"" Jones said.
Jones was put at ease upon seeing a fire tanker truck stationed in his driveway to guard the house should the flames encroach.
""I said, 'Do I have a minute or two to grab some other things?'"" Jones recalled.
But as he tore through his house, he found himself at a loss.
""You always think about what you need to have in case you ever have to evacuate, but when it happens, your mind kind of goes blank,"" Jones said. ""We were mostly just worried about the babies.""
So he got his dog Bailey, a rat terrier, and his ball python, Buttercup.
""When I told the fire chief at the bottom of the hill I had a python, he joked 'I was going to help you out until you told me that,'"" Jones said.
Jones and his wife spent the night at a hotel in Maggie Valley. But he couldn't sleep. So around 1:30 a.m., he got in his car and drove up Soco Road to the observation tower to look down on the fire. By day, thick smoke mostly obscured the flames, but by night, the mountainside was awash in an eerie orange glow.
As firefighters battled the Sheepback Mountain fire on Monday afternoon, a smaller and unrelated fire broke out on the other side of Soco Road up Setzer Cove. Leilani Hutchinson had been watching the smoke when her phone dinged. It was a Haywood County Emergency text alert with another evacuation notice — this time for her area.
""It told us to leave immediately,"" she said. ""I got my dogs and our medicine, and that's about it.""
How the fire started
Haywood County emergency officials had not publicly confirmed how the fire yet started as of Tuesday. But according to eyewitnesses, the fire originated from a controlled brush fire by a landscaping crew that had been doing some clearing.
""Around 11 o'clock, they started burning brush and trees on the property just below my cabin,"" said Tom Kassem, who lives along Pless Underwood Road. ""They said they dug a big hole and were being very careful, and it wasn't windy, so I don't know how it got out of hand.""
Kassem left for a while, but his housemate Saad Ghanem was still home when the fire enveloped him.
""All the way around the cabin was fire and smoke,"" said Ghanem, who speaks limited English. ""Too much scared. I grabbed my dog and run down the mountain so fast.""
Ghanem tried to run down the driveway toward the road, but the fire was blocking his way. So he took off down the steep mountainside, leaping and jumping through the woods with his dog in his arms.
He fell as he was running, scratching up his back and injuring his shoulder in the process. Ghanem made his way to a nearby home, where an ambulance came and picked him up.
The fire moved quickly once it got out of control. By dusk, it had already burned 75 acres.
Kassem said he doesn't blame the landscaping crew that had been burning the brush. The crew was in their truck at the mobile command center set up at the base of the mountain Monday evening to coordinate the response.
""They told me they weren't trying to hurt anybody, that it wasn't intentional. I said 'It's OK, everybody makes mistakes,'"" Kassem said.
Quelling the flames
Along with ground response, firefighting efforts were aided by robust air support.
""We have two spotter planes circling the fire to monitor its movement, plus a helicopter and two air tankers dropping water,"" Richmond said, speaking Monday from the mobile command center. ""The spotter planes keep an eye on which direction the fire is moving and where they need to concentrate their efforts.""
The helicopter made a continuous circuit between Maggie Valley and Lake Junaluska, where it scooped up water to carry back to the fire. The tanker planes had to go to the Asheville Airport to refill, however, Richmond said.
The fire had burned 75 acres by the time dusk fell Monday night. It had grown to 200 acres by 10 a.m. Tuesday morning, with the fire only 30% contained. WIthin an hour of rain moving in Tuesday afternoon, the fire was 100% contained.
Community pitched in
An outpouring of community support was provided to firefighters and first responders, Esmay said.
Local churches showed up at the mobile command center with a steady stream of donuts, hot coffee, snacks and food to keep the crews fed. Victory Baptist Church offered its parking lot for the mobile command center and opened bathrooms to the crews.
Maggie Valley Fire Department was the lead agency for the fire response, though aid came in from every fire department in the county. Two fire departments from Jackson County — Savannah and Balsam-Willetts — brought crews and trucks to staff the Maggie Valley Fire Station and respond to any other calls that came in since local firefighters were occupied with the forest fire.
A shelter and reunification center was set up at Calvary Baptist Church Monday afternoon.
""We are serving as a staging area to help folks that may have been displaced or are looking for loved ones who evacuated,"" said Teresa Allison with Haywood County Health and Human Services. ""Anybody that needs a place to stay in the interim while they are putting out the fire is welcome to come here and help with whatever their needs may be.""
Pull-offs along Soco Road leading up to the Blue Ridge Parkway were crowded with people Monday who watched in shock from the vantage point overlooking the valley. Maggie Valley Alderwoman Tammy Wight was among them.
""My prayers are with the families and firefighters and first responders. I just hope everybody's safe,"" Wight said.

Megafire Doesn't Deter Yosemite's Spotted Owls,2020,09,"In 2013 the Rim Fire-the largest fire on record in the Sierra Nevada-burned one third of the potential California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) habitat in Yosemite National Park.
The park provides prime habitat for this Spotted Owl subspecies, which is listed as a Species of Special Concern by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and concern grew regarding the fire's effect on Yosemite's owl populations. But recent research provides some good news regarding the park's owls, and it may be due to Yosemite's unique history and fire management strategy.
In a study published last week in the journal Forest Ecology and Management, researchers from The Institute for Bird Populations and Yosemite National Park found that Spotted Owl numbers and nesting rates remained stable in areas of the park that were burned by the Rim Fire. Between 2015 and 2017, the researchers surveyed for Spotted Owls, locating their territories and determining their breeding status. They used satellite data to characterize the habitat in the study area, including how severely it burned.
""What surprised me, primarily, was not that owls were still present, but they were still present in the same numbers and still successfully setting up territories and breeding,"" says the study's lead author Lynn Schofield, a biologist with The Institute for Bird Populations. While the owls avoided the most severely burned areas, they still held territories within the fire's perimeter.
California Spotted Owls can tolerate forest fire, but Schofield cautions that not all fires are created equal. Yosemite's forests have not been commercially logged since the early 1900s and fire suppression efforts since the 1970s have been kept to a minimum. This results in a forest structure and fire regime that is distinct from what is found outside of the park.
""In Yosemite there is a diversity of forest habitat"" explains Schofield, ""This means the Rim Fire burned with a diversity of severities creating a range of post-fire habitat for owls to choose from."" The study notes that in portions of the adjacent Stanislaus National Forest that were also burned by the Rim Fire, burn severity was more homogenous likely due to the contrasting logging and fire management regime on the National Forest.
The frequency of large, high intensity ""megafires"" like the Rim Fire is expected to increase in the Sierra Nevada. These megafires are considered one of the most important conservation threats to the California Spotted Owl. This study suggests that Yosemite's owl population has benefited from the park's diverse forest habitats and restored fire regime, and that these factors have allowed them to thrive even after a major disturbance like the Rim Fire.
""At Yosemite, restoring fire to its natural role is one of our management priorities,"" says Sarah Stock, a wildlife ecologist at Yosemite and co-author of the study. ""It's gratifying to see that this strategy is paying off for the park's wildlife.""

Gov.: Vermont has fewest cases but must keep up guard,2020,07,"MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — Vermont has the lowest number of COVID-19 cases in the country and hasn't had a death from the illness in more than a month but the state has to remain vigilant because of the rapid spread of the coronavirus in other parts of the country, Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday.
“In looking across the country, we continue to see a forest fire spreading in the south and west and things could shift back towards us so we have keep our guard up,” said Scott, a Republican, during his regular virus briefing.
The state is considering expanding its mask mandate, Scott said, although he added that he's concerned that “a mandate will create unnecessary conflict.”
""With the numbers that we see in Vermont, particularly in our most rural areas, the data hasn't yet supported a change to the status quo,"" said Scott, who said he would have more information on Friday.
He advised Vermonters to be smart about where they travel and only go to areas that the state has identified as low risk. Residents who are traveling from other locations or taking a flight or public transportation to Vermont should quarantine for 14 days, he said.
MANCHESTER-AREA CASES
Eighty percent of the 65 patients who tested positive for the virus after taking an antigen test that is not considered to be as accurate as the test used by the Health Department have been retested and only four were confirmed positive cases, said Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.
""Through interviews and lab data, we've determined that 59 of the 65 antigen positives are not cases,"" he said.
Vermont does not count tests as positive unless they are done with a more reliable system, Levine has said. The Health Department uses a PCR test.
The PCR test is more available and has been used extensively nationally and internationally, Levine said. “Give it a little time and they'll be able to rely on the antigen test, I would hope, too,” he said.
The PCR test is preferable for people who are asymptomatic, Levine said. The likelihood of developing symptoms would probably occur from the fourth to seventh day, he said. The Health Department recommends that people who feel they've been exposed to the virus to get a test on the seventh day, Levine said.
THE NUMBERS
The Vermont Health Department on Tuesday reported seven new positive cases of the virus that causes COVID-19, bringing the state's total number since the pandemic began to 1,366.
The total number of deaths from COVID-19 has remained at 56 for more than a month.
For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause more severe illness and can lead to death.",US
Borough to do aerial survey of peninsula,2021,03,"When people piloting a small-wing plane take to peninsula skies this spring, it won't just be because they want to see the sights. They'll be part of a borough effort to improve and update the Kenai Peninsula Borough's aerial imagery resources.
The flight will be one of four made possible by a recent unanimous vote in support of legislation by the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly. That legislation also approved additional funds to pay for the flight this spring. The four flights are described in a sole source award the assembly voted for the borough to enter into with the company EagleView, with flights planned for the purpose of gathering updated and high-quality imagery of the borough.
While most beneficial to the borough's assessing department, which can use the imagery to meet assessing canvassing criteria, the imagery can also be used for general government, safety and public uses.
The last time the borough conducted a general capture of imagery was in 2012 and 2013 for the western Kenai Peninsula. Borough Land Management Officer Marcus Mueller said during a Feb. 16 meeting of the Assembly's Finance Committee that the borough has undergone many changes since that capture. Reflected in a new capture, Mueller said, would be things like forest fire damage, spruce bark beetle outbreaks and new homes and roads.
Mueller noted that while borough captures are used often by borough departments, the borough's parcel viewer webpage is their most-visited ""by a long shot,"" with several hundred thousand hits a year.
""This is a really big deal,"" Mueller said during the February meeting. ""Imagery is a really central information piece for a municipality to have.""
Borough Acting Assessing Director Adeena Wilcox said during the February meeting that the technology will save the borough's Assessing Department money and will reduce the risk posed to employees while out in the field, which she said can be dangerous and costly. Putting staff on a boat to survey the outer banks of the Seward area, for example, costs almost $20,000.
The department used the same technology last year to gather imagery of the eastern peninsula, Wilcox said. That project was able to be funded using CARES Act funds because it prevented assessing staff from having to go out into communities.
Wilcox said the technology will also grant the borough visual access to places they've been unable to survey on the ground.
The Native Village of Tyonek, for example, as a sovereign entity, has said that they do not want the assessing department in the community and has even escorted assessing staff off of property in the area.
""We don't want to be on the property if the taxpayer doesn't want us on the property,"" Wilcox said. ""They have the right to tell us not to be there.""
Aerial imagery, Wilcox said, will not replace in-person sales, appeal and year-end inspections conducted by the department and would be used specifically for canvassing.
In all, the ordinance outlines four projects with EagleView that have a projected combined cost of almost $650,000.
The first flight, to take place in spring 2021, will cost about $340,000 and would cover most of the western peninsula.
The second flight, to take place in spring of 2022, will cost about $127,700 and would cover the western shore of Cook Inlet, the tip of the peninsula and the southern shore Kachemak Bay plus Seldovia.
The third flight, scheduled for spring 2023, will cost about $116,000 and would cover most of the peninsula south of Skilak Lake.
The final flight, estimated for spring 2024, would cost about $64,000 and cover the central peninsula.
Wilcox said during the February meeting that conducting flights in spring produces better imagery because many trees lack substantial leaves that block views of the ground.
The ordinance, which was approved unanimously by the assembly during their March 2 meeting, adds about $63,000 to the borough's GIS budget to help fully fund the initial flight scheduled for this spring.
Interactive GIS imagery of the Kenai Peninsula Borough can be found on the borough website at kpb.us/gis-dept/interactive-mapping.

NASA tools could help fight fires from the sky and the ground,2021,08,"The fire wasn't real that day in the rolling hills of Northern California, already turning crisp and brown at the beginning of May. But it offered the perfect opportunity for a group of NASA researchers to test the technology they've been building.
Their demonstration at a wildfire simulation outside Redding, California, showed how emergency responders of all kinds could work more safely and effectively using the prototype tools of NASA's STEReO project - Scalable Traffic Management for Emergency Response Operations.
The faux fire, marked out with orange flags and smoke flares, was being used for aerial firefighting training by STEReO's partners at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CAL FIRE, and the U.S. Forest Service. The exercises focused on the role in wildfire response of an air traffic controller in the sky.
Circling above the scene, this person watches from the window of a plane. They visually track numerous aircraft and juggle their requests - over multiple radio frequencies - to fly near the fire or drop fire retardant, all while steering everyone clear of the firefighters on foot.
While the partners' trainees were learning this demanding job, NASA's STEReO team got to work testing tools that could one day assist them.
New Solutions Require New Coordination
Wildland firefighting is no joke, and, today, critical decisions about dangerous situations rely in part on reports that come in from teams in the field. New technologies could help here: imagine, instead, drones sending real-time data from the perimeter of a forest fire to determine where crews will be most effective.
But that means even more moving parts to coordinate and, without the tools to do it, drones have largely had to stay on the sidelines of wildfire incidents when piloted aircraft are around.
""Planes and helicopters fighting fires have had limited awareness of the drones' whereabouts,"" said Joey Mercer, STEReO's principal investigator at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, ""but STEReO provides a way to see all operations responding to a disaster, in the air and on the ground.""
It also sends out alerts to signal potential issues, like a plane getting close to a drone. STEReO is building on the agency's expertise in drone traffic management to develop these tools that let all elements of an emergency response stay in close contact and out of each other's way.
The result is a system that can be deployed during and after emergencies, from fires to hurricanes, wherever they may be.
""STEReO is a portable system,"" said Mercer, ""and we're developing a sort of 'bring your own internet' capability. That means the system works without high-speed internet access from the usual providers, which is likely to be lacking in a remote area struck by wildfire or a city following an earthquake or major storm.""
Firefighting in the Air, on the Ground, and on Screen
The project also created software tools that show in real time which operations are happening and where. Teams responding to a disaster can follow the action on their own screens, with a data display like a cell phone map in satellite mode. Moving icons show aircraft and humans at work, and the areas where drones will fly are marked.
From April 26 to May 7, 2021, the STEReO team got to see their tools in action in the most realistic setting yet: working alongside CAL FIRE and Forest Service firefighting teams in training.
In this part of Northern California's countryside cell phones have only sketchy coverage, so STEReO's portable internet would definitely be needed. The team arranged their communications equipment strategically and proved that the area of a fire, even in hilly terrain, could be blanketed with STEReO's wifi coverage.
Above them, firefighting planes and helicopters flew in coordination with NASA drones. STEReO tracked them all, along with ground crews and some simulated aircraft for added complexity.
By the end of the demonstration, STEReO's partners had seen how the technology could work for them in a real-world setting, and which tools would help them most when fires strike.
New Technology for a Growing Need
This work, which is led by Ames in collaboration with two other NASA centers - Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and Glenn Research Center in Cleveland - is a concept study under NASA's Convergent Aeronautics Solutions project. The CAS activity is designed to determine STEReO's feasibility, and the results will help determine whether to pursue further development.
Support from CAS is something like a start-up investment for technology exploration government research is well suited for.
""For STEReO, we built basically four or five individual 'products',"" said Mercer. ""We designed them based on input from our partners, and, after seeing how it all came together during the flight demonstration, they identified the products they needed most. This was a low-cost way of connecting technology still in development with their immediate needs - something NASA is particularly good at.""
As climate change impacts extreme weather events, there may be a growing need for tools like those STEReO is creating. The team will continue developing the system, aiming to let its partners test some of the tools independently next year.
By applying NASA technologies to responders' most critical needs, STEReO's creators hope to let them work together seamlessly, helping save property, homes, and lives.",US
Icarus breaks up the survival genre into smart session-based gameplay,2021,06,"<p nitf:lede=""true"">Jun 24, 2021( VentureBeat: <url normalizedValue=""http://venturebeat.com"">http://venturebeat.com</url>/ Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> How to protect your game from cheaters and pirates  <br/> Join Dean Takahashi and others to learn how to defend your game against cheaters and pirates.  <br/> Register Now[1]  <br/><br/>Where does your enterprise stand on the AI adoption curve? Take our AI survey[2] to find out.  
<br/><br/> Icarus[3] is the new game from developer RocketWerkz[4], which DayZ creator Dean Hall[5] founded in New Zealand following his time at Bohemia Interactive[6]. The quick-and-dirty description for Icarus is that it is like Valheim in space. It's a survival game where you'll need to gather resources and build up your tech tree to survive harsh environments. But Icarus puts a spin on the formula with a session-based structure that may make the game even more addictive and appealing when it launches on Steam for $30 on August 12[7]. <br/> I've spent some time playing Icarus, including a session with Hall, who showed me around the world. And one of the first things I noticed is that I had no desire to cut my first run into the world short. I was getting my bearings and learning the mechanics, and the last thing I wanted was to go back up to my space station. And that's something that Hall said the team learned when testing the game. <br/> RocketWerkz originally designed Icarus with short early sessions and longer late-game sessions in mind, but the team actually found that people prefer the opposite. Like me, most people want to spend a long time in a world when they first boot up Icarus. Then later, after leveling up a character and getting in a flow, players enjoy shorter, more goal-oriented runs. And while that was not immediately intuitive or obvious to RocketWerkz, the designers see why that makes sense now. <br/> Like in a lot of sandbox-style games, everything seems possible when you first land in Icarus. And you want to take time to learn the boundaries and dynamics of the world. You will then apply those lessons to accomplish specific purposes once you know what you want to do. <br/><br/> Systems, DLSS, and ray tracing <br/>We tried to start a forest fire. That's the key takeaway from my time in Icarus. It has physics systems that simulate fire and its spread, but we actually failed at getting the fire to jump from one tree from another. But Hall thinks that is because it had just rained in the game. That thunderstorm itself was spectacular — with its own fire-causing lightning strikes. But the moisture left the forest too wet for our arsonist inclinations. <br/> Icarus is brimming with systems like that, and it adds to the sense that you're exploring a sandbox or possibility space. <br/> Another factor that makes Icarus stand out is its visuals and tech. RocketWerkz has already implemented Nvidia's deep-learning supersampling (DLSS) as well as RTX-powered global illumination. This means that you can get realistic-behaving light rays, and DLSS then means you can even run the game at a decent framerate. Even in my early sessions, Icarus regularly hits a better-than-playable framerate thanks to DLSS. And that's before RocketWerkz had given the game its final optimization pass before launch. <br/> We'll see what the game is like once its out for everyone, but it's definitely a game I find myself gravitating toward. A part of that is I haven't had a survival game in my life recently. But I also think Icarus is promising a compelling loop with the potential for emergent storytelling, and that could help it find an audience when it's available beginning August 12.

Borough to do aerial survey of peninsula,2021,03,"When people piloting a small-wing plane take to peninsula skies this spring, it won't just be because they want to see the sights. They'll be part of a borough effort to improve and update the Kenai Peninsula Borough's aerial imagery resources.
The flight will be one of four made possible by a recent unanimous vote in support of legislation by the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly. That legislation also approved additional funds to pay for the flight this spring. The four flights are described in a sole source award the assembly voted for the borough to enter into with the company EagleView, with flights planned for the purpose of gathering updated and high-quality imagery of the borough.
While most beneficial to the borough's assessing department, which can use the imagery to meet assessing canvassing criteria, the imagery can also be used for general government, safety and public uses.
The last time the borough conducted a general capture of imagery was in 2012 and 2013 for the western Kenai Peninsula. Borough Land Management Officer Marcus Mueller said during a Feb. 16 meeting of the Assembly's Finance Committee that the borough has undergone many changes since that capture. Reflected in a new capture, Mueller said, would be things like forest fire damage, spruce bark beetle outbreaks and new homes and roads.
Mueller noted that while borough captures are used often by borough departments, the borough's parcel viewer webpage is their most-visited ""by a long shot,"" with several hundred thousand hits a year.
""This is a really big deal,"" Mueller said during the February meeting. ""Imagery is a really central information piece for a municipality to have.""
Borough Acting Assessing Director Adeena Wilcox said during the February meeting that the technology will save the borough's Assessing Department money and will reduce the risk posed to employees while out in the field, which she said can be dangerous and costly. Putting staff on a boat to survey the outer banks of the Seward area, for example, costs almost $20,000.
The department used the same technology last year to gather imagery of the eastern peninsula, Wilcox said. That project was able to be funded using CARES Act funds because it prevented assessing staff from having to go out into communities.
Wilcox said the technology will also grant the borough visual access to places they've been unable to survey on the ground.
The Native Village of Tyonek, for example, as a sovereign entity, has said that they do not want the assessing department in the community and has even escorted assessing staff off of property in the area.
""We don't want to be on the property if the taxpayer doesn't want us on the property,"" Wilcox said. ""They have the right to tell us not to be there.""
Aerial imagery, Wilcox said, will not replace in-person sales, appeal and year-end inspections conducted by the department and would be used specifically for canvassing.
In all, the ordinance outlines four projects with EagleView that have a projected combined cost of almost $650,000.
The first flight, to take place in spring 2021, will cost about $340,000 and would cover most of the western peninsula.
The second flight, to take place in spring of 2022, will cost about $127,700 and would cover the western shore of Cook Inlet, the tip of the peninsula and the southern shore Kachemak Bay plus Seldovia.
The third flight, scheduled for spring 2023, will cost about $116,000 and would cover most of the peninsula south of Skilak Lake.
The final flight, estimated for spring 2024, would cost about $64,000 and cover the central peninsula.
Wilcox said during the February meeting that conducting flights in spring produces better imagery because many trees lack substantial leaves that block views of the ground.
The ordinance, which was approved unanimously by the assembly during their March 2 meeting, adds about $63,000 to the borough's GIS budget to help fully fund the initial flight scheduled for this spring.
Interactive GIS imagery of the Kenai Peninsula Borough can be found on the borough website at kpb.us/gis-dept/interactive-mapping.

"Modern Folk Duo, Joselyn &amp; Don, Uplift Spirits During Pandemic and Seek to Support California Wildfire First Responders and Victims with Debut Album, ""Soar""",2020,09,"PR Newswire
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- The upcoming full-length album, ""Soar,"" from LA based acoustic duo, Joselyn &amp; Don, will be released September 4th on all streaming platforms, and available on Joselyn &amp; Don's website to purchase as a physical CD or digital download.
'Soar' is somehow timely and timeless, recalling the singer songwriters of the 1970's with a fresh, modern perspective. ""You can just imagine yourself traipsing through the Wild West when listening [to Joselyn &amp; Don]... and there's something very evocative about the whole thing,"" says Jane Howking of York Calling Magazine.
The couple recorded the album over the past two years in their home studio aptly named Garden Studio after the surrounding bountiful fruit trees and vegetable garden. The project was finished during the COVID-19 pandemic and features Don on guitars, drums, horns and bass. Besides her vocals and songwriting, Joselyn adds ukulele, keys and various hand drums. ""This new project is rooted in my early upbringing in Montana listening to bluegrass and folk, and my connection to nature."" Joselyn shares, ""I'm writing better songs now than I did in my 20's. Motherhood and the challenges I've faced in life have enriched my work. Being a musician and sharing your art should be something you can do at any age, because our experience of being human is constantly changing.""
Initially inspired by a California forest fire, the driving anthem, ""Storm,"" from the album acknowledges that the many challenges we face have created a storm we can no longer ignore. An intimate acoustic intro quickly swells with electric guitar, African percussion, and soaring female vocals. The official music video for the advance single, which is dedicated to the first responders and fire victims, premiered on Friday, August 28th (<url normalizedValue=""https://youtu.be/2_qSQ25KSAQ"">https://youtu.be/2_qSQ25KSAQ</url>) and will serve to raise awareness as well as funds for the organizations California Fire Foundation and GlobalGiving - CA Wildfires to provide direct relief.
Joselyn &amp; Don are a refreshing new voice in modern folk showcasing evocative American roots storytelling, rich soulful vocals and stellar musicianship. When they are not writing, recording and releasing music, Don keeps busy as the Film Editor of The Simpsons and Joselyn tours with her international women's group, ADAAWE, which she formed after living in Ghana, West Africa, and works closely with arts education organizations.
Keep up with Joselyn &amp; Don on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and on their website (<url normalizedValue=""https://bit.ly/Joselyn-Don"">https://bit.ly/Joselyn-Don</url>) for info on the release of their debut album, ""Soar,"" as well as their Livestream Album Release Concert on September 4th at 6pm PST.

Cheney and Kinzinger may be too late,2021,08,"I wish I could be a Cheney fan. I really do. Rep. Liz Cheney has conducted herself honorably for the past nine months. Her courage in telling the truth about the election and the insurrection of Jan. 6 has been punished by the Republican conference, which booted her from leadership and replaced her with the lying, scheming Trumpist, Rep. Elise Stefanik. Former President Donald Trump is apparently working feverishly to unseat Cheney from Congress altogether, and his lickspittle lieutenants are joining the effort.
The invertebrate minority leader, Kevin McCarthy -- who, let's recall, declared on Jan. 13 that ""the president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters"" -- has long since scurried back under Trump's skirts, from whence he issues barbs against the few remaining Republicans who still have some principles. McCarthy sniped that Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, the other Republican appointed to the Jan. 6 committee over the objections of party leadership, are ""Pelosi Republicans.""
The opening segments of the Jan. 6 committee were another fine moment for Cheney. She began by thanking the police officers who testified about their experiences defending the Capitol that day:
""Thank you to each of the witnesses appearing before us today. ... You defended the Constitution and our Republic, and every American owes you our undying gratitude.""
She went on to outline the stakes:
""If those responsible are not held accountable, and if Congress does not act responsibly, this will remain a cancer on our Constitutional Republic, undermining the peaceful transfer of power at the heart of our democratic system.""
Those are good words, and as I said above, I respect Cheney's willingness to pay a price. She understood that by taking on the ""Big Lie"" and the almost-as-consequential lie about what happened on Jan. 6, she was risking her leadership position, her seat and possibly her own security. Every word of truth that she (and Kinzinger) utters is like a balm of Gilead.
And yet, the voice in the back of my head keeps saying, ""Is it too late?""
Both Cheney and Kinzinger, may they live to be 120, had many, many earlier opportunities to extinguish this forest fire before it became a raging inferno. Both supported Trump's reelection in 2020. Kinzinger said he was ""upset"" by President Joe Biden's victory. Cheney appeared on ""Fox and Friends"" in July 2020, and while she allowed that she disagreed with Trump on some issues, most notably withdrawal from Afghanistan, she emphasized how important it was that Trump be reelected: ""Whether or not we have debates and discussions internally -- as I'm sure we continue, we will continue to do -- we are going to be absolutely united going forward on the big issues, and I'm not going any place.""
Both Cheney and Kinzinger voted against the first Trump impeachment. They stuck with their support for his reelection, despite the first debate with Biden, despite the catastrophic handling of COVID-19, despite Trump's green light to China's Uyghur camps, despite QAnon, and despite the avalanche of lies and cruelty that corrupted America's soul -- and prepared the ground for the violent insurrection they are now investigating.
Is it welcome that they finally found a line they couldn't cross? A thousand times, yes. But how might this story have unfolded differently if they, and thousands of other Republicans, had found their uncrossable lines sooner?
You can say, ""The base is calling the shots, and the elected are just following what the voters demand."" That's nonsense. The base doesn't get its ideas from nowhere. It gets them from Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and the rest of the conservative media world. And it gets them from elected officials. To paraphrase what Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn told the Jan. 6 committee: When elected officials give permission, there is no limit to the violence that may ensue.
Trump was the arsonist. But if every time he dropped a match on the dry tinder of American polarization, Republican elected officials and others had leaped to extinguish the small flames, we would not be here.
And where is here? We have seen the end of 160 years of the peaceful transfer of power. We've seen the majestic United States Capitol turned into a scene from a dystopian fantasy; an armed mob attempting to subvert an election. They smashed and tortured and caused deaths. They erected a gallows and hunted for the speaker of the House and for the vice president. And Republicans, almost to a man and woman, are excusing, downplaying or whitewashing what happened. An entire political party has abandoned commitment to the rule of law.
To speak up now, well, it's better than nothing. But it's a little like saying you'll take away a drunk's driver's license after he crashed into and killed an 8-year-old. What about all of those times when you saw him get behind the wheel after five drinks and did nothing?
Trump attacked the basics of American democracy. The consequences were foreseeable. There were countless warnings. The great tragedy of this moment is not that Trump attempted what he did, but that so few Republicans tried to stop him when it would have made a difference.

ENVIRONMENT VIRGINIA RETURNS LIVE TO VMI,2022,04,"LEXINGTON, Va., April 4 -- Virginia Military Institute issued the following news release:
LEXINGTON, Va., April 4, 2022-The 32nd annual Environment Virginia Symposium at Virginia Military Institute returned to a live, in-person event on March 29-31. The event was held virtually in 2021 and canceled altogether in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event, organized and co-hosted by the VMI Center for Leadership &amp; Ethics (CLE), attracted nearly 400 attendees from state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, higher education and the private sector. Col. Dave Gray, director of CLE, served as master of ceremony for the event.
Topics at this year's symposium included offshore wind energy, solar farm mitigation strategies, food waste, land conservation, nature-based and construction solutions, solutions to decreasing plastic pollution, algae bloom across Virginia, partnerships in the Chesapeake Bay and more.
The keynote session featured three newly appointed state government officials: Rob Farrell, director of the Department of Forestry (DoF), Mike Rolband, director of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), and Matthew Wells, director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR).
Farrell serves as the eighth state forester of Virginia as well as the director of the DoF, which is responsible for protecting the forest resources of Virginia and ensuring trees and forests provide the greatest possible sustainable social, ecological, and economic benefits to the commonwealth. He joined the DoF as an area forester serving Gloucester and Mathews counties in 2000. He also served the agency as the first director of the forestland conservation program and as deputy state forester. In his opening statement at the symposium, he stated that two thirds of Virginia are covered in forest, a significant part of the commonwealth, and he supports and encourages good management of the forest. He stated that ""job number one is forest fire prevention,"" with which he believes the department has done an exceptional job, ""and our second mission is protecting the water during timber harvest."" He also stated that he is proud of the conservation easement program, a legal agreement between a landowner and a government agency or land trust that permanently limits future development of the land to protect its conservation values, while providing a tax reduction for the landowner.
Rolband founded Wetland Studies and Solutions Inc. (WSSI) in 1991 and grew his company into a multidisciplinary natural and cultural resources consulting firm with a staff of more than 200. His firm constructed the first LEED Gold facility in Virginia and utilized multiple low impact development practices for stormwater management in 2005. In 2014, WSSI was acquired by The Davey Tree Expert Co. and under Rolband's leadership, expanded to include offices in Maryland and across Virginia. WSSI assisted land developers and public works agencies navigate the Clean Water Act, Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act and local environmental regulations. During his talk at the symposium, Rolband stated that the DEQ has a strong foundation, and he wants to build on it to make it better. He cited four main initiatives:
1. ""One DEQ"": The DEQ has six regional offices and a central office and Rolband wants a better balance of the workload among the offices to improve efficiency.
2. Permitting Enhancement &amp; Evaluation Platform (PEEP): Rolband is developing a critical path management scheduling system for every class of permits that DEQ touches making the permitting process easier and more efficient. People applying for permits will be able to monitor the permit process online.
3. Stormwater Programs: Rolband plans on creating one comprehensive manual that does not expire. Currently there are five manuals that have conflicting rules and regulations. After the completion of the one manual, he plans to have training and certification requirements to reduce workloads.
4. Commodity Trading: There are streams, wetlands, and nutrients credits. Rolband currently sees there is a lack of information regarding supply, demand, and price. He wants a commodity trading platform that lets people buy and sell credits in real time and which get extinguished when associated with a permit used.
Wells has 20 years of experience related to Virginia politics, policy, and environmental advocacy. Most recently, he was the Senior Regional Manager for State Government Relations for WestRock, a global leader in sustainable fiber-based packaging solutions. Before joining WestRock in 2016, Wells held senior analyst and special advisory positions with Virginia's departments of Motor Vehicles and Alcohol Beverage Control. He holds a degree in foreign affairs from the University of Virginia and a certificate in sustainability from Virginia Commonwealth University. Wells stated that the parks and preserves are the ""backbone of our quality of life."" His focus will be on the Chesapeake Bay and the maintenance of the 2,700 dams in the state. He stated, ""We must take care of our people, so my first priority is safety."" He added that flood prevention and land conservation are also crucial.
A meaningful part of the annual symposium, is the announcement of the winner of the Captain Ron Erchul Environmental Leadership Award. This year's winner is Bettina Ring, the chief sustainability and diversity officer for the Sustainable Forestry Initiative. The award recognizes a Virginian who has made significant individual efforts to improve the environment. Members of Virginia's environmental community nominate candidates who are judged based on their vision, expertise, commitment, integrity, communication skills, accomplishments, and diplomacy. The award is named for the late VMI professor Ronald A. Erchul, Ph.D., founder of the Environment Virginia Symposium.
Ring is an innovative and thoughtful leader with more than 30 years of expertise in the public sector and nonprofit management, natural resources management, land and water conservation, agriculture and food systems, rural economic development, and public policy. During her very impactful career, she has served as Virginia's fourth Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry, as state forester (director of Virginia Department of Forestry), deputy state forester, senior vice president at American Forest Foundation, and in leadership roles with several other nonprofits.
Ring has been involved in the Virginia Department of Forestry water quality efforts since early in her career, worked on the Healthy Forested Watershed Project, and served on the Chesapeake Bay Principal Staff Committee for the last four years.
In addition to her trade missions and promotion of Virginia's No. 1 and No. 3 industries, Ring also worked with former Governor Ralph Northam '81 and the General Assembly to increase funding for Agriculture Best Management Practices, riparian buffers, and watershed positions, and most recently in the proposed funding for re-opening New Kent Forestry Center to expand seedling capacity in the state, Trees for Clean Water and urban tree canopy, establishing the first-ever state funding for urban and community forestry and land conservation including farmland preservation funding specifically designed to address heirs property issues.
She took an active role, working with the UVA Institute for Engagement and Negotiation, to put on the Governor's Summit on Equitable Collaboration.
""Ring is an outstanding leader who is very worthy of being named this year's Erchul Award winner,"" said Joe Maroon, executive director of the Virginia Environmental Endowment.
Each year, Virginia Military Institute donates $1,500 to a nonprofit environmental organization of the recipient's choice in their honor. Ring has requested that this donation be made to Virginia Natural Resources Leadership Institute.
Other awards presented at the symposium are the Governor's Environmental Excellence Awards, which recognize successful and innovative efforts that improve Virginia's environment. This year's gold medal winners are: Catawba Hospital for Greening of Government; the City of Harrisonburg Department of Public Works for the Harrisonburg urban forestry program; Coastal Virginia Ecotourism Alliance for the Virginia Water Trail; Fauquier County for Upper Rappahannock River Water Trail; George Mason University for Mason Sustainability Council's Circular Economy &amp; Zero Waste task force and the University of Virginia for waste minimization.
Silver medal winners are the City of Petersburg for Appomattox River Trail University Boulevard Overlook &amp; Trailhead; Virginia Tech for Plastic Pollution and Solid Waste Reduction Campus Wide Working Group and William &amp; Mary for institutionalized composting.
Receiving bronze medal awards are Arlington-Fairfax Chapter Inc., Izaak Walton League of America for their environmental management system; Chesterfield County for North Courthouse Library Neighborhood Connector Trail; Defense Supply Center Richmond for their fuel reduction program and Virginia Tech Office of Sustainability for their student internship program.
Receiving honorable mention is Hitachi Energy USA Inc. for their Paint Line Process Improvement Project and Smith Creek Watershed Partnership c/o Ridge to Reefs, Inc. for the Yancy Bioreactor.

"Breakthrough Energy Ventures, National Grid Partners and a Subsidiary of NextEra Energy Invest in TS Conductor to Meet the Growing Demand for Greener Electricity Grids",2021,11,"TS Conductor Corp., a pioneer in high-efficiency conductors for electricity grids, today announced that Breakthrough Energy Ventures, National Grid Partners and a subsidiary of NextEra Energy have joined Talkot and Hervé Touati in its oversubscribed Series A financing, for a total $25 million in funding. The new capital will be used to build the company's first state of the art manufacturing plant in the United States.
""We are thrilled to have Breakthrough Energy Ventures, National Grid Partners and a subsidiary of NextEra Energy investing in TS Conductor. Our mission is to make electricity networks greener. TS achieves that through a combination of energy efficiency and faster and cheaper renewable integration,"" said Dr. Jason Huang, CEO at TS Conductor Corp.
While the electricity generation segment of the energy industry has progressed to cleaner and more efficient solutions, the overhead conductor technology used by transmission and distribution grid operators has not materially changed since the emergence of Aluminum Core Steel Reinforced (ACSR) cables in 1908. ACSR still today represents over 95 percent of the utility cables deployed across the world.
According to <url normalizedValue=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketstudyreport.com%2Freports%2Fglobal-wires-and-cables-market-size-research&amp;esheet=52530605&amp;newsitemid=20211116005043&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Market+Study+Report%2C+LLC&amp;index=1&amp;md5=8c4b1aacc5a5f66b9662517a4f4079c9"">Market Study Report, LLC</url> , the global wires and cables market was estimated to represent $183 billion of sales in 2020, with an annual compounded growth rate anticipated to exceed 4 percent until 2028. Global investment in the power sector reached $780 billion in 2020 and was largely dominated by renewable power (48 percent) and electricity networks (32 percent) investments, according to the <url normalizedValue=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iea.org%2Freports%2Fworld-energy-investment-2021&amp;esheet=52530605&amp;newsitemid=20211116005043&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=International+Energy+Agency&amp;index=2&amp;md5=39ded247d7fe8dbc7923f343b9c723e9"">International Energy Agency</url> (IEA). While considerable, the IEA notes that current levels of renewable energy and energy efficiency investments still fall short of what is needed to maintain global temperatures well below a 2 ºC rise.
The UN climate targets create the need for new cable technologies that can reduce electricity network losses and accelerate the connection of wind and solar farms, which is one of the major bottlenecks of renewable energy expansion. Network losses amount to approximately 2000 TWh annually, or 6.7 times the electricity consumption of the U.K.
""Transmission is fundamentally important to our climate mission, yet it has seen limited innovation over the years. It is rare to find a transmission technology like TS Conductor with as much potential in terms of deployability, cost and efficiency,"" said Carmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures. ""TS Conductor will be a major enabler of increasing electricity demand and increasing penetration of renewables in a critical time. We are delighted to lead this round with a stand-out team and an outstanding technology.""
""National Grid has committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions 90 percent by 2040 and to net zero by 2050, and to accelerating the incorporation of wind, solar and battery storage in our grids in the UK and North America,"" said Lisa Lambert, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of National Grid and the President and Founder of National Grid Partners. ""There are few solutions enabling grid operators to reduce their electricity consumption, and TS Conductor is the most impressive solution I have encountered so far to decarbonize electricity grids. Their product, when combined with a top-notch management team, positions TS Conductor to be a leader in the market.""
TS Conductor was founded in 2018 by Rulong Chen, James Huang and Jason Huang, based on James Huang's patented conductor design. This new class of conductors is based on a unique combination of carbon composite and aluminum encapsulation of the composite core. The conductors can be installed with the same tools and operating procedures as ACSR cables. And they are compatible with industry standard field practice and can be used for:
Line reconductoring, allowing for the doubling of capacity of an existing line without having to change or retrofit any structures.",US
REAPING THE FRUIT OF A DECADE'S WORK IN THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO,2021,09,"The following information was released by the World Bank:
Trees with twisted trunks, countless waterfalls, fauna and flora resistant to annual droughts and periodic fires. This is the Cerrado, Brazil's second largest biome that spans an area of 2,036,448 km2 and is celebrated this September 11 across the country. Encompassing approximately 22% of Brazil's land, the Cerrado's high aquifer potential has earned it the ""water tank"" moniker for housing the springs of the three largest watersheds in South America. In total, an estimated 11,627 species of native plants have been catalogued in the biome, as well as 199 species of mammals, and a rich avifauna composed of 837 species[i].
Considered the area with the greatest agricultural potential on the planet from an economic perspective, the Cerrado is where most agricultural activities in Brazil take place, accounting for 60% of the country's grain production[ii]. In addition to its economic importance, the Cerrado carries social relevance as a place with traditional populations who subsist on the region's natural resources, in addition to indigenous peoples, geraizeiros, baba ueiras, riverside communities, vazanteiros and quilombola communities that, together, are part of Brazil's historical and cultural heritage and possess ancestral knowledge of the country's biodiversity.
In recognition of such rich biodiversity, ten years ago Brazil conceived the Brazil Investment Plan under the Forest Investment Program (FIP) aimed at the conservation and sustainable development of the Cerrado. I was part of the team that designed the program in 2011 and could hardly imagine then that FIP Brasil would become so relevant to the integration of government efforts aimed at environmental conservation and development in the Cerrado, which involve all 11 states located in the biome.
At the time, the government made the strategic decision to work with several ministries instead of just one, thus joining efforts to address the challenge of promoting conservation in the Cerrado. After a lengthy consultation process with the government and private institutions, researchers and traditional communities, the decision was made to use a portfolio of individual projects and the World Bank as the focal point for multilateral development banks involved in FIP in Brazil[LS1] , funded with support from the Climate Investment Fund (CIF).
In these ten years, the FIP Brazil has achieved significant and innovative results, improving production methods in the Cerrado, integrating institutions at different levels and fostering unity among traditional peoples and communities living in the region. Estimates show that these combined actions have already impacted the lives of 51.7 beneficiaries, 37,000 rural properties and 64 traditional communities so far.
Under the FIP ABC Cerrado project (ended in 2019), rural producers changed their properties in the field by recovering pastures and employing other low-carbon agricultural practices. These producers show their commitment to sustainable practices by investing 7 reais for each 1 Brazilian real put in by the project. Where once there was degraded pasture, today productive pastures and protected springs abound.
In late 2021, the activities under the FIP Monitoring project will come to a successful end. They will leave behind a legacy of reliable and publicly-accessible systems and data on deforestation, fire management, forest fire risk management, and estimating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from deforestation and fires in the Cerrado. The main outputs have already been delivered, organized and unified in the project's website.
DGM Brazil (Dedicated Grant Mechanism for Indigenous People and Local Communities), a project that the entire team cares about, will be delivering its results in early 2022. With 55 completed sub-projects under its belt, DGM Brasil not only strengthened the traditional communities and indigenous peoples of the Cerrado, but also presented an opportunity for indigenous peoples, quilombolas, geraizeiros and coconut breakers to sit together at the same table and begin a dialogue, joining forces to achieve common goals for the protection of the biome. Women have played a key role in this project, leading 13 of the 64 sub-projects, in addition to the National Steering Committee, currently headed by quilombola Lucely Pio.
FIP in Brazil activities will continue in the coming years with the Paisagens Rurais (Rural Landscapes) project, which promotes sustainable agricultural techniques, restoration and environmental conservation among rural producers in selected areas. FIP Rural Environmental Cadastre project also includes activities to formalize rural properties and adapt them to Brazil's environmental laws. FIP Coordination, in turn, continues to monitor and evaluate project activities and enable information exchanges and synergies across the entire portfolio.
A decade later, some of the things we planned from the outset continue to apply, such as efficient production practices and environmental conservation. But reality has imposed major challenges on us all, such as changes in legislation and public policies, changes to the market, exchange rate challenges and, finally, the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced us towards remote and virtual solutions.
As such, this Cerrado Day is an important milestone and a chance to look back at the path trailed by the projects so far and all the achievements made in this constant journey to conserve our Cerrado.

"GUARD MEMBERS IN 24 STATES, D.C. CALLED UP IN RESPONSE TO CIVIL UNREST",2020,05,"ARLINGTON, Va., May 29 -- The National Guard issued the following news release:
As of Sunday, National Guard Soldiers and Airmen were activated in 24 states and the District of Columbia in response to civil disturbances, bringing the total number of Guard members on duty in support of their governors to nearly 62,000.
This number represents activations for civil unrest, COVID-19 response, as well as state-specific disasters such as wildfires, flooding and other natural disasters.
The civil unrest response mission is expected to grow as governors assess the fluid situations in their states and call on the National Guard to assist.
""The hardest mission we do is responding in times of civil unrest,"" said Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau.
The activation of Guard members in response to civil unrest has unfolded in multiple cities in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Guard personnel assigned to these missions are trained, equipped and prepared to assist law enforcement authorities and first responders, said Lengyel.
""We plan, train and prepare for emergency response missions with our local, state, and federal partners,"" he said. ""We're part of the communities we serve. We know the police, fire departments and hospital workers. We know their capabilities because we live with their capabilities.""
Guard members are to perform a variety of mission sets including traffic control, support to law enforcement, transportation and communication support. They've also been called upon to assist with extinguishing fires burning as a result of the unrest.
""Aircrews were using forest fire equipment, including helicopter water buckets, to put out building fires at protests last night,"" said Lengyel.
The overall mission of Guard members is to assist local authorities and ensure safety.
""We're here to help and assist local authorities,"" said Lengyel. ""Our troops are here to protect life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety.""
Those Guard members called up are in a state active duty status and remain under the command and control of their respective governors, said Lengyel, adding those responding will continue to adhere to COVID-19 prevention measures.
""Governors have used Guard members many times during response efforts to support local and state law enforcement in a wide range of capacities, to include assisting in upholding the rule of law."" said Lengyel. ""While conditions may change, the National Guard's ability to respond is constant.""

This marks the first-ever instance of Israeli firefighters landing in the United States to assist in fighting fires.The fires, which started Aug. 
15, have been burning over 1.46 million acres and has destroyed about 2,800 structures as of Tuesday.The Israeli team, comprising officers and firefighters from the country's Fire and Rescue Services, rescue and forest fire[1] experts, and an Israeli Foreign Ministry representative, is expected to remain in the U.S. for nearly two weeks, according to a statementthe Israeli Foreign Ministry.[2] Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said the move represented 'close friendship between the nations' and 'excellent relations' that the countries share. 'I praise the members of the delegation and wish them success on their mission,' he was quoted as saying in the statement.Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg welcomed the crew Sunday with a message on Twitter. 'Today we welcomed a delegation of firefighters from Israel who arrived yesterday,' he wrote. 'Tomorrow they will report to the CA Office of Emergency Services and be dispatched to fires around the state. As a Jewish mayor, I'm particularly proud and happy to see them come to our aid.'At least 16,000 firefighters have been reportedly mobilized as of Monday across California to contain over 18 reported major fires raging across the state. According to Cal Fire, the wildfires, called the SCU Lightning Complex, are spotted in Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, and San Benito counties. The fires have burned 383,157 acres so far, with 60% containment. The SCU Lighting Complex[3] is the second-largest wildfire recorded in California history, and the LNU Lightning Complex, which has burned 375,209 acres across Napa, Sonoma, Solano, Lake, and Yolo counties, with 63% containment, was named as the third-largest wildfire in the state's history.Several U.S. states have extended their help to California and Gov. Gavin Newsom said he urged [4]countries like Australia and Canada also to rush assistance for California firefighters.

Linn County trying to stop proposed Douglas-fir National Monument -- again,2022,08,"Aug. 7—About 80 miles east of the Linn County Courthouse, an expanse of blue-green trees gives way to jagged Cascade peaks that burst clouds, channel rivers and form the crown of a could-be national monument.
Everything below, hundreds of thousands of acres of mostly Douglas fir, which, depending on whom you ask, is potential fire fuel, timber or heritage recreational space.
The proposed Douglas-fir National Monument is back up for discussion now that President Donald Trump is out of office, and it could soon reach President Joe Biden's desk for signature under the Antiquities Act of 1906.
Linn County's elected leadership isn't happy about that. Officials are seeking intervention from Oregon's U.S. senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, and Rep. Peter DeFazio.
On the other side, advocates hope the White House will hear their pleas — that formal protections for Douglas fir are long overdue.
Both sides say they're in the right. Neither is talking to the other.
'It's scary'
Their timber cold war started in 2015, when a coalition of environmental activists sought to blanket much of the Willamette National Forest in formal protections for old-growth trees.
The more than 530,000-acre swath of land, which includes parts of Linn, Marion and Jefferson counties, would be the largest national monument in Oregon. Douglas-fir would be the 14th largest of the nation's nearly 130 monuments.
Critics fear the monument would dictate how private timber growers can use their land or cut down their trees. But David Stone, president of Friends of Douglas-fir National Monument and one of the leading proponents, said monument rules would not apply to private landowners within the space, otherwise known as ""inholdings.""
Still, the county has its doubts.
""It's scary that people who don't live in the area are the ones who are out there proposing this monument,"" Linn County Commissioner Will Tucker said.
The Douglas-fir National Monument would sit mostly on the Willamette National Forest in the Cascade foothills. But those petitioning first Trump and now Biden seek to cover a patchwork set of wilderness areas, federally managed land and some 44,000 acres of private forests.
A Springfield-based nonprofit has pushed to establish Douglas-fir National Monument, taking aim at raising the prestige of its namesake tree.
The arguments go like this:
One side, the monument proponents, say Mature Douglas fir stabilizes soil, shades streams, scrubs and sequesters carbon from the air and has the potential to act as a balm on a warming climate.
The monument also would be a draw for hikers, campers and others who spend money in the mountainous eastern reaches of the Willamette Valley.
Meanwhile, federal protections ensure those trees mature, burn, fall as they did before the arrival of European settlers.
The other side says private landowners and timber operators already follow stringent logging practices which contain clearcuts to 120 acres, enforce stream buffers, and ensure roads and logging trucks aren't loading cool, clear-running water with soil.
They know what's best for their land, and the proposed monument would decommission roads potentially used by fire crews and all but ensure conflagrations in its mission to protect old-growth.
""I don't want to see the possibility of this going through without the county having a chance to weigh in because it puts new additional rules on a substantial portion of Linn County,"" Tucker said.
A different approach
But Stone maintains that one cannot, and should not, prevent fire in the backcountry, as it is part of the natural order of a forest.
His view is that private land and business owners in the proposed area make it their job to make their buildings ""fire safe,"" clearing nearby trees and anything that burns from around those structures. It's a prevention strategy.
""That's how you deal with fire,"" Stone said. ""You make your home, stores and buildings fire safe and they won't burn.""
Cyndi Anderson, a Brownsville tree advocate, said embracing changing views of land management is part of the succession of forests, too.
""There is plenty of private timber land. We don't have to mess with public land,"" Anderson said.
Anderson is a leader of a local chapter of Great Old Broads for Wilderness, an activist group that has prioritized preserving mature Douglas firs.
Stone belongs to that group, she said, and the local Broads overlap with legal and lobby concerns, such as Cascadia Wildlands and Oregon Wild, in trying to establish protections for mature evergreens.
When the monument was first pitched seven years ago under President Barack Obama, it didn't seem realistic, Anderson said.
Now, even if Biden chooses to pass on the proposal, she'll dwell on the upside: focusing attention on mature Douglas fir stands — a big change from the 1980s, when she said she began advocacy work in Oregon's forests.
""Even to entertain the idea is a big step forward,"" Anderson said.
The Broads saw recent success measuring trees, fish-spawning creek beds, and counting wildlife with Cascadia Wildland. Those surveys informed a Forest Service analysis that led the Sweet Home Ranger District to weigh pros and cons of logging and leave mature forests on the Santiam intact.
""That felt like just a big win. For the climate, for Willamette National Forest,"" Anderson said.
The groundswell of apparent consideration for mature Douglas fir shows that managing forests for climate, wildlife and water quality can co-exist with private timber interests.
""Just leave it intact,"" Anderson said. ""We need it.""
History
Talks of a Douglas fir national monument began in 2015 by a coalition of environmental groups. At the time, they were eyeing 481,324 acres. Seven years later, the total acreage has risen to more than 530,000 and includes land that abuts the Warm Springs Reservation.
The proposed monument would include all of the Middle Santiam and Menagerie Wilderness areas, Quartzville Creek Wild and Scenic River and a portion of the Mount Jefferson Wilderness.
Then in 2016 with Donald Trump's ascension, the proposal screeched to a halt. The Antiquities Act authorizes the president to proclaim national monuments on federal lands that contain historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific interest.
While more uncommon, a national monument also can be established by an Act of Congress.
With Biden in office, the proposal has gained momentum once again. On April 22 — Earth Day — the president launched the America the Beautiful Initiative, which supports his goal to conserve 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.
Within a week of this announcement, The Coalition to Protect America's National Parks named the Douglas-fir proposal and five others in a letter to Biden, urging him to declare them all national monuments.
The monument's supporters haven't heard back from the president, although Tucker claims a Washington, D.C. lobbyist — whom he prefers not to name — informed him that the proposal could soon be up for discussion.
In response, Tucker and his two colleagues on the Board of Commissioners, Sherrie Sprenger and Roger Nyquist, penned a letter to DeFazio, Merkley and Wyden, asking them to stop the proposed monument. Tucker said he plans to write another directly to the president.
This is not the first letter Tucker has written to stop the monument. He sent one by himself a few years ago. He never heard back.
Wyden declined to comment on this story, according to staff.
Merkley communications staff responded in an email, indicating no information would be available before press time. A ranking DeFazio staffer took a phone call requesting information but did not respond before press time.
""I know my writing is falling on deaf ears,"" he said. ""All I'm asking for is five seconds. This proposal takes forest management in the wrong direction.""
Lack of input
Although the proposed monument shares a border with the Warm Springs Reservation, neither the proponents nor the opponents have spoken directly with tribal leaders to ask their opinion.
Stone said he was able to reach the tribe one time, but representatives said they were too busy to get involved with the campaign and ultimately did not give their input one way or the other.
""I've reached out to them a number of times, and they say it's a nice proposal, not knowing much about it. So I'm not implying they endorse it,"" he said. ""We don't have evidence of active use (of the proposed land) currently.""
Tucker said that while he has not yet contacted the tribe, he is confident that its members will be ""equally as concerned.""
""I think they feel that the rules and regulations placed on their tribal lands have been changed without their involvement,"" Tucker said. ""When you take more lands and place more rules on them, the tribe's trust of the government is low for exactly this reason.""
Combating climate change
Both sides of the Douglas-fir debate disagree with the other's way of combating climate change.
Those who are against the monument believe logging is an essential part of maintaining a forest. The management of timber to sequester carbon, Tucker said, is one of the most important things that needs to be done, in addition to planting new trees.
The vast majority of timber sales in Linn County are from private lands, a yearly average 237,384 million board feet of timber compared to 34,703 million from public lands. Private sales generally increased between 2010 and 2019, logging 263,284 million board feet in the most recent year of data.
""As we are watching these fires burn, it just makes me want to cry because had that timber been cleaned up, the fuel wouldn't have been there as much as it did,"" Tucker said.
Stone, however, said a forest fire is either the beginning of a new forest or the continuation of a current forest. In his view, fire is a natural disturbance that is beneficial to fish and wildlife, and logging after a fire removes essential wood mass needed for the forest to recover.
Tucker also mentioned that Douglas firs do not need protection; in fact, they grow so abundantly he has some in his own yard.
""To call it a Douglas fir monument just shocks me,"" Tucker said.
Cascade-Siskiyou litigation
Linn County is currently involved in a lawsuit with the U.S. government regarding the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument, located in Southwest Oregon and Northern California.
President Bill Clinton in 2000 declared the range a national monument. In 2017, Obama expanded the monument by 48,000 acres.
Many industry groups, including Linn County, believe this expansion violated the Oregon and California Revested Lands Act of 1937, which requires forest maintenance for 2.4 million acres of forestland across 18 counties in Western Oregon.
The county lost, appealed, then won, and the decision was once again appealed. The Department of Justice in February 2020 put both sets of litigation on hold until the DC District Court issues its final order on cases related to the Bureau of Land Management's resource management plans.
Lack of communication
The Linn County Commissioners and Friends of Douglas-fir National Monument have never spoken directly about the proposal.
Stone, who lives in Springfield, said he's interested in working with the people of Linn County to better understand their needs, and he's not trying to shut out their voices.
""You can't just go into a rural county and just ignore what's important to them and expect to succeed,"" he said.
He referenced the economic impact study posted on his website, <url normalizedValue=""http://www.douglasfirnationalmonument.org"">www.douglasfirnationalmonument.org</url>, which finds Western rural communities with national monuments do better economically than adjacent counties without national monuments.
""It's obvious. If you drive through downtown Sweet Home,"" he said, ""there's all those boarded-up stores. You get to see the suffering that happens in a rural county in the West that doesn't have protected land.""
Stone said he is confident that the proposed monument will be established, as he's been in contact with Wyden, Merkley and DeFazio for several years about it.
""As we see, climate change is wrecking everything we hold dear,"" Stone said. ""Protection of the land is real important; it's real urgent right now.""

The Linn County Commissioners and Friends of Douglas-fir National Monument have never spoken directly about the proposal.
Stone, who lives in Springfield, said he's interested in working with the people of Linn County to better understand their needs, and he's not trying to shut out their voices.
""You can't just go into a rural county and just ignore what's important to them and expect to succeed,"" he said.
He referenced the economic impact study posted on his website, <url normalizedValue=""http://www.douglasfirnationalmonument.org"">www.douglasfirnationalmonument.org</url>, which finds Western rural communities with national monuments do better economically than adjacent counties without national monuments.
""It's obvious. If you drive through downtown Sweet Home,"" he said, ""there's all those boarded-up stores. You get to see the suffering that happens in a rural county in the West that doesn't have protected land.""
Stone said he is confident that the proposed monument will be established, as he's been in contact with Wyden, Merkley and DeFazio for several years about it.
""As we see, climate change is wrecking everything we hold dear,"" Stone said. ""Protection of the land is real important; it's real urgent right now.""

Jonathon Golden What do we owe wildland firefighters?,2021,06,"“It’s like having gasoline out there,” said Brian Steinhardt, forest fire zone manager for Prescott and Coconino national forests in Arizona, in a recent AP story about the increasingly fire-prone West.
Now something else is happening — and at the worst possible time.
Federal firefighters are leaving the workforce and taking their training and experience with them. The inability of federal agencies to offer competitive pay and benefits is creating hundreds of wildland firefighting vacancies.
Vacancies, of course, limit how much federal firefighters can do. If Western communities want to be protected, they need to ensure that their firefighters receive better pay and benefits.
In my 11 years of work as a wildland firefighter, I’ve managed aircraft, trained people and run fires myself, but I also did outreach and recruitment for the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. I know how hard it is for hiring managers to make 2,000 hours of grueling work, crammed into six exhausting months, sound appealing when the pay is $13.45/hour. The pay doesn’t come close to matching the true demands or everyday dangers of the job.
Federal wildland firefighters, by necessity, are transient workers. During the fire season — now nearly year-round — they must be available to travel anywhere in the United States at any time. And to advance in their career, they have to move to other federal duty stations to gain more qualifications.
Finding affordable housing has always been a problem for career firefighters on a federal salary. To make matters worse, federal agencies revoked the “Transfer of Station” stipend for career employees, which helped offset the cost of moving. Just recently, a national forest supervisor also revoked a “boot stipend.” It might sound minor, but it isn’t When you’re in the firefighting business, boots tough enough to save your life can easily cost you $500.
Some states aren’t relying on the government to act quickly. “We aren’t just waiting for the next crisis to hit,” said California Gov. Gavin Newsom, in establishing an $80.74 million Emergency Fund that delivers an additional 1,256 seasonal firefighters to boost CALFIRE’s ranks. This Emergency Fund is in addition to the governor’s $1 billion budget request for California’s Wildfire and Forest Resilience Action Plan.
In Washington, state legislators unanimously passed a $125 million package that will enable the state’s Natural Resources Department to hire 100 more firefighters. The legislation furthers the state’s efforts to restore forest health and creates a $25 million fund to ensure community preparedness around the state.
Utah’s House Bill 65, recently signed into law, appropriates money to help Utah’s communities offset the cost of wildfire suppression. Most importantly, it commissions a study to evaluate the current pay plan for firefighters within Utah’s Natural Resources Department.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Casey Snider, was amazed to learn that frontline wildland firefighters make more money at McDonald’s “These positions are critical,” he said. “They are the first ones on fires.” This year, Utah has already had five times the number of wildfires it normally experiences in a year.
And firefighters are organizing and speaking up. The Grassroots Wildland Firefighters is working to halt the exodus of firefighters from federal agencies by advocating for pay parity with state and local fire protection agencies. The group also supports initiatives to assist the physical and mental health of firefighters and their families. The statistics they highlight are shocking Wildland firefighters have a suicide rate 30 times higher than the average. They also experience high incidences of cardiovascular disease and lung cancer.
There is talk on the federal level of creating a permanent, year-round firefighting workforce. I think this is a necessary step, but it won’t fix the workforce capacity issue unless increased pay and benefits are used to encourage the recruitment and retention of federal firefighters.
We all know that today’s wildfires are longer, more damaging and more frequent than ever before. We also know that men and women are putting their lives on the line for less than they’d earn at a McDonald’s.
Our firefighters do all this to protect our lives, our forests and our communities. We owe them at least a living wage and a chance for a healthy life. I hope more states and legislators will start paying attention. This is a debt that needs to be paid.

Senate Energy &amp; Natural Resources Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Coconino County Board Supervisor Babbott,2020,11,"The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests and Mining issued the following testimony by Art Babbott, Coconino County board supervisor for District 1, as part of a hybrid hearing on the Forest Health and Biomass Act (S. 4603) on Nov. 18:
Thank you for holding today's hearing to discuss S. 4603, Forest Health and Biomass Energy Act, and for inviting me to testify on behalf of the critical need for biomass energy to support forest health across the Western United States. On behalf of Coconino County, I want to express my thanks to Senator McSally for working with the County to introduce S. 4603 and the subcommittee for highlighting this critical issue.
My name is Art Babbott, County Supervisor from Coconino County. During my time on the Board of Supervisors, forest restoration has been one of the top policy priorities for the County as catastrophic wildfire and flood represent the number one public health and safety risk for the County. As part of that priority, I have been honored to serve as Chair of the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), which I will discuss later.
Coconino County, the second largest county in the contiguous United States, consisting of 18,661 square miles of land, 27 percent, or over three million acres, of which are owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service. We are home to the largest Ponderosa Pine forest in the world, making healthy forests one of our top interests and priorities as we work to protect lives and communities from the impacts of catastrophic wildfires and post-wildfire flooding.
In the past ten years, Coconino County has experienced four major wildfires on federal land that has negatively impacted us through the tragic loss of life, homes and businesses, decreased property values as well as social and economic burdens on our communities. Just one year ago in my district, the Museum Fire, which burned less than 2,000 acres, cost the U.S. Forest Service over $11 million to suppress and rehabilitate and cost Coconino County nearly $2 million in response to the post-wildfire flooding threat to the City of Flagstaff.
While forest restoration has been on the hearts and minds of our citizens for years, we are currently in the eighth year of a ten-year landscape scale restoration project called the Four Forest Restoration Initiative or 4FRI, an effort to restore 300,000 acres of forest over 10 years. In those eight years, the contractor has only been successful at treating 14,000 acres. While there are many factors that have played into the small amount of acres being treated, the lack of a market for the biomass (non-merchantable trees, limbs and tops) that is created from forest restoration treatments continues to be the bottleneck.. This is quite evident by the fact that a mere 125 miles away, where a bioenergy plant is located in Snowflake, Arizona, industry has been able to treat over SIX TIMES as many acres in the same timeframe precisely because there is a market for biomass. Support for biomass energy facilities as well as the ""High Hazard Area Wood Biomass Fund"" in S. 4603 to fund the processing, removal and hauling of biomass to end markets that can be hundreds of miles away from the source, is critical for increasing the pace and scale of forest restoration on federal lands.
In the early 1990's, much of Arizona's forest industry ""left town"" due to increasing litigation on federal timber sales. Add to that the Forest Service policy to put every forest fire out, we have created conditions where the forest is overstocked with trees and is a virtual tinderbox waiting to combust. Northern Arizona University's Ecological Restoration Institute cites that pre-1900, tree densities in Arizona's forests averaged around 24 trees per acre due to the frequent lightning caused fires naturally thinning the forest. However, that average today has skyrocketed to well over 1,200 trees per acre. The goal of forest restoration is to reduce the tree density to a healthy average of 80 trees per acre, allowing for the re-introduction of wildfire back into our fire adapted ecosystem. Attempting to do that work primarily through prescribed fire is too risky and not feasible based on the current density of trees. However, mechanical thinning treatments brings a multitude of benefits, although success depends on markets being made available for the forest products and biomass. One of the greatest benefits of mechanized thinning operations, aside from creating a healthy, fire-resistant forest, is the creation of well-paying jobs in some of the most rural areas of the country where they are desperately needed.
Biomass energy plays a significant role in the success rate of forest restoration in Arizona and yet has struggled to get support from state and federal lawmakers. Biomass energy is the only viable option, at this time, in our efforts to thin 30,000 to 50,000 acres per year for the next twenty years as we work diligently to improve forest health and reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires across the West. We often look only at the cost of bioenergy when determining its viability and knowing that it has a higher cost than green energy systems like solar and wind. Therefore, it often gets overlooked. However, we must not forget that the ecosystem benefits resulting from forest restoration treatments that supply the biomass for energy, is creating healthy forests and watersheds, improved wildlife habitat, protecting communities and lives from catastrophic wildfires and the negative air quality impacts, as well as recreational and economic opportunities within our national forest lands. S. 4603 is critical for support of biomass removal from federal lands and biomass energy to reduce the amount of carbon emissions from wildfire, open-burning fire and prescribed fire. In addition, the financial impact from forest restoration, made possible by having biomass energy as an end market for forest by-products, is the reduction of catastrophic wildfires that have cost the federal government nearly $3.4 billion in suppression costs alone in 2020, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Furthermore, it is estimated that the total economic impact from wildfires in 2020 will reach between $130 to $150 billion in losses.
The facts on the ground in our region prove out the need for biomass as a tool to dispose of the forest products in our area. Senator McSally's legislation, S. 4603, is a critical step towards creating this policy goal and funding that will plant the seeds for biomass utilization in forest restoration efforts in Arizona and elsewhere across the West.
In Arizona, where we have only one 30 MW bioenergy plant, there is a need for an additional 90 MW of biomass energy to consume the biomass residue that will be produced from the Four Forest Restoration Initiative. Over the last several years, the bioenergy facility captured over 98 percent of the particulate matter (PM) 2.5 created by burning biomass for energy. The EPA has published that ""Wildland fires now account for 40 percent of the total PM emitted in the country, making it a major source of the pollutant, which causes lung and health problems."" Consider that against all particulate matter emitted from vehicles, power generation, industrial facilities, etc. forest fire represents 40 percent of the PM emitted.
In conclusion, it is critical that the federal government upholds its responsibility to the American people in supporting the most viable and economic way to dispose of the millions of tons of small diameter trees, limbs and tops (biomass) that result from forest restoration projects across the West and more specifically in Arizona, where there are no other industry markets available, allowing for more acres to be treated each year. Without your support, we will continue to see catastrophic wildfires ravage the landscape and watersheds, turning once beautiful forests into a desolate wasteland of ash and dust. I applaud the subcommittee for holding this important hearing today and urge you to pass S. 4603 to protect our fragile forest ecosystem in the West.

LANDSLIDE BLOCKS THOMPSON RIVER NEAR ASHCROFT: A landslide with about half a mile frontage came down without warning on the west side of the Thompson river at Basque, about six miles south of Ashcroft on Saturday morning last, and has changed completely the aspect of the country in that section, it is reported. The river was entirely blocked, and several miles up stream a rise of about twelve feet took place. No damage was done to either the C.P.R. or the C.N.R., fortunately, as the two lines follow parallel along the east side of the river at the point where the slide occurred. The Hammond ranch at Basque is the scene of the landslide, and, during the afternoon the ground was still falling down at intervals. At this writing no damage to the right-of-way, or to traffic is reported from either railway.

796 FOREST FIRES SO FAR THIS YEAR: A total of 796 forest fire outbreaks have cost B.C. $84,518 so far this year, forest branch officials revealed at Victoria. The figures compare with those up to August 1 last year, which show 878 outbreaks costing $68,479 to overcome. Officials pointed out that heavy rains this season have helped to keep forest hazards at a minimum although the province has just passed through one dangerous period. They added that August is often a dangerous month for forest fires, and urged the public to remember the danger is not over. [As of Aug. 1, 2021 there had been 1,275 wildfires reported in the province this year.]
CACHE CREEK TO GET ELECTRIC LIGHT: Poles are being placed along the road from the Ashcroft Water, Electric power plant on the Bonaparte in preparation for the installation of a power and light line to Cache Creek. Cedar poles are being imported for the work at a cost, we understand, of approximately $10 each. They will run along the Boston Flat, and Cache Creek will be put on an up-to-date basis, so far as electric light is concerned. The installation will include not only the T.U. Auto Camp and homes there, but will take in the surrounding farms.
""ASHCROFT"" POTATOES: Mr. Mike Leigh, local agent for the B.C. Interior Vegetable Marketing Board, is a booster for Ashcroft. Recently the Board shipped him a supply of sacks branded ""Drybelt Potatoes"" for shipping local spuds. He immediately objected and informed the Board that he wanted the name ""Ashcroft"" included on the brand to denote that they were grown in Ashcroft. That is the right patriotic spirit, and he was advised he would have his own way. In olden times we were told it was bad breeding to blow ones' own horn. Today the one who shouts the loudest does the most business.

George Hicks happily shared his love of nature,2021,01,"But, even though as a young man he tried a seaman's job, his true love was working in towering forests.
In her eulogy, his daughter, Janice Lippert, said that water and wood would be key elements throughout his life. She also spoke about the pull he would feel every year to return to the place of his birth.
Born April 5, 1931, on Easter Sunday, in the pulp and paper town of Grand Falls, Nfld., to Olive and Henry Hicks, George was a middle child among six kids, heavily weighted with girls. Four sisters to be exact.
George's first job was with CN Marine, serving in the coastal service. The seafaring life, however, was not for him and George decided on a landlubber life, enrolling in the Maritime Forest Ranger School in Fredericton, N.B., in 1950. Not only was he embarking on a new career, but George also met Amy Perry, a New Brunswick girl, former teacher and a newly minted nurse. Amy had grown up with four brothers so she knew about being outnumbered.
The couple married in December 1951 in Thunder Bay, after George accepted a job with Marathon Pulp and Paper.
Over the next few years, the couple would move between the Maritimes and Ontario as George's jobs required. They finally settled in Sussex, N.B., where George worked as a forest ranger/technician for three decades for the Department of Natural Resources.
It was in that job George had a tremendous impact on the health of the forests. Spruce budworm was decimating the fir and spruce forests of New Brunswick. Along with a team of five colleagues, they mapped out the damage caused by the invasive pest over 10 seasons. It was important work.
The New Brunswick Archives indicates there was a particularly devastating outbreak in the Atlantic provinces from the mid-1970s until the 1980s and George was in the middle of fighting to preserve what was left. In 1976, the province reacted by spraying about 20 million acres and replanting. George played a part in helping save and restore the forests.
George also focused on wildlife in his desire to protect wild Canada. He would do aerial forest fire patrols and, during deer season, he'd be searching for illegal nighttime deer hunting spotted from the sky. George loved to fly and this became the best part of his job.
George extended his love of nature to schoolchildren, helping develop natural resources protection programs for elementary schools. The passion for protecting and appreciating wild spaces would be shared with their only daughter, Janice, and grandchildren, Amy and Seth.
In her eulogy, granddaughter Amy spoke of the years the family would spend at her grandparents' New Brunswick cabin and, later, at their cottage on Lake Conestogo. Her poetic words about the nature that surrounded them were a testament to George's lasting influence.
In 1994, after George retired from the government and Amy from nursing, the couple moved to Kitchener to be closer to their daughter. Janice had moved to Waterloo Region as a student and decided to stay and raise her family.
When Amy developed Alzheimer's, the couple sold the Kitchener home and moved to live with Janice and her family in New Hamburg. Amy later moved into long-term care and George moved to a retirement home in Elmira. Amy died in 2017.
Janice spoke about her father's skills in the workshop, particularly after he retired. He made doll houses, a garage for tiny toy cars and a little kitchen. As she said, no store-bought toy could compare to her father's craftsmanship. He also had an uncanny ability to fix just about anything with a piece of rope. George had ingenuity.
Janice remembers her dad as kind, generous and her constant source of support.
""As my dad, he was strong and yet gentle,"" she said. ""He always took time to chat, listen or help out in whatever way possible."" She also spoke of how important his faith was and how he lived by the principals he learned within that faith, particularly the part about loving your neighbours.
George had a stroke followed by a bout of pneumonia last fall. He died Dec. 22.

That is the right patriotic spirit, and he was advised he would have his own way. In olden times we were told it was bad breeding to blow ones' own horn. Today the one who shouts the loudest does the most business.

A recent decision to close the Little Fort school and bus the children to Barriere caused problems for families with small children who live on McNab Road as the school authorities didn't plan extend bus services to those children. School board policy won't allow extensions of bus service so there were situations where children who live within walking distance of their school are bussed and those living further out are not.

Failure to use a seatbelt almost cost a Barriere trucker his life when he was thrown from his Kentworth tractor onto Highway 5 following a collision with a chip truck and then was narrowly missed being run over by both big rigs.
Barriere RCMP want parents to pay attention to where their children are and what they're up to as local youth gathering behind the Thompson Valley Credit Union are attracting the wrong kind of attention. Police report complaints are coming in that those hanging out in that area have broken lights, thrown cigarettes into the mail slot and thrown garbage around the area.
The future of anew multi-level care facility hangs in limbo while the provincial government reviews capital projects. An urge, however is creeping into the lives of those who have worked for so many years to bring extensive care facilities to Clearwater.

Two weeks of excessive rain lowered the fire hazard in the area after a low snowfall, dry spring and two weeks of hot weather increased the hazard in early July. Now, the fire season is likely over, though there's still some potential in the Clearwater to Vavenby area, according to Clearwater Fire Centre staff.
An 18-year-old 100 Mile House resident became stuck on a ledge about 40 metres from the top of Spahats Falls viewpoint, unable to move up or down. Jason Schapansky was later rescued by volunteers from Clearwater Search and Rescue. He summed up the climbing attempt as being ""harder than it looked.""

He was responding to a television interview buy Vancouver mayor Philip Owen who said the city's problem coyotes should be trapped and relocated to wilderness areas of the province. Quinn gave to reasons for his comments: there are already enough coyotes in the TNRD to form a natural balance; and urban coyotes will quickly move back to urban areas when moved.

Vinay Menon: Why have gender reveal parties traded cupcakes for explosives?,2021,04,"I miss the old days when new parents would send out a casual email.
""Hey, just to let you know, we are having a boy."" Or, <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">""</emphasis>Hey, just to let you know, we are having a girl."" Back then, there was zero chance of getting an email that read: ""Hey, just to let you know, the TNT was a big mistake, as was the Big Bertha howitzer from eBay. Anyway, the cops are here. Fire marshals are investigating. Do you know a good lawyer?""
I am so glad this bonkers trend of ""gender reveal parties"" arrived after my twin daughters were born. God knows if I would've felt peer pressure to set off a dirty bomb next to the hostas: ""Hey, thanks for coming and, just to let you know, it's time to strap on your gas masks and radiation suits because we are having - <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">kaboom!</emphasis> - TWO GIRLS!""
How did the stork get replaced by a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor?
Among last year's AFP Pictures of The Year, there was a haunting image of a firefighter in California, a hose draped over his shoulders as he's battling apocalyptic flames. The partial caption: ""A firework at a gender reveal party triggered a wildfire in Southern California that has destroyed 7,000 acres (2,800 hectares) and forced many residents to flee their homes ...""
Imagine a conga line at a wedding that accidentally triggers a tsunami.
Or an earthquake, which is what many thought was happening this week in New Hampshire after a couple detonated 80 pounds of Tannerite to celebrate news they were having a boy. The explosion, according to an NBC affiliate, put cracks in home foundations, disrupted the clean water supply and could be heard from across the state line.
Entire towns shook. As one local resident told the station: ""We heard this godawful blast. It knocked pictures off our walls ... I'm all up for silliness and whatnot, but that was extreme.""
<emphasis typeStyle=""it"">Yeah</emphasis>. The gender reveal party is now all about the extreme.
Last month in Cancun, two people died when an airplane trailing pink contrails for the baby girl news suddenly nosedived into the sea. Previous gender party fatalities now include ""death by shrapnel"" and ""death by improvised device."" In a recent story about the body count of these manic birth celebrations, Newsweek cited a February incident from Michigan in which, ""a couple fired a cannon at a baby shower, but accidentally killed one of their friends.""
Good lord. Baby showers should be about feigned enthusiasm and questionable finger foods. That's it. As the mom-to-be rambles on sweetly and incoherently, unaware she's not going to get a good night's sleep for the next two years, all you should be doing is grinning and stealing glances at your watch. What you should absolutely not be doing is fretting about possibly meeting your maker after a merry mishap with 12th century artillery.
I don't want to sound like an old man shaking his fist at the clouds, even though that's exactly what I am, but all of our cultural rituals are now totally out of whack. For example, when I was a kid, birthday parties involved chips, pop, hot dogs, games and a slab cake more toxic than a dirty bomb. It was awesome. Parents back then didn't feel any need to recreate ""The Falcon and The Winter Soldier"" or go viral on Instagram. But as social media has become the second-hand smoke of an entire generation, parents are now choking on the fumes of their own folly.
Gender reveal parties started out innocently enough. New parents wheeled out blue or pink baked goods and everyone cheered. Or parents bought big helium balloons that, once popped, gave way to Trojan Horse streamers in the symbolic colours of male or female. What new parents did not do was succumb to extreme one-upmanship as guests ran for cover and the mushroom cloud spelled out boy or girl.
And the craziest part? Nobody cares about the gender of your baby. I mean, grandparents care. If you already have kids, they might also care, as is suggested by the YouTube library of Gender Reveal Party Fails in which distraught tykes have meltdowns over news of their impending siblings: ""I don't want a baby brother! I don't want a baby sister!""
But everyone else in your social group? They don't care!
A gender reveal is not grounds to host a hare-brained party that possibly leads to an explosion, forest fire, earthquake, tsunami and fatalities. It's not. The sex of your baby is about as exciting as your views on Shakespeare. Nobody cares. If you want me to attend a party in which there's a risk I may be vapourized by a festive direct-energy weapon, your new bundle of joy better be capable of terraforming or interdimensional shape-shifting. I'll take that risk.
Boy or girl doesn't cut it.
When this pandemic is over, we should rethink all of our cultural rituals. All of them.
And banning gender reveal parties would be a good start.

MEET THE CANDIDATES - TOWN OF CRESTON - SCHOOL DISTRICT 8,2022,10,"Kathy Etheridge I have been a part of the Creston Valley for over 40 years, and I love everything about living here. I have recently started a new venture as a small business owner taking over Simply Raw, a kitchen located inside Fly in the Fibre. My partner and I now reside in Canyon on a small acreage with our nine-year-old daughter, a cat, a dog, and some chickens.
Over the last couple years, I have been a volunteer with the Canyon-Lister Elementary School (CLES) breakfast program and I also joined the Parent Advisory Council.
My interest to be a trustee is for the students and parents of the community. I would like to be an assertive voice for Creston.
Prior to taking over a small business, I was employed with Labatt, where I was in a leadership role and collaborated with many different departments within the company. I believe my integrity, honesty, ability to be a team player, and my drive to obtain results makes me a good candidate.
At an early age my daughter was diagnosed with Distal 18q, with the diagnoses came along low muscle tone and a small ear canal. When she joined kindergarten, I was worried for her safety. CLES has been so amazing and after day one I never worried about that again. If elected, my focus will be the safety and equity of all students and staff in Creston.
Being a stakeholder, I will work hard and focus on what is important to students and staff in Creston. I will be a lifeline for inclusion, integrity, and equity for all learners. Student safety and success should be priority! Clements Verhoeven Thirty years of classroom experience only served to reinforce my motivation for entering the teaching profession in the first place-after parenting, teaching is the most important human activity. I taught english and history according to the timetable, but my focus was always critical thinking. “What does this poem tell us about being human?” was a favourite question. The discussion that didn’t end because the bell rang meant the class had been a success.
Why do I wish to be Creston’s school trustee? Because I want to be there to ensure that our school board values and facilitates the excitement of classrooms engaged in real learning, where students develop the thinking skills and self-awareness to confidently deal with our increasingly challenging world. And, to that end, I think there is much to be done in allocating resources, ensuring that Creston schools are safe, healthy, well-funded vibrant places of learning.
Committed administrators and teaching staff are critical in this quest of creating the best learning conditions, and their concerns need to be addressed in all school board decisions. Without representation and a sense that their concerns are valid and will be heard and acted upon by their school board, teacher morale suffers and a vibrant learning situation is that much harder to sustain.
My experience in the various roles I filled as a representative of my colleagues included voluntary work as chairperson for professional development and working learning conditions. As a leader in my department, I served at various times as department head of English, as an assistant for curriculum development and implementation, and as a member of the school’s hiring committee. These roles have given me insights and skills that I will utilise as Creston’s school trustee.
Why should people vote for me? Ask my former students about Mr. V.
Cody Beebe There’s two options for writing an interview. You could choose to waste space bashing other opponents, trying to besmirch the name of others. Point fingers, blame, spread half truths, and insult others. Alternatively, you can choose to focus on yourself. I choose to tell the public about my plans, my ideals, and the type of person I am. I won’t point fingers like the others have chosen to, since after all, it’s a petty tactic to dismiss legitimate ideals of others.
I was born and raised in Creston. I have coached hockey here, taught Conservation and Outdoor Recreation Education here, and am currently helping to establish a drone program for the Creston Air Search and Rescue. I went through the schools that your kids have gone to, are going to, or will go to.
Though now the times are changing, many trustee candidates will want the older ways of teaching and schooling. But as parents, as neighbours, and as a community we all know that we need new innovations, new strategies. I myself have one child in post secondary, and two children in the public school system. I get an inside perspective on the issues at large, on what struggles our kids are really facing. Communication is very important to me. Without proper communication, the board can’t function properly, which is why I will hold communication as a top priority. Along with providing a safe, equitable, and inclusive education for all. I believe strongly in putting funding into the children’s hands, to further better their chances at receiving the best education they can. In a calm manner, with pro-fessionalism in mind, I have, and will continue to fight for these kids. One major issue that’s being talked about is the de-amalgamation of Creston from School District 8. I am for this process, if Creston wants it, I will fight for it at every level. De-amalgamation will be a hard fight and will come with many issues on its own, but we mustn’t look through one lens.
I intend to solve any issues in a way where Creston won’t lose, where our community won’t lose, where the kids don’t lose out. I promise to keep the voice of Creston alive during my term, and intend for it to channel the community’s voices to solve issues at a board level. By fixing communication, and fighting for our students in an effective manner that leaves everyone happy, I assure you, your kids will receive the best education Creston can offer them.
Mary Jayne Blackmore I am a teacher of 13 years in the Creston Valley I am passionate about education. My first love is to be in the classroom with students, yet the design of our school system plays such a critical role in how effective an individual teacher can be in supporting the learning journey of a child. I’ve worked to support students from the Bountiful Community as they’ve transitioned into the school district and college. I’ve advocated to the trustees of School District 8 for the unique needs and challenges of many youth in this valley. I’ve been frustrated to see that often programs designed for youth have not tried to address the distinct barriers our rural populations face:distance, relocating, cost of travel, and unsafe highways. During the sale of the Home Links building, I was infuriated as the school board gave no con-sideration to protecting a vital resource that is a hub and unique service supporting a vulnerable population in our community. I’ve witnessed the continued erosion of educational assets in the Creston Valley and often hear the frustration many community members feel about this. My keen interest in community development is influenced by my training with Tamarack Institute. A school as the heartbeat of a community is a philosophy I follow. Healthy communities start with healthy schools. I’ve worked as a vice principal of Mormon Hills Schools. I am familiar with the Ministry of Education accreditation process and school funding models. I’ve worked in the non-profit sector as president of Trails for Creston Valley Society. I completed university studies in Utah and have studied many different educational models. I sat on a consultation committee for developing BC’s new curriculum. I feel inspired by the direction the new curriculum is headed and the Ministry of Education’s work to apply Indigenous ways of knowing into our everyday classrooms.
If elected, I promise to work towards building community through a culture of respect and support, listening and taking action for what families need, placing value on re-skilling our youth with practical life skills, creating a culture of reciprocity with the natural world to combat helplessness in our current climate crisis, serving an active and responsible role in truth and reconciliation, being an advocate and stronger voice for securing educational resources for youth, and lobby provincial government to return Creston Valley to its own school district.
Allan Gribbin As a school trustee running for re-election, I am in this race because there is unfinished business for Creston schools and our community. Since the amalgamation of the Creston School District with the larger Nelson District 25 years ago, Creston has faired poorly. There are six trustees on the north side of the district with close connections to Nelson and three trustees in the Creston region. One of the first decisions the new district made was to saddle Creston taxpayers with paying off a share of the $1 million debt that Nelson schools brought to the new amalgamated district. Creston had always operated with a balanced budget and Creston schools were never given any credit for the strict financial discipline we followed.
I am dedicated to community and strongly believe that a strong relationship between our schools and our community must be re-established and maintained. Last year.a $750,000 computer purchase was approved by the current school board. The contract went to a Kelowna business while a local business who wanted to participate in the bidding process was excluded. I was the only trustee who fought to try to give local business an opportunity to participate but my lone vote was shut down by our current board. Our board chair even refused to allow my motion that would require us to give local business an opportunity to bid on district contracts, a policy that other districts have.
I believe that we need to re-establish the relationship between the school district and our community. The importance of this relationship can be seen on graduation night with tens of thousands of dollars in donations for scholarships coming from local businesses. It is sad that the benefits of this relationship hasn’t flowed back to these generous donors. I will continue to work to require the board to give local business an opportunity to bid on district contracts.
As a retired teacher of 28 years, I understand education and hold the board to account when they present education policy. I was the first teacher in the district to pilot the First Nations 11 course in the 90s, and I have maintained a strong relationship with the Yaqan Nukiy community ever sense. My two children graduated here in Creston and my son is about to graduate from the University of Regina education program. Education has been my life and advancing the benefits of education to every child is my vision and goal.
By electing Clements Verhoeven in Creston, and Mary Jayne Blackmore and myself in the South Rural Zone, you will have three trustees working to return Creston’s school district where it belongs.
My wife Jo and I live in Canyon. We spent many years traveling the Kootenays, paddling and camping at the Kootenay, Columbia, and Slocan lakes. We always wanted to live in the Creston Valley. Our dream was to move here and have a big garden and a place for Jo’s horses. Thankfully our dream has been realized and we absolutely love this valley.
Since our arrival, I have been an active member of the Canyon Community Association initially as a member and now as chairperson of the board focusing on developing and improving Canyon Park. With my experience in water systems and governmental affairs, I have served as a board member of the North Canyon Water Improvement District for the past three years. The board has achieved so much in that time developing the Roger Tierney water system to better sustain our users through drought conditions and to better support our neighbours. I have been actively involved as a certified spotter with the Civil Air Search and Rescue in the Creston Valley since 2019.
My previous work experience is highly suited for the role of RDCK director. I worked in government for 35 years, for BC Parks in roles such as operations manager for the East Kootenay Parks and later as the recreation head for the Kootenay Region. As such, I was responsible for the facility maintenance for the $75 million plant, spending approximately $1 million a year for facility rebuilds including potable and wastewater systems and new construction projects. I was also the project director for the Kokanee Glacier Cabin. In my position, I was responsible for Search and Rescue for BC Parks for the Kootenays. I was trained in Alpine Rescue and Recovery in my position as Superintendent of Mount Robson Provincial Park. I was a park ranger, deputy conservation officer, and auxiliary RCMP constable in addition to my work for BC Parks. This was all to serve and support the communities in which I lived.
I have in-depth knowledge of governmental affairs and processes, legalities, and funding. If elected, my points of focus will be the supply and affordability of accessible water, re-establishing planning commissions within Area B for residents to have a stronger voice and to be able to liaise with local government, being available and fully accessible, questioning initiatives that may impact taxation and additional costs to Area B residents, and requesting a review of directors’ wages.
I wish to continue serving and making our communities better. I have a lot to offer and a tremendous amount of experience and energy. I see many opportunities to make a positive impact for Area B residents and to engage with local government so they are heard and involved in matters that impact them most.
Calling the Creston Valley home for over 40 years, I have lived for the last 15 years in Erickson.
In 2021, along with my partner Garry, we invested in a mobile food trailer business – Savour &amp; Company Kitchen. This has allowed me to follow my passion for food, showcasing what the Creston Valley produces, serving people as well as the flexibility to make my role as a regional director my priority.
Our valley is full of agricultural diversity, strong and resilient businesses, and recreational and tourism opportunities. These are just some of the reasons why I want to continue to serve this community. Serving as Director for Area B for the last eight years and two terms on Creston council prior, I understand the roles and responsibilities of this position. I have spent the last 14 years building relationships with other levels of government that have opened the doors to successful Tanya Wall grant applications. With experience in revitalizing and building a business such as Casey’s Community House with my late husband Ralph, operating a safety consulting business, and 18 years at Columbia Brewery as the safety and environmental compliance manager, I have gained a vast skill set that is adaptable and can deal with many issues at once. Personally, I understand how quickly one’s life can change and how to rebuild it. We can make all the plans in the world but there are times when circumstances are uncontrollable and those plans need to be adaptable, as we have seen through this global pandemic and in our ever-changing world.
Listening to the community, I know we have challenges coming out of the pandemic. We need to work together supporting our community associations and volunteers to ensure that we are fiscally responsible. My focus if re-elected will be to deal with arising issues, listen to residents’ concerns, and adjust plans accordingly. Agricultural Sustainability – maintaining a healthy growth, supporting our food security needs, finding a balance on our greatest resource, water, and to continue with the provincial government to investigate a more affordable and sustainable supply for irrigation. Water-we face many challenges in our area water systems and we will need to be innovative to ensure we are investing for the future. Climate Awareness – this will require us to deal with extreme heat events, forest fire risk, flooding, and our changing weather patterns. Recreation – continue to invest in our parks and trails network, maintain and enhance our recreation facility and community halls and parks and offer programming that fits the needs of all ages. Economic Diversity –to continue to support the businesses in Area B while creating new opportunities in agriculture tourism and showcasing the beauty and diversity of what the Creston Valley offers.
I will continue to work for you with confidence and leadership. I have the knowledge, determination and enthusiasm to continue working towards strengthening our community.
Adam Casemore I was born and raised in Creston. I am a bricklayer by trade, I own and operate my own Masonry Business. My wife and I live in Area C and enjoy everything the valley has to offer.
I want to continue to serve as Director for Area C because I’m passionate about the community. I have built meaningful relationships with individuals and groups over the years who share the same passion and want to see enhancement and growth. I feel that I have a good foundation in place to continue that work.
I have previously served on town council and was able to obtain a good understanding of how municipal governments operate. I continued by being elected as a regional director the following term. I understand the partnership that is needed to work together collectively. I have established good working relationships with key stakeholders and RDCK staff to build a vast network that helps move things forward efficiently, as well as address any issues. I also was elected to the Association of Kootenay Boundary Local Government Executive where I eventually served as vice president. I have been elected and continue to serve as Chair of the Rural Affairs Committee for the RDCK for the last three years.
If re-elected, I would continue to move projects forward such as the construction of the West Creston Fire Hall, a supply of potable water for Alice siding, improved water access for recreation along the Goat River and Kootenay River, funding to address the dykes along the Kootenay River, improved services for the landfill and compost facility, and potential curbside pick-up for rural residents. These are just a few projects I would like keep working on and potentially complete in the next term.
Residents should consider voting for me because I’m knowledgeable about the issues that mean the most. I have plans and funding in place to continue moving forward to execute and deliver on the initiatives. I have worked hard the last four years to deliver on the needs of the community and would like to use that experience and knowledge for the next term. I plan to continue Kelly Vandenberghe I am very pleased to be a member of this community. I come from an energy and auction business background and have always served in my communities from a firefighter and volunteer to taking on leadership roles. My wife and I have five kids and four grandchildren. She is a teacher in Creston. We both have a strong connection to agriculture.
My interest in public service comes from a strong desire to do my part in enriching the lives of my neighbours and my community. I have always served whether as a coach, fund-raising auctioneer, or leader. Municipal representatives are directly connected to the grass roots of their community.
I have experience as municipal elected official and am proud with how I served and what I accomplished. I believe strongly I am an effective communicator, always prepared, highly organized and with great attention to detail. Relationship building works very well for me. My business background allows me to understand the fiscal challenges and responsibilities in decision making. Integrity and honesty have always been my cornerstones.
I have talked with many people from this and surrounding areas listening to people’s stories and points of view on what they feel is working and what is not. My job is to investigate and ask the hard questions (at the RDCK table) to ensure service level standards are appropriate and Area C is receiving their fair share of fiscal resources. Improving on service delivery and efficiency is a strength developed from my business and communications background.
Residents should count on someone committed to the task of professional representation, a pledge to report and gather feedback and a proven track record in returning calls within a day. Residents in Area C should feel comfortable and connected by voting for Kelly Vandenberghe to represent them in RDCK Area C. Visit KellyV.cafor more information.",Canada
15 YEARS AGO: Pee Wee softball team takes home gold In summer games,2021,08,"40 YEARS AGO A forest fire covering about 300 acres north of Blue River was reported over the weekend. Operations Superintendent for the Clearwater District, Max Tanner, said as of Monday, 50 men and six cats were involved in fighting the blaze which Forestry officials are calling the “Ad” fire.
New “highly-informative” tourist maps were printed, showcasing the locations of smaller roads, public facilities and businesses located throughout the area. A regional map is included, following the Yellowhead from Louis Creek to Alberta highlighting sights along the way.
The B.C. Rollers slowpitch team from Kamloops dominated the tournament with a five-game winning streak and managed to shut out the Clearwater Bears in the final game. More than 30 softball games were played during the event at the Clearwater Park and in Sunshine Valley.
35 YEARS AGO A recent decision to close the Little Fort school and bus the children to Barriere caused problems for families with small children who live on McNab Road as the school authorities didn’t plan extend bus services to those children. School board policy won’t allow extensions of bus service so there were situations where children who live within walking distance of their school are bussed and those living further out are not.
Over 100 people attended a meeting called to urge the Thompson-Nicola Regional District directors to release approximately $10,000 for a feasibility study into building a swimming pool and leisure complex in Clearwater.
Activity in the Clearwater Forest District increased dramatically after a relatively quiet fire season to date. Extensive lightning strikes recorded in Wells Gray Park and the headwaters of Adams River were the cause of many of the new blazes. At least 12 new fires were recorded overnight.
For the fourth consecutive year, the B.C. Rollers from Kamloops will have their name engraved on the Clearwater Sloballers perpetual trophy after their win in the weekend slowpitch tournament held at the Clearwater ball park.
30 YEARS AGO About 50 people taking part in a relay run across Canada passed through the North Thompson over two days. They were travelling from Vancouver to Montreal as part of the “Sacred Run,” to carry the message of the sacredness of all things and prayers for the healing of Mother Earth. The run was planned end around Sept. 27 at Kahnawake near Montreal.
Over 500 people stopped by the Birch Island homecoming to enjoy the festivities. Many entries participated in the parade with many pioneer families having their own float.
About 45 people took part in the annual “Summit Meeting” organized by Friend of Wells Gray Park and BC Parks on Trophy Mountain. Only around a dozen made it to the skyline ridge for the view north into the park.
25 YEARS AGO Failure to use a seatbelt almost cost a Barriere trucker his life when he was thrown from his Kentworth tractor onto Highway 5 following a collision with a chip truck and then was narrowly missed being run over by both big rigs.
Barriere RCMP want parents to pay attention to where their children are and what they’re up to as local youth gathering behind the Thompson Valley Credit Union are attracting the wrong kind of attention. Police report complaints are coming in that those hanging out in that area have broken lights, thrown cigarettes into the mail slot and thrown garbage around the area. The future of anew multi-level care facility hangs in limbo while the provincial government reviews capital projects. An urge, however is creeping into the lives of those who have worked for so many years to bring extensive care facilities to Clearwater.
20 YEARS AGO Two weeks of excessive rain lowered the fire hazard in the area after a low snowfall, dry spring and two weeks of hot weather increased the hazard in early July. Now, the fire season is likely over, though there’s still some potential in the Clearwater to Vavenby area, according to Clearwater Fire Centre staff.
An 18-year-old 100 Mile House resident became stuck on a ledge about 40 metres from the top of Spahats Falls viewpoint, unable to move up or down. Jason Schapansky was later rescued by volunteers from Clearwater Search and Rescue. He summed up the climbing attempt as being “harder than it looked.”
Blue River’s Steve Quinn, director for TNRD Area B, told Vancouver to keep its coyotes. He was responding to a television interview buy Vancouver mayor Philip Owen who said the city’s problem coyotes should be trapped and relocated to wilderness areas of the province. Quinn gave to reasons for his comments:there are already enough coyotes in the TNRD to form a natural balance; and urban coyotes will quickly move back to urban areas when moved.
15 YEARS AGO The Zone 2 Pee Wee boys softball team took home gold in the B.C. Summer Games held in Kamloops. They were the only team to have to play three games in one day.
The three day long Great Canadian Music Explosion Family Festival began, ran and ended with a bang. Entertainers of every type were present to strut their stuff. Clowns, children’s entertainers, Elvis Presley tribute artists and ramp jumping BMXers all showed.
April Francis and Paul Michie decided to have their wedding with a splash-literally. The two were married after a white water rafting trip on the Clearwater River.
10 YEARS AGO Differing views on territorial claims by several First Nations bands appear to have postponed the proposed signing of a cooperation agreement between Selkirk Metals and Simpcw First Nation. The signing was cancelled at the last minute, apparently because of questions raised by Neskonlith and Adams Lake Indian Bands.
A children’s story about a lamb has almost sold out its first printing after just a couple of months and the author is looking at doing a second. The book, written by June Moilliet, tells the story of a lamb bom on the Moilliet family’s heritage sheep ranch near Vavenby.
5 YEARS AGO Clearwater residents Keith McNeill and Jean Nelson completed their first leg of a 350 kilometre carbon cycle at the Bear Radio Station in Barriere. The pair are dedicated to promoting e-Petition 297 which is an online petition to Canada’s parliament that calls for nationwide carbon fee-and-dividend as a way to help control global warming.

Greece counts cost as firefighters battle flare-ups,2021,08,"<p nitf:lede=""true"">Aug 11, 2021( Digital Journal: <url normalizedValue=""http://www.digitaljournal.com"">http://www.digitaljournal.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> Nearly 900 firefighters were slowly bringing a wildfire under control that has raged for nine days on the Greek island of Evia, authorities said Wednesday, while fresh forces were deployed to fight a massive blaze on the Peloponnese peninsula. 
<br/> 'I think we can say that the fire fronts are slowly coming under control,' Yiannis Kontzias, mayor of Istiaia on Evia, told state TV ERT. <br/> But the battle was far from won, with sudden flare-ups an ever present danger owing to bone-dry conditions on the ground. <br/> The wildfires in Greece have scorched their way through thousands of hectares, leaving three dead, hundreds homeless, causing incalculable damage and capsizing the critical tourism season. <br/> Those staying behind have been without running water and electricity, sometimes for days on end. <br/> The fires have been fanned by the country's worst heatwave in decades and the authorities have pointed the finger at climate change, which experts say increases the intensity and frequency of such extreme weather events. <br/>Algeria has meanwhile become the latest Mediterranean country to be hit by devastating wildfires this summer, with the death toll there rising to 65 on Wednesday. <br/> Eight people were killed in blazes in Turkey earlier in the month. <br/> - Peloponnese fires - <br/> The fire situation in Greece was most precarious on Wednesday in the mountainous and forested Peloponnese region of Gortynia. <br/> Christos Lambropoulos, deputy governor for the broader Arcadia region, said efforts were concentrated on keeping the fire from reaching the area's tallest mountain, Mount Mainalo. <br/> 'We estimate the front is over 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) long,' he told Skai TV. <br/> 'It's a very thick forest with many communities,' he said. <br/> Forces in Gortynia were beefed up Wednesday to nearly 600 firefighters including crews from the Czech Republic, Britain, France and Germany. <br/> Another 60 firemen were tackling a smaller fire in Laconia, in the southeastern Peloponnese, the fire department said. <br/> A huge multinational force of nearly 900 firefighters has meanwhile been deployed to back fire crews on the Greek island of Evia, where the town of Istiaia has been under threat for days. <br/> It included Cypriots, Moldovans, Poles, Serbs, Slovaks, Romanians and Ukrainians. Serbian, Swedish and Swiss planes and helicopters were among a fleet of seven aircraft providing support. <br/> 'Yesterday, we saw the light of the sun for the first time in days,' Istiaia mayor Yiannis Kontzias told state TV ERT. <br/> He was referring to giant smoke clouds that have choked residents and obstructed flights by water-bombing aircraft. <br/> EU states and other countries have so far contributed 21 aircraft, 250 vehicles and more than 1,200 firefighters, some of whom were due to arrive by Friday. <br/> Support from abroad has helped avert an even greater disaster. <br/> 'When we arrived, it seemed like the whole of Greece was burning,' said Nicolas Faure, part of a detachment of more than 170 French firefighters that began arriving late last week. <br/> - 'Entire ecosystem destroyed' - <br/><br/>Even as the immediate danger for his town receded, Kontzias said local businesses 'face extinction' in coming months in a tourism season already decimated by the Covid-19 pandemic. <br/> 'We have lost the month of August, which would have sustained people here over the coming year.' <br/> '(Local) tourism has been demolished, most (visitors) have left,' the mayor said. <br/> 'The damage is huge, and the environmental disaster will have economic repercussions for decades.' <br/> From July 29 to August 11, more than 93,000 hectares (231,000 acres) were burnt in Greece,according to the European Forest Fire Information System. The average area burnt over the same period between 2008 and 2020 was 2,330 hectares. <br/> A draft UN assessment seen exclusively by AFP called the Mediterranean a 'climate change hotspot' and said increasing temperatures and aridity had lengthened fire seasons and 'doubled potential burnable area'. <br/> Dimitris Haliotis, the head of a Red Cross team, said that 'the entire ecosystem is destroyed' on the island, with the loss of forest animals running in the hundreds. <br/> Theodoros Roumeliotis, the local hoteliers president in the Greek spa town of Aidipsos, said August reservations had collapsed by 90 percent. <br/> 'It's a colossal loss,' he told AFP. <br/> 'Right now, hotels are obliged to refund one million euros in reservations cancelled,' he said, adding that some operators were unlikely to survive the blow. <br/> - Calls for sackings - <br/><br/>There have been growing calls in Greece for the resignation of top public safety officials who as recently as June had insisted that the country was well-prepared. <br/> There was additional anger over the loss last week of much of the forest of Varibobi, one of Athens' last remaining nature reserves. In that fire, the former royal estate of Tatoi narrowly avoided destruction. <br/> Civil protection deputy minister Nikos Hardalias said Greece's resources were 'stronger than ever before'. <br/> 'We faced an operationally unique situation with 586 fires in eight days during the worst weather phenomenon in 40 years,' he said on Tuesday. <br/>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis this week apologised to the nation for any possible 'shortcomings' in the state's response. He is to hold a press conference on Thursday. <br/> The PM has pledged hundreds of millions of euros in additional funds for civil protection, reforestation and flood prevention. <br/><url normalizedValue=""https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;title=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-ups"">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;title=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-ups</url><br/>The post Greece counts cost as firefighters battle flare-ups[1] appeared first on Digital Journal[2]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/greece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups/article"">https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/greece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups/article</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.digitaljournal.com"">https://www.digitaljournal.com</url>",Canada
Receives Drilling Permit and Exercises Option to Purchase Claims at the Vixen Gold Project,2021,08,"ALX RESOURCES CORP (""AL-V"") - Receives Drilling Permit and Exercises Option to Purchase Claims at - the Vixen Gold Project
ALX Resources Corp. (""ALX"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to provide an update for its 100%-owned Vixen Gold Project (""Vixen"" or the ""Project"") located in the Red Lake Mining District of Ontario. Vixen consists of three sub-projects totaling 10,614 hectares (26,227 acres), Vixen North, Vixen South and Vixen West, located within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt approximately 60 kilometres (37 miles) east of Red Lake, Ontario.
Vixen North Exploration Permit
In the fall of 2020, ALX completed a high-resolution helicopter-borne magnetic and VLF-EM survey totaling 475.7 line-kilometres to over a known 3,000 metre-long high magnetic trend and other important structural trends present at Vixen North. Drill targets were subsequently defined by the integration of the airborne survey results with the geochemical results of site visits carried out in 2019 and 2020 (see ALX news release dated October 29, 2020), which led to the filing of an exploration permit application for Vixen North.
In late June 2021, following a positive engagement with local First Nations, ALX received an exploration permit from the Ontario Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines (the ""Permit""). The Permit allows for diamond drilling at up to ten locations at Vixen North totaling approximately 1,000 metres (3,280 feet), and is effective until June 28, 2024. The drilling program is designed to be helicopter-supported with a start date to be determined, due to the continuing forest fire emergency and the resulting moratorium on exploration activities in the Red Lake Mining District.
Vixen South Claims Acquisition
In early May 2021, ALX executed an option-to-purchase agreement with arm's-length vendors (the ""Vendors"") to purchase a 100% interest in a group of claims west of Grace Lake, consisting of nineteen claim units and a single patented claim (the ""Claims"", see ALX news release dated May 12, 2021). The Claims comprise approximately 384 hectares (949 acres) and are located along the northern edge of the Vixen South claim block.
ALX carried out due diligence on the Claims, which included a site visit in late June 2021 before forest fires effectively closed off access to the Vixen South area. In August 2021, ALX decided to exercise its right to purchase a 100% interest in the Claims in exchange for a total of $40,000 cash and 500,000 common shares of ALX. The Claims remain subject to a 2.5% net smelter returns royalty (""NSR"") in favour of the Vendors, which can be purchased in its entirety by ALX for $2.5 million. This transaction is subject to the acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange.

Still a lot of work to do to fully connect regional district,2020,05,"The northern portion of the Regional District of Kitimat-Stikine is totally dependent on a single fibre optic cable route. One solution could mean putting a ring on it.
On May 22, TANEx Engineering Corporation presented a connectivity draft strategy to the regional board of directors, showing the state of connectivity services in the district.
One risk factor in the report is that there is only one fibre optic cable route into the district. It runs along Highway 16 and poses a connectivity risk because if it was damaged the whole district would be severely affected.
The Nisga'a and Tahltan Nations have secured fibre optic cable on the Northwest Transmission Line. That fibre backbone could be used to complete a ring of cable in the north, running through Terrace, Dease Lake, Watson Lake, Dawson Creek and Prince George.
""Once you've completed a ring like this a break in a fibre due to a forest fire or something means that all that connectivity can be rerouted around the ring so that there is no impact in service,"" said Mike Thomas, TANEx president.
A northern ring would not only be beneficial for the regional district but for the province as a whole, but it is not expected to happen anytime soon.
""The reality is they are just plagued by excessive delays, these things take a long time to get through the funding process and even once they get through the funding process getting access to get these things built can take years,"" said Mike Thomas.
The report found that connectivity in the district is diverse. The Terrace area and the southern part of the district is reasonably developed, with many service providers. That is contrasted by the northern areas in the district, where there is little to no service and Northwestel is the only provider.
""It's really about making high speed internet connectivity available throughout your region to benefit all of your constituents regardless of where they live, so that they can benefit from the economy as well as important services,"" said Kerri-Anne Thomas, TANEx project manager, to the district board.
Cellular service coverage in the district is far from total. Right now, over 600 kilometres of major roadways in the district do not have cellular service, a public safety issue because there is no access to emergency services.
The eventual goal is to have cellular coverage along all highway corridors in the regional district.
""Obviously we all know that it's seriously lacking along many of the major roads, we think it's about 28 per cent now,"" said Kerri-Anne Thomas.
TANEx identified download and upload speeds for various types of homes and businesses in the region based on 50 megabytes per second download and 10 megabytes per second upload speeds (50/10).
Outside of municipalities, about 14 per cent of anchor tenants like schools, libraries, first responder facilities and healthcare facilities have 50/10 service. Within RDKS member municipalities that number is 42 per cent.
About one third of homes outside member municipalities have access to 50/10 service.
TANEx will present its final report to the regional district board in late July.

""The reality is they are just plagued by excessive delays, these things take a long time to get through the funding process and even once they get through the funding process getting access to get these things built can take years,"" said Mike Thomas.
The report found that connectivity in the district is diverse. The Terrace area and the southern part of the district is reasonably developed, with many service providers. That is contrasted by the northern areas in the district, where there is little to no service and Northwestel is the only provider.
""It's really about making high speed internet connectivity available throughout your region to benefit all of your constituents regardless of where they live, so that they can benefit from the economy as well as important services,"" said Kerri-Anne Thomas, TANEx project manager, to the district board.
Cellular service coverage in the district is far from total. Right now, over 600 kilometres of major roadways in the district do not have cellular service, a public safety issue because there is no access to emergency services.
The eventual goal is to have cellular coverage along all highway corridors in the regional district.
""Obviously we all know that it's seriously lacking along many of the major roads, we think it's about 28 per cent now,"" said Kerri-Anne Thomas.
TANEx identified download and upload speeds for various types of homes and businesses in the region based on 50 megabytes per second download and 10 megabytes per second upload speeds (50/10).
Outside of municipalities, about 14 per cent of anchor tenants like schools, libraries, first responder facilities and healthcare facilities have 50/10 service. Within RDKS member municipalities that number is 42 per cent.
About one third of homes outside member municipalities have access to 50/10 service.
TANEx will present its final report to the regional district board in late July.

'We fought a great battle': Greece defends wildfire response,2021,08,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — As the worst of Greece's massive wildfires were being tamed Tuesday, the country's civil protection chief defended the firefighting efforts, saying every resource was thrown into the battle against what he described as the fire service's biggest-ever challenge.
Nikos Hardalias said authorities “truly did what was humanly possible” against blazes that destroyed tens of thousands of hectares (acres) of forest and hundreds of homes, killed a volunteer firefighter and forced more than 60,000 people to flee. Two other firefighters were in intensive care with severe burns.
“We handled an operationally unique situation, with 586 fires in eight days during the worst weather conditions we’ve seen in 40 years,” Hardalias told a news conference. “Never was there such a combination of adverse factors in the history of the fire service.”
Greece had just experienced its worst heat wave since 1987, which left its forests tinder-dry. Other nearby nations such as Turkey  and Italy also faced the same searing temperatures and quickly spreading fires.
Worsening drought and heat – both linked to climate change – have also fueled wildfires this summer in the U.S. West  and in Siberia in northern Russia.
Scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas  is driving extreme events. Researchers can directly link a single event to climate change only through intensive data analysis, but they say such calamities are expected to happen more frequently.
In Greece, the worst blaze still burning Tuesday was in the northern section of Evia, the country's second-largest island, which is linked by a bridge to the mainland north of Athens and is a favorite holiday destination for the Greek capital's residents.
Nearly 900 firefighters, 50 ground teams and more than 200 vehicles were fighting the blaze that broke out Aug. 3, the fire service said. They included crews from Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Cyprus and Poland — part of a huge international response to Greece's plea for assistance.
Fourteen helicopters provided air support Tuesday on Evia, including three from Serbia, two from Switzerland and two from Egypt. The wildfire on Evia, unlike many in the United States, was burning in an area in which villages and forests are entwined.
Hardalias said all the fire fronts on Evia were waning, but firefighters were guarding the perimeter of the blaze, particularly around a cluster of villages that were among the dozens evacuated on the island in recent days. However, heavy smoke from the fires has often reduced visibility to zero, making it too dangerous for water-dropping aircraft to assist ground forces.
According to EU wildfire data and satellite imagery, more than 49,000 hectares (121,000 acres) have burned up on Evia — by far the worst damage from any of the recent fires in Greece.
Several other wildfires were burning in the country, with the most significant in the southern Peloponnese region, where new evacuations were ordered Tuesday afternoon. About 400 firefighters, including teams from the Czech Republic and Britain, battled that blaze, assisted by five helicopters and 23 water-dropping planes from several countries.
A judicial investigation is under way into the causes of the fires, including any links to criminal activity. Several arson suspects have been arrested.
“I don’t know whether there is any organized arson plan, that’s not my job,” Hardalias told the news conference. But it was his “feeling” that at least with the flames near ancient Olympia, the seven or eight fires that broke out in close succession could be due to arson.
Also on Tuesday, a woman convicted of intentionally starting a fire in an Athens park last week was sentenced to five years in prison.
Residents and local officials on Evia have complained about a lack of water-dropping planes in the early stages that they say left the fire to grow to such proportions that flying became too hazardous.
Hardalias argued that when the Evia blaze broke out, authorities were already facing other enormous challenges. A major forest fire was burning through the northern outskirts of Athens, forcing the evacuation of thousands, and another was coursing through villages towards ancient Olympia — a hugely important archaeological site in the Peloponnese where the ancient Olympic Games were held for more than 1,000 years.
“Every house lost is a tragedy for all of us. It’s a knife in our heart,” he said.
Asked whether he was satisfied with the country's firefighting response, Hardalias said: “Obviously, there can be no satisfaction after such a catastrophe. But all our available forces, ground and airborne, were sent immediately to the fires.”
“Whether we could have done something different remains to be seen,” he said. “But in any case, we fought a great battle, and the losses were among those fighting it, not among civilians.”
Greek authorities have emphasized saving lives, issuing evacuation alerts for dozens of villages and neighborhoods this summer. In 2018, a deadly fire that engulfed a seaside settlement near Athens killed more than 100 people, including some who drowned trying to escape the flames and smoke by sea.
Critics say the government’s focus on evacuating villages prevented villagers with local knowledge from helping firefighters and led to more property destruction.
Greece's center-right government has pledged to provide compensation to everyone who suffered loss from the wildfires and to undertake a massive reforestation effort to replace the trees that have burned.
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told a special cabinet meeting Tuesday that owners of destroyed or damaged homes would receive up to 150,000 euros ($176,000) in state compensation, with initial payments to begin next week, while businesses and farmers will also get support and tax breaks.
In southwest Turkey, crews battled two fires Tuesday in the coastal province of Mugla, including a brush fire near Bodrum’s Gumusluk resort neighborhood. Bodrum’s mayor said the fire was close to being extinguished and no residential areas were threatened.
Meanwhile, firefighters quickly put out a new blaze in a forest in Istanbul’s Sariyer district.

Still a lot of work to do to fully connect regional district,2020,05,"The northern portion of the Regional District of Kitimat-Stikine is totally dependent on a single fibre optic cable route. One solution could mean putting a ring on it.
On May 22, TANEx Engineering Corporation presented a connectivity draft strategy to the regional board of directors, showing the state of connectivity services in the district.
One risk factor in the report is that there is only one fibre optic cable route into the district. It runs along Highway 16 and poses a connectivity risk because if it was damaged the whole district would be severely affected.
The Nisga'a and Tahltan Nations have secured fibre optic cable on the Northwest Transmission Line. That fibre backbone could be used to complete a ring of cable in the north, running through Terrace, Dease Lake, Watson Lake, Dawson Creek and Prince George.
""Once you've completed a ring like this a break in a fibre due to a forest fire or something means that all that connectivity can be rerouted around the ring so that there is no impact in service,"" said Mike Thomas, TANEx president.
A northern ring would not only be beneficial for the regional district but for the province as a whole, but it is not expected to happen anytime soon.
""The reality is they are just plagued by excessive delays, these things take a long time to get through the funding process and even once they get through the funding process getting access to get these things built can take years,"" said Mike Thomas.
The report found that connectivity in the district is diverse. The Terrace area and the southern part of the district is reasonably developed, with many service providers. That is contrasted by the northern areas in the district, where there is little to no service and Northwestel is the only provider.

"Hundreds of families homeless as Greek fires rage, Turkey saved by the rain",2021,08,"<p nitf:lede=""true"">Aug 07, 2021( Digital Journal: <url normalizedValue=""http://www.digitaljournal.com"">http://www.digitaljournal.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> Hundreds of firefighters fought wildfires and flare-ups that have devoured record numbers of woodlands in Greece Saturday and left hundreds of families homeless, but heavy rains brought some respite to hard-hit Turkey. <br/> More than 1,450 Greek firefighters backed by at least 15 aircraft were battling the fires, with reinforcements arriving from other countries, the fire service said. 
<br/> The blazes in Greece are set to continue, with strong winds and temperatures of up to 38 degrees C (100 F) forecast in some regions on Saturday. <br/> This year's fires have been far more destructive than in previous years. <br/> In the last 10 days, 56,655 hectares (140,000 acres) have been burnt in Greece,according to the European Forest Fire Information System. The average number of hectares burnt over the same period between 2008 and 2020 was 1,700 hectares. <br/> 'When this nightmarish summer ends we will reverse the damage as soon as possible,' Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis pledged on Saturday. <br/> In Pefkofyto, in the north of Athens, pensioner Tasos Tsilivakos struggled to contain his tears. <br/> 'This is a horrible disaster,' he told AFP. <br/> 'I'm really afraid that maybe only our great-grand children will have the chance to walk again in these areas.' <br/> One 62-year-old man from nearby Agios Stefanos told Alpha TV how after being evacuated he had had to watch his house burning on television. 'My child is still crying from the shock,' he said. <br/><br/>- Rains help Turkey - <br/><br/>Greece and Turkey have been fighting devastating fires for more than a week as the region suffers its worst heatwave in decades. Officials and experts have linked such intense weather events to climate change. <br/> So far, they have killed two people in Greece and eight in Turkey, with dozens more hospitalised there during 10 days of the blazes. <br/> A UN draft report seen by AFP labelled the Mediterranean region a 'climate change hotspot', warning that heatwaves, droughts and fires would become more fierce in the future, supercharged by rising temperatures. <br/> But the weather gave Turkey some respite Saturday. Officials in the Turkish coastal city of Antalya said the blazes were under control in the southwestern province after rainfall there. <br/> And heavy rainfall was expected to continue until the afternoon in areas including Manavgat, one of the most affected by the fires. <br/> The situation remained serious however around the tourist hotspot of Mugla, where at least three neighbourhoods have been ordered to evacuate. <br/> There have been over 200 fires in 47 of Turkey's 81 provinces, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Bekir Pakdemirli tweeted early on Saturday. Thirteen fires continue in five provinces. <br/><br/>- Fears of more high winds - <br/><br/>Greek Civil Protection deputy minister, Nikos Hardalias said on Saturday that 55 blazes were raging across Greece. <br/> They were burning on Evia, the country's second largest island, which lieseast of the capital; in the Peloponnese region in the southwest; and in Fthiotida in Central Greece. <br/> The fire front on Evia alone ran across 30 kilometres (18 miles) long, said Fanis Spanos, regional governor of Central Greece, but in Attica peninsula there the situation was 'more stable'. <br/> There is, however, concern as winds are expected to pick up pace later in the day, the Fire Brigade said. <br/> Part of a motorway linking Athens to the north of the country that had been shut down as a precaution was reopened Saturday. <br/> In the northern Evia, where more than 1,300 people fled the fires on ferry boats Friday from the coastal village of Limni, another 23 were evacuated Saturday morning from a nearby beach at Rovies. <br/> Navy warships are on high alert off the north of the island in case more evacuations are required. <br/> Local officials there have already called for more air support in the firefighting efforts warning for hundreds of homeless families. <br/> Fanis Spanos told the Athens News Agency (ANA) that more than 300 families whose homes had been burned down were being sheltered in hotels. <br/> The situation remained dire in Mani, in the Peloponnese, where 5,000 people were evacuated on Friday. <br/> Eleni Drakoulakou, the mayor of East Mani, told ERT TV on Saturday that half the town had been burnt, blaming a lack of water-dropping air support during the critical first hours of the wildfire. <br/> ANA also reported that two people had been charged for arson. <br/> In Athens, police arrested a woman in a park on Friday as she was carrying two lighters, petrol and flammable materials,a few minutes after a fire broke out there. <br/> Authorities have banned visits to parks and forests through Greece. <br/> A 43-year-old man was arrested in the area of Krioneri and charged with arson, according to ANA. <br/><url

"Thousands flee fires in Greece, Turkey; some rescued by sea",2021,08,"DROSOPIGI, Greece (AP) — Thousands of people fled wildfires burning out of control in Greece and Turkey on Friday, including a major blaze just north of the Greek capital of Athens that left one person dead, as a protracted heat wave turned forests into tinderboxes and flames threatened populated areas, electricity installations and historic sites. 
Firefighters across Greece were battling 56 active wildfires, Civil Protection chief Nikos Hardalias said. Multiple evacuation orders were issued for inhabited areas of the country's mainland and the nearby island of Evia, while the fire near Athens burned forestland and houses in its path heading toward Lake Marathon, the capital’s main water reservoir. 
“We continue our effort hour by hour to tackle the multiple fires we face today,” Hardalias said. “Conditions are exceptionally dangerous.” Strong winds were forecast for Friday afternoon in much of Greece, which could hamper firefighting efforts.
Athens' main trauma hospital said a 38-year-old man died after sustaining a head injury from a falling utility pole in Ippokrateios Politeia, one of the neighborhoods north of Athens affected by the fire. The man was taken to the hospital by ambulance Friday afternoon without any vital signs, and efforts to revive him for more than an hour were unsuccessful. 
On Evia, the coast guard mounted a major operation to evacuate hundreds of people by sea, using patrol vessels, fishing and tourist boats and private vessels to rescue residents and vacationers overnight and into Friday. Dozens of other villages and neighborhoods were emptied in the southern Peloponnese region and just north of the Greek capital as blazes raced through pine forests. 
“We're talking about the apocalypse, I don't know how to describe it,” Sotiris Danikas, head of the coast guard in the town of Aidipsos on Evia, told state broadcaster ERT, describing the sea evacuation.
The coast guard said 668 people had been evacuated from beaches in northeast Evia by early Friday afternoon after flames cut off all other means of escape. Coast guard vessels continued to patrol the coastline.
A massive amphibious aircraft leased from Russia joined the firefighting effort on the island. The Beriev Be-200 is the largest firefighting plane Greece currently has at its disposal.
Greek and European officials have blamed climate change for the multiple fires burning through swathes of southern Europe, from southern Italy to the Balkans, Greece and Turkey. Massive fires have been burning across Siberia in Russia's north for weeks, while hot, bone-dry, gusty weather has also fueled devastating wildfires in California, decimating whole towns in some cases. 
Greece has been baked by its worst heat wave in three decades, with temperatures soaring to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). Thousands have fled homes and holiday accommodation, while at least 20 people, including four firefighters, have been treated for injuries. Two of the firefighters were in intensive care in Athens, while another two were hospitalized with light burns, the Health Ministry said. 
In neighboring Turkey, wildfires described as the worst in decades have swept through swaths of the southern coast for the past 10 days, killing eight people.
More than 1,000 firefighters and nearly 20 aircraft are now battling major fires across Greece. Several European countries are sending or already sent firefighters, planes, helicopters and vehicles to help, while Israel also announced it was sending firefighters.
In Turkey, authorities on Friday evacuated six more neighborhoods near the Mugla province town of Milas as a wildfire fanned by winds burned some 5 kilometers (3 miles) from a power plant. At least 36,000 people were evacuated to safety in Mugla province alone, officials said.
Meanwhile, several excavators cleared strips of land to form firebreaks in a bid to stop flames from reaching the Yenikoy power plant, the second such facility to be threatened by wildfires in the region. 
Wildfires near the tourism resort of Marmaris, also in Mugla province, were largely contained by late Thursday, officials said, while at least two fires were still burning in Antalya province, another beach holiday destination.
In Greece, firefighters went door to door in areas around 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) north of Athens telling people to evacuate, while helicopters dropped water on towering flames and thick smoke blanketed the area. Authorities sent push alerts to mobile phones in the area urging residents to leave. 
Constant flare-ups that threatened inhabited areas hampered the work of hundreds of firefighters there.
The fire halted traffic on the country's main highway connecting Athens to northern Greece and damaged electricity installations. The power distribution company announced rolling cuts in the wider capital region to protect the electrical grid. 
In the Drosopigi area, resident Giorgos Hatzispiros surveyed the damage to his house Friday morning, the first time he was seeing it after being ordered to evacuate the previous afternoon. Only the charred walls of the single-story home remained, along with his children's bicycles, somehow unscathed in a storeroom. Inside, smoke rose from a still-smoldering bookcase. 
“Nothing is left,” Hatzispiros said. He urged his mother to leave, to spare her the sight of their destroyed home. 
In southern Greece, nearly 60 villages and settlements were evacuated Thursday and early Friday. In addition to Evia, fires were burning in multiple locations in the southern Peloponnese region where a blaze was stopped before reaching monuments at Olympia, birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games. 
A summer palace outside Athens once used by the former Greek royal family was also spared. 
The fires also disrupted COVID-19 vaccinations. The Health Ministry announced the suspension of vaccinations at centers in areas affected by the fires, saying appointments could be rescheduled when conditions allow.
“Our priority is always the protection of human life, followed by the protection of property, the natural environment and critical infrastructure. Unfortunately, under these circumstances, achieving all these aims at the same time is simply impossible,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a televised address Thursday night. 
The wildfires, he said, display “the reality of climate change.”
In 2018, more than 100 people died when a fast-moving forest fire engulfed a seaside settlement east of Athens. Some of them drowned trying to escape by sea from the choking smoke and flames after becoming trapped on a beach.

New Potential Gold Settings Discovered Encourage Further Follow Up at Kwai,2021,10,"GOLDEN GOLIATH RESOURCES LTD (""GNG-V;GGTHF-0"") - New Potential Gold Settings Discovered Encourage Further Follow-Up - at Kwai
Golden Goliath Resources Ltd. has been drilling on the Kwai gold property since July and has now completed holes K21-25 to K21-35. K21-25 to K21-28 tested the area around the anomalous gold value that was returned earlier in drill hole K21-21 on the south side of Beauregard Lake. K21-29 to K21-34 tested IP anomalies on the Pakwash fault east of Beauregard Lake. The final hole in the program, K21-35, tested a mag and structural anomaly with weak IP in an area northwest of Beauregard Lake that is now interpreted to be directly up ice of the high gold in till values returned in early 2020.
Hole K21-35, which was just completed on October 1, cut multiple zones of brick red potassic alteration associated with brecciation, silicification, hematite and up to 15% disseminated sulfides. This hole was located off the main trend of the Pakwash fault targeting a crosscutting northwest trending magnetic anomaly associated with a weak IP anomaly. Recent geological fieldwork has established a 040 degree ice direction, which is much steeper than previously understood. This places K21-035 directly up ice of the strong gold in till results found on the West Grid. This alteration is very similar to a style of mineralization seen in the Red Lake region, in particular in the Spring Pole deposit area in the north end of the Uchi belt.
There are a number of untested weak IP anomalies beneath conductive overburden that are now potential targets and a large area of the northern part of the property has yet to be surveyed by IP. The original Kwai gold showing is in this area of unexplored terrain.

In July four holes were drilled to follow up on an anomalous gold value of 864 ppb over 1 m in hole K21-21 and these were K21-25 to K21-28, all of which intersected a shear-fault zone on the south side of Beauregard Lake in a feature parallel to and south of the Pakwash Fault. Although no further gold values were encountered in these four holes, a 400-500m long section of the structure with associated IP anomalies has yet to be drill tested.
The area east of Beauregard Lake was tested by holes K21-29 to K21-34 on lines 28E, 30E, 32E, 34E, 39E and 41E. Three other potential gold settings were encountered. Silicified sediments similar to those that occur on the Great Bear Dixie property to the north lie along a basalt contact, and wide albite alteration zones occur in holes 31 and 32. In addition a shear zone in basalt was found in hole K21-34 with disseminated pyrite and lenses of quartz. Assays are pending on these holes.

The drill was then moved to an area north of the West Grid on line 6E where hole K21-35 intersected the very interesting zone of potassic alteration, silicification and hematite. A pause in the program will now take place to give time for assays to catch up prior to expanding the coverage of the Kwai project.
Golden Goliath CEO Paul Sorbara PGeo comments:
""This drilling project, in such a great area of prospective geology, continues to excite our team as we explore along the Pakwash fault boundary edge of the Uchi Subprovince. We have confidence in the potential of the Kwai property given the number of favourable environments we have identified and, given the recent LP Fault deep drilling success at Great Bear, the fact that all of our drill holes are shallow. Our improved understanding of the geology, ice history, and models of mineralization are focusing our search. I would also like to thank Niigaani drilling, and the Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, and Forestry for ensuring our program could be completed through what was a very difficult forest fire season in the area.""
QAQC
All the gold values reported in this round of drilling were obtained by fire assaying 30 gm samples. Blank and standards were inserted into the sample stream alternating at 25m intervals.

The Clearwater District Forest Office has reported nine fires so far this season with three of those still burning and under observation. All of the fires were started by lightning except for one which was caused by slash burning.
For the third consecutive year the PrincetonWeyerhaeuser team has won the Weyerhaeuser Softball Tournament held in Clearwater over the weekend. The Princeton Crocs defeated B.C.I from Kamloops 16-4 in the final game.
New residents to the area, Jack and Dianne Marlow, will soon be taking over management of the Stedmans store in Clearwater. Jack Marlow, who has 24 years experience in the retail trade including 12 years with Stedmans, will operate the store with help from his wife, Dianne and their 19-year-old son, Johnny.
35 YEARS AGO
Members of the IWA carried out their threat to call a strike at wood work operations, after a breakdown in contract negotiations. Pickets turned up at Weyerhaeuser Canada sawmills in the southern Interior, including the company's mill in Vavenby.
The Clearwater Fire Department responded to a fire which broke out in a CN rail car full of potash. The train was pulled onto the siding at Birch Island where fire crew fought the heavy smoke.
A brush control project is proposed to start again on a 50-hectare 10-year-old forest plantation on Road 3 above Vavenby in the Clearwater Forest District. Brush saws will be used to cut the brush, then registered herbicide Roundup will be applied to the freshly cut stumps.
30 YEARS AGO
Sports fishery for chinook salmon in the Clearwater River is due to open Aug. 2 and a couple of regulations are to be more strictly enforced. The use of natural bait is prohibited in the Clearwater River from the Mahood River confluence upstream to Falls Creek at Clearwater Lake. This regulation is now law and will be enforced in 1991.
The Barriere and District Health Centre is to be expanded and renovated at a cost of $100,000. The project will include the addition of a third doctor's office, together with two examination rooms, doctor's storage space and an enlarged clinic waiting area.
Up to 300 participants are expected for a one-day tour to look at vegetation management techniques used in the Clearwater Forest District. The tour will investigate using sheep, cattle and grass-legume mixes to control competing vegetation on cutblocks.
25 YEARS AGO
Four persons, believed to be suffering non-life threatening injuries, were taken to Dr. Helmcken Memorial Hospital in Clearwater following a head-on collision between a motorcycle and a mid-sized car.
Barriere firefighters contained and extinguished a small forest fire that broke out on the east side of Agate Bay Road, below Glen Grove Estates. About a dozen firefighters responded to the call out. One firefighter suffered smoke inhalation and another burned a hand.
An 18'x24' ready-to-assemble wooden shed that was reported stolen wasn't actually stolen and wasn't ready to assemble. It was a disassembled old shed.
20 YEARS AGO
Clearwater's Ian Archibald won $500,000 in the Lotto Super 7 lottery. It was only the fourth time he had bought a lottery ticket. He won a free play from the previous ticket and gave the clerk $1 for the extra.
A 15-year-old Prince George youth was lucky to be alive following a fall near Helmcken Falls viewpoint. He was visiting Wells Gray Park with his church group. The young man somehow got beyond the easternmost or upstream end of the safety fences near the viewpoint and was not on a secure trail when he fell.
The road to Wells Gray Park was cut for the third time in six years due to flooding. Despite this, the local area was not added to a list of areas eligible to receive flood disaster assistance from the Provincial Emergency Program.
15 YEARS AGO
Kevin Kreuger presented Bert Walker with a $60,000 cheque for improvements to the Sportsplex, the first of three. The funding came from the Ministry of Small Business and Economic Development for a program called Olympic/Paralympic Live Sites awards. The award will enable communities like Clearwater to complete special projects.
Reports have filtered through that International Ranger Corp has been drilling despite the lack of a permit. Witnesses have seen it take place on the Foghorn property. But it's copper, not uranium and the drilling is being done by Yellowhead Mining Inc at Harper Creek.
Two local girls, Kristin Sunderman and Tiana Blouin, who began their softball careers in Clearwater were integral members of the Darlen Transport Coyotes Junior Ladies Softball team that won the Provincial C Championships in Kamloops.
10 YEARS AGO
Clearwater Stingers won all seven of their games at the Squirt C provincial championships and took home gold.
Naturalist Trevor Goward is working with the Land Conservancy of B.C. and the Ancient Forest Alliance to auction off the naming rights to two lichen species he discovered. Proceeds of the auction go towards preserving B.C.'s ancient rain forests.
Clearwater now has a FrontCounter BC desk, located in the Headwaters Forest District office on Highway 5. Kamloops-Thompson MLA Terry Lake presented a $400,000 cheque from Towns for Tomorrow for the District of Clearwater's water system.
5 YEARS AGO
A total of 44 riders took part in the Wells Gray Riders gymkhana at the Upper Clearwater riding arena, held monthly during the summer. Twenty-four of the riders were kids.
Logging blocks under discussion on the shoulder of Trophy Mountain and on the west side of the Clearwater River would yield about 200,000 cubic metres of wood, equivalent to between 20 and 25 per cent of Candor's Vavenby division's annual allowable cut. Information about Canfor's Upper Clearwater logging plans were presented at an open house.
The Blue River fire hall is to get upgrades, thanks to the Thompson-Nicola Regional District board of directors' approval of spending up to $24,000 to improve the hall's energy efficiency. Proposed improvements include new heating equipment, upgrades of single-pane windows, lighting and new insulation and siding along one side of the building.

'Swift chariots of democracy': all aboard Washington's secret subway,2021,09,"<p nitf:lede=""true"">Sep 27, 2021( Digital Journal: <url normalizedValue=""http://www.digitaljournal.com"">http://www.digitaljournal.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> Frequented by presidents, Supreme Court justices and even the occasional movie star, it is the transport of choice for some of the world's most powerful movers and shakers — yet few Americans know it exists. <br/> The Capitol Subway System, a network of trolleys in the fluorescent-lit bowels of the labyrinthine, 600-room US Congress in Washington, has been ferrying politicians back and forth for more than a century. 
<br/> The journey is just enough time for lawmakers such as Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, pictured in 2008, to engage in serious political conversation, idle gossip, an impromptu press conference or a pleasant daydream. —  AFP<br/> It has made headlines as the scene of a botched assassination bid, an impromptu off-Broadway stage and a hiding place for a president who disappeared from the Oval Office without telling anyone. <br/> 'Children love it so there are always senators who are willing to bring family members with young children, nieces and nephews, to ride on it,' Dan Holt, an assistant historian at the Senate Historical Office, told AFP. <br/> 'And so I think there's just something kind of special about it.' <br/> The track stretches 3,100 feet — a shade under a kilometer — with the 90-second hop between stations just enough for serious political debate, idle gossip, an impromptu press conference or a moment of quiet reverie. <br/> 'Think about getting on the train to ride to work in other contexts, where you have that moment where you can just sit for a minute and think — or sit and have casual conversation,' Holt said. <br/> 'The train in the Capitol has served that purpose as well over time.' <br/> Barack Obama may be one of the world's most famous faces but to his fellow subway passengers in 2007, he was just another senator. —  AFP<br/> It has also provided useful photo opportunities for presidential hopefuls looking to show the common touch, such as Ronald Reagan, although a boyish JFK — then just plain old Senator Jack Kennedy — was once refused entry and scolded to 'stand aside for the senators, son.' <br/> - 'Good fortune bad marksmanship' - <br/> Today, the bustling main station is abuzz whenever the Senate is in session, with journalists waiting patiently to swarm legislators as they disembark to vote in the upper chamber. <br/> But the cut-and-thrust of political discourse isn't always as convivial below ground as it is on the Senate floor. <br/> In 1950, Maine senator Margaret Chase Smith was preparing to deliver a rebuke to fellow Republican Joe McCarthy when the intimidating anti-communist crusader and smear-artist saw her in a subway car. <br/> 'Margaret, you look very serious,' Smithlater recalled McCarthy saying, according to Holt.'Are you going to make a speech?' <br/> 'Yes,' she responded, 'and you're not going to like it very much.' <br/> Three years earlier the subway had seen its only recorded assassination attempt, when disgruntled ex-Capitol Police officer William Kaiser opened fire from a .22-caliber pistol on presidential hopeful John Bricker. <br/> The Ohio senator dived for cover into the waiting subway car, yelling at the driver to whisk him away, as a second bullet whistled over his head. <br/> 'Only good fortune and the bad marksmanship of his assailant saved the senator,' The New York Times reported after the gunman fled the scene, only to be arrested later. <br/> Actor Denzel Washington, pictured in 2018 after riding the Capitol Subway, is a among a long list of celebrity patrons that also includes Richard Gere, Chuck Norris, Jon Stewart and the rock star Bono. —  AFP<br/> In less querulous times, political leaders have seen the subway as something of a refuge from the frenetic pace of Washington politics. <br/> William Howard Taft, the 27th president, alarmed aides one Saturday in January 1911 when he went missing for around an hour to go see the trains. <br/> 'A keen thrill of fear swept over the city when anxious inquiries at the White House brought forth the reply that the president could not be found. The alarm spread like a forest fire,' the Washington Times reported at the time. <br/> - Show tunes - <br/> The first subway was opened on March 7 1909 for senators hoping to avoid the punishing Washington heat as they went between their offices and the upper chamber. <br/> Electric Studebaker automobiles were replaced by a monorail with its own track three years later and, in 1960, officials added four $75,000 electric subway cars — dubbed 'swift chariots of democracy' by the Senate chaplain. <br/> This 1934 image courtesy of the Library of Congress, shows people riding the US Capitol's subway system. —  AFP<br/> A House line connected the Rayburn House Office Building to the Capitol five years after that and, in 1993, an $18 million Disneyland-style driverless train was introduced to great fanfare. <br/> Not everyone supported these improvements. Some senators grumbled about bumpy rides while others complainedthat their delicately coiffured hair was being ruined by gusts of wind. Ohio's Mike DeWine banned his staff from riding in protest against government waste. <br/> Future presidents aside, the system's famous patrons have included actors Richard Gere, Chuck Norris and Denzel Washington, satirist Jon Stewart and the rock star Bono. <br/> Lin-Manuel Miranda, the Tony Award-winningcreator of hit musical 'Hamilton,' decided to take a midnight ride and belt out show tunes for his Twitter following when he was in the building to receive an award in 2017. <br/> Some Capitol Hill staff see the gentility of subway interactions becoming rarer as health-conscious politicians with step-counting devices increasingly take to walking between buildings. <br/> But the clientele will never truly disappear as long as the urgent task of running the country requires busy people to be in 10 places at once. <br/> 'If you're in a rush, it's great,' Holt told AFP. <br/><url normalizedValue=""https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;title=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subway"">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;title=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subway</url><br/>The post 'Swift chariots of democracy': all aboard Washington's secret subway[1] appeared first on Digital Journal[2]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/swift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway/article"">https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/swift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway/article</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.digitaljournal.com"">https://www.digitaljournal.com</url>",Canada

Tarot can offer cues to aid mental health journey,2021,03,"Sometimes it feels like dissatisfaction is the backdrop of modern living. The Canadian Mental Health Association reports that suicide is one of the leading causes of death for both men and women from adolescence to middle age.
How can society combat this epidemic? While there are medications to ease the effects of anxiety and depression, it is not a cure. Unfortunately, there is no simple solution for depression.
Everybody is sensitive to different things and has different thresholds. What barely bruises the ego for one person can be shattering to another person's sense of self.
But just because depression can't be eradicated doesn't mean that we should admit defeat. Metaphorically speaking, sadness is an illness of the heart and the heart is a muscle. Therefore, we can train it to be stronger. Just as our bodies can heal themselves, so can our hearts. We just need to figure out how to confront and tame our pain.
Using tarot as a meditation tool can help us understand and take control of our emotions. Because tarot is a reflection of life, it contains cards that speak of life's unpleasant events. Contemplating these ""negative"" cards can help us find the strength to face it with maturity. Studying their lessons can give us the determination to move through it.
The following cards reflect some of the rough patches in life's journey:
Card: 3 of Swords
This card is about heartbreaks. It can be caused by anything ranging from dramatic betrayals akin to those found in soap operas to quietly repressed disappointment. It represents all those times we felt let down and not receiving the results we'd hoped for in spite of our best and most sincere efforts. If left unchecked, pain can hijack our emotions until it's all we have room for in our hearts.
Although pain is something we try to avoid, when we do feel it, it's important to remember that this is an important life experience. Pain offers us a chance to grow. Taking time to understand how our hearts got broken will make us wiser, making us less likely to commit to the same situations and people in the future. Also, because it can be frightening to face the things that hurt us, we gain strength and courage once we make peace with it.
Card: 5 of Swords
In this card, we see the end of a battle. The victor holds the spoils while the losers walk away with their tails between their legs. This card speaks about those times when we feel beaten and defeated. There was no glory in a good fight, only the bitterness and humiliation of failure.
During these moments, it's easy to believe that nothing good came out of it. The irony here is that failure is a prerequisite to success. Every great figure in history has failed before. They say that whatever doesn't kill you will make you stronger. I say that it can also make you better. Moments of failures are windows of opportunity to self-reflect in ways we don't do when we feel good about ourselves. It forces us to confront our own weaknesses and arrogance.
Did we lose because we weren't well prepared? Or did we choose the wrong fight altogether? Acknowledging where we went wrong will give us a better chance of getting it right the next time. So if we ever fall short of our goals and someone else beats us to the finish line, instead of wallowing in self-pity or assuming that the world is unfair, concentrate on how we can improve. Remember, those who refuse to see their own faults will never rise above the cycle of failure.
Card: Tower
When people are first introduced to tarot, many think that Death or the Devil are the most difficult cards to work with. Personally, I think the Tower is the most frightening card of all. Unlike Death, in which we gradually come to an end of a chapter, the changes brought forth by the Tower are sudden and unexpected. The lightning strikes the watch tower out of nowhere, destroying a structure that is supposed to protect us. It speaks about radical changes, often not in our favour.
So what good can possibly come from this? How can we grow and learn from tragic events beyond our own control?
In truth, words alone cannot offer enough comfort when the Tower pays us a visit. The loss and suffering must be endured seemingly without reason. It's perhaps the most difficult lesson one can learn in life: sometimes bad things happen to good people.
The key to recovery is time, faith and determination. A forest fire may seem like a tragic event. During these times, we must remember that nature never destroys without purpose. With time, new flora will grow over the nutrient-rich ashes.
Just like nature, we must learn to salvage what we can and focus on rebuilding. Use this as an opportunity to consciously restart your life.

25 YEARS AGO: Farm party crackdown begins,2021,05,"40 YEARS AGO:Clearwater Timber Products mills were shut down Friday when IWA employees staged an illegal work stoppage.
Later in the day Weyerhaeuser Vavenby mill was also closed down by similar action.
Reason for the walkout is believed to be an effort to secure a single provincial agreement for members rather than bargaining in three units as at present.
35 YEARS AGO:Chosen to represent the area as the 1986 Miss Clearwater May Queen was Miss Lisa Wilgosh. Her princess will be Valerie Braaten.
Miss Wilgosh, sponsored by Newby Construction, was also chosen from among her fellow contestants as Miss Congeniality, at the annual May Queen pageant.
The five contestants seeking the Miss Clearwater banner included Valerie Braaten, Miss Stedmans; Miss Raft River Riders, Ashley Sjodin, Miss Clearwater Lions, Laura Shipley; Miss OORP, Connie Arneson as well as Miss Wilgosh.
The new queen and her princess were crowned by retiring royalty, queen Dee Dee Null and her princess Donna Cooper. 30 YEARS AGO:About 30 boaters attended a meeting to discuss boat use on Clearwater and Azure Lakes in Wells Gray Park met with BC Parks staff at the Infocentre in Clearwater. Even if they were not all totally pleased with the outcome of the meeting, most appeared happy that Parks is making an effort to get their input. Major topics were camping fees for those staying overnight at the campsites along the two lakes, canoeonly campsites and how to lessen congestion at the boat launch at the south end of Clearwater Lake.
Boaters staying overnight along the lakes will now pay $5 per vessel per night, explained Parks’ Brian Carruthers.
25 YEARS AGO:It was worthy of prime time TV.
As the two RCMP officers waved at the oncoming car to stop for an alcohol check, the driver hit the gas and dodged past, speeding along the shoulder of the gravel road.
We all piled into the police vehicles and gave chase down Candle Creek Road headed for Highway 5, red light flashing.
Looking for an out, the fleeing driver made a sharp turn onto a dirt road, the open front passenger side door of the car open and swinging wildly.
The desperate move proved just that, desperate, as the suspect vehicle was forced to a halt in the yard of a private residence approximately one-half kilometre later. Sgt. Henry, in the lead vehicle, leaped out of the unmarked police cruiser, collared the suspect driver, threw him over the trunk of his car and cuffed him while police service dog Brig, riding in the second RCMP vehicle, barked wildly and two of the suspect vehicle passengers screamed that the third needed medical attention.
20 YEARS AGO: Licenses and the rest of the forest sector have to recognize that First Nations have an underlying ownership title to the land.
That was the message brought by North Thompson Indian Band chief Nathan Matthew to about 30 local foresters at a breakfast meeting in Clearwater.
“That’s the hardest part for people to accept,” said Matthew. “Most can agree on the soft stuff, but when it gets to ownership of the land it gets difficult. It’s a legal issue. “The companies want more power, and First Nations are seen as an impediment to that. This has led to First Nations being pushed out the door.”
Possibly First Nations should share in stumpage and other resource revenue collected from their traditional territory, he felt. 15 YEARS AGO:RCMP officer and father of five, Chris Newel, is riding in the Cops for Kids Charitable Foundation in September. He says he’s looking forward to the challenging 1,000 kilometre, nineday ride.
Newel first became interested in the ride when he saw the Cops for Cancer riders in the fall. However, due to location, he just couldn’t get onboard. So this year, Newel is able to ride for Cops for Kids and raise some much-needed funds.
“I was a little hesitant at first because it’s a huge challenge,” he said. “It’s not something you can just do on a whim.”
Newel needs to have $1,500 in pledges before he can rise, but he’s aiming for a total of $3,000 by September.
10 YEARS AGO:Black Press publisher Al Kirkwood said he’s more than a little proud of how his papers fared at the recent Canadian Community Newspapers Assocation and B.C. and Yukon Community Newspaper Association’s awards held during the Ink and Beyond conference, at the River Rock Resort in Richmond on April 30 and May 1. Kirkwood, commented that it takes outstanding staff to mold all facets of a newspaper into an award-winning publication. And that’s why the staff at both papers, especially The Times, are celebrating their recent triumphs.
The North Thompson Times took first place honours at the CNA Awards for Best All-Round Newspaper circulation up to 1249, and Best Editorial Page circulation up to 1249.
5 YEARS AGO:Clearwater resident Tom Grimm and his son, Brue, recently returned home after being evacuated from Fort McMurray.
“Compared to Fort Mac, 2003 was just a campfire,” according to the elder Grimm.
Tom was comparing the forest fire that forced the evacuation last week of that northern Alberta town with the fire of 13 years ago that destroyed Louis Creek and forced the evacuation of much of the lower North Thompson Valley.
Grimm, a heavy equipment operator, had experience fighting both.
The fire behaviour at Fort McMurray was much more extreme, he said, and the damage to homes and property far more extensive.
“I was on top of a hill they call Super Test in Fort Mac,” he recalled. “I looked toward town and it looked as if three or four volcanoes were going off.”",Canada
How tarot can offer cues to help us on our mental health journey,2021,03,"Sometimes it feels like dissatisfaction is the backdrop of modern living. The Canadian Mental Health Association reports that suicide is one of the leading causes of death for both men and women from adolescence to middle age.
How can society combat this epidemic? While there are medications to ease the effects of anxiety and depression, it is not a cure. Unfortunately, there is no simple solution for depression. Everybody is sensitive to different things and has different thresholds. What barely bruises the ego for one person can be shattering to another person's sense of self.
But just because depression can't be eradicated doesn't mean that we should admit defeat. Metaphorically speaking, sadness is an illness of the heart and the heart is a muscle. Therefore, we can train it to be stronger. Just as our bodies can heal themselves, so can our hearts. We just need to figure out how to confront and tame our pain.
Using tarot as a meditation tool can help us understand and take control of our emotions. Because tarot is a reflection of life, it contains cards that speak of life's unpleasant events.

Another 69 Canadians headed to help fight bushland fires in Australia,2020,01,"Another 69 Canadians are heading to Australia this week to help fight the country's worst bush fires in recent memory.
Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne says the deployment comes after Australia asked for more help.
More than 200 bush fires continue to rage across Australia, with the two most populated states of New South Wales and Victoria bearing the brunt of the damage.
The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre says 27 incident management staff will leave for Melbourne Thursday, followed by two more incident managers and 40 firefighters on the weekend.
This is the sixth wave of Canadians helping out in Australia, bringing the total number to more than 160 people.
The first group of 21 experts left for Australia in early December, and returned to Canada last week.
The latest wave will spend 31 days, all of it in the state of Victoria. Previous groups were deployed to other parts of the country, including Sydney.
""We are all proud of their efforts,"" Champagne said on Twitter Tuesday afternoon.
Paul Schnurr, an incident commander with the Nova Scotia Department of Lands and Forestry, said he and the other two experts from his province who are part of the latest wave are happy to help.
""Australia has been there for Canada when we needed them on some of our big fires, it feels great to be able to return the favour,"" he said in a statement.
The interagency centre, a Winnipeg-based nonprofit entity run by federal, provincial and territorial fire management agencies, said in a statement Australian firefighters helped out in Canada in 2015, 2017 and 2018.
Australia is suffering a lengthy and deadly wildfire season that began in October, which is several months earlier than usual.
More than seven million hectares across the country have burned, killing 28 people, destroying or damaging more than 3,000 homes, and forcing the largest peacetime evacuation in Australia's history.
It's estimated more than half a billion animals have died.
Smoke in Melbourne was so bad Tuesday Canadian tennis star Eugenie Bouchard needed medical attention in a qualifying match at the Australian Open tennis tournament Tuesday, while at least one other match was called off because of the smoke.
Champagne said last week Canada would consider any assistance Australia needs but its government had only asked for additional people so far.
Most of the Canadians who have travelled there to date are helping with managing the response teams, overseeing the use of airplanes and providing expertise in how the fires will behave. The United States and New Zealand have also sent firefighters to help.",Canada

1-Offs,2021,07,"Ticats open Sunday practice
If you want to catch a live glimpse of the 2021 Hamilton Tiger-Cats - including at least a couple of dozen who won't be with them when the regular season begins - Sunday morning is your one chance.
The Ticats will open their training camp practice at Tim Hortons Field to the public on Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m. It will be the first time fans have been able to see the team on the field since the Eastern Final on Nov. 17, 2019.
It's a ticketed event, although there is no charge. Tickets are available online at ticats.ca/open-practice-july25 on a first-come, first-served basis. Each request is limited to four tickets and the person requesting the tickets must fill out a form with their email address and phone number for contact tracing purposes. Masks will be required. Gates open at 8 a.m. and entry is at the south-side gates off the plaza on Cannon Street. The team will follow the 75 per cent capacity restrictions laid out in public health protocols for the sections it opens on the south-west side of the lower bowl.
Different turf, fewer logos
It won't be fully evident until the home opener against the Argos on Labour Day, but the Tim Hortons Field turf will have a very different look for Ticats fans watching the game live. There's the new darker, and more lush, playing surface. And, apparently, there will be only one logo painted onto the turf for home games: the big Ticat primary logo at centre field. Sources said the other sponsors' logos will be only shown virtually on TSN broadcasts and that will be the case in all league cities. The CFL did not return The Spectator's request for confirmation and details on Tuesday.
Add heavy smoke to Forge hurdles
Forge FC had to cancel its practice in Winnipeg Tuesday because of forest fire smoke that has carried into the city. It was to be an important full-training session prior to Thursday's final match in the eight-game CPL season kickoff bubble against Cavalry FC. Head coach Bobby Smyrniotis wanted to test injured Tristan Borges and Maxim Tissot Tuesday for game readiness. Hamilton's Calgary-based rival has 11 points, while Forge has 12. If the Forge can win, its 5-3 record has to be seen as overachievement with nine player injuries, and the inability to adequately train in Hamilton.
""There's a blanket of smoke,"" Smyrniotis said. ""I'm not sure, going forward, what will happen. I don't think we've ever experienced something like this. We felt it yesterday and today it was like a full foggy day with that kind of limited visibility. Only it's not fog. Two minutes in it, you could feel it in your lungs. It's quite bad at the moment.""
Alarming study on girls' sport participation
This triggers our personal alarm bell and calls for preventive action from those of us who care, which should be everyone. According to a report based on research by Canadian Women &amp; Sport, E-alliance and Canadian Tire Jumpstart, one in four Canadian girls aged six to 18 who engaged in organized sport at least once per week before the pandemic are not committed to return to that level of participation when restrictions are fully lifted. That, the study says, represents 350,000 females who aren't sure they want to play.
The five leading barriers to participation in organized sport for girls before COVID-19 struck - access to programs, quality of programs, other interests, costs, and lack of confidence - have been magnified by the pandemic.

Canadian Football League
As they got down to the required 75 plus ""non-counters"" Monday, the Ticats released defensive back Maurice Carnell IV, who played one game for the team in 2019, but is hurt and can't play this season. They have five players on the suspended list: defensive linemen Jalen Bates, Marshall Esokpunwu and Valentin Gnahoua, wide receiver Emmanuel Butler and offensive lineman Jordan Murray ... Al McColman of Hamilton, the CFL official who worked 14 Grey Cups and now does crew evaluations for the league, is the CFL's COVID compliance officer responsible for the Tiger-Cats. He advises and assesses on league-mandated health and safety pandemic protocols ... Over the weekend, the Montreal Alouettes released kicker Tyler Crapigna, whose winning field goal in double overtime gave McMaster its only Vanier Cup in 2011, but Winnipeg signed him Tuesday ... Good eye from Spectator reader Todd Laidman who noticed in the Mike Filerretirement column that Marv Allemang was mentioned as one of the longtime Ticats' centres. He did play some over the ball but was more regularly at guard and it was seven-time all-star Henry Waszczuk, of course, who was the main centre for a decade or so, beginning in the mid-1970s ... Jim Lawson, former CFL chair and interim commissioner and recently announced as a new member of the Burlington Sports Hall of Fame, co-owns a thoroughbred named Zuger, named after JoeZuger. Other co-owners in the Black and Gold Stables include Ticat CEO Scott Mitchell, his mother Lois Mitchell and his father former league commissioner Doug Mitchell, and NFL sideline official Steve Foxcroft. When Zuger begins racing as a two-year-old next year, it will be under Ticat-coloured silks ... The CFL has released its 2021 promotionalcampaign video, called Rise With Us.
National Lacrosse League
As part of the NLL's Faceoff weekend, the Toronto Rock will play their first game back in Hamilton on Saturday, Dec. 4 against Albany after a 23-year absence in the city where they originated. Albany and The Rock will play in the East conference with Georgia, Halifax, New York, Philadelphia and Rochester. Calgary, Colorado, Panther City (Fort Worth), Saskatchewan and Vancouver will play in the west ... The Rock signed defender Brandon Slade and goaltender Riley Hutchcraft to one-year contract extensions. Hutchcraft has played only 75 minutes in his three-year career as Nick Rose has started 67 consecutive regular-season games, dating back to 2016 ... TSN, which will broadcast a regular-season game of the week, returns to the NLL for the first time since 2016. It makes sense: five of the 14 teams are Canadian and national legends Steve Nash and Wayne Gretzky, who played box lacrosse in Brantford, have joined the league in the ownership group of expansion team Las Vegas, which starts play in 2022.

Size of Oregon wildfire underscores vastness of the US West,2021,07,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) &amp; - The monstrous wildfire burning in Oregon has grown to a third the size of Rhode Island and spreads miles each day, but evacuations and property losses have been minimal compared with much smaller blazes in densely populated areas of California.
The fire's jaw-dropping size contrasted with its relatively small impact on people underscores the vastness of the American West and offers a reminder that Oregon, which is larger than Britain, is still a largely rural state, despite being known mostly for its largest city, Portland.
The 476-square-mile (1,210-square-kilometer) Bootleg Fire is burning 300 miles (483 kilometers) southeast of Portland in and around the Fremont-Winema National Forest, a vast expanse of old-growth forest, lakes and wildlife refuges.
If the fire were in densely populated parts of California, ""it would have destroyed thousands of homes by now,"" said James Johnston, a researcher with Oregon State University's College of Forestry who studies historical wildfires. ""But it is burning in one of the more remote areas of the lower 48 states. It's not the Bay Area out there.""
At least 2,000 homes have been evacuated at some point during the fire and another 5,000 threatened. At least 70 homes and more than 100 outbuildings have gone up in flames. Thick smoke chokes the area where residents and wildlife alike have already been dealing with months of drought and extreme heat. No one has died.
Pushed by strong winds from the southwest, the fire is spreading rapidly to the north and east, advancing toward an area that's increasingly remote.
Evacuation orders on the fire's southern edge, closer to more populous areas like Klamath Falls and Bly, have been lifted or relaxed as crews gain control. Now it's small, unincorporated communities like Paisley and Long Creek &amp; - both with fewer than 250 people &amp; - and scattered homesteads that are in the crosshairs.
""The Bootleg Fire is threatening ranch houses that are in pretty far-flung areas,"" Johnston said. ""There are no suburbs in that area.""
But as big as the Bootleg Fire is, it's not the biggest Oregon has seen. The fire's current size puts it fourth on the list of the state's largest blazes in modern times, including rangeland fires, and second on the list of infernos specifically burning in forest.
These megafires usually burn until the late fall or even early winter, when rain finally puts them out.
The largest forest fire in modern history was the Biscuit Fire, which torched nearly 780 square miles (2,000 square kilometers) in 2002 in the Rogue River&amp;#x26;#8211;Siskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon and northern California. The largest fire of any type was the Long Draw Fire in 2012, which incinerated 872 square miles (2,260 square kilometers) of mostly sagebrush and rangeland in the endless expanses of southeastern Oregon, where almost no one lives.
By the time the Bootleg Fire is extinguished months from now, it will likely be as big or bigger than those fires, but research shows that Oregon once experienced megafires much larger than these fairly often, Johnston said.
""I think it's important for us to take the long view of wildfire. In the context of the last couple hundreds years, the Bootleg Fire is not large,"" he said. ""One of the things my lab group does is reconstruct historical fires, and fires that were burning in that area in the 1600s and 1700s were just as big as the Bootleg Fire or bigger.""
That's little reassurance for fire crews battling the current blaze, which is 25% contained.
On Monday, flames forced the evacuation of a wildlife research station as firefighters had to retreat from the flames for the ninth consecutive day due to erratic and dangerous fire behavior. Sycan Marsh hosts thousands of migrating and nesting birds and is a key research station on wetland restoration in the upper reaches of the Klamath Basin.
Fire pushed by winds and fueled by bone-dry conditions jumped fire-retardant containment lines and pushed up to 4 miles into new territory, authorities said.
Fire crews were also rushing to corral multiple ""slop fires"" &amp; - patches of flames that escaped fire lines meant to contain the blaze &amp; - before they grew in size. One of those smaller fires was already nearly 4 square miles (10 square kilometers) in size. Thunderstorms with dry lightning were possible Monday as well, heightening the dangers.
""We are running firefighting operations through the day and all through the night,"" said Joe Hessel, incident commander. ""This fire is a real challenge, and we are looking at sustained battle for the foreseeable future.""
The Bootleg Fire was one of many fires burning in a dozen states, most of them in the U.S. West. Sixteen large uncontained fires burned in Oregon and Washington state alone on Monday, affecting a total of 767 square miles (1,986 square kilometers), the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center said.
Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.
At the other end of Oregon, a fire in the northeast mountains grew to nearly 26 square miles (49 square kilometers).
The Elbow Creek Fire that started Thursday has prompted evacuations in several small, rural communities around the Grande Ronde River about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of Walla Walla, Washington. It was 10% contained.
Natural features of the area act like a funnel for wind, feeding the flames and making them unpredictable, officials said.
A complex of fires where the states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho meet also grew, reaching 167 square miles (433 square kilometers). The Snake River Complex was 44% contained. The complex was made up of three fires started by lightning on July 7. Flames were chewing through a mix of grass and timber in an extremely remote area of steep terrain about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Lewiston, Idaho.
And in Northern California, authorities expanded evacuations on the Tamarack Fire in Alpine County in the Sierra Nevada to include the mountain town of Mesa Vista. That fire, which exploded over the weekend and forced the cancellation of an extreme bike ride, was 36 square miles (93 square kilometers) with no containment.
Thunderstorms expected to roll through Monday night could bring winds to fan the flames and lightning that could spark new ones, the National Weather Service said.

FireSmart program underway,2021,02,"Each year, the Forest Resource Improvement Association of Alberta (FRIAA) requests Expressions of Interest to municipalities wanting vegetation cleared or forests thinned. Of the 51 applicants, FRIAA approved 36 proposals for a total cost of $2,437,513.25. The majority of the FireSmart programs commenced in late January 2021 and will continue through to the Spring and Fall. 
The specific FireSmart project west of Fox Creek will consist of thinning the forest and mulching trees that are down or deadfall still standing. The neighbouring forested section, which has unmerchantable trees, is slated to be piled and burned. For the last three years, several areas on both sides of Highway 43, just east of Fox Creek, have had FireSmart work completed. The northside underwent thinning, and mulching and the cutline on the southside that runs parallel to Highway 43 was cleared of overgrown vegetation by Wildland fire crews conducting a controlled burn, thus creating a fire break between the forest and the highway.  
As Albertans, we know all too well the devastation that wildfires cause. Thousands of hectares of our timber resources are destroyed each year, costing billions of dollars in lost revenue for lumber mills, contributing to the shortage of lumber for export and retail, not to mention the wildlife that relies on our forests for shelter, food and survival. The impacts are much more severe when a wildfire gets out of control and encroaches into residential areas. Hundreds of homes can be destroyed quickly, which also puts human life at risk. Many still struggle with the aftermath of the Slave Lake, Fort McMurray and the Chuckegg Creek fires in 2019.  
The FireSmart project aims to reduce wildfires' risk from entering into populated areas. Managing overgrown vegetation, removing dead trees and surface fuels can help slow the spread should a fire occur. Reducing ground fuels can minimize flames from reaching into the treetops. Keep in mind; that not all ground fuels can be eliminated, but if shrubs are cut back, tall vegetation and deadfall removed, it all helps lessen the height of the fire’s flames and intensity levels. The thinning of the forest is another critical factor that helps reduce the speed at which fire spreads. A third factor for protecting the forest is delimbing the lower branches close to the ground. By increasing space between the ground and the branches, the flames will have less chance of climbing the tree and reaching the crown.  
Knowing the three types of wildfires will help to understand why FireSmart programs are so important and effective in reducing the spread of forest fires. The first is an underground fire. These occur in areas where there’s muskeg or an abundance of dead vegetation beneath the soil. Once ignited, they can smoulder for months or years and pose a risk of surface ignition. Next is a ground or surface fire. The fire stays relatively low to the ground and only burns surface vegetation and debris. 
A prime example would be forested areas where FireSmart took place. Surface fires cause the least damage to our resources and are the easiest for firefighters to control and extinguish relatively quickly. The last and most dangerous is the crown fire. Once flames reach the crown, it will continue to spread from treetop to treetop quickly and become unpredictable and difficult for firefighters to battle. The previous large wildfires we've experienced in Northern Alberta have been crown fires. Again, participating in the FireSmart programs, cleaning up deadfall, and low-hanging branches all reduce a crown fire's chances.  
The thinning process and removing deadfall require the trees to be put in piles and burned. The safest time to conduct these burns is during the winter months, as the chance of starting a forest fire is significantly reduced. One drawback to burning large piles in the winter is its smoke. Forestry officials plan the burns on days when the weather is most favourable, but we all know that can change quickly, creating issues. For burns along the highway, such as what’s occurring in Fox Creek, it can become a significant hazard for motorists. Smoke can accumulate and travel a great distance if a weather inversion occurs during burning. An inversion occurs when colder air is trapped near the ground by a warm layer above, and there’s little to no wind. Once this happens, it will force the smoke to linger closer to ground level and not dissipate, creating poor visibility for long distances. According to Alberta Wildfire, the best burn practices are to burn in stages to reduce smoke and have time to adapt to the changing weather. Also, watch weather conditions and don't burn if an inversion is forecasted, and lastly, the perfect days to burn brush are when the temperatures remain consistent and wind speeds are 5 km/h or greater.

"Pakenham's Cedar Hill Christmas Tree Farm now open weekends, offering 'Pancakes on the Porch' and wagon rides",2020,10,"As you enter Cedar Hill Christmas Tree's long driveway in Pakenham, Christmas thoughts start to fill your mind as you see tiny fir trees lined up in the distance and catch a glimpse of wooden green reindeers prancing on top of hay bales.
""Christmas is always in season here,"" said Pam Martin, co-owner of the 114-acre tree farm. This year, the Martin family have decided to open early, with their kickoff event ""Fall into Christmas"" offering pancakes on the porch all served outdoors by Fulton's Pancake House.
""We're looking forward to this fall event, we've never done it,"" she said. The event runs every weekend from September 26 until November 1 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. They also offer wagon rides around the farm for $3, a scavenger hunt (beginner to advance levels), a zip line, treats such as brownies, butter tarts, doughnuts and cookies to enjoy, and cute little bunnies to purchase.
Martin's 12-year-old son Graham bred bunnies as a lockdown project and is selling them for $40 each.
The store will be open to get a head start on Christmas shopping with Christmas ornaments and decor, handmade wreaths and new offerings of gourmet food available to purchase.
""The gourmet food section is new to us. We worked really hard to source them all - all made locally in Ontario. My husband actually went to most of the places and picked them up directly from the farms,"" Martin said.
Martin is particularly proud of a special blend of hot sauce made out of new little growth from their farm's fir trees called ""Blazing Forest Fire,"" which she sent to a producer to manufacture.
Prior to taking over the farm in 2016, Martin's family were organic dairy farmers. As former members of the primary food supply chain, she holds farmers near and dear to her heart.
""That's why we wanted to feature, focus and support other local farmers (by carrying their products). Farmers are the unsung heroes. You take for granted that when you go to the grocery store that there'd be food there, but it doesn't just appear on the shelves, there's a lot of work that goes into it,"" Martin said.
Martin also talked about the notion people have that growing Christmas trees is easy. ""People think we just plant the tree and that's it. It's a massive amount of work to grow a perfect looking tree. Most people don't appreciate how much work goes into it,"" she said.
For instance, in early summer they ""have to go out to every single tree and pull all the pine cones out by hand. Some trees will have 700 pine cones,"" she said.
If they don't pull all the pine cones out, the cones will shatter, ooze sap and ruin the tree. ""It takes us about three weeks to do that,"" Martin said. They also have to prune, fertilize and mow between the fir trees, which won't be ready to be full grown Christmas trees for eight years.
Looking ahead to Halloween, Martin plans on inviting kids to the farm.
""Halloween may look a little bit different this year, we don't really know yet, but they can come here and be completely physically distant, do the scavenger hunt in their costumes and just enjoy the day,"" Martin said.
As for handing out candy, Martin has this to say: ""When you go trick or treating in a Christmas farm, you're going to get candy canes.""
Cedar Hill Christmas Tree has launched their online store and will be selling Christmas trees from Nov. 12 until Dec. 24. They are located at 951 8th Concession South, Pakenham. Visit cedarhillchristmastreefarm.com/ or call 613-256-3029.",Canada
Extreme danger fires set to double again as hot and dry conditions persist in region,2021,07,"With more hot and dry weather on the way this week the 27 “extreme danger” fires burning in the Southeast Fire Centre region could be on the rise, doubling as they did last week during similar conditions. 
In all, there are 46 wildfires of note burning in the region, including 16 that are considered high danger, leaving only two fires at moderate danger. One fire burning near Rock Creek is very low danger. 
Six days ago only 16 fires were considered extreme danger but high temperatures and no precipitation for the third week in a row have created a tinder dry forest undergrowth. No other area of the province is as at risk and currently beset by wildfires as the Southeast. 
The Southern Interior only received 30 per cent of normal June rainfall, said Kim Wright, Southeast Fire Centre communications officer, and below-average spring precipitation with above seasonal temperatures accelerated the drying of forest fuels “at a rate not previously observed, making them highly susceptible to ignition.” 
This has advanced the fire season. The region currently has 241 fire starts this year (65 active), 133 fire starts ahead of the five-year average. 
“Burning conditions across much of the province are currently three to four weeks ahead of schedule and more typical of average mid-July or August conditions,” she said.  
“Fuels right now are very susceptible to ignition throughout the southern part of the province.” 
Above seasonal temperatures are forecasted to persist through the southern half of the province, she added. 
With all of the fires burning, BC Wildfire Service is not fighting every one of them. The Service responds to wildfires on a priority basis within the Southeast Fire Centre, said Wright, with the top priority being human life and safety.  
The second priority is property, she added, with the third priority protection of areas with high environmental values including community watersheds and species at risk. The fourth priority is resource values.  
Other areas of Canada and the U.S. are facing similar issues, said Wright, and have resources tied up with their own wildfires. 
“This means that some of the provinces and countries that would normally help out during B.C.’s fire season are currently busy fighting their own wildfires and are unable to assist as much as they could under different circumstances,” she said, noting that resources are being deployed strategically as a result. 
Currently, there are two fires threatening communities or rural homes in the region, with the 742-hectare Trozzo Creek fire the closest to a community (Winlaw) in the area around Nelson.  
The lightning-caused, active fire is 7.5 kilometres northeast of Winlaw, with the Wildfire Service reporting all “containment lines held, minimal growth” as of Saturday.  
“This fire is visible from Winlaw, Nelson, Castlegar and surrounding areas, as well as to those travelling on Highway 6 in the area,” said Wright about the fire.  
Even though the fire is not considered an interface fire — threatening homes — it is deploying 72 firefighters, three helicopters and seven pieces of heavy equipment to fight it. 
According to the Southeast Fire Centre, “good progress was made yesterday (Saturday), with active danger tree assessing and falling” taking place on the Trozzo Forest Service road that allowed for safe passage for water tenders to supply water to ground crews to the west.  
“A fuel free was constructed and overlaid with hose and sprinklers from the north flank of the to the fire,” a release from the centre noted. 
In order to provide additional safe access for fire crews, two additional helipads were constructed, allowing suppression efforts to push farther into the higher elevation.  
Containment efforts are centring on the western and northwestern perimeters, with a guard extending toward the southwest to hold the fire in the upper Winlaw Creek drainage — which flows down into the community of Winlaw. 
“Helicopters will continue to provide support by bucketing the fire and moving equipment as needed,” the report explained. 
Other fires of note: 
• The Octopus Creek fire is located about 11 kilometres south of Fauquier and is estimated to be 1,172 hecatres. The Regional District of Central Kootenay has implemented an evacuation order for five properties on the south side of Taite Creek, including the Taite Creek recreation site. An evacuation alert is also in place for 162 properties in the communities of Applegrove and Fauquier.  
• The Michaud Creek fire is located about 21 km south of Edgewood and is estimated to be 2,500 hectares. The RDCK has implemented an evacuation order for two properties in the Cinnamon Lake and Johnson Creek areas. An evacuation alert is also in place for properties in the communities of Edgewood and Needles. 
Taking action on the home front 
As this period of heightened fire behaviour continues, now is the time for homeowners to prepare themselves and property for wildfire, noted Wright.  
Preparing in advance for a potential wildfire in the area that may result in an evacuation alert or order can make the experience less stressful for everyone.  
Wright suggested taking the time now to develop a household evacuation plan, assemble an emergency kit and talk to neighbours.

“If a wildfire is directly threatening your community, the best information sources are your municipality, regional district, band office or local authority,” she said. “Find out in advance how they’ll share vital information, whether it’s via Facebook, Twitter, a website or phone number.” 
The importance of fire 
Although the effect of a forest fire on domestic structures and some stands of timber can be devastating, there is an important role that fire plays. 
Fire is a natural and essential ecological process and has influenced nearly all forest and grassland environments in British Columbia, said Wright.  
“A wildfire is a ‘natural disturbance event,’ an acute environmental disruption that causes long-term changes to the affected ecosystem,” she said.  
Following a wildfire, a resilient ecosystem — the ability to resist and recover from natural disturbances — will recover more quickly and will be more biodiverse, Wright added.  
“Fire is a natural component of B.C.’s ecosystems, so when a wildfire is burning away from people, property, environmental values or resource values, it can actually be more beneficial than harmful in the long term,” she said.",Canada
"Ontario adviser urges caution despite dip in COVID-19 cases, vaccine delays draw ire",2021,01,"A top science adviser says Ontario is far from in the clear despite a downward trend in COVID-19 cases, while some provinces criticized Ottawa for lower-than-expected vaccine shipments and the pandemic was flagged as an outsized contributor to Quebec's death count last year. 
Canada's most populous province reported 2,093 new infections Thursday and 56 more deaths linked to the novel coronavirus. Cases have fallen since Ontario issued a stay-at-home order two weeks ago. 
Dr. Adalsteinn Brown, who co-chairs Ontario's COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, said new infections are on track to decrease to between 1,000 and 2,000 a day by the end of February. There were several days earlier this month when they topped 3,000. 
A new COVID-19 variant first detected in the United Kingdom, which is at least 30 per cent more transmissible, is circulating in the community. Brown said it would likely be the dominant version of the virus in March and risks pushing up Ontario's case count if not controlled. 
""The new variants, like the variant from the United Kingdom, give us less room to relax and less room for error.""
With the right amount of diligence, schools should be able to stay open, Brown said. 
He added controlling the spread in workplaces like food plants and warehouses is critical.
""Just like a forest fire, if we don't pay attention to the hot spots, the whole forest will keep on erupting into flames."" 
Dr. Susy Hota, medical director of infection prevention and control at Toronto's University Health Network, said Ontario's data show that the restrictions have been effective in tamping down the spread of the virus. 
""How long we need to maintain it is the big question,"" she said.
""This does take its toll on people. It's important to keep in mind what the impact is on the population, because you don't want to be trading off one health risk for another.""
Hota added that anyone panicking about the new variants can take heart in knowing measures such as limiting contacts and masking seem to work against them. 
""All is not lost. I think we still need to keep our focus on what needs to be done because it's still effective.""
In Ottawa, Maj.-Gen Dany Fortin, who is in charge of Canada's inoculation effort, said supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are expected to be crimped in the weeks ahead as work to expand a plant in Belgium continues. 
Fortin said Canada is to receive 149,000 over the next two weeks — one-fifth of what had previously been promised. 
Pfizer is to send 335,000 doses the week of Feb. 15, which is 91 per cent of the previous delivery schedule. 
""This is a bump in the road — not insignificant,"" Fortin told a media briefing. ""But we have to look at the long game.""
Fortin said Canada is expecting 20 million doses of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines between April and June, and more if additional vaccines receive Health Canada approval. 
Provincial governments decried the latest vaccine projections. 
Alberta Health Minister Tyler Shandro said his government was told Thursday that the province would receive 63,000 fewer vaccines than expected in the first quarter of the year. 
“The federal government is failing Canadians. This is a grim situation that seems to be getting worse every week.""  
Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said on Twitter that Ottawa had lowered its estimates for total Pfizer vaccines in-hand by the end of March to 3.5 million from four million.
""We can’t vaccinate people when we aren’t getting vaccines and when we aren’t getting accurate information from the federal government.""
Fortin said the government had given the provinces more conservative figures for planning purposes and has been assured by Pfizer that four million doses are on the way by the end of March. 
Meanwhile, Quebec's statistics agency reported that deaths in the province rose 10 per cent last year because of the pandemic — a jump it considers to be exceptional. 
The Institut de la statistique du Quebec said the number of deaths had risen by about two per cent per year between 2010 and 2019 due to a growing and aging population. 
Quebec reported 1,368 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, as well as 39 additional deaths.
British Columbia reported 546 new cases and 12 more deaths on Thursday.
Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has said the infection trend downward isn't enough to prevent COVID-19 spread and there have been outbreak ""hot spots"" in the province.

"Ontario adviser urges caution despite dip in COVID-19 cases, vaccine delays draw ire",2021,01,"A top science adviser says Ontario is far from in the clear despite a downward trend in COVID-19 cases, while some provinces criticized Ottawa for lower-than-expected vaccine shipments and the pandemic was flagged as an outsized contributor to Quebec's death count last year.
Canada's most populous province reported 2,093 new infections Thursday and 56 more deaths linked to the novel coronavirus. Cases have fallen since Ontario issued a stay-at-home order two weeks ago.
Dr. Adalsteinn Brown, who co-chairs Ontario's COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, said new infections are on track to decrease to between 1,000 and 2,000 a day by the end of February. There were several days earlier this month when they topped 3,000.

European storm's death toll hits eight,2020,02,"Ferocious winds, with gusts over 200 km/h, lashed Corsica and whipped up a forest fire that flared overnight on the French Mediterranean island on Tuesday, after a storm with hurricane-force winds and heavy rains battered northern Europe for days, killing at least eight people and causing severe travel disruptions.
More than 300 fire officers were involved in fighting the blazes and two ports were closed and flights suspended on Corsica. Power was cut to 2,000 homes.
The storm also continued to batter other parts of Europe. Fallen trees blocked roads and train tracks in southern Germany and Austria.
The Austrian city of Salzburg near the German border was hit by the storm Tuesday. Public broadcaster ORF reported that more than 400 firefighters worked for hours to remove downed trees from crushed cars and roads. They also had to remove a huge metal roof that was blown off a building. No one was injured, ORF reported.
German railroad operator Deutsche Bahn, which had shut down all long-distance trains on Monday, said most of its service resumed Tuesday with the exception of some trains in southern regions that were still being battered by gusty winds. Schools across Germany reopened.
Deaths due to the fierce storm were reported in Poland, Sweden, Britain, Slovenia, Germany and the Czech Republic. On Tuesday, Polish officials reported a third storm-related death in the country, saying a relative of two people killed Monday when the roof of a ski rental building collapsed also died.
In northern Bavaria, where a gust of over 160 km/h was recorded, the storm produced a record amount of electricity being fed into the German grid from wind turbines, equivalent to almost 44 nuclear power plants.
The German Weather Service said strong winds would keep blasting much of the country on Tuesday but the brunt of the storm had moved to the southeast. In northeastern Germany, a new storm was expected to reach the Baltic coast. The German Weather Service also forecast heavy rains for most of the country as well as for France and Belgium.
In England and Scotland, the Met Office national weather agency still had 85 flood warnings in force as torrential rains caused numerous rivers to overflow their banks.
Further north, in Norway, water from the North Sea overflowed harbours and entered houses along the country's southern coast, causing property damage. Local airline Wideroe cancelled 21 departures because low pressure over northern Norway meant its small planes couldn't fly, the Norwegian news agency NTB reported.
The low pressure was affecting the altitude gauges on the planes with no possibility to adjust for the low pressure.
In the Czech Republic, more than 40,000 households remained without electricity Tuesday morning, down from some 300,000 on Monday afternoon. Around 20 train routes were still blocked because of fallen trees on the track. Only one flight from Amsterdam was cancelled Tuesday, Prague's international airport said.",Canada

Quebec to deploy sound trucks in Montreal to announce mobile vaccine clinics,2021,04,"MONTREAL -Quebec will deploy sound trucks in hard-hit Montreal neighbourhoods to announce the presence of mobile clinics offering Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines, Health Minister Christian Dube said Friday.
There will be more than 20,000 doses of that vaccine available with or without appointments over the weekend, he said on Twitter. 
Dube said sound trucks will blast messages in multiple languages along residential streets in western Montreal and in the city's diverse Cote-des-Neiges borough, adding that the AstraZeneca vaccine is for those 55 and over. 
""We are waiting for a decision from public health to extend the age for which (AstraZeneca) can be administered,"" the minister said. 
Dube said since the government lowered the eligible age for the AstraZeneca vaccine to 55, about 160,000 more people have been vaccinated, 22,000 of them in Montreal.
But data provided by the Health Department suggests many eligible Quebecers haven't taken up the offer. 
""In Quebec, more than 635,000 people aged 55 to 79 have still not been vaccinated and have not made an appointment to get the vaccine,"" the department said in an email. Quebec has received 411,200 doses of AstraZeneca and 267,000 remain unused. 
The AstraZeneca vaccine is available to Quebecers between the ages of 55 and 79 at walk-in clinics and by appointment across the province. Quebec suspended use of that vaccine in those younger than 55 over concerns about rare blood clots in a small number of recipients. 
While Montreal was the hardest-hit region in Quebec during the first and second wave of the pandemic, the number of new, daily cases in the city has remained relatively stable since late February. 
Dr. Sarah-Amelie Mercure, the associate medical chief for infection and disease control at Montreal's public health authority, said that while officials have seen a slight increase in the number of new cases, the city is not reporting the explosive growth in infections that's been seen in other parts of the province.
Mercure said there are a number of factors limiting the spread of COVID-19 in Montreal, including relatively strict health orders that limit contacts and a more aggressive, targeted approach to controlling the spread of variants. 
Public health has begun conducting more exhaustive contact-tracing investigations, she said in an interview Friday. ""We're really looking for the source. When we don't find the source, we look even further.""
Going further, she said, involves looking in places that have not reported cases for people who may have come into contact with an infected individual, adding that officials may also ask ""contacts of contacts"" to isolate.
Vaccination is also playing a role in some areas, such as residences for elderly people, but not enough people have been vaccinated for it to be having a large impact on transmission in the broader community, Mercure said. 
But, she said, it's not impossible that in parts of the city, acquired immunity among people who have recovered from the virus is slowing transmission.
Montreal's ""relatively enviable"" situation remains fragile, Mercure said, adding that a couple superspreader events — like the one at a Quebec City gym linked to hundreds of cases — could change that rapidly.
Benoit Masse, a public health professor at Universite de Montreal, said part of the reason Montreal is not being affected as much as elsewhere is due to the way viruses are transmitted in a population.
""The virus infects the most susceptible and the epidemic dies out when there are no more susceptible people to infect,"" he wrote in an email Friday, comparing the virus to a forest fire that moves to a new area once all the trees in one place are burned. 
""Since reinfections are very rare, an infected person who recovers is no longer likely to be reinfected.""
Since the start of the pandemic, Montreal has reported a total of around 6,000 confirmed cases for every 100,000 people, Masse wrote, adding that the real number of cases is likely three to five times higher.
Elsewhere in Quebec, he said, there has been an average of around 3,500 reported cases per 100,000 people, leaving more opportunities for the virus to spread. 
Meanwhile, Quebec set a pair of records for COVID-19 injections, inoculating 74,927 people on Thursday — the highest single-day number of Quebecers vaccinated since the campaign started. That daily total included 15,522 doses administered in pharmacies, also a record. 
The seven-day average for shots is 66,000 per day, well above what had been planned for April, Dube said Friday. Health officials said Quebec has vaccinated 26 per cent of the population with at least one dose.
The pace of the vaccine rollout bodes well for the province's plan to dole out 5.3 million doses — one for every adult — by the Fete nationale holiday on June 24, Dube said. 
Quebec reported 1,527 new COVID-19 cases Friday and seven more deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus. Hospitalizations were up by three patients, to 664, and eight more people were in intensive care, for a total of 167.
Montreal reported 355 cases, followed by the Quebec City area with 294 and Chaudiere-Appalaches, south of the capital region, with 204.
Quebec has reported 334,071 COVID-19 infections and 10,785 deaths linked to the virus since the beginning of the pandemic. There are 13,941 active reported cases in the province.

Ontario Cobalt Exploration Update,2021,05,"BATTERY MINERAL RESOURCES CORP (""BMR-V"") - Ontario Cobalt Exploration Update
Battery Mineral Resources Corp. (""Battery"" or ""BMR"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that drilling intercepted 4 main cobalt mineralized structures on the recently completed and initial diamond drill program at the White Reserve Project located about 120 kilometres northeast of Sudbury and 30 kilometers southwest of town of Elk Lake.
Highlights: //st * 17 drillholes completed for 1,838 meters (""m""); * Targets identified from recent three-dimensional model of historic
underground mine workings and results of a recent geophysical model; * Samples have been dispatched for assay and results are pending.
About the White Reserve program
The White Reserve property comprises 616 mining claims totaling 12,984 hectares of contiguous mining claims located in Banks, Barber, Speight, Van Nostrand and Whitson townships (Figure 1). Much of the White Reserve property was burnt by a devastating forest fire during the summer of 2018 (Photo 1). The 2018 fires severely limited access to the property with only a limited number of reconnaissance prospecting, geological mapping and rock sampling traverses completed.
In 2019 a grid-based geophysical three-dimensional distributed induced polarization (""3D IP"") survey was conducted by Canadian Exploration Services. Limited rock grab sampling of rock dumps and surface outcrops yielded anomalous cobalt values ranging from 0.02% to 3.90% cobalt and 0.26g/t to 5.90g/t silver.
BMR compiled a 3D geological model of the historic workings and main vein structures to identify targets and design the drill program (17 drillholes / 1,838m). The drilling targeted both strike and vertical extensions of the main veins and two high chargeability induced polarization geophysical targets.
The four main east-west striking quartz-carbonate-silver-cobalt vein structures were drill tested. Several of the holes were also planned to test a north-south high chargeability 3D IP geophysical anomaly located just west of the old mine workings in the Nipissing diabase (Figure 2 and Table 1). Targeting was as follows: //st * Holes WRS20-001 - 004: Tested the #21 Vein * Holes WRS20-005 - 006: Tested the #14 Vein * Holes WRS20-007 - 008: Tested the #10 Vein * Hole WRS20-009: Tested IP Chargeability Anomaly &amp;#7 Vein * Hole WRS20-010: Tested IP Chargeability * Hole WRS20-011: Tested the #7, #8 &amp;#9 Veins * Hole WRS20-012: Tested the #10 Vein * Holes WRS20-013 - 014: Tested the #14 Vein * Holes WRS20-015 - 016: Tested the #7 Vein
Detailed core logging and sampling has been completed. Samples have been dispatched for assay. Results are pending.
Battery CEO Martin Kostuik states: ""We are encouraged that the 4 main mineralized vein structures targeted by this initial drill test were intercepted as-planned. This drilling targeted the historic mine area which includes 5 production shafts operating until approximately 1940. There remains an additional six known cobalt occurrences at White Reserve to be explored. We look forward to receiving the assay results and continuing this exciting portion of our Northern Ontario cobalt exploration program.""
Background
The White Reserve project comprises a 15 km long, north-trending belt of Proterozoic Nipissing diabase that hosts seven cobalt-silver occurrences including the historic workings known as the White Reserve mine (Figure 3 and Figure 4). The minesite is nestled in a north-south trending valley bounded by high ridges of diabase.
The White Reserve mine was operated from 1909 - about 1940. Early mine development included sinking of a shaft to 45m with two levels at 21m and 43m. Four additional shafts and a total of 1105m of lateral underground workings were developed. Historically, 24 vein zones were located on the eastern and western rims of the diabase- enclosed valley. The more productive veins, #7, #10, #14, and #21 were explored with shafts and open cuts, the 3 former veins developed on the west side, and the latter, on the east. White Reserve mine ""reported historic"" production amounted to 19,775 ounces of silver &amp;452 pounds of cobalt from the #21 Vein.
The White Reserve project is dominated by a north-south striking Nipissing diabase sill, which intrudes quartzites and sandstones of the Lorraine formation, part of the Huronian Supergroup of the Cobalt Embayment. The diabase occurs mainly in the centre of the claim block. Regional north-south and northeast-trending faults transect the area.
Cobalt - silver mineralization is generally confined to the diabase in veins that parallel the numerous faults and structures. Cobalt - silver mineralization occurs as vein-filled fractures, ranging from hairline fractures to a maximum width of 0.08m. Vein selvages consist of epidote-hematite-altered zones. The dominant sulphide minerals are niccolite and smaltite, with minor amounts of native bismuth and silver. Disseminated cobalt sulphides are hosted in a granophyric phase of the Nipissing diabase. Additionally, disseminated cobalt-silver mineralization was noted up to 1.5 meters on either side of vein fractures.

Quality Control
Sample preparation, analysis and security procedures applied on the BMR exploration projects is aligned with industry best practice. BMR has implemented protocols and procedures to insure high quality collection and management of samples resulting in reliable exploration assay data. BMR has implemented formal analytical quality control monitoring for all of its field sampling and drilling programs by inserting blanks and certified reference materials into every sample sequence dispatched.
Sample preparation was performed by ALS Minerals Laboratories (ALS) in Sudbury, Ontario and sample analyses by ALS in North Vancouver, British Columbia. ALS analytical facilities are commercial laboratories and are independent from BMR. All BMR samples were bagged by BMR staff and delivered Upon receipt at the ALS Laboratory in Sudbury, samples were logged in a sophisticated laboratory information management system (LIMS) for sample tracking, scheduling, quality control, and electronic reporting. Samples were dried in special drying ovens prior to crushing. The samples were crushed to 70% ( -2 mm and a riffle split of 250 grams was then pulverized to 85% of the material achieving a size of (75 microns. These prepared samples were then shipped to the ALS Laboratory in North Vancouver for analyses by the following methods: //st * ME-MS61: A high precision, multi-acid digest including Hydrofluoric,
Nitric, Perchloric and Hydrochloric acids. Analysed by ICP (inductively
coupled plasma) mass spectrometry that produced results for 48 elements. * ME-OG62: Aqua-Regia digest: Analysed by ICP- AES (Atomic Emission
Spectrometry) or sometimes called optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES)
for high levels of Co, Cu, Ni and Ag. * Ag-GRA21: Silver by fire assay and gravimetric finish; 30-gram charge.
Weight. Used when samples contain ) 1500 ppm silver. * Au-AA25: Gold was analysed by a 30-gram fire assay method, followed by
AAS (atomic absorption spectroscopy).
Note that 48 element ICP trace element data was also collected and reported by the laboratory. Certified international standards were inserted into sample batches by ALS. Blanks and duplicates are inserted within each analytical run. The blank is inserted at the beginning, internationally certified standards are inserted at random intervals, and duplicates are analysed at the end of the batch.

"High Grade Au Mineralization on the Western Extension of Beardmore Geraldton Greenstone Belt, Ontario",2021,10,"TRANSITION METALS CORP (""XTM-V;TNTMF-0"") - High Grade Au Mineralization on the Western Extension - of Beardmore-Geraldton Greenstone Belt, Ontario
Transition Metals Corp (""Transition"", ""the Company"") is pleased to announce its summer prospecting and sampling work continues to support the interpretation that its Jolly Gold property covers the western extension of the prolific Beardmore-Geraldton Greenstone Belt (BGB) (Figure 1). The property covers a sulphide-facies iron formation that caps the northern assemblage of mafic metavolcanic flows overlain by intermediate pyroclastics. Gold deposits elsewhere in the BGB, such as the 4.5 Moz I&amp;I Hardrock deposit under development by Greenstone Gold near Geraldton, are considered classic examples of epigenetic, non-stratiform, banded iron formation-hosted gold deposits. Other notable deposits within the BGB include the Brookbank (0.6 Moz M&amp;I), the Sand River and Leitch Mine (past production of 0.9 Moz), the Northern Empire Mine and Sturgeon River Mine.
In July the Company completed a first pass mapping and prospecting program on Jolly Gold which included cutting and assaying of 114 channel samples on the historical Fat Beagle trench (Figure 2, Table 1) as well as collecting 82 prospecting grab samples across the 45.6 km2 property before work was halted due to local forest fire conditions. This work followed up on the initial property visit conducted in September 2020 (see November 24th, 2020 press release). Much of the property is covered by unconsolidated sediment and Nipigon diabase, limiting the exposure of the targeted Archean host rocks.
Channel sampling within the historic Fat Beagle trench returned very high-grade zones of gold mineralization, with assays of up to 146.5 g/t Au over 0.41 m, and 24.4 g/t Au over 0.61 m (Figure 2, Table 1). The best result from the 82 grab samples collected outside of the showing area returned was 1.35% Zn from an outcrop of sulphide facies iron formation (Figure 3).
CEO Scott McLean commented, ""The results of the sampling in the historic trench and identification of prospective sulphide facies iron formation supports the interpretation that our claims cover the western extension of the prolific Geraldton-Beardmore gold belt and have the potential to host significant gold mineralization. This camp scale exploration opportunity has seen only limited exploration despite its' accessible location. We believe that the application of advanced exploration techniques including, biogeochemical surveys that have proven successful on our Wollaston Cu project will assist in advancing our understanding of the property's prospectivity and identify major target areas for further exploration including diamond drilling.""

Press Gallery,2020,10,"UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It's just really hard now to get an appointment. I think it's going to be really tricky.
<p nitf:lede=""true"">UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I needed to get tested on Friday, but I ended up having to wait until Monday to get tested.
EVAN SOLOMON: Testing nightmares across the country, backlogs, waits, it's been a nightmare, frankly. Meantime, the prime minister tested negative for COVID-19 back in August. Prime minister said his test result came back just a day later. How did he get tested so fast? Did he use the private paid clinic that MPs are allowed to use? Erin O'Toole used one. Did the prime minister also use that? And should private testing clinics, you can get some in Quebec, across the river from where I'm sitting right now, for about $250, should those be allowed, or, as the Health Minister Patty Hajdu said yesterday, are those a violation of the Canada Health Act and a doorway to two tier healthcare? And if so, why do MPs get it? Let's dig in with the press gallery. Bob Fife, the Globe and Mail's Ottawa bureau chief is here, Emilie Nicolas reporter of Le Devoir is here, and Dr. Abdu Sharkawy, CTV News infectious disease specialist joins us. Bob, I'll start with you. First of all, do we know more about the prime minister's test? He wasn't very transparent when he got it or how he got it. Now what do you make, what do you make of this, these private clinics charging for a quick test to break the logjam?
<p>ROBERT FIFE (Globe and Mail): Well the prime minister's office hasn't been very forthcoming about when he got that test, did he go to a private clinic, who did it? I suspect what happened is that he probably had the DND doctor, which travels with him, do the test, but they haven't provided with that kind of information. You know the problem we've had here is that governments had plenty of time to prepare for what everybody knew was going to happen in the fall, which was a second wave, a surge, and that we are facing that right now, and the governments did not prepare for that. But the solution is not to go to a two-tier system. The solution is to put more money into the system so that they can do proper testing. I don't think Canadians want to see a system where politicians jump the queue, or people with money can spend $250 and get a test, while everybody else cannot do that. So the onus lies on the feet of the politicians who did not properly prepare, and that we as Canadians have to demand more of our politicians to get this testing done.
SOLOMON: Yeah. I wonder about the walk. The walk. Of course, Emilie, in Quebec, it's different after of course that legal case, the Chow Lui case, if people can't get expedient health care they're allowed to take alternative routes so people are getting it in Quebec. How is the debate around private testing for COVID playing out there?
EMILIE NICOLAS (Le Devoir): Well it's important to understand that it's not just private testing. It's also all the normal surgeries, hospitals procedures that have been delayed because the hospitals are focused on COVID-19. So what you're seeing is a lot of folks who are actually paying because they've been waiting for so-called, you know, non-urgent surgeries, but they're still in pain, and so they turn to the private sector for that. So, really, I think it's, what's important to bear in mind is that whenever people have tried to privatize something, whether it be health care or schools, the first thing that they do is underfund the public system to make the public system inefficient and crappy in some way, and then that helps some of the public to be convinced that that they need the private option as well, right. So I guess that's what we're saying. There's no good option right now because the problem is upstream. The problem is why is it that we have a public health care system that cannot answer the needs of the Canadian population properly.
SOLOMON: Yeah, the very people, Dr. Sharkawy, who are running and upholding the notion of public health care when it doesn't work, they become the very illustration of why some will argue you need private health care. You're on the front lines. Give us a sense of the test crisis, if it's a major failure, and what you make of it as a way out?
DR. ABDU SHARKAWY (CTV News Infectious Disease Specialist): Well it absolutely a major crisis at this point in time. When you talk about a backlog of cases to be tested, you know, in the 80,000, 90,000 range, and concurrently having no effective tracing system at the same time, that's abject failure. You're in a situation now where the people who actually need to be tested are those that are in marginalized communities. Those that are disproportionately affected by this are those that don't have the resources available to them to advocate. They don't necessarily have the health literacy that many others do. And we've shifted to online appointments here in Ontario. I'm not sure that that's serving the population that is affected by this disease mostly here.
SOLOMON: Doc, let me just quickly stay with you, because I just talked to the Liberal leader in Ontario, Steven Del Duca, and he's calling for restaurants, bars, and gyms in Ontario, in hot spots anyway, to close down for 28 days. There's a lot of debate about a second lockdown. Again, you're on the front line. Do we need it in certain places?
SHARKAWY: I think at this point in time the evidence is abundantly clear. We can no longer continue to debate about whether this is an issue that continues to worsen. We have seen our hospitalizations increase slowly, but steadily, over the last week and a half. We know that hospitalizations and ICU admissions are the last indicators of disease progression within the community. And we know that venues such as bars and indoor dining in particular are those that help propagate transmission of this virus. That's an epidemiologic principle of reality that can no longer be denied. So I absolutely think we need targeted restrictions to be imposed without further delay, or we're going to make the situation much worse in the long run.
SOLOMON: Bob, just the politics of this, politicians who maybe had a lot of confidence a month ago, is the length of the pandemic, is this changing the political response and the impact of this?
FIFE: Well, look, I'm flabbergasted by this to be honest, because everybody had told us we're going to have a bad first wave, but the second wave is going to be worse, and it's going to come in the fall, and we're just seeing the early stages of it, because flu season is upon us as well. So the politicians have to get together, prime minister, he talks to the premiers once a week, he's got sit down with them and say, look, what resources do we need to solve this problem, and let's get to work to solving it. And to the doctor's point, if there are hot spots, then they should be closing down restaurants and bars in hot spots. This is like a forest fire. It blows up, you know, we can calm it down at some points, and other points, the wind comes up and it is blowing really badly and burning, and we, and this is what's happening in Toronto and the Ottawa area, and clearly they have to address this issue. But it takes political leadership to do so, and they've failed miserably over the summer months.
SOLOMON: Just real quick, Emilie, I just got a couple seconds. You're living in the forest fire, you're in one of the red zones in Quebec. Are they doing, is Quebec doing anything differently than other provinces?
NICOLAS: More things have been closed down already. The 28 days that is being suggested in Ontario is already in place, I'm living it right now. The one issue that I would say very quickly is that because there's no information on where the tracing is happening basically, how the outbreaks are happening, it's hard to justify why those measures are in place if you don't know that for example gyms are the problem, then you close gyms, then there's a backlash of people who are unhappy with that, so that's one of the issues, transparency.
SOLOMON: All right. Guys, I've got take a short break. I know Emilie and Bob are going to stay with us. Just to use Bob's metaphor, doc, you're our firefighter in this, our viral firefighter. Good luck, and we really appreciate your work, your information and your work on the frontlines as they fire starts to burn. But we got to take a break. Coming up next, a funeral was held today for Joyce Echaquan. She's the woman who died in a Quebec hospital while hearing racist comments about Indigenous peoples. How pervasive is racism in the healthcare system? We break that down next.

Dr. Chirico gets majority of West Nipissing council’s support,2021,02,"West Nipissing council voted with a strong majority Tuesday against a resolution asking the North Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit to “immediately transition” out of COVID-19 shutdown extension. 
Deputy Mayor Yvon Duhaime was the lone member to vote in support of asking Dr. Jim Chirico, the Medical Officer of Health, to align the district with the provincial framework, including the reopening of toboggan hills, outdoor rinks, and snowmobile trails. 
The resolution, tabled by Mayor Joanne Savage in response to a widely-circulated letter by resident Rejean Venne, who cited statistics that argued the local health unit wasn’t basing its decisions on available information. 
Venne was also calling for a cost-benefit analysis to weigh the risks of COVID-19 against the toll on local businesses, increases in opiod deaths and overall impact on the mental health of residents. 
See: Our region needs to be treated more fairly when it comes to the COVID-19 response 
And: Parry Sound Chamber of Commerce demands data to justify extended lock down order 
“This is not going to resolve our situation,” Duhaime said of the current situation where other neighbouring regions have looser restrictions and more open economies. “We can’t stop this from happening (when people can bring the virus back such as the case at the North Bay apartment building) meanwhile everybody suffers.” 
Duhaime said he agrees with the mayor of Sudbury who wants to create a northern bubble to keep non-essential travelers out of the area. 
“In West Nipissing, we’ve done reasonably well, we’ve done everything humanly possible to keep everyone safe, but, unfortunately, you close the door in one area but you leave the windows open, then things can happen,” he said. “If we’re going to close it, let’s close it and do it properly.” 
Otherwise, Duhaime said, the extension of the shutdown merely “penalizes the businesses in our area.” 
Councillor Chris Fisher said it is “terrible with no end in sight, however … if we encourage Dr. Chirico to lift some rules and people start dropping dead around us, that’s a problem.” 
Fisher also noted that West Nipissing council “doesn’t have the same information he has.” 
Councillor Denis Senecal also supported the status quo of keeping the district under tighter restrictions “especially with that variant in North Bay.” 
Senecal said he’s satisfied with Dr. Chirico’s decisions that included closing snowmobile trails, outdoor rinks and toboggan hills even though most of the province didn’t do so. 
“I think we’ve been well served by Dr. Chirico, he’s kept us safe so far. To open it up now I don’t think it’s wise,” he said. 
Councillor Dan Roveda said it’s not council’s jurisdiction. 
“It’s the health unit’s responsibility to keep people healthy,” Roveda said, adding he supports the “radical” closing of potential gathering activities 100 per cent. 
“Dr. Chirico is trying to save lives. God forbid one of the variants get into our community, it would spread like a wildfire” like it did in North Bay, he said. 
Councillor Leo Mallette agreed with Venne’s points and helped bring the motion to the table but he appeared to recognize council’s lack of jurisdiction. 
Councillor Rolly Larabie said there’s no reason to discuss the resolution if they have no power to overrule Dr. Chirico. 
“It’s pointless, we can’t change his mind,” he said, suggesting instead that the resolution go to the emergency control group for review. But Jay Barbeau, chief administrative officer, said that group respects “incident command” management structures. 
Barbeau said they’d follow the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry decisions if it was a forest fire and the police if it was a criminal situation. 
“This is a health thing … and we tend to follow the direction of experts in those areas,” he said, adding a cost-benefit analysis would more likely be done at global level rather than a district health unit. 
Councillor Lise Senecal recognized that “everybody is sick and tired, getting cabin fever or whatever you call it … it’s not fun for everybody.” 
Senecal shared she’s been retired for a year and can’t travel but going against Dr. Chirico isn’t advisable, especially considering the aging demographic in the district that’s most vulnerable to the virus. 
Council can make decisions that prepare the municipality to open, such as giving staff the green light to get ready for outdoor rinks reopening or closing the arenas if it’s no longer feasible. 
Savage also said council should stick in its lane, although she’d like to see more communication between health unit districts and municipal leaders. 
“Our role is as ambassador … to tell people to follow the health regulations,” she said, which include for the North Bay and Parry Sound district to remain under lockdown until at least Monday.

Hepburn park's fireless clean up,2016,12,"Forest Fire Management Victoria has begun mechanically removing fuel throughout the southern end of Doctors Gully in the Hepburn Regional Park instead of burning off.
The organisation met with residents and the Hepburn Shire Council earlier in the year to discuss options for the site's clean up after residents had expressed concern about the affect burn-offs would have on tourism in the region.
FFM Vic Regional Manager Forest and Fire Operations, Peter Kambouris said while planned burning would continue to be used, the absence of bark fuels in the area meant burning could be avoided in this instance.
The move come less than three weeks after Emergency Management Commissioner Craig Lapsley urged all regional Victorians to clean up ahead of the summer fire season.

Real needs sidelined,2015,05,"The wave of articles, such as ""Direct Action could be converted to real policy"" (AFR, April 29), echo the story of little Johnnie. His mum came into his room to find he had ripped up paper and scattered pieces across the room. She asked, ""What are you doing?"" He replied, ""Keeping the elephants away."" She said, ""But there are no elephants here."" He said, ""See, it's working.""
So as banknotes continue to be torn up to fight the red herring of ""carbon"", a will-'o-the-wisp imaginary elephant, real issues are sidelined - punitive taxation, inadequate infrastructure (roads, bridges, dams, ports), hopeless town planning, insufficient drought, flood and forest-fire proofing - and remain underfunded or unfunded. Where are our priorities?

A price for bush living,2016,01,"Bushfires are inevitable and necessary for our particular type of flora, so there needs to be fires from time to time. People and property do not need to suffer destruction or death, if the powers that be enforce some rules about how people live in the bush. It seems that we need a fuel exclusion zone of some size around all towns, hamlets and houses in fire risk areas.
This raises the question: why should the house owners who make the logical decision to live in areas that are not in a non-defendable fuel and forest fire area, pay a royalty on insurance to support all those who don't?
I think it would make more sense for the government to clear the fuel away and let the people who still wish to live in the bush pay their own way. Thus leaving more money in the pockets of the logical majority.
