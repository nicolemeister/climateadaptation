""We are proud to align with One Tree Planted in restoration and replanting,"" explained Katie Sadler, Brand Manager.
""As a leading producer of Oregon Pinot Noir, and with the recent fires across the west coast and in Firesteed's backyard of the Willamette Valley close to our hearts, it was important to us to find a partner that would allow us to give back to the environment in the Pacific Northwest and beyond,"" explained Katie Sadler, Brand Manager for Firesteed.
The inaugural year of partnership includes a $10,000 donation that will help sponsor a total of five regional tree planting projects occurring in Colorado, Michigan, and Oregon. Elements of these projects include biodiversity &amp; habitat restoration, forest fire restoration, watershed restoration, and climate stability.
""With One Tree Planted, we were able to work closely with them to hand select projects to support in Firesteed's home State of Oregon, as well as other key regions, and we are proud to be part of these tree plantings going on now through 2021."" said Sadler. ""Looking ahead, we hope to expand our partnership with One Tree Planted and our contributions to these important projects.""
Firesteed was founded in 1992 and is dedicated to producing distinctive wines showcasing select vineyards spanning Oregon's most desirable winegrowing regions. Its Erratic Oaks Estate Vineyard was planted in 2006 and is named for the erratically shaped oak tree and its branches at the top elevation of the vineyard. Erratic Oaks Vineyard was both LIVE and Salmon Safe certified in 2020 and is a primary source for Firesteed's nationally distributed Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, and Riesling. It is in the spirit of our evergreen roots in Oregon, as well as our dedication to being stewards of the environment in the vineyard and beyond, that Firesteed is proud to partner with One Tree Planted and its cause.

CWU RESEARCHERS STUDY REGIONAL POLLUTION USING ICE CORE FROM NORTH CASCADES,2020,06,"ELLENSBURG, Wash., June 18 -- Central Washington University issued the following news release:
Using ice core samples retrieved from the South Cascade Glacier, CWU researchers have been able to reconstruct black carbon concentrations in the atmosphere spanning the period 1840-1991. Ice cores provide invaluable information that is used to determine past climate and environmental conditions.
""This is only the second study to publish a deep ice core record from the lower 48 states,"" said Susan Kaspari, CWU geological sciences professor, who led the research. ""It's unusual to get valuable environmental records from glaciers that are low elevation, but the black carbon record is less affected by melt, so the record stayed well preserved. We were also really lucky to be able to date the core well. One of the ways we dated the ice core was from an ash horizon from the 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption.""
Black carbon, also referred to as soot, comes from gas and diesel engines, coal-fired power plants, wildfires, and other sources. It's a major component of air pollution and an important contributor to climate change.
Kaspari and her team found that black carbon concentrations were highest during the period 1940-1960 when black carbon was 16 times higher than during pre-industrial times. The dramatic increase is attributed to domestic coal burning and forest fire emissions during those two-decades.
Kaspari and previous CWU Master of Science student Dan Pittenger, the journal article's co-author, drill a shallow ice core on South Cascade Glacier in 2014.Interestingly, the South Cascade ice core showed the period of peak black carbon concentrations in Washington was later than other regions that industrialized earlier, such as the United States' East Coast and Europe due to the relatively small population in the Evergreen State before World War II.
The ice core from the South Cascade Glacier, a small valley glacier in the North Cascades Range, was collected by United States Geological Survey scientists in 1994 and was stored at the National Ice Core Laboratory until 2013 when Kaspari and her team gained access to it.
""We're also using the ice core record to tell us about the factors contributing to glacier and snowmelt in the region,"" she pointed. ""When black carbon is deposited on snow and glacier surfaces, it darkens the surface and causes more energy from the sun to be absorbed, leading to faster melt.""
The CWU research is gaining national attention. It will be published in the June 16 issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres.

Wildfire danger diminished,2020,04,"April 21--     Apr. 21--A damp winter and early spring has western North Carolina in good shape as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows the region has no instances of drought.
That's also good news for N.C. Forest Service firefighters as the risk of wildfire continues to decrease.
A ban on open burning issued April 3 because of hazardous forest-fire conditions was lifted Monday, and the process for obtaining a burn permit is again open. While burn permits are available, state officials are asking people to be aware of the risks when burning yard debris and to consider putting it off through the end of May because careless burning is a leading cause of wildfires in the state, Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said in a press release.
""Recent rainfall across the state, especially in our western counties, has helped with dry conditions, but it is important to remember that we are still in the midst of spring wildfire season and the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Troxler said. ""Preventing escaped debris burns is something each of us can do to protect our communities and our first responders.""
Burn permits are available only online because all Forest Service offices are closed to the public because of COVID-19. Burn permits issued before the ban went into effect on April 3 were canceled, so residents who had one of those permits now have to obtain a new one before burning.
The National Weather Service's spring outlook shows an increased likelihood of above-normal temperatures through the end of May, bringing with them the slightly increased chance of above-normal rainfall. That continues a trend over the last six months of above-normal rainfall over the central and western parts of the state.
According to Forest Service data, wind speeds of more than 10 miles per hour, a relative humidity of less than 25 percent and temperatures above 60 degrees greatly influence the behavior of fire in the Blue Ridge Escarpment.
Through the first 20 days of April, the Forest Service has fought 496 fires that burned more than 1,000 acres. So far this year, NCFS has documented 1,420 fires covering 6,382.4 acres.

MEMBER OF TIMBER POACHING GROUP THAT SET OLYMPIC NATIONAL FOREST WILDFIRE SENTENCED TO 2 1/2 YEARS IN PRISON,2020,09,"TACOMA, Wash., Sept. 21 -- The U.S. Department of Justice's U.S. Attorney's office for Western District of Washington issued the following press release:
One of two men charged in a scheme to steal maple wood that resulted in a massive 2018 forest fire on the Olympic Peninsula was sentenced to prison today in U.S. District Court in Tacoma, announced U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran. SHAWN EDWARD WILLIAMS, 49, was sentenced to 30 months in prison and three years of supervised release for theft of public property and setting timber afire. At the sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge Benjamin H. Settle said that ""the consequences of your actions . . . resulted in horrendous consequences to the forests.""
According to records filed in the case, between April and August 2018, lead defendant Justin Andrew Wilke conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal. In July 2018, just days after his release from state prison, WILLIAMS joined the conspiracy, helping Wilke remove maple from the National Forest and transporting it with Wilke to a mill in Tumwater, Washington. The type of maple harvested by the defendants is highly prized and used to produce musical instruments.
On August 3, 2018, the group decided to cut a maple tree that contained a wasp's nest near the base of the tree. To remove the nest, the group sprayed insecticide and gasoline on the nest and base of the tree and then lit the nest on fire. The group failed to extinguish the fire, which developed into a wildfire later named the ""Maple Fire."" The Maple Fire consumed more than 3,300 acres between August and November 2018 and cost approximately $4.2 million to contain. WILLIAMS did not himself set the fire, but was present when others set the fire.
WILLIAMS pleaded guilty in December 2019.
In their sentencing memo, prosecutors highlighted the danger of Wilke and WILLIAMS's conduct. ""Forest fires present a dire and growing threat in this region. They destroy our forests, poison our air, and endanger responders, local residents, recreationalists, and wildlife. When this fire occurred in early August 2018, the Puget Sound region was (as it is today) already experiencing significant smoke from existing wildfires, and the high risk of fire was evident to everyone in Western Washington. Despite this atmosphere, Williams participated in taking the extreme risk of setting fire to a portion of a tree-deep in the forest, in mid-summer. The consequences of that decision-thousands of acres burned, millions of dollars in containment costs, and the release of huge amounts of smoke-were easily foreseeable.""
The case was investigated by the United States Forest Service. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Will Dreher.

Planet Alaska : Ten lessons from the fireweed,2022,01,"By Yéilk' Vivian Mork
Yes, I'm thinking about fireweed in the middle of winter. In these dark times, I close my eyes and see fuchsia blossoms buzzing with bumblebees. 2021 was the second year we've been living through this pandemic, and it's been hard. I've been feeling this sense of languishing, so I know you've probably been feeling it too. We are grieving. We've been sick and we've lost friends or family, our elders. Our jobs might've changed, our business shut down. Looking forward to a new year is hard for many of us. There's a lot of anxiety. This brings me back to the fireweed. I'm thinking about fireweed because fireweed gives me hope.
Fireweed is a gift from Tlingit Aaní. In our Lingít language it's called lóol. I look to Tlingit Aaní to help heal, to enliven, to balance my life so this leads me to consider the lessons of the fireweed. What lessons can this flower offer us as we reflect on 2021 and move forward into 2022?
Preparing: As snow keeps falling, we're not thinking about what the plants are doing in the winter, but the fireweed is there preparing for the next year. It's ever-present. It's still there under three feet of snow. The fireweed plant is an expert at preparing. This is one of the most important lessons we receive from this plant. We often think about other seasons as times to prepare for winter, but winter is also a time to prepare for our upcoming busy seasons. Fireweed tea is made from the leaves. High in vitamins A and C and there's an art to fermenting and preparing the tea for use in winter. If you're enjoying fireweed tea in the winter, you've practiced preparedness.
Growth and Tolerance: Fireweed grows along our roadsides, in disturbed areas, in our logged forests, along the borders of meadows, forests, and streams. It expands in a large and long-lived structure of shallow roots. It's tolerant of acidic, neutral, and alkaline soils. We can surely learn growth and tolerance from the fireweed. This winter, let's ask ourselves where we need to grow? In the fireweed's world there's always room for growth.
Beauty: Fireweed are determined to share their beauty. A káx yan aydél wé tl'átgi — We are stewards of the air land and sea. When we walk through a field of fireweed, we sense that the beauty in the moment is just for us, that this plant was created so we could share the world with bees and beauty. We are a part of that beauty.
Persistence: You know why I like fireweed? Because they're one of the first plants to grow up after the land has burned from forest fire. They grow in adversity where nothing else does. Yee gu.aa yáx x'wán. Be strong and have courage. Be a Fireweed!
Reclaim a place and space: Fireweed loves open spaces. It's the plant that returns and reclaims a place and beautifies it. One single plant can produce 80,000 seeds. It doesn't stop feeding places even in winter. We humans can claim a winter space too. Make space in the winter for art, storytelling, renewing relationships, planning, or learning something new. Make space for taking care of our Elders. Reclaim your winter space as a place for dreams.
Roots: Consider where we come from: our clans, the land, our ancestors. Toowú klagé haa t'aakx'í, ka haa naax sateeyí, ka haa kusteeyí. Have pride in our family and our clan and our traditions. I'm both Tlingit and Hawaiian. Alaska and Hawaii are two of my favorite places in the world and my favorite fireweed flavor combo is fireweed and dragon fruit. Fireweed teaches us to be diverse, to know who we are. Our roots are important, they're what holds us to place, and form our first relationships, which is to the land.
Endurance: Over these last few years, we've witnessed how climate change is affecting the fireweed. But still, they endure. Yee toowú klatseen. Be strong. I've seen some strange alien-looking fireweed plants with thicker stalks. I've seen fireweed ""bushes"" rather than single stalk plants. I saw a fireweed that had more than 20 new start tips growing along the entire stalk. I've never seen a single fireweed with that many tips. I've seen fireweed stalks with bent shapes, and some with curled ends, and square stalks (not round), and some with leaves bunched together. But still, they endure.
Community: We are like fireweed rhizomes. We are community so we must to tend to our community. Wooch eenx haa isteeyí, wooch dusxáni, wooch éet wutudasheeyí. When we're together, we love each other, we help each other. Our community is resilient like the fireweed. In fact, fragmenting the rhizomes stimulates the shoots to grow. By harvesting fireweed, we are tending to our community because we're going to make something with it and gift it away. We're also helping the plant community flourish. This tending to our community is important, especially in the winter. We are rhizomes growing from roots, reaching out together to make a forest of fireweed.
Peace: Whenever I walk into a field of fireweed, I sense peace. Tlél kútx i yáa wdawóodlik—Have patience. This past year, in the moments the rain stopped, I walked my dog around the neighborhood and through the fireweed meadows. I picked fireweed blossoms and dried some and infused them in honey. I picked fireweed and brewed a mixed tea of s'ikshaldéen (Labrador tea), blueberries, thimbleberry and ginger.
Healing: Winter can be healing. For our minds it can be a time of reflection. For our bodies it provides rest. Fireweed medicine is good medicine that can assist us. Fireweed can be used as a decongestion for coughs and asthma, ulcers, gastritis, and colitis. Fireweed also has anti-inflammatory properties and has been used for arthritis and rheumatism. Tlingit Aaní provides many healing plants for us.
Fireweed (Chamerion angustifolium) offers us lesson at every stage including the dormant stage as it prepares for spring. Fireweed is a member of the Evening Primrose family (Onagraceae). It's a perennial growing from 4 to 6 feet high up to 9 feet high. It's a valued food for humans and animals too like deer, moose, caribou, rabbits, and muskrats.
Fireweed is my favorite harbinger of spring and it's one of the best first spring vegetables. As soon as the snow is gone, look for it. A lot of people don't notice when fireweed shoots come up, and by the time they do, its past the edible stage. Fireweed stalks, leaves, and blossoms are good to combine with other plants and foods. I've made fireweed scones, honey, jelly, smoothies, muffins, sauces, tea, lemonade, syrup and dressings. Fireweed shoots can be pickled and steamed, and the buds can be added to salads or pickled as capers. I make teas from dried or fermented leaves.
This winter, as we inhabit this winter space, as we layer on socks and long underwear, as we clomp in our cleats across ice and shovel the driveway yet again, think of the fireweed lessons. Fireweed lessons include preparedness, growth and tolerance, beauty, persistence, reclamation, roots, endurance, community, peace, and healing. Maybe we can all try to be a bit of fireweed.

"AF PHYSICIAN ADVISES, 'FOLLOW YOUR NOSE' TO EARLY COVID-19 DIAGNOSIS",2020,04,"The following information was released by the U.S. Air Force Air Material Command:
By Gina Marie Giardina, Air Force Research Laboratory
An ear, nose and throat surgeon in the Air Force Research Laboratory assembled a multi-national team of nine other medical professionals to consolidate their front-line observations and recommendations regarding early symptoms of patients infected with COVID-19, in an article that was published online April 15 in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.
Col. (Dr.) Michael Xydakis, who works in AFRLs 711th Human Performance Wing, and this team state that during this pandemic, the sudden onset of difficulty with smell (anosmia) or taste (dysgeusia), with no other nasal congestion or other symptoms, should cause healthcare providers to exercise increased caution.
New onset anosmia likely serves as a reliable proxy marker of infection, explained Xydakis. Diagnosing asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers early and advising self-quarantine is essential to control the spread of this virus. By diagnosing patients infected by COVID-19 early in their disease process, we are essentially going after the kindling before it becomes a forest fire.
Aimed at strengthening the COVID-19 diagnostic criteria for healthcare providers, the article offers recommendations to those treating, testing and diagnosing patients presenting with rapid onset difficulty with smell or taste.
""Most concerning,"" said Xydakis, ""is the recent and compelling evidence that viral shedding and transmission may occur in asymptomatic carriers or mildly symptomatic patients, and the current screening processes for detecting COVID-19 do not include testing taste or smell functions.""
The Lancet Infectious Diseases is recognized as being a global and authoritative forum for infectious diseases research and opinion, explained Xydakis, so we hope this information is rapidly disseminated to other health care providers.
Included in the article are recommendations for healthcare providers with patients who report a sudden loss of smell or taste, but do not have nasal congestion or other symptoms that accompany allergies or the common cold.
The Lancet can be accessed at <url normalizedValue=""https://www.thelancet.com/coronavirus"">https://www.thelancet.com/coronavirus</url>.
Healthcare providers should have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in patients who present with new onset anosmia as the only symptom, Xydakis said.
The clinical research that we are conducting in AFRL is intrinsically translational and, in a time of crisis, offers the shortest path for providing senior leadership with actionable, decision-quality, operational information said Xydakis. The same holds true for the national and international partnerships we build along the way."

Also, remember to recreate responsibly on the Forest by following the tips below:
* Dispersed Camping - When camping outside of developed campgrounds, remember that creating new campsites kills vegetation and leads to soil erosion. If possible, use an existing site, or pick a site where vegetation is absent.
It In, Pack It Out - Inspect the campsite, picnic area, or rest site for trash or spilled foods. Pack out all trash, leftover food, and litter, leaving the place cleaner than you found it.
* Answering Nature's Call - Find a spot at least 200 feet from any water source. Dig a hole 6-8 inches deep and bury human waste. Pack out used toilet paper and feminine products to prevent animals from digging them up.
Be Considerate of Others - Respect each other and yield on the trail. Step to the downhill side of the trail when encountering pack stock. Take breaks and camp away from trails and other visitors. Avoid loud voices or noises and let nature's sounds prevail.
* Pets in the Forest - Pets should be leashed in developed recreation sites, including campgrounds, picnic areas, and trailheads. Along the trail, there may be additional signs instructing pet owners to keep pets on-leash. Remember to pick up and pack out pet waste.
* Respect Access - Stay out of closed areas. Do not trespass and do not cross private lands unless given permission. Leave gates as you found them, whether opened or closed. Do not cut fences as they keep livestock confined. Remember it is illegal to deface or destroy trees, signs, outbuildings, or other objects on federal lands.
* Ride Ethically - Always stay on designated Forest roads and trails as they are designed using industry best practices to be environmentally sustainable. Go over, not around, obstacles to avoid widening trails. Remember it is illegal to ride cross-country on NFS lands, and motorized vehicles and bicycles are not allowed in wilderness areas.

Ukrainian officials: Fires out near Chernobyl nuclear plant,2020,04,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian emergency officials said Tuesday they have extinguished forest fires in the radiation-contaminated area near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but acknowledged that grass was still smoldering in some areas.
Hundreds of firefighters backed by aircraft have been battling several forest fires around Chernobyl for the past 10 days. They contained the initial blazes, but new fires raged closer to the decommissioned plant.
Emergencies Service chief Mykola Chechetkin reported to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that rains helped firefighters put out the flames, but acknowledged that it would take a few more days to extinguish smoldering grass.
Chechetkin said emergency workers have prevented the fire from engulfing radioactive waste depots and other facilities in Chernobyl.
The 2,600-square-kilometer (1,000-square-mile) Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was established after the 1986 disaster at the plant that sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over much of Europe. The zone is largely unpopulated, although about 200 people have remained despite orders to leave.
Ukraine's emergencies service said radiation levels in the capital, Kyiv, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the plant, were within norms after the forest fires.
President Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians not to panic.
""We all remember the lessons of April 26, 1986,"" he said in an online statement Tuesday. ""No one is hiding the truth from you. Right now the truth is that the situation there is under control.""
On Monday, activists warned that the blazes were getting dangerously close to waste storage facilities.
Yaroslav Yemelyanenko, a member of the public council under the state agency in charge of the closed zone around the plant, said one fire was raging within 2 kilometers (about 1.2 miles) from one of the radioactive waste depots.
Last week, officials said they tracked down a person suspected of triggering the blaze by setting dry grass on fire in the area. The 27-year-old man said he burned grass ""for fun"" and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to spread quickly.
On Monday, police said that another local resident burned waste and accidentally set dry grass ablaze, triggering another devastating forest fire. They said he failed to report the fire to the authorities.
Blazes in the area have been a regular occurrence. They often start when residents set dry grass on fire in the early spring - a widespread practice in Ukraine, Russia and some other ex-Soviet nations that often leads to devastating forest fires."

Canada's airports expect massive fee increases and service reductions,2020,10,"U.S., Oct. 28 -- The failure of government and the airline industry to embrace a holistic approach to aviation support during the COVID-19 pandemic is leaving the regional and community airports of this country on the brink of financial collapse and airlines facing massive rates and fees increases in 2021.
Despite a dramatic decline in airline passenger traffic since the COVID-19 pandemic began in March, Canada's smaller airports have carried the financial burden of maintaining their runways, air terminals, and emergency services without access to any previous or current financial aid.
When governments and the public hear of dire situations in the aviation sector the focus tends to be on the major airlines and the major airports that connect Canadians in large urban areas to transborder and international destinations, and that is frustrating to the Regional Community Airports of Canada (RCAC).
""For all Canadians outside of our large urban centers it is regional and local airports that connect the vast regions of our country for essential services, and business and leisure travel"", says Brian Grant, Chair of the RCAC.
""These smaller airports play a critical role in providing remote access and a quality of life that all Canadians expect. Movement of critical food supplies, emergency health care, essential cargo, emergency evacuation, forest fire fighting services are just a few examples of what regional and community airports deliver in addition to passenger air travel"".
According to the RCAC all airports have been hit with severe reductions in revenues and reduced or canceled air service leaving them unable to meet the costs of operating the airports unless governments step in with direct financial support soon.
""2020 has been a year of deep staffing cuts and reducing services, under the pressure of exceptional revenue loses, to meet fixed operational and safety costs dictated by government regulation along with new pandemic related costs to ensure the safety and confidence of travelers"", continues Mr. Grant. ""In 2021 these airports are estimating upwards of 45-60% increases in rates and fees charged to airlines and passengers to continue operations as they exist today. In most cases reserve funds have been depleted and the only possible reductions left are closures of airport infrastructure"".
Recommendations highlighted by the national organization for effective support include:
Ensure regional and community airports' eligibility to all federal COVID assistance programs (i.e. emergency wage subsidy, debit relief and loans programs, and rent subsidy etc.) regardless of governance or ownership model.
Stabilize the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy for airports to not less than 75% for 2021 to protect the employment capabilities of these airports for employees.
Provide financial assistance to cover fixed operating costs at 2019 levels to eliminate deficits and avoid rates and fees increases in order to bolster airline and travel activity.
Increase Airport Capital Assistance Program funding to $95 mil annually (an industry request prior to the COVID-19 pandemic dating back more than two years).
Adjust the federal contribution limit to the ACAP to not less than 75% of eligible project costs and relax the eligibility requirement of commercial schedule passenger service for current eligible airports for 2021 through 2025, to ensure the protection and maintenance of essential infrastructure and equipment during the post-pandemic recovery period.

Air quality unhealthy as wildfire smoke rolls in,2020,09,"Sept. 14--     Sep. 14--It has been impossible to see even the outline of Big Mountain from downtown Whitefish since wildfire smoke rolled into the area over the weekend.
Wildfire smoke form Idaho, Washington and Oregon has been moving east, impacting Montana's air quality, according to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality. Air quality is expected to worsen as smoke continues to push eastward across the state.
On Tuesday morning the air quality for Flathead County was listed as unhealthy meaning that people with respiratory or heart disease, the elderly and children, should avoiding outdoor activity. Everyone else should avoid prolonged exertion while outside.
The Flathead City-County Health Department issued a notice encouraging residents to regularly monitor air quality conditions and restrict outdoor activity accordingly.
The county has an air quality monitoring station in Columbia Falls and results of the monitoring are posted hourly on the health department's air quality website at <url normalizedValue=""http://svc.mt.gov/deq/todaysair/"">http://svc.mt.gov/deq/todaysair/</url>.
Air quality ratings include good, moderate, unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy and hazardous.
When the air quality is anything other than good, folks should watch for symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath and reduce exertion, according to the health department.
Smoke is made up of a mixture of gases and fine particles when wood and other organic materials burn, according to the health department, and the biggest public health threat from smoke is fine particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs causing a range of health problems.
Those most at risk for health issues are the elderly, children and those with respiratory issues or heart disease, the health department notes.
An air quality alert was issued for much of the state through Tuesday morning due to the wildfire smoke.
Smoky conditions are expected to continue for the Northern Rockies through the week, the National Weather Service in Missoula said.
There's expected to be a break form the smoke by the weekend, the Weather Service predicts, when a relatively moist Pacific storm system is expected to move over the Northern Rockies.
""A change in the weather pattern will occur Friday into Saturday,"" the Weather Service said Tuesday. ""An upper low will move through the Northern Rockies and provide widespread rains.""
The relief from smoky conditions may not last long as weather forests are indicating a high pressure ridge over California will transport smoke from California and Oregon wildfires once again across the region next week.
The fire danger in Flathead County remains very high.
Interagency fire managers are asking the public to remain careful when out recreating this fall.
""It's important for everyone locally to do their part to prevent human-caused fire starts,"" said acting Flathead National Forest Fire Management Officer Andy Huntsberger. ""We need every resource available to help out our neighbors, and the more we can do to limit our local fire response, the better.""

"Patterson AFB Physician Advises, 'Follow Your Nose' to Early COVID-19 Diagnosis",2020,04,"The U.S. Air Force Wright-Patterson Air Force Base issued the following news:
Col. (Dr.) Michael Xydakis, an ear, nose and throat surgeon in the Air Force Research Laboratory, assembled a multi-national team of nine other medical professionals, who consolidated their front-line observations and recommendations regarding early symptoms of patients infected with COVID-19 in an article that was published online April 15 in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.
Xydakis, who works in AFRL's 711th Human Performance Wing, and this team state that during this pandemic, the sudden onset of difficulty with smell (anosmia) or taste (dysgeusia), with no other nasal congestion or other symptoms, should cause healthcare providers to exercise increased caution.
""New onset anosmia likely serves as a reliable proxy marker of infection,"" explained Xydakis. ""Diagnosing asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers early and advising self-quarantine is essential to control the spread of this virus. By diagnosing patients infected by COVID-19 early in their disease process, we are essentially going after the kindling before it becomes a forest fire.""
Aimed at strengthening the COVID-19 diagnostic criteria for healthcare providers, the article offers recommendations to those treating, testing and diagnosing patients presenting with rapid onset difficulty with smell or taste.
""Most concerning,"" said Xydakis, ""is the recent and compelling evidence that viral shedding and transmission may occur in asymptomatic carriers or mildly symptomatic patients, and the current screening processes for detecting COVID-19 do not include testing taste or smell functions.""
The Lancet Infectious Diseases is recognized as being a global and authoritative forum for infectious diseases research and opinion, explained Xydakis, so we hope this information is rapidly disseminated to other health care providers.
Included in the article are recommendations for healthcare providers with patients who report a sudden loss of smell or taste, but do not have nasal congestion or other symptoms that accompany allergies or the common cold.
Healthcare providers should have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in patients who present with new onset anosmia as the only symptom, Xydakis said.
""The clinical research that we are conducting in AFRL is intrinsically translational and, in a time of crisis, offers the shortest path for providing senior leadership with actionable, decision-quality, operational information"" said Xydakis. ""The same holds true for the national and international partnerships we build along the way.""

Trump Blames California for Fires. He Should Check to See Whose Land They're On.,2020,09,How Washington politics and blame-shifting let the forest fire problem get out of control.
Ukrainian officials: Fires out near Chernobyl nuclear plant,2020,04,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian emergency officials said Tuesday they have extinguished forest fires in the radiation-contaminated area near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but acknowledged that grass was still smoldering in some areas.
Hundreds of firefighters backed by aircraft have been battling several forest fires around Chernobyl for the past 10 days. They contained the initial blazes, but new fires raged closer to the decommissioned plant.
Emergencies Service chief Mykola Chechetkin reported to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that rains helped firefighters put out the flames, but acknowledged that it would take a few more days to extinguish smoldering grass.
Chechetkin said emergency workers have prevented the fire from engulfing radioactive waste depots and other facilities in Chernobyl.
The 2,600-square-kilometer (1,000-square-mile) Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was established after the 1986 disaster at the plant that sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over much of Europe. The zone is largely unpopulated, although about 200 people have remained despite orders to leave.
Ukraine's emergencies service said radiation levels in the capital, Kyiv, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the plant, were within norms after the forest fires.
President Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians not to panic.
""We all remember the lessons of April 26, 1986,"" he said in an online statement Tuesday. ""No one is hiding the truth from you. Right now the truth is that the situation there is under control.""
On Monday, activists warned that the blazes were getting dangerously close to waste storage facilities.
Yaroslav Yemelyanenko, a member of the public council under the state agency in charge of the closed zone around the plant, said one fire was raging within 2 kilometers (about 1.2 miles) from one of the radioactive waste depots.
Last week, officials said they tracked down a person suspected of triggering the blaze by setting dry grass on fire in the area. The 27-year-old man said he burned grass ""for fun"" and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to spread quickly.
On Monday, police said that another local resident burned waste and accidentally set dry grass ablaze, triggering another devastating forest fire. They said he failed to report the fire to the authorities.
Blazes in the area have been a regular occurrence. They often start when residents set dry grass on fire in the early spring - a widespread practice in Ukraine, Russia and some other ex-Soviet nations that often leads to devastating forest fires."

Presentation
LAWSON WINDER, VP &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, BOFA SECURITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Hello, everyone. In this segment, we will hear from the only uranium company presenting today. And it happens to be Cameco, the world's second largest producer of the metal used for fuel in reactors. And joining me from Cameco today is Senior Vice President and CFO, Grant Isaac. Grant, welcome to Miami. And I'll turn the podium over to you.
GRANT E. ISAAC, SENIOR VP &amp; CFO, CAMECO CORPORATION: Great. Thank you very much. If you don't mind, I'm just going to stay here. My tremendous laziness just keeps me right in this chair. It's a good spot to be. I'll make a few opening comments, but happy to go to your questions. At the beginning of that, I just want to, a bit of a shout-out to Lawson on the work that he's been doing in our space lately. It really is a good analysis of what's going on.
Ours is a market where the fundamentals were improving. I think a lot of people saw nuclear kind of regain its place in the policy toolbox because of the decarbonization push. A lot of question marks around supply because it turns out that markets work after years of pervasive low prices. There wasn't a lot of investment in capacity, and that was starting to build momentum.
And then everything kind of changed on February 24 when Russia invaded Ukraine. And now on top of that fundamental, we're going through an unprecedented geopolitical realignment in our market, which is just code for Western customers are looking to exclude Russia from their nuclear fuel procurement going forward. And Russia is a very big player in that part of our industry. I have no idea how everything is going to work out geopolitically. But I can say with confidence that we are extraordinarily well positioned in a market that's bifurcating. And there's more Western capacity required to meet Western demand.
So that's a really important dynamic going on. Hopefully, we can get into that in a little bit more detail. But just a final comment on how we're positioned. For us, the uranium isn't a spot market. It's not one where we see strong prices for spot conversions, spot enrichment, spot uranium and we rush forward to meet it. It's one where you need to secure homes for your planned production and then you make the right decision.
So for us, it's about marketing discipline. That continues. We have lots of customers interested in supply. We're looking for those terms and conditions that make sense for us. So marketing discipline then allows you to make the production decisions afterwards that make sense, the best and most economic way to fulfill it. And we're still in supply discipline mode despite how robust everything is looking. We haven't seen the procurement cycle yet to change those supply decisions. Maybe we could see ourselves there.
But the final piece I'll mention is just what's interesting is, we're talking about being on really the early innings of a contracting cycle. And we've never started one from such high prices already. Uranium term price starting with a 5. Conversion price has never been higher than it is today. SWU price is starting to approach historic highs. We've never launched a contracting cycle from a base of this stronger prices before. So lots to talk about in our industry, happy to take questions.
Questions and Answers
LAWSON WINDER: I'd share an interesting comment that I heard from a fuel buyer I spoke with 2 weeks ago. His comment was, as this contracting cycle unwinds, people like Cameco are going to be very well placed to enjoy spot markets. Next down would be the assets that had operated but are currently on care and maintenance. And next would be the developers. So I think Cameco is very well placed. But what I wanted to talk about was the last point you made, which is on contracting activity.
So with Q4 results, obviously, you guys had a very exciting announcement of 50 million pounds of new contracting. Q1, there was nothing. I mean, you and I both know that it is very lumpy and it tends not to come on a regular basis, but it certainly surprised a lot of market participants. What I wanted to get your perspective on was when do you expect contracting to come back in a very meaningful way. And I know it's very hard to define, but kind of walk us through your framework.
GRANT E. ISAAC: Yes. Good question. And here's our expectation. But one quick clarification, we contracted 40 million pounds in Q1. We just contracted it. And we're prepared to announce it in early February when we put out our Q4 release. So Q1 actually was one of our biggest contracting quarters ever.
So just a bit of history, in 2021, utilities were really paying attention to uranium supply. We saw a lot of uranium contracting going on because of that fundamental story that we were talking about. Us and our competitors in the industry were seeing a lot of interest in uranium. But that changed also on February 24. Utilities shifted their attention from where's my long-run uranium coming from to where's my enrichment and conversion going to come from?
Just a reminder, Russia, about 40% of the global enrichment capacity is Russian. About 30% of the global conversion capacity is Russian. They're about 14% of global supply of uranium. They're 50% of the secondary supplies in our market. So utilities turned their attention from where is the uranium coming from to starting to contract the enrichment service.
We saw a 40% jump in the enrichment price 2 weeks ago. It went from $72 per unit enriched to $120 per unit enriched. That reflects the panic that's setting in among those Western fuel buyers to secure the non-Russian source of enrichment. Once they have their enrichment lined up, they then have to turn their attention to, I need the feedstock. And so their next focus will be on the conversion sector, which is already pricing strong. We expect to see more strength in conversion. We provide conversion. We're the only North American converter right now operating.
And then they will return their attention to uranium because now you need the product to which you're going to apply these services. So February 24 was a bit of a change, and it really shifted attention downstream. And so uranium contracting will pick up again when they feel comfortable with their enrichment coverage and then their conversion coverage and then we'll see the return to the uranium demand in a big way.
LAWSON WINDER: A lot of great material there. I would like to touch on blue sky. So I often get the comment from investors that Cameco, an investment in Cameco is capped because of your contract book, which I would note, it only goes out 5 years. And I would also note fails to account for the fact that you're also not fully contracted on that contract book and then there's still all the contracting that you can do beyond the year 2025 where you provide that guidance. Could you walk us through sort of the theoretical capacity that Cameco has in still uncontracted material? And I know it's probably dangerous for you to throw percentages, but that type of thing, I think, really helps investors think about what the true blue sky upside is.
GRANT E. ISAAC: Yes. On that price sensitivity table, we have figured out that there's a lot of misunderstanding about how it's constructed. It only reflects our current committed sales, and we make no representation of an assumed production rate at certain spot prices. And so really, we vigorously retain 3 points of leverage to this market.
Number one is, we have a number of existing contracts that are market-related. And so as the uranium price goes up, we get the pickup of the higher prices in those existing contracts. They have a little bit of a kicker on them, too, in that utilities tend to be procyclical. In a rising uranium market, they flex up their contracts not flex down. The psychology there is the price is obviously rising because the product is getting scarce, I should flex up and take more of it. So market-related is our first point of leverage.
Second point of leverage is exactly what you talked about. It's the pounds we haven't sold yet. I mean, we are not trying to be sold out right now. We like to be covered in year. We like to have a good comfortable amount of coverage next year. And then we don't mind that uncommitted to fall off dramatically because we think that there's a better pricing environment for those pounds. And so take, for example, the extreme supply discipline at McArthur River. 115 million pounds left in the ground when uranium was $17.75 a pound. And now it's pricing at $50 a pound. That's a pretty good investment in supply discipline by leaving that material inventory into the ground.
So that's the second point of leverage, the pounds that haven't been sold and we're far from sold out. We're still in supply discipline mode. Yes, we're bringing McArthur back, but we're going to operate it at a lower than full capacity rate. And we're planning on bringing Cigar Lake back in 2024 as well because the procurement cycle isn't quite there yet. So we will run in 2024 on current plans at 40% below our productive capacity. We make no effort to sell the remaining 40% of supply. It's not our interest right now because we want to be leveraged to that market.
But there's a third piece of leverage that's really crucial too. And that is when utilities truly go into a security of supply driven mode reflected in the conversation you had with them. They don't turn to the greenfield projects and take a chance on schedule and risk. They turn to the incumbents that they already have contracts with and they say, look, I don't have time to start a brand-new RFP. I don't have time to launch a brand-new negotiation. We already have a purchase order. Let's just expand the volumes. So we vigorously protect the market-related leverage, the pounds we haven't sold yet and that incumbent advantage because we like to put that business into an up market, not a down market.
LAWSON WINDER: Fill in the blanks a little bit on the contract book beyond 2025. How far out does it go out and how quickly does it sort of fall off?
GRANT E. ISAAC: Well, we have about, in that contract table that we announced over the next 5 years, we have about 100 million pounds under contract. But then every year, we disclose that our entire book is about 150 million pounds. So we still have a lot of volume that's outside that 5-year window. We're starting to see in our market, began to see it last year, utilities started shifting their procurement back to a traditional mode. When the spot market was so horrendously oversupplied following Fukushima, the spot market became the home for a bunch of surplus production that didn't have a home. So it got dumped into the spot market in a low interest rate environment, utilities said to themselves, hey, I don't want to pay term prices for uranium. I want to pay spot prices forward. And so they were finding financial intermediaries to buy in the spot market, carry it on a carry trade and take it into the early part of term contracting, and this broke the term price.
The term price, instead of being anchored to production economics, was anchored to the forward curve of spot. Utilities then saw Sprott enter the market and start buying a lot of material. We bought a lot of material. The spot market became very, very thin. We actually entered backwardation. And as we entered backwardation, the most expensive pounds were the carry trade pounds. So the carry trade business basically dried up, then interest rates are starting to rise, which condemns the carry trade business going forward.
So utilities have gone back to taking bigger bites out of the market. So the tenor of the contracts have gone from 2 to 5 years, 2 to 7. Now we're seeing 2 to 10. The time frames are getting bigger. We had a contract that we announced in Q1 that was 2030 to 2040. So the window that utilities are looking at is getting bigger, reflecting their confidence in their reactor programs and volumes are going up. Not just because there's more years being added, but they're taking bigger bites out of the market. So no surprise, the underlying term price of uranium is back reflecting production economics as opposed to reflecting the carry trade on spot.
LAWSON WINDER: Well said. Now a really interesting point in your Q1 results was the delayed material from Inkai. And I mean, you cited insurance concerns, but also other concerns. Maybe you could just speak to that other part. And also, why is there a delay in arranging an alternate route to get that material from Kazakhstan to the rest of the world, aside from Russia, because my understanding was you guys had already established that route. It was Caspian, Georgia, Azerbaijan into Black Sea.
GRANT E. ISAAC: Yes. So we have a joint venture with Kazatomprom. It's an extraordinary joint venture with a great partner and a partner that's doing a tremendous job in a very difficult situation. And they can explain it better than we can for sure.
From a Cameco perspective, we're very, very risk averse, and that's a part of the world we don't understand as well as our joint venture partner does. Our joint venture partner might look at forest fire risk in Northern Saskatchewan and say, that's crazy. Well, we can manage forest fire risk. We look at risk in that part of the world and we just don't understand it as well, and we're very risk averse. And so we've taken the position for a variety of reasons that range from the ability to secure insurance, the predictability of the transport system. We don't want to use the Russian route. And we've also taken the position, we shouldn't use the Russian route. And that is the exclusive route for getting Central Asian supply out of that part of the world.
There is an alternative route that's been established. It's been used by our joint venture partner. They've successfully used it. An Inkai shipment has actually successfully used it last year. But we just put that disclosure in because it's not clear to us. We can't predict at the moment when that route is going to be available for us. And so we just said, we're going to leave our material in-country. Now the good news for Cameco, we've got production sources in other parts of the world. We've got our long-term purchase program. We've got an inventory. It's a minor problem for us. It's just time and money is all it will take to get access to it.
But if you think about it from a utility point of view, it's actually a growing uncertainty and potential problem for the nuclear fuel supply because a lot of conversion facilities in the world require that material from Central Asia. So if there's delays, that's just going to delay the supply chain, which with the tightness in the market, you wonder how much it can tolerate those delays. So for us, it's a manageable problem. It's systemically a bigger challenge for the industry. It just reflects a different risk tolerance that we have because we don't understand that part of the world as well as others do.
LAWSON WINDER: That's an excellent perspective. And I'll leave it there on that topic because I think we're going to get into a bit more tomorrow on our uranium plant panel at 10 a.m. What I would like to do is ask about conversion because that is something very specific to Cameco. So one thing, conversion prices, as you mentioned, are very strong, possibly at all-time highs. What do you see as the risk or something that could actually cause that to correct? But in the current environment, how does Cameco take advantage of that?
And then secondly, in relation to that, the World Nuclear Association publishes this data on capacity and capacity utilization. They always show you guys using about 70% of your UF6 capacity utilization. Is it possible for you to displace what the rest of that unused capacity is currently being used for to take advantage of the higher prices?
GRANT E. ISAAC: Yes. A lot to unpack there. Conversion is the tightest part of the nuclear fuel cycle at the moment. Western demand for conversion, just throw a few numbers at you, 35,000 tonnes of conversion is needed. Western supply is around 20,000 tonnes. So there's a 15,000 tonne gap.
On top of that, the enrichers need more conversion because while they're going to add more capacity to displace the Russian capacity, one way they can get more enrichment out of their plant is to what's called overfeed it, which is just code for they need more UF6 going into it, use it less efficiently. And that's another 6,000 tonnes on top of that. But the good news over time for the conversion industry is, well, there's a plant in the U.S. that's at 0 today. And it will come back to 7,000 tonnes, probably 10,000. There's a plant in France that's running at half capacity and it will go up to 15,000 tonnes. We're at 12,500. And the enricher overfeed will only last until they install new capacity.
So on balance, Western conversion to 2027, 2028 could catch up or there'll just be a small gap. So for us, it isn't about jamming a whole bunch of new production into the conversion space because we live through the times when it was oversupplied and we were running our plant at half capacity. So the goal for us is to fill it up, get those margins as good as we can, lock in these historic prices, but not forget that there's capacity that needs to come back and will come back with some of these restarts.
LAWSON WINDER: Okay. That's great perspective. Thank you for the conversation today. Unfortunately, we are out of time. So thank you all for being here listening to our presentation, and thank you, Grant, for being here.
GRANT E. ISAAC: Great. Thank you.

Virginia Tech: Taking Action Against Harassment in the Field,2022,01,"(TNSjou) -- Virginia Tech issued the following news:
By Jenny Kincaid Boone
For Virginia Tech students who study forestry, the outdoors is the classroom.
Piling into university vans and heading out into the woods to study trees, wildflowers, and more is what they do, often several times a week. It's an essential component of lab instruction for many Virginia Tech faculty in the College of Natural Resources and Environment, including Carolyn Copenheaver, an associate professor who teaches forest ecology.
But because these outdoor labs don't take place in a traditional classroom, students often let their guards down.
A few years ago, Copenheaver was approached by female students sharing their experiences of harassment in the field.
That's when she realized that something had to change.
Fast forward a few years, and Copenheaver now is leading a charge to address sexual misconduct and harassment in her courses, which all involve field labs. In the process, she has become an outspoken resource for helping other faculty to maneuver this delicate topic.
In October, Copenheaver, along with three other colleagues, published the results of numerous focus group discussions with faculty at universities across the country. The discussions centered on how to address and prevent sexual harassment in higher education agriculture and natural resources programs with outdoor lab spaces.
The findings, which outline a list of best practices for faculty, were published in the North American College and Teachers of Agriculture journal: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nactateachers.org"">https://www.nactateachers.org</url>/
The work was funded by a USDA Higher Education Challenge Grant, and Copenheaver said she hopes to apply for another grant to continue this work.
She also has spoken with several professional groups about the work.
For many years, even during her own time in college, Copenheaver said she normalized some of the behavior and language that she heard in her forestry classes. She chalked up the language to the fact that the majority of students in those courses are male and some of the words were spoken as jokes. For example, in some of her classes for forestry majors at Virginia Tech, there may be only one female student among an all-male roster.
Copenheaver herself was one of few females in her master's and doctoral programs, and she now recalls being a victim of sexual harassment. She heard certain language so often that she assumed it was what women had to endure in her field.
""I didn't even know that's what it was,"" she said.
Her work over the last few years has opened her eyes to changes that she needs to make to ensure that her students feel secure.
""They [students] know how to behave in a classroom; they've been doing it since kindergarten,"" Copenheaver said. ""But we're driving to the woods, and people's informal behavior comes out. It's my job to police their language, because that's still part of the class, and I still have to create a safe space for all of my students.""
The focus groups outlined a list of best practices for faculty to address sexual harassment upfront with their students. This includes stating rules in syllabi, bringing up the topic and expectations several times with the class, and establishing a laboratory code of conduct.
Others who worked with Copenheaver for the project include Adam Coates, an assistant professor of forest fire ecology and management at Virginia Tech; Adam Downing, a Virginia Cooperative Extension agent for agriculture, natural resources, and forestry in the Northern District; and Saskia van de Gevel, department chair and professor of geography and planning at Appalachian State University.
After talking with faculty from at least 10 universities, Downing said it was clear that many found it difficult to talk about sexual harassment in front of their students.
""There are words in this realm that people don't want to say out loud,"" he said. ""We need to be able to do that to have meaningful conversations. I think just looking for opportunities to have these conversations, not just checking the boxes that 'I got my Title IX training done,' would have some good outcomes.""
After hearing from her students, Copenheaver sought help about what she could do and change from Anthony Scott, chief of inclusion and belonging in the Division of Student Affairs at Virginia Tech.
Scott said that it is essential that faculty address these issues in front of their students and see this as an important teaching opportunity.
""We are supposed to be preparing these students to go out in the world and make a difference,"" he said. ""We can no longer continue to suggest through our silence that issues of equity and diversity and inclusion and belonging, that these issues aren't just as important as figuring out a mathematical formula.""
In the fall semester, Copenheaver initiated conversations about sexual harassment with her students and included explicit expectations in her syllabi. She will continue doing this going forward.
Copenheaver's research into these topics is unique to many agriculture and natural resources programs, said Wendy Fink, who is executive director of the academic programs section, and assistant vice president of food, agriculture, and natural resources at the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. Copenheaver presented her work for a subcommittee of the APLU this past summer.
""I think her research is very much needed in the fields of agriculture and natural resources,"" Fink said. ""Raising awareness on how to prevent sexual harassment or assault, including through bystander training and creating a culture that encourages reporting, remains critical to creating safer working and learning environments for everyone.""
Natalie Hedrick, a junior who is majoring in forestry at Virginia Tech, said she appreciates that Copenheaver is talking with her classes about how to treat one another appropriately.
""I think it's a conversation that needs to happen in every major within colleges,"" she said. ""It's better to say it 1,000 times than one. The repetition is key with people our age. Especially when we go out into the field, language does change.""
Hedrick said she enjoys having professors like Copenheaver in CNRE, who are female and can relate with her. In 2018, Copenheaver received the Society of American Foresters award for outstanding forestry education, the first woman ever to do so. She also received the Virginia Tech Alumni Award for Teaching Excellence in 2020.
Hedrick said Copenheaver helps her students feel that they are a part of a community.
""You don't feel uncomfortable asking questions,"" Hedrick said.
This is the kind of environment that Copenheaver wants to continue to foster - one in which students are not afraid to come to her with any questions or concerns.
""If we're not comfortable with it, if you have a student who is a victim, they will sense that you are uncomfortable, and they will never come to you,"" she said. ""My goal is to be clear in my communication about what is acceptable and what is unacceptable in my classroom space. And my classroom space extends beyond the four walls where we have lectures. If I'm there, you're in my class.""

ECON STUDENT'S CURIOSITY HELPS ANSWER A BURNING QUESTION,2021,01,"The following information was released by the University of Oregon:
Matthew Dodier always knew he wanted to work in international development or public policy. But early in his undergraduate years, his destinationand the path to get therewas unclear.
What was clearat least to economics professor Ben Hansenwas that Dodier in 2014 displayed an impressive curiosity and work ethic in Hansen's intermediate microeconomics course.
Hansen, whose work in applied microeconomics focuses on crime, health, and labor, is always searching for standout students to undertake research projects for academic and personal growth. He quickly recognized Dodier's talent. ""Matt was one of those students,"" Hansen says, ""who was always attentive, interacted, and then would come to office hours and ask me more questions.""
RELATED LINKS
Hansen enlisted Dodier's help as a research assistant. Then, in 2015, Dodier was selected as a Ronald E. McNair Scholar, joining a federal program that prepares first-generation students with financial need and underrepresented students for doctoral studies. He was required to complete a research project of his own, and Hansen served as his mentor.
The topic emerged from Dodier's interest in development economics and environmental economics: conducting research on how forest fires impact public health.
Wildfires in Oregon were particularly intense in 2014, and as Dodier and Hansen kicked around ideas related to air pollution, ""the idea of looking at forest fires came up,"" Hansen says. ""That's something that is salient to everybody, but nobody had studied the impact on hospitalizations or its impact on pollution.""
Dodier examined the effect of wildfire smoke on respiratory health. He collected statewide data on hospital admissions for respiratory problems, forest fire statistics from the Oregon Department of Forestry, unemployment numbers from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, population data from the National Cancer Institute, and land data from the US Department of Agriculture. He then looked at the origin, size, and location of forest fires and data on local particulate matteror air pollutionto measure whether forest fires resulted in more pollution.
The research showed that the wildfire smoke emanating from forest fires indeed increased air pollution and caused hospitalizations to rise. That finding, Hansen says, ""speaks to one of the potential costs of a warmer, drier climate where we have more of these fires. And more broadly, it speaks to the role of pollution affecting the health of the local population.""
The issue takes on new relevance as researchers examine the connection between air pollution and COVID-19. A recent study from Harvard, for example, found that Americans living in more polluted areas are more likely to die from the disease than those in clearer regions.
The research was Dodier's first taste of a complex, fast-moving project with tough deadlines. The first big hurdle Dodier encountered was accessing the wealth of data he needed in a short amount of time. Then came the arduous task of merging all those disparate data sets to measure the impact of forest fires.
""Some of it was just frustrating,"" Dodier says. ""It was really stressful, and it taught me to deal with that.""
It also ignited a passion that still burns in the 2016 graduate today, as a PhD candidate in public policy at Harvard Kennedy School.
Dodier now has a clear path: he's set his sights on a career in academic research as a professor, perhaps not unlike Hansen, who helped Dodier discover where he could go with economics.
""I could talk to him about anything, not just econ,"" Dodier says. ""He was always encouraging and he gives real, honest feedback.""

If people leave, the villages will burn for sure,"" he told AFP. <br/>""For the next 40 years we will have no job and in the winter we are going to drown from the floods without the forests that were protecting us,"" he added. <br/>Addressing the criticism Sunday, Hardalias said that smoke and the wind direction and the resulting poor visibility had hampered the work of the water-dropping aircraft. <br/>But Nasos Iliopoulos, spokesman for the main opposition Syriza party, said many fires had burned out of control for days across Greece without high winds. Someone, he said, would have to take responsibility for the ""truly tragic"" devastation. <br/>Already late Saturday, Hardalias said that provisional shelter had been provided to 2,000 people evacuated from the island. <br/>In the previous 10 days alone, 56,655 hectares (140,000 acres) have been burnt in Greece, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. The average number of hectares burnt over the same period between 2008 and 2020 was 1,700 hectares. <br/>Britain, France, Spain and other countries have answered Greece's appeal for help, and on Sunday, Serbia announced it was sending 13 vehicles with 37 firefighters and three firefighting helicopters. <br/>The Greek authorities meanwhile are on high alert to prevent more arsons. <br/>Firefighters arrested three young men, aged between 16 and 21, Sunday morning at port city of Piraeus, near Athens, for attempted arson in nearby Perama. <br/>And Athens police said Sunday they had arrested a foreigner at a park in Athens trying to light napkins at the root of a tree. <br/>"

"'State of the Climate' rally demands bolder action from Gov. Polis, lawmakers",2022,01,"<p nitf:lede=""true"">Jan 14, 2022( Colorado Newsline: <url normalizedValue=""https://coloradonewsline.com"">https://coloradonewsline.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> As Gov. Jared Polis stood in the Colorado House of Representatives to deliver his State of the State address on Thursday, dozens of Colorado environmental activists stood just yards away on the steps of the Capitol, once again demanding a more aggressive approach to the climate crisis from state government. 
<br/> Just weeks after the Marshall Fire became the latest climate-related disaster to strike the state, killing at least one person and razing more than a thousand homes in Boulder County, activists urged Polis to declare a 'climate emergency.' <br/> One sign held by a rallygoer featured an image of a burning home and asked: 'Who's next?' <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=""https://coloradonewsline.com/subscribe"">https://coloradonewsline.com/subscribe</url><br/>'We already have a humanitarian crisis here on our streets — with the fires, the tornadoes, the floods, the heat, it is coming,' said activist Harmony Cummings. 'Our elected officials are not doing enough to keep us safe.' <br/> The 'State of the Climate' rally, organized by a coalition of environmental groups including 350 Colorado, the Sierra Club, GreenLatinos and Colorado Rising, came as new data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed[1] that the last six months were Colorado's hottest on record. <br/> In a monthly summary[2] released Thursday, state climatologists with the Colorado Climate Center echoed other experts in identifying a warming climate as a key factor in the unprecedented Marshall Fire, which surpassed the 2013 Black Forest Fire to become the most destructive wildfire in state history. 'Underlying climate conditions of drought, record warmth over the previous 6 months, and near record dry air provided all the ingredients,' the report said. <br/> Inside the Capitol, Polis, too, told lawmakers that recent disasters like the Marshall Fire and last year's Glenwood Canyon mudslides underscore the urgency of 'meeting the climate crisis head-on.' <br/> 'I'm grateful for the work my administration has done in partnership with Colorado's legislative leaders to move our state toward a cleaner, more renewable energy future,' Polis said. 'We've set Colorado on a path to reducing emissions statewide.' <br/> But that path isn't aggressive enough for many environmental activists, who want to see more ambitious emissions-cutting policies — and an approach from state government that includes restricting fossil fuel extraction. Their list of demands[3] to Polis includes the development of a plan by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to phase out drilling by 2030. <br/> 'Fossil fuels are responsible for 80% of carbon emissions, but it's business as usual at the COGCC,' said Christiaan van Woudenberg, an anti-fracking activist and member of the Erie Board of Trustees. 'Not a single permit has been denied. Governor, in order to keep your promises, you need to stop issuing drilling permits.' <br/> Focus on environmental justice <br/><br/>Wednesday wasn't the first time Polis' environmentalist critics have sought to put a spotlight on these issues during his State of the State address. Two years ago, 38 protesters[4] were arrested by Colorado State Patrol officers for a variety of disruptions, including chanting and displaying banners, before and during the governor's speech in the House chamber. The disruption charges were later dropped. <br/><url normalizedValue=""https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC_0372-scaled.jpeg"">https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC_0372-scaled.jpeg</url> Abolitionist and state House candidate Elisabeth Epps addresses the crowd gathered at the Colorado Capitol for a 'State of the Climate' rally on Jan. 13, 2022. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline) <br/>'No matter how many years in jail they threaten us with, we won't stop our accountability on Polis or any leader that turns their back on us or future generations,' GreenLatinos activist Ean Thomas Tafoya, who was among those arrested in 2020, told the crowd Thursday. <br/> Activists have clashed for years with Polis and his predecessor, Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper, over the rapid expansion of oil and gas drilling activity in Colorado during the last 15 years. That's especially the case when it comes to the fossil-fuel industry's impacts on communities with a long history of pollution, like the neighborhoods that surround the Suncor oil refinery in north Denver and Commerce City or the controversial drilling site[5] near Bella Romero Academy in Greeley. <br/> Thanks in large part to legislation passed by Democrats in the General Assembly, efforts to strengthen protections for 'disproportionately impacted communities' have been launched by multiple state agencies in recent years, including the COGCC, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Colorado Department of Transportation. But now activists want to see those processes produce tangible results. <br/> 'We're tired of being harmed,' said Renee Millard-Chacon, an activist and co-founder of the Indigenous group Womxn from the Mountain. 'We've defined disproportionately impacted communities — I'm no longer here to define or be on councils. I'm here to finally bring change.' <br/> Other speakers at the rally included Elisabeth Epps, founder of the Colorado Freedom Fund and a recently declared candidate for House District 6. Epps told rallygoers that the struggle for environmental justice and efforts to reform policing and prisons are linked — noting, for example, that some of those who are hurt the most by more intense and more frequent heat waves are inmates at prisons and jails who often have inadequate air conditioning. <br/> 'There are people in this building that have never stood up to power,' Epps said. 'If you want leaders that are going to take the actions necessary to protect not just our planet but the people and cultures on it, you need to elect leaders that have already been doing that work. <br/> 'I hope this isn't too controversial — y'all, the Earth is going to make it,' Epps added. 'Do you understand that? The Earth is going to last. It's us that might not make it.' <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=""https://coloradonewsline.com/donate"">https://coloradonewsline.com/donate</url><br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.denverpost.com/2022/01/13/colorado-climate-average/"">https://www.denverpost.com/2022/01/13/colorado-climate-average/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=""https://climate.colostate.edu/monthly_summary.html"">https://climate.colostate.edu/monthly_summary.html</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=""https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/unitedforclimatedemands/"">https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/unitedforclimatedemands/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.denverpost.com/2020/01/23/colorado-climate-protest-capitol-polis-criminal-charge/"">https://www.denverpost.com/2020/01/23/colorado-climate-protest-capitol-polis-criminal-charge/</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/23/bella-romero-greeley-school-fracking/"">https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/23/bella-romero-greeley-school-fracking/</url>

World news in brief,2020,04,"Australian High Court acquits cardinal of child sex offenses
CANBERRA, Australia - Cardinal George Pell, who is serving a six-year jail sentence for child sex abuse, has been successful in his bid to overturn his conviction in the Australian High Court.
Pell, 78, will be released immediately today after more than 400 days behind bars.
The judgment was handed down by Chief Justice Susan Kiefel in a near-empty courtroom in Brisbane due to coronavirus social distancing restrictions.
The appeal was allowed and the High Court ordered Pell's ""convictions be quashed and judgments of acquittal be entered in their place,"" as outlined in a statement sent to media.
Pell was sentenced by a Victoria state County Court judge in March last year to six years in prison for sexually abusing two 13-year-old choirboys in a back room of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne in December 1996 while he was archbishop of Australia's second-largest city.
Pell was also convicted of indecently assaulting one of the boys by painfully squeezing his genitals after a Mass in early 1997. Pell would have had to serve three years and eight months behind bars before he becomes eligible for parole.
A jury unanimously convicted Pell of all five charges in December 2018, but he was spared prison for three months while he underwent replacement surgery for both knees.
The High Court examined whether the Victorian Court of Appeal was correct in its 2-1 majority decision in August to uphold the jury verdicts.
U.N.: Syria likely behind attacks on 5 facilities
UNITED NATIONS - A U.N. investigation has concluded it is ""highly probable"" that the Syrian government or its allies were responsible for attacks on five facilities in the last opposition stronghold in the northwest in 2019 - a school, two health care centers, a hospital and a child care facility.
The investigators said it is ""probable"" a sixth attack on a Palestinian refugee camp in Aleppo was carried out either by armed opposition groups or by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the strongest militant group in northwest Idlib province that is affiliated with al-Qaida.
A summary of the 185-page confidential report by a board of inquiry appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was released Monday. It was charged with investigating incidents in the northwest after Russia and Turkey agreed to establish a ""de-escalation zone"" in Idlib on Sept. 17, 2018.
Iraqis report rocket attacks on U.S. oil facility
The Iraqi military said Monday that five rocket attacks hit a U.S. oil production facility.
The rockets targeted the site of Halliburton in the Burjesia area in the oil-rich Basra province, the military statement said. Two Iraqi security officials and one official at the state-run Basra Oil Company said five rockets at struck the area. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
A rocket launcher was subsequently found on the Zubair-Shuaiba road by security forces, according to the statement, with 11 unused missiles that were later defused.
No militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the rocket fire. There was no significant damage, the military said, adding that Iraqi security forces in Basra are searching for the perpetrators of the attack.
Halliburton is an American oil service provider working in the Zubair oil field, which is operated by the Italian ENI.
Monday's attack was the first since last summer to target U.S. oil companies working in the oil-rich south. A rocket struck an oil-drilling site in Basra last June, landing inside a compound housing energy giant Exxon Mobil, Shell and ENI.
Ukrainians fight forest fire near Chernobyl nuclear site
KYIV, Ukraine - Emergency teams in Ukraine on Monday continued battling a forest fire in the contaminated area around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant that has raised radiation fears.
Police said they tracked down a person suspected of starting the blaze by setting dry grass on fire in the area. The 27-year-old man said he burned grass ""for fun"" and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to expand quickly.
Two blazes erupted Saturday in the zone around Chernobyl that was sealed after the 1986 explosion at the plant.
Firefighters said they managed Monday to put out the smaller of the two fires, which engulfed about 12 acres, but the second one continued burning, covering about 50 acres.
Authorities said that radiation levels in the area substantially exceed normal levels, but the emergencies service said radiation levels in the capital, Kyiv, 60 miles south, were within norms.
Migrants force their way into Spain
MADRID - Some 50 migrants on Monday forced their way into Spain's Melilla city over the fence that separates the European enclave in northern Africa, authorities there said.
The central government's delegation in Melilla, which borders Morocco, said that they were part of a group of around 250 migrants who launched a ""massive and violent entry"" into the city, scaling the fence and ignoring the Spanish law enforcement officers on guard.
A Red Cross spokesman in the city said that volunteers had assisted several migrants with cuts and bruises at the gates of Melilla's temporary migrant internment center, and that at least four of them had been transferred to a hospital with possible bone fractures and other ailments.
Melilla and nearby Ceuta are two tiny enclaves separated from Morocco by barbed-wire fences and constant border monitoring.
Poland will vote for president through the mail
WARSAW, Poland - Polish lawmakers voted late Monday to conduct the country's forthcoming presidential elections exclusively through postal voting due to the lockdown imposed for the coronavirus pandemic.
Parliament also empowered house speaker Elzbieta Witek to push back the date of the election, if necessary. Both decisions by parliament require approval from the Senate and from President Andrzej Duda, who is seeking reelection.
Time was pressing for a decision on whether and how to hold the election that had been scheduled - before the pandemic hit - for May 10. Accelerating infections and strict containment measures would make it impossible for people to vote as usual, at polling stations.

Focus of government not to just conserve forests quantitatively but to qualitatively enrich it: Shri Bhupender Yadav
Posted On: 13 JAN 2022 2:51PM by PIB Delhi
Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Bhupender Yadav, today released the India State of Forest Report 2021 prepared by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) which has been mandated to assess the forest and tree resources of the country.
Sharing the findings, the Minister informed that the total forest and tree cover of the country is 80.9 million hectare which is 24.62 percent of the geographical area of the country. As compared to the assessment of 2019, there is an increase of 2,261 sq km in the total forest and tree cover of the country.
The Minister expressed happiness over the fact that the present assessment reveals that 17 states/UTs have above 33 percent of the geographical area under forest cover and stated that the focus of the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is not just to conserve the forests quantitatively but to enrich it qualitatively.
The ISFR-2021 provides information on forest cover, tree cover, mangrove cover, growing stock, carbon stock in Indias forests, forest fire monitoring, forest cover in tiger reserve areas, above ground estimates of biomass using SAR data and climate change hotspots in Indian forests.
MAJOR FINDINGS
The total forest and tree cover of the country is 80.9 million hectare which is 24.62 percent of the geographical area of the country. As compared to the assessment of 2019, there is an increase of 2,261 sq km in the total forest and tree cover of the country. Out of this, the increase in the forest cover has been observed as 1,540 sq km and that in tree cover is 721 sq km.
Increase in forest cover has been observed in open forest followed by very dense forest. Top three states showing increase in forest cover are Andhra Pradesh (647 sq km) followed by Telangana (632 sq km) and Odisha (537 sq km).
Area-wise Madhya Pradesh has the largest forest cover in the country followed by Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Maharashtra. In terms of forest cover as percentage of total geographical area, the top five States are Mizoram (84.53%), Arunachal Pradesh (79.33%), Meghalaya (76.00%), Manipur (74.34%) and Nagaland (73.90%).
17 states/UTs have above 33 percent of the geographical area under forest cover. Out of these states and UTs, five states/UTs namely Lakshadweep, Mizoram, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya have more than 75 percent forest cover while 12 states/UTs namely Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Goa, Kerala, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Assam, Odisha, have forest cover between 33 percent to 75 percent.
Total mangrove cover in the country is 4,992 sq km. An increase of 17 sq Km in mangrove cover has been observed as compared to the previous assessment of 2019. Top three states showing mangrove cover increase are Odisha (8 sq km) followed by Maharashtra (4 sq km) and Karnataka (3 sq km).
Total carbon stock in countrys forest is estimated to be 7,204 million tonnes and there an increase of 79.4 million tonnes in the carbon stock of country as compared to the last assessment of 2019. The annual increase in the carbon stock is 39.7 million tonnes.
METHODOLOGY
In tune with the Government of Indias vision of digital India and the need for integration of digital data sets, FSI has adopted using the vector boundary layers of various administrative units upto districts level as provided by Survey of India along with digital open series topo sheets, in order to ensure comprehensive compatibility with the geographical areas as reported in Census, 2011.
The biennial assessment of forest cover of the country using mid-resolution Satellite data is based on interpretation of LISS-III data from Indian Remote Sensing satellite data (Resourcesat-II) with a spatial resolution of 23.5 meters with the scale of interpretation 1:50,000 to monitor forest cover and forest cover changes at District, State and National level.
This information provides inputs for various global level inventories, reports such as GHG Inventory, Growing Stock, Carbon Stock, Forest Reference Level (FRL) and international reporting to UNFCCC targets under CBD Global Forest Resource Assessment (GFRA) for planning and scientific management of forests.
Satellite data for the entire country was procured from NRSC for the period October to December 2019. The satellite data interpretation is followed by rigorous ground truthing. Information from other collateral sources are also used to improve the accuracy of the interpreted image.
The accuracy level achieved in the current assessment is the significantly high. The accuracy of forest cover classification has been assessed 92.99%. The accuracy of classification between forest and non-forest classes has been assessed 95.79% against internationally accepted accuracy of classification of more than 85%. A rigorous QC and QA exercise was also carried out.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT FEATURES of ISFR 2021
In the present ISFR 2021, FSI has included a new chapter related to the assessment of forest cover in the Tiger Reserves, Corridors and Lion conservation area of India. In this context, the decadal assessment of change in forest cover within Tiger Reserves, Corridors and Lion conservation area helps in assessing the impact of conservation measures and management interventions that have been implemented over the years.
For decadal assessment, change in forest cover, during the period between ISFR 2011 (data period 2008 to 2009) and the current cycle (ISFR 2021, data period 2019-2020) within each Tiger Reserves has been analysed.
A new initiative of FSI has also been documented in the form of a chapter, where the Above Ground Biomass has been estimated. FSI, in collaboration with Space Application Centre (SAC), ISRO, Ahmedabad, initiated a special study for estimation of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) at pan-India level, using L- band of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The results for the States of Assam and Odisha (as well as AGB maps), were presented earlier in ISFR 2019. The interim results for AGB estimates (and AGB maps) for the entire country are being presented as a new chapter in ISFR 2021. The detailed report will be published after completion of the study.
FSI in collaboration of with Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani, Goa Campus has performed a study based on Mapping of Climate Change Hotspots in Indian Forests. The collaborative study was carried out with the objective to map the climatic hotspots over the forest cover in India, using computer model-based projection of temperature and rainfall data, for the three future time periods i.e. year 2030, 2050 and 2085.
The report also contains information on various parameters State/UT wise. Special thematic information on forest cover such as hill, tribal districts, and north eastern region has also been given separately in the report.
It is expected that the information given in the report would provide valuable information for policy, planning and sustainable management of forest and tree resources in the country."
CITADEL STUDENT FINDS RARE PLANT FOR THE 1ST TIME IN CHARLESTON COUNTY,2021,01,"McCLELLANVILLE, Jan. 4 -- The Citadel issued the following press release:
A Citadel student recently discovered new populations of Carolina birds-in-a-nest, a relative of the mint plant with a showy pink flower that had never before been recorded in Charleston County.
The plant, which grows a few feet off the ground and can be hard to spot when it's not in bloom, prefers a wet, sunny environment.
Celie Dailey, who is pursing a master's degree in biology, stumbled on several thickets of the plant in bloom this summer at a conservation site on the Black River in southern Georgetown County.
The rare wildflower lives in a limited range in the coastal plains from Georgia to North Carolina. The federal government considers it an ""at-risk"" plant, and will decide whether it should be listed as threatened or endangered in 2023. Dailey reported the sighting to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
""They were really excited to find it,"" Dailey said. ""It turned out, it was kind of a monster population.""
But shortly after, Dailey spotted this rare plant again in an unexpected place - a roadside ditch in McClellanville. It was the first recorded population ever found in Charleston County.
Celie Dailey in 2019 with a patch of Carolina birds-in-a-nest, or Macbridea caroliniana, which she has found in several new spots around Charleston and Georgetown County. April Punsalan/Provided Joel Gramling, a Citadel professor and Dailey's adviser, said the discoveries are important in part because the plant, with the Latin name Macbridea caroliniana, is hard to keep track of. A 2016 survey couldn't find about 45 percent of the Macbridea population at previously discovered locations in South Carolina, Gramling said.
""We see this trend where we aren't able to find these populations, and now, all of a sudden, here's (Dailey) in several different counties, finding new populations,"" he said.
It's possible that the plant has been hard to detect because it blends in with other flora when it's not blooming. If previously sunny areas become shaded by new trees or shrubs, it may also recede into simple green stems.
Thriving populations are found in ""disturbed"" areas, which may have been cleared of larger plants by natural causes, such as a forest fire, or man-made ones, such mowing in a drainage ditch.
One of its main habitats - the edges of a swamp or inside a bog - can also be hard to access when the telltale blooms are out. Dailey said that in trips to the Black River site, she had to push through thickets of grass taller than she was, and was showered with ticks in the process.
""Nobody wants to be in a swamp in July,"" Dailey said. ""It's just nasty.""
But she said that the plant, though unassuming, is not just rare, it's special to the state. South Carolina has the biggest population of the plant among the three states in which it's been found.
It's just one of several overlooked plants that make up the state's biodiversity, she said.
""I just love these wild places because they are just so diverse,"" Dailey said. ""Roadside places where you have so-called 'weedy' plants growing wild, people just want to cut these areas down ... those types of areas are so cool to me, to see the abundance of life there.""
Residents who spot Carolina birds-in-a-nest can report it to the Fish and Wildlife Service office in Charleston at (843) 727-4707.

"Homes, lives spared in fire that raged across Sheepback Mountain",2022,04,"Apr. 5—MAGGIE VALLEY — A fire on Sheepback Mountain above Maggie Valley that originated from a brush fire Monday afternoon raged through the night and into Tuesday — threatening homes, forcing dozens of evacuations and consuming more than 300 acres before finally being quelled by rain.
Firefighters on the ground mobilized quickly when the fire broke out with a concerted strategy to save homes in the fire's path. Crews soaked down the perimeter of homes in advance of the fire and then hunkered down as it closed in, hoping it would sweep around them as it continued its march across the mountainside.
""We've got tanker trucks next to all the homes being threatened, and they are individually protecting each home,"" Allison Richmond, public information officer for Haywood Emergency Services, said Monday evening. ""We hope the rain that's coming will extinguish it pretty well. In the meantime, we are doing a good job keeping it away from people's homes.""
Fire departments from across Haywood County and beyond battled the blaze through the night, along with support from the N.C. Forest Service, National Park Service and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.
""Crews are working around the clock. They are coming in from all over Western North Carolina lending a hand,"" said Christina Esmay, public information officer for the Haywood County Sheriff's Office.
Brenda Mancuso, who lives on Sheepback Mountain, was grateful to the crews who put themselves in harm's way to stop the fire.
""It was a rough night. I didn't sleep at all,"" said Mancuso, who stayed with a friend after having to evacuate her RV. ""I just kept reminding myself no matter what happens to me I am on God's plan, and I don't have control over it. You just have to trust in God. So that's what I did.""
Tuesday morning, emergency officials allowed Mancuso to return to her property and see how it had fared. Speaking by phone as she pulled up to her RV, she broke into tears upon finding it had been spared.
""If I had lost everything, it would have been catastrophic. I think it would have broken me,"" she said.
She had to evacuate so quickly Monday, she only had time to grab her two cats and her dog.
""I kind of just froze. I couldn't think of what to bring,"" said Mancuso.
Evacuations
An evacuation notice was sent out via the Haywood County Emergency Text alert system shortly after the fire broke out. Responders followed up by going door-to-door.
Mark Jones, who lives on Sheepback Mountain Road, returned home from work Monday afternoon to find the road leading to his home barricaded and the mountainside billowing with smoke and flames.
""They wouldn't let me get up the hill at first, but when I told them I had pets to go after, they drove me up in a utility vehicle,"" Jones said.
Jones was put at ease upon seeing a fire tanker truck stationed in his driveway to guard the house should the flames encroach.
""I said, 'Do I have a minute or two to grab some other things?'"" Jones recalled.
But as he tore through his house, he found himself at a loss.
""You always think about what you need to have in case you ever have to evacuate, but when it happens, your mind kind of goes blank,"" Jones said. ""We were mostly just worried about the babies.""
So he got his dog Bailey, a rat terrier, and his ball python, Buttercup.
""When I told the fire chief at the bottom of the hill I had a python, he joked 'I was going to help you out until you told me that,'"" Jones said.
Jones and his wife spent the night at a hotel in Maggie Valley. But he couldn't sleep. So around 1:30 a.m., he got in his car and drove up Soco Road to the observation tower to look down on the fire. By day, thick smoke mostly obscured the flames, but by night, the mountainside was awash in an eerie orange glow.
As firefighters battled the Sheepback Mountain fire on Monday afternoon, a smaller and unrelated fire broke out on the other side of Soco Road up Setzer Cove. Leilani Hutchinson had been watching the smoke when her phone dinged. It was a Haywood County Emergency text alert with another evacuation notice — this time for her area.
""It told us to leave immediately,"" she said. ""I got my dogs and our medicine, and that's about it.""
How the fire started
Haywood County emergency officials had not publicly confirmed how the fire yet started as of Tuesday. But according to eyewitnesses, the fire originated from a controlled brush fire by a landscaping crew that had been doing some clearing.
""Around 11 o'clock, they started burning brush and trees on the property just below my cabin,"" said Tom Kassem, who lives along Pless Underwood Road. ""They said they dug a big hole and were being very careful, and it wasn't windy, so I don't know how it got out of hand.""
Kassem left for a while, but his housemate Saad Ghanem was still home when the fire enveloped him.
""All the way around the cabin was fire and smoke,"" said Ghanem, who speaks limited English. ""Too much scared. I grabbed my dog and run down the mountain so fast.""
Ghanem tried to run down the driveway toward the road, but the fire was blocking his way. So he took off down the steep mountainside, leaping and jumping through the woods with his dog in his arms.
He fell as he was running, scratching up his back and injuring his shoulder in the process. Ghanem made his way to a nearby home, where an ambulance came and picked him up.
The fire moved quickly once it got out of control. By dusk, it had already burned 75 acres.
Kassem said he doesn't blame the landscaping crew that had been burning the brush. The crew was in their truck at the mobile command center set up at the base of the mountain Monday evening to coordinate the response.
""They told me they weren't trying to hurt anybody, that it wasn't intentional. I said 'It's OK, everybody makes mistakes,'"" Kassem said.
Quelling the flames
Along with ground response, firefighting efforts were aided by robust air support.
""We have two spotter planes circling the fire to monitor its movement, plus a helicopter and two air tankers dropping water,"" Richmond said, speaking Monday from the mobile command center. ""The spotter planes keep an eye on which direction the fire is moving and where they need to concentrate their efforts.""
The helicopter made a continuous circuit between Maggie Valley and Lake Junaluska, where it scooped up water to carry back to the fire. The tanker planes had to go to the Asheville Airport to refill, however, Richmond said.
The fire had burned 75 acres by the time dusk fell Monday night. It had grown to 200 acres by 10 a.m. Tuesday morning, with the fire only 30% contained. WIthin an hour of rain moving in Tuesday afternoon, the fire was 100% contained.
Community pitched in
An outpouring of community support was provided to firefighters and first responders, Esmay said.
Local churches showed up at the mobile command center with a steady stream of donuts, hot coffee, snacks and food to keep the crews fed. Victory Baptist Church offered its parking lot for the mobile command center and opened bathrooms to the crews.
Maggie Valley Fire Department was the lead agency for the fire response, though aid came in from every fire department in the county. Two fire departments from Jackson County — Savannah and Balsam-Willetts — brought crews and trucks to staff the Maggie Valley Fire Station and respond to any other calls that came in since local firefighters were occupied with the forest fire.
A shelter and reunification center was set up at Calvary Baptist Church Monday afternoon.
""We are serving as a staging area to help folks that may have been displaced or are looking for loved ones who evacuated,"" said Teresa Allison with Haywood County Health and Human Services. ""Anybody that needs a place to stay in the interim while they are putting out the fire is welcome to come here and help with whatever their needs may be.""
Pull-offs along Soco Road leading up to the Blue Ridge Parkway were crowded with people Monday who watched in shock from the vantage point overlooking the valley. Maggie Valley Alderwoman Tammy Wight was among them.
""My prayers are with the families and firefighters and first responders. I just hope everybody's safe,"" Wight said.

Megafire Doesn't Deter Yosemite's Spotted Owls,2020,09,"In 2013 the Rim Fire-the largest fire on record in the Sierra Nevada-burned one third of the potential California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) habitat in Yosemite National Park.
The park provides prime habitat for this Spotted Owl subspecies, which is listed as a Species of Special Concern by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and concern grew regarding the fire's effect on Yosemite's owl populations. But recent research provides some good news regarding the park's owls, and it may be due to Yosemite's unique history and fire management strategy.
In a study published last week in the journal Forest Ecology and Management, researchers from The Institute for Bird Populations and Yosemite National Park found that Spotted Owl numbers and nesting rates remained stable in areas of the park that were burned by the Rim Fire. Between 2015 and 2017, the researchers surveyed for Spotted Owls, locating their territories and determining their breeding status. They used satellite data to characterize the habitat in the study area, including how severely it burned.
""What surprised me, primarily, was not that owls were still present, but they were still present in the same numbers and still successfully setting up territories and breeding,"" says the study's lead author Lynn Schofield, a biologist with The Institute for Bird Populations. While the owls avoided the most severely burned areas, they still held territories within the fire's perimeter.
California Spotted Owls can tolerate forest fire, but Schofield cautions that not all fires are created equal. Yosemite's forests have not been commercially logged since the early 1900s and fire suppression efforts since the 1970s have been kept to a minimum. This results in a forest structure and fire regime that is distinct from what is found outside of the park.
""In Yosemite there is a diversity of forest habitat"" explains Schofield, ""This means the Rim Fire burned with a diversity of severities creating a range of post-fire habitat for owls to choose from."" The study notes that in portions of the adjacent Stanislaus National Forest that were also burned by the Rim Fire, burn severity was more homogenous likely due to the contrasting logging and fire management regime on the National Forest.
The frequency of large, high intensity ""megafires"" like the Rim Fire is expected to increase in the Sierra Nevada. These megafires are considered one of the most important conservation threats to the California Spotted Owl. This study suggests that Yosemite's owl population has benefited from the park's diverse forest habitats and restored fire regime, and that these factors have allowed them to thrive even after a major disturbance like the Rim Fire.
""At Yosemite, restoring fire to its natural role is one of our management priorities,"" says Sarah Stock, a wildlife ecologist at Yosemite and co-author of the study. ""It's gratifying to see that this strategy is paying off for the park's wildlife.""
The article Megafire Doesn't Deter Yosemite's Spotted Owls appeared first on Eurasia Review."
Gov.: Vermont has fewest cases but must keep up guard,2020,07,"MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — Vermont has the lowest number of COVID-19 cases in the country and hasn't had a death from the illness in more than a month but the state has to remain vigilant because of the rapid spread of the coronavirus in other parts of the country, Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday.
“In looking across the country, we continue to see a forest fire spreading in the south and west and things could shift back towards us so we have keep our guard up,” said Scott, a Republican, during his regular virus briefing.
The state is considering expanding its mask mandate, Scott said, although he added that he's concerned that “a mandate will create unnecessary conflict.”
""With the numbers that we see in Vermont, particularly in our most rural areas, the data hasn't yet supported a change to the status quo,"" said Scott, who said he would have more information on Friday.
He advised Vermonters to be smart about where they travel and only go to areas that the state has identified as low risk. Residents who are traveling from other locations or taking a flight or public transportation to Vermont should quarantine for 14 days, he said.
MANCHESTER-AREA CASES
Eighty percent of the 65 patients who tested positive for the virus after taking an antigen test that is not considered to be as accurate as the test used by the Health Department have been retested and only four were confirmed positive cases, said Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.
""Through interviews and lab data, we've determined that 59 of the 65 antigen positives are not cases,"" he said.
Vermont does not count tests as positive unless they are done with a more reliable system, Levine has said. The Health Department uses a PCR test.
The PCR test is more available and has been used extensively nationally and internationally, Levine said. “Give it a little time and they'll be able to rely on the antigen test, I would hope, too,” he said.
The PCR test is preferable for people who are asymptomatic, Levine said. The likelihood of developing symptoms would probably occur from the fourth to seventh day, he said. The Health Department recommends that people who feel they've been exposed to the virus to get a test on the seventh day, Levine said.
THE NUMBERS
The Vermont Health Department on Tuesday reported seven new positive cases of the virus that causes COVID-19, bringing the state's total number since the pandemic began to 1,366.
The total number of deaths from COVID-19 has remained at 56 for more than a month.
For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause more severe illness and can lead to death."
Borough to do aerial survey of peninsula,2021,03,"When people piloting a small-wing plane take to peninsula skies this spring, it won't just be because they want to see the sights. They'll be part of a borough effort to improve and update the Kenai Peninsula Borough's aerial imagery resources.
The flight will be one of four made possible by a recent unanimous vote in support of legislation by the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly. That legislation also approved additional funds to pay for the flight this spring. The four flights are described in a sole source award the assembly voted for the borough to enter into with the company EagleView, with flights planned for the purpose of gathering updated and high-quality imagery of the borough.
While most beneficial to the borough's assessing department, which can use the imagery to meet assessing canvassing criteria, the imagery can also be used for general government, safety and public uses.
The last time the borough conducted a general capture of imagery was in 2012 and 2013 for the western Kenai Peninsula. Borough Land Management Officer Marcus Mueller said during a Feb. 16 meeting of the Assembly's Finance Committee that the borough has undergone many changes since that capture. Reflected in a new capture, Mueller said, would be things like forest fire damage, spruce bark beetle outbreaks and new homes and roads.
Mueller noted that while borough captures are used often by borough departments, the borough's parcel viewer webpage is their most-visited ""by a long shot,"" with several hundred thousand hits a year.
""This is a really big deal,"" Mueller said during the February meeting. ""Imagery is a really central information piece for a municipality to have.""
Borough Acting Assessing Director Adeena Wilcox said during the February meeting that the technology will save the borough's Assessing Department money and will reduce the risk posed to employees while out in the field, which she said can be dangerous and costly. Putting staff on a boat to survey the outer banks of the Seward area, for example, costs almost $20,000.
The department used the same technology last year to gather imagery of the eastern peninsula, Wilcox said. That project was able to be funded using CARES Act funds because it prevented assessing staff from having to go out into communities.
Wilcox said the technology will also grant the borough visual access to places they've been unable to survey on the ground.
The Native Village of Tyonek, for example, as a sovereign entity, has said that they do not want the assessing department in the community and has even escorted assessing staff off of property in the area.
""We don't want to be on the property if the taxpayer doesn't want us on the property,"" Wilcox said. ""They have the right to tell us not to be there.""
Aerial imagery, Wilcox said, will not replace in-person sales, appeal and year-end inspections conducted by the department and would be used specifically for canvassing.
In all, the ordinance outlines four projects with EagleView that have a projected combined cost of almost $650,000.
The first flight, to take place in spring 2021, will cost about $340,000 and would cover most of the western peninsula.
The second flight, to take place in spring of 2022, will cost about $127,700 and would cover the western shore of Cook Inlet, the tip of the peninsula and the southern shore Kachemak Bay plus Seldovia.
The third flight, scheduled for spring 2023, will cost about $116,000 and would cover most of the peninsula south of Skilak Lake.
The final flight, estimated for spring 2024, would cost about $64,000 and cover the central peninsula.
Wilcox said during the February meeting that conducting flights in spring produces better imagery because many trees lack substantial leaves that block views of the ground.
The ordinance, which was approved unanimously by the assembly during their March 2 meeting, adds about $63,000 to the borough's GIS budget to help fully fund the initial flight scheduled for this spring.
Interactive GIS imagery of the Kenai Peninsula Borough can be found on the borough website at kpb.us/gis-dept/interactive-mapping.

NASA tools could help fight fires from the sky and the ground,2021,08,"The fire wasn't real that day in the rolling hills of Northern California, already turning crisp and brown at the beginning of May. But it offered the perfect opportunity for a group of NASA researchers to test the technology they've been building.
Their demonstration at a wildfire simulation outside Redding, California, showed how emergency responders of all kinds could work more safely and effectively using the prototype tools of NASA's STEReO project - Scalable Traffic Management for Emergency Response Operations.
The faux fire, marked out with orange flags and smoke flares, was being used for aerial firefighting training by STEReO's partners at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CAL FIRE, and the U.S. Forest Service. The exercises focused on the role in wildfire response of an air traffic controller in the sky.
Circling above the scene, this person watches from the window of a plane. They visually track numerous aircraft and juggle their requests - over multiple radio frequencies - to fly near the fire or drop fire retardant, all while steering everyone clear of the firefighters on foot.
While the partners' trainees were learning this demanding job, NASA's STEReO team got to work testing tools that could one day assist them.
New Solutions Require New Coordination
Wildland firefighting is no joke, and, today, critical decisions about dangerous situations rely in part on reports that come in from teams in the field. New technologies could help here: imagine, instead, drones sending real-time data from the perimeter of a forest fire to determine where crews will be most effective.
But that means even more moving parts to coordinate and, without the tools to do it, drones have largely had to stay on the sidelines of wildfire incidents when piloted aircraft are around.
""Planes and helicopters fighting fires have had limited awareness of the drones' whereabouts,"" said Joey Mercer, STEReO's principal investigator at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, ""but STEReO provides a way to see all operations responding to a disaster, in the air and on the ground.""
It also sends out alerts to signal potential issues, like a plane getting close to a drone. STEReO is building on the agency's expertise in drone traffic management to develop these tools that let all elements of an emergency response stay in close contact and out of each other's way.
The result is a system that can be deployed during and after emergencies, from fires to hurricanes, wherever they may be.
""STEReO is a portable system,"" said Mercer, ""and we're developing a sort of 'bring your own internet' capability. That means the system works without high-speed internet access from the usual providers, which is likely to be lacking in a remote area struck by wildfire or a city following an earthquake or major storm.""
Firefighting in the Air, on the Ground, and on Screen
The project also created software tools that show in real time which operations are happening and where. Teams responding to a disaster can follow the action on their own screens, with a data display like a cell phone map in satellite mode. Moving icons show aircraft and humans at work, and the areas where drones will fly are marked.
From April 26 to May 7, 2021, the STEReO team got to see their tools in action in the most realistic setting yet: working alongside CAL FIRE and Forest Service firefighting teams in training.
In this part of Northern California's countryside cell phones have only sketchy coverage, so STEReO's portable internet would definitely be needed. The team arranged their communications equipment strategically and proved that the area of a fire, even in hilly terrain, could be blanketed with STEReO's wifi coverage.
Above them, firefighting planes and helicopters flew in coordination with NASA drones. STEReO tracked them all, along with ground crews and some simulated aircraft for added complexity.
By the end of the demonstration, STEReO's partners had seen how the technology could work for them in a real-world setting, and which tools would help them most when fires strike.
New Technology for a Growing Need
This work, which is led by Ames in collaboration with two other NASA centers - Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and Glenn Research Center in Cleveland - is a concept study under NASA's Convergent Aeronautics Solutions project. The CAS activity is designed to determine STEReO's feasibility, and the results will help determine whether to pursue further development.
Support from CAS is something like a start-up investment for technology exploration government research is well suited for.
""For STEReO, we built basically four or five individual 'products',"" said Mercer. ""We designed them based on input from our partners, and, after seeing how it all came together during the flight demonstration, they identified the products they needed most. This was a low-cost way of connecting technology still in development with their immediate needs - something NASA is particularly good at.""
As climate change impacts extreme weather events, there may be a growing need for tools like those STEReO is creating. The team will continue developing the system, aiming to let its partners test some of the tools independently next year.
By applying NASA technologies to responders' most critical needs, STEReO's creators hope to let them work together seamlessly, helping save property, homes, and lives."
Icarus breaks up the survival genre into smart session-based gameplay,2021,06,"<p nitf:lede=""true"">Jun 24, 2021( VentureBeat: <url normalizedValue=""http://venturebeat.com"">http://venturebeat.com</url>/ Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> How to protect your game from cheaters and pirates  <br/> Join Dean Takahashi and others to learn how to defend your game against cheaters and pirates.  <br/> Register Now[1]  <br/><br/>Where does your enterprise stand on the AI adoption curve? Take our AI survey[2] to find out.  
<br/><br/> Icarus[3] is the new game from developer RocketWerkz[4], which DayZ creator Dean Hall[5] founded in New Zealand following his time at Bohemia Interactive[6]. The quick-and-dirty description for Icarus is that it is like Valheim in space. It's a survival game where you'll need to gather resources and build up your tech tree to survive harsh environments. But Icarus puts a spin on the formula with a session-based structure that may make the game even more addictive and appealing when it launches on Steam for $30 on August 12[7]. <br/> I've spent some time playing Icarus, including a session with Hall, who showed me around the world. And one of the first things I noticed is that I had no desire to cut my first run into the world short. I was getting my bearings and learning the mechanics, and the last thing I wanted was to go back up to my space station. And that's something that Hall said the team learned when testing the game. <br/> RocketWerkz originally designed Icarus with short early sessions and longer late-game sessions in mind, but the team actually found that people prefer the opposite. Like me, most people want to spend a long time in a world when they first boot up Icarus. Then later, after leveling up a character and getting in a flow, players enjoy shorter, more goal-oriented runs. And while that was not immediately intuitive or obvious to RocketWerkz, the designers see why that makes sense now. <br/> Like in a lot of sandbox-style games, everything seems possible when you first land in Icarus. And you want to take time to learn the boundaries and dynamics of the world. You will then apply those lessons to accomplish specific purposes once you know what you want to do. <br/><br/> Systems, DLSS, and ray tracing <br/>We tried to start a forest fire. That's the key takeaway from my time in Icarus. It has physics systems that simulate fire and its spread, but we actually failed at getting the fire to jump from one tree from another. But Hall thinks that is because it had just rained in the game. That thunderstorm itself was spectacular — with its own fire-causing lightning strikes. But the moisture left the forest too wet for our arsonist inclinations. <br/> Icarus is brimming with systems like that, and it adds to the sense that you're exploring a sandbox or possibility space. <br/> Another factor that makes Icarus stand out is its visuals and tech. RocketWerkz has already implemented Nvidia's deep-learning supersampling (DLSS) as well as RTX-powered global illumination. This means that you can get realistic-behaving light rays, and DLSS then means you can even run the game at a decent framerate. Even in my early sessions, Icarus regularly hits a better-than-playable framerate thanks to DLSS. And that's before RocketWerkz had given the game its final optimization pass before launch. <br/> We'll see what the game is like once its out for everyone, but it's definitely a game I find myself gravitating toward. A part of that is I haven't had a survival game in my life recently. But I also think Icarus is promising a compelling loop with the potential for emergent storytelling, and that could help it find an audience when it's available beginning August 12.

Borough to do aerial survey of peninsula,2021,03,"When people piloting a small-wing plane take to peninsula skies this spring, it won't just be because they want to see the sights. They'll be part of a borough effort to improve and update the Kenai Peninsula Borough's aerial imagery resources.
The flight will be one of four made possible by a recent unanimous vote in support of legislation by the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly. That legislation also approved additional funds to pay for the flight this spring. The four flights are described in a sole source award the assembly voted for the borough to enter into with the company EagleView, with flights planned for the purpose of gathering updated and high-quality imagery of the borough.
While most beneficial to the borough's assessing department, which can use the imagery to meet assessing canvassing criteria, the imagery can also be used for general government, safety and public uses.
The last time the borough conducted a general capture of imagery was in 2012 and 2013 for the western Kenai Peninsula. Borough Land Management Officer Marcus Mueller said during a Feb. 16 meeting of the Assembly's Finance Committee that the borough has undergone many changes since that capture. Reflected in a new capture, Mueller said, would be things like forest fire damage, spruce bark beetle outbreaks and new homes and roads.
Mueller noted that while borough captures are used often by borough departments, the borough's parcel viewer webpage is their most-visited ""by a long shot,"" with several hundred thousand hits a year.
""This is a really big deal,"" Mueller said during the February meeting. ""Imagery is a really central information piece for a municipality to have.""
Borough Acting Assessing Director Adeena Wilcox said during the February meeting that the technology will save the borough's Assessing Department money and will reduce the risk posed to employees while out in the field, which she said can be dangerous and costly. Putting staff on a boat to survey the outer banks of the Seward area, for example, costs almost $20,000.
The department used the same technology last year to gather imagery of the eastern peninsula, Wilcox said. That project was able to be funded using CARES Act funds because it prevented assessing staff from having to go out into communities.
Wilcox said the technology will also grant the borough visual access to places they've been unable to survey on the ground.
The Native Village of Tyonek, for example, as a sovereign entity, has said that they do not want the assessing department in the community and has even escorted assessing staff off of property in the area.
""We don't want to be on the property if the taxpayer doesn't want us on the property,"" Wilcox said. ""They have the right to tell us not to be there.""
Aerial imagery, Wilcox said, will not replace in-person sales, appeal and year-end inspections conducted by the department and would be used specifically for canvassing.
In all, the ordinance outlines four projects with EagleView that have a projected combined cost of almost $650,000.
The first flight, to take place in spring 2021, will cost about $340,000 and would cover most of the western peninsula.
The second flight, to take place in spring of 2022, will cost about $127,700 and would cover the western shore of Cook Inlet, the tip of the peninsula and the southern shore Kachemak Bay plus Seldovia.
The third flight, scheduled for spring 2023, will cost about $116,000 and would cover most of the peninsula south of Skilak Lake.
The final flight, estimated for spring 2024, would cost about $64,000 and cover the central peninsula.
Wilcox said during the February meeting that conducting flights in spring produces better imagery because many trees lack substantial leaves that block views of the ground.
The ordinance, which was approved unanimously by the assembly during their March 2 meeting, adds about $63,000 to the borough's GIS budget to help fully fund the initial flight scheduled for this spring.
Interactive GIS imagery of the Kenai Peninsula Borough can be found on the borough website at kpb.us/gis-dept/interactive-mapping.

"Modern Folk Duo, Joselyn &amp; Don, Uplift Spirits During Pandemic and Seek to Support California Wildfire First Responders and Victims with Debut Album, ""Soar""",2020,09,"PR Newswire
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- The upcoming full-length album, ""Soar,"" from LA based acoustic duo, Joselyn &amp; Don, will be released September 4th on all streaming platforms, and available on Joselyn &amp; Don's website to purchase as a physical CD or digital download.
'Soar' is somehow timely and timeless, recalling the singer songwriters of the 1970's with a fresh, modern perspective. ""You can just imagine yourself traipsing through the Wild West when listening [to Joselyn &amp; Don]... and there's something very evocative about the whole thing,"" says Jane Howking of York Calling Magazine.
The couple recorded the album over the past two years in their home studio aptly named Garden Studio after the surrounding bountiful fruit trees and vegetable garden. The project was finished during the COVID-19 pandemic and features Don on guitars, drums, horns and bass. Besides her vocals and songwriting, Joselyn adds ukulele, keys and various hand drums. ""This new project is rooted in my early upbringing in Montana listening to bluegrass and folk, and my connection to nature."" Joselyn shares, ""I'm writing better songs now than I did in my 20's. Motherhood and the challenges I've faced in life have enriched my work. Being a musician and sharing your art should be something you can do at any age, because our experience of being human is constantly changing.""
Initially inspired by a California forest fire, the driving anthem, ""Storm,"" from the album acknowledges that the many challenges we face have created a storm we can no longer ignore. An intimate acoustic intro quickly swells with electric guitar, African percussion, and soaring female vocals. The official music video for the advance single, which is dedicated to the first responders and fire victims, premiered on Friday, August 28th (<url normalizedValue=""https://youtu.be/2_qSQ25KSAQ"">https://youtu.be/2_qSQ25KSAQ</url>) and will serve to raise awareness as well as funds for the organizations California Fire Foundation and GlobalGiving - CA Wildfires to provide direct relief.
Joselyn &amp; Don are a refreshing new voice in modern folk showcasing evocative American roots storytelling, rich soulful vocals and stellar musicianship. When they are not writing, recording and releasing music, Don keeps busy as the Film Editor of The Simpsons and Joselyn tours with her international women's group, ADAAWE, which she formed after living in Ghana, West Africa, and works closely with arts education organizations.
Keep up with Joselyn &amp; Don on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and on their website (<url normalizedValue=""https://bit.ly/Joselyn-Don"">https://bit.ly/Joselyn-Don</url>) for info on the release of their debut album, ""Soar,"" as well as their Livestream Album Release Concert on September 4th at 6pm PST.

Cheney and Kinzinger may be too late,2021,08,"I wish I could be a Cheney fan. I really do. Rep. Liz Cheney has conducted herself honorably for the past nine months. Her courage in telling the truth about the election and the insurrection of Jan. 6 has been punished by the Republican conference, which booted her from leadership and replaced her with the lying, scheming Trumpist, Rep. Elise Stefanik. Former President Donald Trump is apparently working feverishly to unseat Cheney from Congress altogether, and his lickspittle lieutenants are joining the effort.
The invertebrate minority leader, Kevin McCarthy -- who, let's recall, declared on Jan. 13 that ""the president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters"" -- has long since scurried back under Trump's skirts, from whence he issues barbs against the few remaining Republicans who still have some principles. McCarthy sniped that Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, the other Republican appointed to the Jan. 6 committee over the objections of party leadership, are ""Pelosi Republicans.""
The opening segments of the Jan. 6 committee were another fine moment for Cheney. She began by thanking the police officers who testified about their experiences defending the Capitol that day:
""Thank you to each of the witnesses appearing before us today. ... You defended the Constitution and our Republic, and every American owes you our undying gratitude.""
She went on to outline the stakes:
""If those responsible are not held accountable, and if Congress does not act responsibly, this will remain a cancer on our Constitutional Republic, undermining the peaceful transfer of power at the heart of our democratic system.""
Those are good words, and as I said above, I respect Cheney's willingness to pay a price. She understood that by taking on the ""Big Lie"" and the almost-as-consequential lie about what happened on Jan. 6, she was risking her leadership position, her seat and possibly her own security. Every word of truth that she (and Kinzinger) utters is like a balm of Gilead.
And yet, the voice in the back of my head keeps saying, ""Is it too late?""
Both Cheney and Kinzinger, may they live to be 120, had many, many earlier opportunities to extinguish this forest fire before it became a raging inferno. Both supported Trump's reelection in 2020. Kinzinger said he was ""upset"" by President Joe Biden's victory. Cheney appeared on ""Fox and Friends"" in July 2020, and while she allowed that she disagreed with Trump on some issues, most notably withdrawal from Afghanistan, she emphasized how important it was that Trump be reelected: ""Whether or not we have debates and discussions internally -- as I'm sure we continue, we will continue to do -- we are going to be absolutely united going forward on the big issues, and I'm not going any place.""
Both Cheney and Kinzinger voted against the first Trump impeachment. They stuck with their support for his reelection, despite the first debate with Biden, despite the catastrophic handling of COVID-19, despite Trump's green light to China's Uyghur camps, despite QAnon, and despite the avalanche of lies and cruelty that corrupted America's soul -- and prepared the ground for the violent insurrection they are now investigating.
Is it welcome that they finally found a line they couldn't cross? A thousand times, yes. But how might this story have unfolded differently if they, and thousands of other Republicans, had found their uncrossable lines sooner?
You can say, ""The base is calling the shots, and the elected are just following what the voters demand."" That's nonsense. The base doesn't get its ideas from nowhere. It gets them from Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and the rest of the conservative media world. And it gets them from elected officials. To paraphrase what Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn told the Jan. 6 committee: When elected officials give permission, there is no limit to the violence that may ensue.
Trump was the arsonist. But if every time he dropped a match on the dry tinder of American polarization, Republican elected officials and others had leaped to extinguish the small flames, we would not be here.
And where is here? We have seen the end of 160 years of the peaceful transfer of power. We've seen the majestic United States Capitol turned into a scene from a dystopian fantasy; an armed mob attempting to subvert an election. They smashed and tortured and caused deaths. They erected a gallows and hunted for the speaker of the House and for the vice president. And Republicans, almost to a man and woman, are excusing, downplaying or whitewashing what happened. An entire political party has abandoned commitment to the rule of law.
To speak up now, well, it's better than nothing. But it's a little like saying you'll take away a drunk's driver's license after he crashed into and killed an 8-year-old. What about all of those times when you saw him get behind the wheel after five drinks and did nothing?
Trump attacked the basics of American democracy. The consequences were foreseeable. There were countless warnings. The great tragedy of this moment is not that Trump attempted what he did, but that so few Republicans tried to stop him when it would have made a difference.

ENVIRONMENT VIRGINIA RETURNS LIVE TO VMI,2022,04,"LEXINGTON, Va., April 4 -- Virginia Military Institute issued the following news release:
LEXINGTON, Va., April 4, 2022-The 32nd annual Environment Virginia Symposium at Virginia Military Institute returned to a live, in-person event on March 29-31. The event was held virtually in 2021 and canceled altogether in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event, organized and co-hosted by the VMI Center for Leadership &amp; Ethics (CLE), attracted nearly 400 attendees from state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, higher education and the private sector. Col. Dave Gray, director of CLE, served as master of ceremony for the event.
Topics at this year's symposium included offshore wind energy, solar farm mitigation strategies, food waste, land conservation, nature-based and construction solutions, solutions to decreasing plastic pollution, algae bloom across Virginia, partnerships in the Chesapeake Bay and more.
The keynote session featured three newly appointed state government officials: Rob Farrell, director of the Department of Forestry (DoF), Mike Rolband, director of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), and Matthew Wells, director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR).
Farrell serves as the eighth state forester of Virginia as well as the director of the DoF, which is responsible for protecting the forest resources of Virginia and ensuring trees and forests provide the greatest possible sustainable social, ecological, and economic benefits to the commonwealth. He joined the DoF as an area forester serving Gloucester and Mathews counties in 2000. He also served the agency as the first director of the forestland conservation program and as deputy state forester. In his opening statement at the symposium, he stated that two thirds of Virginia are covered in forest, a significant part of the commonwealth, and he supports and encourages good management of the forest. He stated that ""job number one is forest fire prevention,"" with which he believes the department has done an exceptional job, ""and our second mission is protecting the water during timber harvest."" He also stated that he is proud of the conservation easement program, a legal agreement between a landowner and a government agency or land trust that permanently limits future development of the land to protect its conservation values, while providing a tax reduction for the landowner.
Rolband founded Wetland Studies and Solutions Inc. (WSSI) in 1991 and grew his company into a multidisciplinary natural and cultural resources consulting firm with a staff of more than 200. His firm constructed the first LEED Gold facility in Virginia and utilized multiple low impact development practices for stormwater management in 2005. In 2014, WSSI was acquired by The Davey Tree Expert Co. and under Rolband's leadership, expanded to include offices in Maryland and across Virginia. WSSI assisted land developers and public works agencies navigate the Clean Water Act, Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act and local environmental regulations. During his talk at the symposium, Rolband stated that the DEQ has a strong foundation, and he wants to build on it to make it better. He cited four main initiatives:
1. ""One DEQ"": The DEQ has six regional offices and a central office and Rolband wants a better balance of the workload among the offices to improve efficiency.
2. Permitting Enhancement &amp; Evaluation Platform (PEEP): Rolband is developing a critical path management scheduling system for every class of permits that DEQ touches making the permitting process easier and more efficient. People applying for permits will be able to monitor the permit process online.
3. Stormwater Programs: Rolband plans on creating one comprehensive manual that does not expire. Currently there are five manuals that have conflicting rules and regulations. After the completion of the one manual, he plans to have training and certification requirements to reduce workloads.
4. Commodity Trading: There are streams, wetlands, and nutrients credits. Rolband currently sees there is a lack of information regarding supply, demand, and price. He wants a commodity trading platform that lets people buy and sell credits in real time and which get extinguished when associated with a permit used.
Wells has 20 years of experience related to Virginia politics, policy, and environmental advocacy. Most recently, he was the Senior Regional Manager for State Government Relations for WestRock, a global leader in sustainable fiber-based packaging solutions. Before joining WestRock in 2016, Wells held senior analyst and special advisory positions with Virginia's departments of Motor Vehicles and Alcohol Beverage Control. He holds a degree in foreign affairs from the University of Virginia and a certificate in sustainability from Virginia Commonwealth University. Wells stated that the parks and preserves are the ""backbone of our quality of life."" His focus will be on the Chesapeake Bay and the maintenance of the 2,700 dams in the state. He stated, ""We must take care of our people, so my first priority is safety."" He added that flood prevention and land conservation are also crucial.
A meaningful part of the annual symposium, is the announcement of the winner of the Captain Ron Erchul Environmental Leadership Award. This year's winner is Bettina Ring, the chief sustainability and diversity officer for the Sustainable Forestry Initiative. The award recognizes a Virginian who has made significant individual efforts to improve the environment. Members of Virginia's environmental community nominate candidates who are judged based on their vision, expertise, commitment, integrity, communication skills, accomplishments, and diplomacy. The award is named for the late VMI professor Ronald A. Erchul, Ph.D., founder of the Environment Virginia Symposium.
Ring is an innovative and thoughtful leader with more than 30 years of expertise in the public sector and nonprofit management, natural resources management, land and water conservation, agriculture and food systems, rural economic development, and public policy. During her very impactful career, she has served as Virginia's fourth Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry, as state forester (director of Virginia Department of Forestry), deputy state forester, senior vice president at American Forest Foundation, and in leadership roles with several other nonprofits.
Ring has been involved in the Virginia Department of Forestry water quality efforts since early in her career, worked on the Healthy Forested Watershed Project, and served on the Chesapeake Bay Principal Staff Committee for the last four years.
In addition to her trade missions and promotion of Virginia's No. 1 and No. 3 industries, Ring also worked with former Governor Ralph Northam '81 and the General Assembly to increase funding for Agriculture Best Management Practices, riparian buffers, and watershed positions, and most recently in the proposed funding for re-opening New Kent Forestry Center to expand seedling capacity in the state, Trees for Clean Water and urban tree canopy, establishing the first-ever state funding for urban and community forestry and land conservation including farmland preservation funding specifically designed to address heirs property issues.
She took an active role, working with the UVA Institute for Engagement and Negotiation, to put on the Governor's Summit on Equitable Collaboration.
""Ring is an outstanding leader who is very worthy of being named this year's Erchul Award winner,"" said Joe Maroon, executive director of the Virginia Environmental Endowment.
Each year, Virginia Military Institute donates $1,500 to a nonprofit environmental organization of the recipient's choice in their honor. Ring has requested that this donation be made to Virginia Natural Resources Leadership Institute.
Other awards presented at the symposium are the Governor's Environmental Excellence Awards, which recognize successful and innovative efforts that improve Virginia's environment. This year's gold medal winners are: Catawba Hospital for Greening of Government; the City of Harrisonburg Department of Public Works for the Harrisonburg urban forestry program; Coastal Virginia Ecotourism Alliance for the Virginia Water Trail; Fauquier County for Upper Rappahannock River Water Trail; George Mason University for Mason Sustainability Council's Circular Economy &amp; Zero Waste task force and the University of Virginia for waste minimization.
Silver medal winners are the City of Petersburg for Appomattox River Trail University Boulevard Overlook &amp; Trailhead; Virginia Tech for Plastic Pollution and Solid Waste Reduction Campus Wide Working Group and William &amp; Mary for institutionalized composting.
Receiving bronze medal awards are Arlington-Fairfax Chapter Inc., Izaak Walton League of America for their environmental management system; Chesterfield County for North Courthouse Library Neighborhood Connector Trail; Defense Supply Center Richmond for their fuel reduction program and Virginia Tech Office of Sustainability for their student internship program.
Receiving honorable mention is Hitachi Energy USA Inc. for their Paint Line Process Improvement Project and Smith Creek Watershed Partnership c/o Ridge to Reefs, Inc. for the Yancy Bioreactor.

"Breakthrough Energy Ventures, National Grid Partners and a Subsidiary of NextEra Energy Invest in TS Conductor to Meet the Growing Demand for Greener Electricity Grids",2021,11,"TS Conductor Corp., a pioneer in high-efficiency conductors for electricity grids, today announced that Breakthrough Energy Ventures, National Grid Partners and a subsidiary of NextEra Energy have joined Talkot and Hervé Touati in its oversubscribed Series A financing, for a total $25 million in funding. The new capital will be used to build the company's first state of the art manufacturing plant in the United States.
""We are thrilled to have Breakthrough Energy Ventures, National Grid Partners and a subsidiary of NextEra Energy investing in TS Conductor. Our mission is to make electricity networks greener. TS achieves that through a combination of energy efficiency and faster and cheaper renewable integration,"" said Dr. Jason Huang, CEO at TS Conductor Corp.
While the electricity generation segment of the energy industry has progressed to cleaner and more efficient solutions, the overhead conductor technology used by transmission and distribution grid operators has not materially changed since the emergence of Aluminum Core Steel Reinforced (ACSR) cables in 1908. ACSR still today represents over 95 percent of the utility cables deployed across the world.
According to <url normalizedValue=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketstudyreport.com%2Freports%2Fglobal-wires-and-cables-market-size-research&amp;esheet=52530605&amp;newsitemid=20211116005043&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Market+Study+Report%2C+LLC&amp;index=1&amp;md5=8c4b1aacc5a5f66b9662517a4f4079c9"">Market Study Report, LLC</url> , the global wires and cables market was estimated to represent $183 billion of sales in 2020, with an annual compounded growth rate anticipated to exceed 4 percent until 2028. Global investment in the power sector reached $780 billion in 2020 and was largely dominated by renewable power (48 percent) and electricity networks (32 percent) investments, according to the <url normalizedValue=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iea.org%2Freports%2Fworld-energy-investment-2021&amp;esheet=52530605&amp;newsitemid=20211116005043&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=International+Energy+Agency&amp;index=2&amp;md5=39ded247d7fe8dbc7923f343b9c723e9"">International Energy Agency</url> (IEA). While considerable, the IEA notes that current levels of renewable energy and energy efficiency investments still fall short of what is needed to maintain global temperatures well below a 2 ºC rise.
The UN climate targets create the need for new cable technologies that can reduce electricity network losses and accelerate the connection of wind and solar farms, which is one of the major bottlenecks of renewable energy expansion. Network losses amount to approximately 2000 TWh annually, or 6.7 times the electricity consumption of the U.K.
""Transmission is fundamentally important to our climate mission, yet it has seen limited innovation over the years. It is rare to find a transmission technology like TS Conductor with as much potential in terms of deployability, cost and efficiency,"" said Carmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures. ""TS Conductor will be a major enabler of increasing electricity demand and increasing penetration of renewables in a critical time. We are delighted to lead this round with a stand-out team and an outstanding technology.""
""National Grid has committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions 90 percent by 2040 and to net zero by 2050, and to accelerating the incorporation of wind, solar and battery storage in our grids in the UK and North America,"" said Lisa Lambert, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of National Grid and the President and Founder of National Grid Partners. ""There are few solutions enabling grid operators to reduce their electricity consumption, and TS Conductor is the most impressive solution I have encountered so far to decarbonize electricity grids. Their product, when combined with a top-notch management team, positions TS Conductor to be a leader in the market.""
TS Conductor was founded in 2018 by Rulong Chen, James Huang and Jason Huang, based on James Huang's patented conductor design. This new class of conductors is based on a unique combination of carbon composite and aluminum encapsulation of the composite core. The conductors can be installed with the same tools and operating procedures as ACSR cables. And they are compatible with industry standard field practice and can be used for:
Line reconductoring, allowing for the doubling of capacity of an existing line without having to change or retrofit any structures."
REAPING THE FRUIT OF A DECADE'S WORK IN THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO,2021,09,"The following information was released by the World Bank:
Trees with twisted trunks, countless waterfalls, fauna and flora resistant to annual droughts and periodic fires. This is the Cerrado, Brazil's second largest biome that spans an area of 2,036,448 km2 and is celebrated this September 11 across the country. Encompassing approximately 22% of Brazil's land, the Cerrado's high aquifer potential has earned it the ""water tank"" moniker for housing the springs of the three largest watersheds in South America. In total, an estimated 11,627 species of native plants have been catalogued in the biome, as well as 199 species of mammals, and a rich avifauna composed of 837 species[i].
Considered the area with the greatest agricultural potential on the planet from an economic perspective, the Cerrado is where most agricultural activities in Brazil take place, accounting for 60% of the country's grain production[ii]. In addition to its economic importance, the Cerrado carries social relevance as a place with traditional populations who subsist on the region's natural resources, in addition to indigenous peoples, geraizeiros, baba ueiras, riverside communities, vazanteiros and quilombola communities that, together, are part of Brazil's historical and cultural heritage and possess ancestral knowledge of the country's biodiversity.
In recognition of such rich biodiversity, ten years ago Brazil conceived the Brazil Investment Plan under the Forest Investment Program (FIP) aimed at the conservation and sustainable development of the Cerrado. I was part of the team that designed the program in 2011 and could hardly imagine then that FIP Brasil would become so relevant to the integration of government efforts aimed at environmental conservation and development in the Cerrado, which involve all 11 states located in the biome.
At the time, the government made the strategic decision to work with several ministries instead of just one, thus joining efforts to address the challenge of promoting conservation in the Cerrado. After a lengthy consultation process with the government and private institutions, researchers and traditional communities, the decision was made to use a portfolio of individual projects and the World Bank as the focal point for multilateral development banks involved in FIP in Brazil[LS1] , funded with support from the Climate Investment Fund (CIF).
In these ten years, the FIP Brazil has achieved significant and innovative results, improving production methods in the Cerrado, integrating institutions at different levels and fostering unity among traditional peoples and communities living in the region. Estimates show that these combined actions have already impacted the lives of 51.7 beneficiaries, 37,000 rural properties and 64 traditional communities so far.
Under the FIP ABC Cerrado project (ended in 2019), rural producers changed their properties in the field by recovering pastures and employing other low-carbon agricultural practices. These producers show their commitment to sustainable practices by investing 7 reais for each 1 Brazilian real put in by the project. Where once there was degraded pasture, today productive pastures and protected springs abound.
In late 2021, the activities under the FIP Monitoring project will come to a successful end. They will leave behind a legacy of reliable and publicly-accessible systems and data on deforestation, fire management, forest fire risk management, and estimating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from deforestation and fires in the Cerrado. The main outputs have already been delivered, organized and unified in the project's website.
DGM Brazil (Dedicated Grant Mechanism for Indigenous People and Local Communities), a project that the entire team cares about, will be delivering its results in early 2022. With 55 completed sub-projects under its belt, DGM Brasil not only strengthened the traditional communities and indigenous peoples of the Cerrado, but also presented an opportunity for indigenous peoples, quilombolas, geraizeiros and coconut breakers to sit together at the same table and begin a dialogue, joining forces to achieve common goals for the protection of the biome. Women have played a key role in this project, leading 13 of the 64 sub-projects, in addition to the National Steering Committee, currently headed by quilombola Lucely Pio.
FIP in Brazil activities will continue in the coming years with the Paisagens Rurais (Rural Landscapes) project, which promotes sustainable agricultural techniques, restoration and environmental conservation among rural producers in selected areas. FIP Rural Environmental Cadastre project also includes activities to formalize rural properties and adapt them to Brazil's environmental laws. FIP Coordination, in turn, continues to monitor and evaluate project activities and enable information exchanges and synergies across the entire portfolio.
A decade later, some of the things we planned from the outset continue to apply, such as efficient production practices and environmental conservation. But reality has imposed major challenges on us all, such as changes in legislation and public policies, changes to the market, exchange rate challenges and, finally, the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced us towards remote and virtual solutions.
As such, this Cerrado Day is an important milestone and a chance to look back at the path trailed by the projects so far and all the achievements made in this constant journey to conserve our Cerrado.

"GUARD MEMBERS IN 24 STATES, D.C. CALLED UP IN RESPONSE TO CIVIL UNREST",2020,05,"ARLINGTON, Va., May 29 -- The National Guard issued the following news release:
As of Sunday, National Guard Soldiers and Airmen were activated in 24 states and the District of Columbia in response to civil disturbances, bringing the total number of Guard members on duty in support of their governors to nearly 62,000.
This number represents activations for civil unrest, COVID-19 response, as well as state-specific disasters such as wildfires, flooding and other natural disasters.
The civil unrest response mission is expected to grow as governors assess the fluid situations in their states and call on the National Guard to assist.
""The hardest mission we do is responding in times of civil unrest,"" said Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau.
The activation of Guard members in response to civil unrest has unfolded in multiple cities in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Guard personnel assigned to these missions are trained, equipped and prepared to assist law enforcement authorities and first responders, said Lengyel.
""We plan, train and prepare for emergency response missions with our local, state, and federal partners,"" he said. ""We're part of the communities we serve. We know the police, fire departments and hospital workers. We know their capabilities because we live with their capabilities.""
Guard members are to perform a variety of mission sets including traffic control, support to law enforcement, transportation and communication support. They've also been called upon to assist with extinguishing fires burning as a result of the unrest.
""Aircrews were using forest fire equipment, including helicopter water buckets, to put out building fires at protests last night,"" said Lengyel.
The overall mission of Guard members is to assist local authorities and ensure safety.
""We're here to help and assist local authorities,"" said Lengyel. ""Our troops are here to protect life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety.""
Those Guard members called up are in a state active duty status and remain under the command and control of their respective governors, said Lengyel, adding those responding will continue to adhere to COVID-19 prevention measures.
""Governors have used Guard members many times during response efforts to support local and state law enforcement in a wide range of capacities, to include assisting in upholding the rule of law."" said Lengyel. ""While conditions may change, the National Guard's ability to respond is constant.""

This marks the first-ever instance of Israeli firefighters landing in the United States to assist in fighting fires.The fires, which started Aug. 
15, have been burning over 1.46 million acres and has destroyed about 2,800 structures as of Tuesday.The Israeli team, comprising officers and firefighters from the country's Fire and Rescue Services, rescue and forest fire[1] experts, and an Israeli Foreign Ministry representative, is expected to remain in the U.S. for nearly two weeks, according to a statementthe Israeli Foreign Ministry.[2] Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said the move represented 'close friendship between the nations' and 'excellent relations' that the countries share. 'I praise the members of the delegation and wish them success on their mission,' he was quoted as saying in the statement.Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg welcomed the crew Sunday with a message on Twitter. 'Today we welcomed a delegation of firefighters from Israel who arrived yesterday,' he wrote. 'Tomorrow they will report to the CA Office of Emergency Services and be dispatched to fires around the state. As a Jewish mayor, I'm particularly proud and happy to see them come to our aid.'At least 16,000 firefighters have been reportedly mobilized as of Monday across California to contain over 18 reported major fires raging across the state. According to Cal Fire, the wildfires, called the SCU Lightning Complex, are spotted in Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, and San Benito counties. The fires have burned 383,157 acres so far, with 60% containment. The SCU Lighting Complex[3] is the second-largest wildfire recorded in California history, and the LNU Lightning Complex, which has burned 375,209 acres across Napa, Sonoma, Solano, Lake, and Yolo counties, with 63% containment, was named as the third-largest wildfire in the state's history.Several U.S. states have extended their help to California and Gov. Gavin Newsom said he urged [4]countries like Australia and Canada also to rush assistance for California firefighters.

Linn County trying to stop proposed Douglas-fir National Monument -- again,2022,08,"Aug. 7—About 80 miles east of the Linn County Courthouse, an expanse of blue-green trees gives way to jagged Cascade peaks that burst clouds, channel rivers and form the crown of a could-be national monument.
Everything below, hundreds of thousands of acres of mostly Douglas fir, which, depending on whom you ask, is potential fire fuel, timber or heritage recreational space.
The proposed Douglas-fir National Monument is back up for discussion now that President Donald Trump is out of office, and it could soon reach President Joe Biden's desk for signature under the Antiquities Act of 1906.
Linn County's elected leadership isn't happy about that. Officials are seeking intervention from Oregon's U.S. senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, and Rep. Peter DeFazio.
On the other side, advocates hope the White House will hear their pleas — that formal protections for Douglas fir are long overdue.
Both sides say they're in the right. Neither is talking to the other.
'It's scary'
Their timber cold war started in 2015, when a coalition of environmental activists sought to blanket much of the Willamette National Forest in formal protections for old-growth trees.
The more than 530,000-acre swath of land, which includes parts of Linn, Marion and Jefferson counties, would be the largest national monument in Oregon. Douglas-fir would be the 14th largest of the nation's nearly 130 monuments.
Critics fear the monument would dictate how private timber growers can use their land or cut down their trees. But David Stone, president of Friends of Douglas-fir National Monument and one of the leading proponents, said monument rules would not apply to private landowners within the space, otherwise known as ""inholdings.""
Still, the county has its doubts.
""It's scary that people who don't live in the area are the ones who are out there proposing this monument,"" Linn County Commissioner Will Tucker said.
The Douglas-fir National Monument would sit mostly on the Willamette National Forest in the Cascade foothills. But those petitioning first Trump and now Biden seek to cover a patchwork set of wilderness areas, federally managed land and some 44,000 acres of private forests.
A Springfield-based nonprofit has pushed to establish Douglas-fir National Monument, taking aim at raising the prestige of its namesake tree.
The arguments go like this:
One side, the monument proponents, say Mature Douglas fir stabilizes soil, shades streams, scrubs and sequesters carbon from the air and has the potential to act as a balm on a warming climate.
The monument also would be a draw for hikers, campers and others who spend money in the mountainous eastern reaches of the Willamette Valley.
Meanwhile, federal protections ensure those trees mature, burn, fall as they did before the arrival of European settlers.
The other side says private landowners and timber operators already follow stringent logging practices which contain clearcuts to 120 acres, enforce stream buffers, and ensure roads and logging trucks aren't loading cool, clear-running water with soil.
They know what's best for their land, and the proposed monument would decommission roads potentially used by fire crews and all but ensure conflagrations in its mission to protect old-growth.
""I don't want to see the possibility of this going through without the county having a chance to weigh in because it puts new additional rules on a substantial portion of Linn County,"" Tucker said.
A different approach
But Stone maintains that one cannot, and should not, prevent fire in the backcountry, as it is part of the natural order of a forest.
His view is that private land and business owners in the proposed area make it their job to make their buildings ""fire safe,"" clearing nearby trees and anything that burns from around those structures. It's a prevention strategy.
""That's how you deal with fire,"" Stone said. ""You make your home, stores and buildings fire safe and they won't burn.""
Cyndi Anderson, a Brownsville tree advocate, said embracing changing views of land management is part of the succession of forests, too.
""There is plenty of private timber land. We don't have to mess with public land,"" Anderson said.
Anderson is a leader of a local chapter of Great Old Broads for Wilderness, an activist group that has prioritized preserving mature Douglas firs.
Stone belongs to that group, she said, and the local Broads overlap with legal and lobby concerns, such as Cascadia Wildlands and Oregon Wild, in trying to establish protections for mature evergreens.
When the monument was first pitched seven years ago under President Barack Obama, it didn't seem realistic, Anderson said.
Now, even if Biden chooses to pass on the proposal, she'll dwell on the upside: focusing attention on mature Douglas fir stands — a big change from the 1980s, when she said she began advocacy work in Oregon's forests.
""Even to entertain the idea is a big step forward,"" Anderson said.
The Broads saw recent success measuring trees, fish-spawning creek beds, and counting wildlife with Cascadia Wildland. Those surveys informed a Forest Service analysis that led the Sweet Home Ranger District to weigh pros and cons of logging and leave mature forests on the Santiam intact.
""That felt like just a big win. For the climate, for Willamette National Forest,"" Anderson said.
The groundswell of apparent consideration for mature Douglas fir shows that managing forests for climate, wildlife and water quality can co-exist with private timber interests.
""Just leave it intact,"" Anderson said. ""We need it.""
History
Talks of a Douglas fir national monument began in 2015 by a coalition of environmental groups. At the time, they were eyeing 481,324 acres. Seven years later, the total acreage has risen to more than 530,000 and includes land that abuts the Warm Springs Reservation.
The proposed monument would include all of the Middle Santiam and Menagerie Wilderness areas, Quartzville Creek Wild and Scenic River and a portion of the Mount Jefferson Wilderness.
Then in 2016 with Donald Trump's ascension, the proposal screeched to a halt. The Antiquities Act authorizes the president to proclaim national monuments on federal lands that contain historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific interest.
While more uncommon, a national monument also can be established by an Act of Congress.
With Biden in office, the proposal has gained momentum once again. On April 22 — Earth Day — the president launched the America the Beautiful Initiative, which supports his goal to conserve 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.
Within a week of this announcement, The Coalition to Protect America's National Parks named the Douglas-fir proposal and five others in a letter to Biden, urging him to declare them all national monuments.
The monument's supporters haven't heard back from the president, although Tucker claims a Washington, D.C. lobbyist — whom he prefers not to name — informed him that the proposal could soon be up for discussion.
In response, Tucker and his two colleagues on the Board of Commissioners, Sherrie Sprenger and Roger Nyquist, penned a letter to DeFazio, Merkley and Wyden, asking them to stop the proposed monument. Tucker said he plans to write another directly to the president.
This is not the first letter Tucker has written to stop the monument. He sent one by himself a few years ago. He never heard back.
Wyden declined to comment on this story, according to staff.
Merkley communications staff responded in an email, indicating no information would be available before press time. A ranking DeFazio staffer took a phone call requesting information but did not respond before press time.
""I know my writing is falling on deaf ears,"" he said. ""All I'm asking for is five seconds. This proposal takes forest management in the wrong direction.""
Lack of input
Although the proposed monument shares a border with the Warm Springs Reservation, neither the proponents nor the opponents have spoken directly with tribal leaders to ask their opinion.
Stone said he was able to reach the tribe one time, but representatives said they were too busy to get involved with the campaign and ultimately did not give their input one way or the other.
""I've reached out to them a number of times, and they say it's a nice proposal, not knowing much about it. So I'm not implying they endorse it,"" he said. ""We don't have evidence of active use (of the proposed land) currently.""
Tucker said that while he has not yet contacted the tribe, he is confident that its members will be ""equally as concerned.""
""I think they feel that the rules and regulations placed on their tribal lands have been changed without their involvement,"" Tucker said. ""When you take more lands and place more rules on them, the tribe's trust of the government is low for exactly this reason.""
Combating climate change
Both sides of the Douglas-fir debate disagree with the other's way of combating climate change.
Those who are against the monument believe logging is an essential part of maintaining a forest. The management of timber to sequester carbon, Tucker said, is one of the most important things that needs to be done, in addition to planting new trees.
The vast majority of timber sales in Linn County are from private lands, a yearly average 237,384 million board feet of timber compared to 34,703 million from public lands. Private sales generally increased between 2010 and 2019, logging 263,284 million board feet in the most recent year of data.
""As we are watching these fires burn, it just makes me want to cry because had that timber been cleaned up, the fuel wouldn't have been there as much as it did,"" Tucker said.
Stone, however, said a forest fire is either the beginning of a new forest or the continuation of a current forest. In his view, fire is a natural disturbance that is beneficial to fish and wildlife, and logging after a fire removes essential wood mass needed for the forest to recover.
Tucker also mentioned that Douglas firs do not need protection; in fact, they grow so abundantly he has some in his own yard.
""To call it a Douglas fir monument just shocks me,"" Tucker said.
Cascade-Siskiyou litigation
Linn County is currently involved in a lawsuit with the U.S. government regarding the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument, located in Southwest Oregon and Northern California.
President Bill Clinton in 2000 declared the range a national monument. In 2017, Obama expanded the monument by 48,000 acres.
Many industry groups, including Linn County, believe this expansion violated the Oregon and California Revested Lands Act of 1937, which requires forest maintenance for 2.4 million acres of forestland across 18 counties in Western Oregon.
The county lost, appealed, then won, and the decision was once again appealed. The Department of Justice in February 2020 put both sets of litigation on hold until the DC District Court issues its final order on cases related to the Bureau of Land Management's resource management plans.
Lack of communication
The Linn County Commissioners and Friends of Douglas-fir National Monument have never spoken directly about the proposal.
Stone, who lives in Springfield, said he's interested in working with the people of Linn County to better understand their needs, and he's not trying to shut out their voices.
""You can't just go into a rural county and just ignore what's important to them and expect to succeed,"" he said.
He referenced the economic impact study posted on his website, <url normalizedValue=""http://www.douglasfirnationalmonument.org"">www.douglasfirnationalmonument.org</url>, which finds Western rural communities with national monuments do better economically than adjacent counties without national monuments.
""It's obvious. If you drive through downtown Sweet Home,"" he said, ""there's all those boarded-up stores. You get to see the suffering that happens in a rural county in the West that doesn't have protected land.""
Stone said he is confident that the proposed monument will be established, as he's been in contact with Wyden, Merkley and DeFazio for several years about it.
""As we see, climate change is wrecking everything we hold dear,"" Stone said. ""Protection of the land is real important; it's real urgent right now.""

Stone, who lives in Springfield, said he's interested in working with the people of Linn County to better understand their needs, and he's not trying to shut out their voices.
""You can't just go into a rural county and just ignore what's important to them and expect to succeed,"" he said.
He referenced the economic impact study posted on his website, <url normalizedValue=""http://www.douglasfirnationalmonument.org"">www.douglasfirnationalmonument.org</url>, which finds Western rural communities with national monuments do better economically than adjacent counties without national monuments.
""It's obvious. If you drive through downtown Sweet Home,"" he said, ""there's all those boarded-up stores. You get to see the suffering that happens in a rural county in the West that doesn't have protected land.""
Stone said he is confident that the proposed monument will be established, as he's been in contact with Wyden, Merkley and DeFazio for several years about it.
""As we see, climate change is wrecking everything we hold dear,"" Stone said. ""Protection of the land is real important; it's real urgent right now.""

Jonathon Golden What do we owe wildland firefighters?,2021,06,"“It’s like having gasoline out there,” said Brian Steinhardt, forest fire zone manager for Prescott and Coconino national forests in Arizona, in a recent AP story about the increasingly fire-prone West.
Now something else is happening — and at the worst possible time.
Federal firefighters are leaving the workforce and taking their training and experience with them. The inability of federal agencies to offer competitive pay and benefits is creating hundreds of wildland firefighting vacancies.
Vacancies, of course, limit how much federal firefighters can do. If Western communities want to be protected, they need to ensure that their firefighters receive better pay and benefits.
In my 11 years of work as a wildland firefighter, I’ve managed aircraft, trained people and run fires myself, but I also did outreach and recruitment for the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. I know how hard it is for hiring managers to make 2,000 hours of grueling work, crammed into six exhausting months, sound appealing when the pay is $13.45/hour. The pay doesn’t come close to matching the true demands or everyday dangers of the job.
Federal wildland firefighters, by necessity, are transient workers. During the fire season — now nearly year-round — they must be available to travel anywhere in the United States at any time. And to advance in their career, they have to move to other federal duty stations to gain more qualifications.
Finding affordable housing has always been a problem for career firefighters on a federal salary. To make matters worse, federal agencies revoked the “Transfer of Station” stipend for career employees, which helped offset the cost of moving. Just recently, a national forest supervisor also revoked a “boot stipend.” It might sound minor, but it isn’t When you’re in the firefighting business, boots tough enough to save your life can easily cost you $500.
Some states aren’t relying on the government to act quickly. “We aren’t just waiting for the next crisis to hit,” said California Gov. Gavin Newsom, in establishing an $80.74 million Emergency Fund that delivers an additional 1,256 seasonal firefighters to boost CALFIRE’s ranks. This Emergency Fund is in addition to the governor’s $1 billion budget request for California’s Wildfire and Forest Resilience Action Plan.
In Washington, state legislators unanimously passed a $125 million package that will enable the state’s Natural Resources Department to hire 100 more firefighters. The legislation furthers the state’s efforts to restore forest health and creates a $25 million fund to ensure community preparedness around the state.
Utah’s House Bill 65, recently signed into law, appropriates money to help Utah’s communities offset the cost of wildfire suppression. Most importantly, it commissions a study to evaluate the current pay plan for firefighters within Utah’s Natural Resources Department.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Casey Snider, was amazed to learn that frontline wildland firefighters make more money at McDonald’s “These positions are critical,” he said. “They are the first ones on fires.” This year, Utah has already had five times the number of wildfires it normally experiences in a year.
And firefighters are organizing and speaking up. The Grassroots Wildland Firefighters is working to halt the exodus of firefighters from federal agencies by advocating for pay parity with state and local fire protection agencies. The group also supports initiatives to assist the physical and mental health of firefighters and their families. The statistics they highlight are shocking Wildland firefighters have a suicide rate 30 times higher than the average. They also experience high incidences of cardiovascular disease and lung cancer.
There is talk on the federal level of creating a permanent, year-round firefighting workforce. I think this is a necessary step, but it won’t fix the workforce capacity issue unless increased pay and benefits are used to encourage the recruitment and retention of federal firefighters.
We all know that today’s wildfires are longer, more damaging and more frequent than ever before. We also know that men and women are putting their lives on the line for less than they’d earn at a McDonald’s.
Our firefighters do all this to protect our lives, our forests and our communities. We owe them at least a living wage and a chance for a healthy life. I hope more states and legislators will start paying attention. This is a debt that needs to be paid.

Senate Energy &amp; Natural Resources Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Coconino County Board Supervisor Babbott,2020,11,"The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests and Mining issued the following testimony by Art Babbott, Coconino County board supervisor for District 1, as part of a hybrid hearing on the Forest Health and Biomass Act (S. 4603) on Nov. 18:
Thank you for holding today's hearing to discuss S. 4603, Forest Health and Biomass Energy Act, and for inviting me to testify on behalf of the critical need for biomass energy to support forest health across the Western United States. On behalf of Coconino County, I want to express my thanks to Senator McSally for working with the County to introduce S. 4603 and the subcommittee for highlighting this critical issue.
My name is Art Babbott, County Supervisor from Coconino County. During my time on the Board of Supervisors, forest restoration has been one of the top policy priorities for the County as catastrophic wildfire and flood represent the number one public health and safety risk for the County. As part of that priority, I have been honored to serve as Chair of the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), which I will discuss later.
Coconino County, the second largest county in the contiguous United States, consisting of 18,661 square miles of land, 27 percent, or over three million acres, of which are owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service. We are home to the largest Ponderosa Pine forest in the world, making healthy forests one of our top interests and priorities as we work to protect lives and communities from the impacts of catastrophic wildfires and post-wildfire flooding.
In the past ten years, Coconino County has experienced four major wildfires on federal land that has negatively impacted us through the tragic loss of life, homes and businesses, decreased property values as well as social and economic burdens on our communities. Just one year ago in my district, the Museum Fire, which burned less than 2,000 acres, cost the U.S. Forest Service over $11 million to suppress and rehabilitate and cost Coconino County nearly $2 million in response to the post-wildfire flooding threat to the City of Flagstaff.
While forest restoration has been on the hearts and minds of our citizens for years, we are currently in the eighth year of a ten-year landscape scale restoration project called the Four Forest Restoration Initiative or 4FRI, an effort to restore 300,000 acres of forest over 10 years. In those eight years, the contractor has only been successful at treating 14,000 acres. While there are many factors that have played into the small amount of acres being treated, the lack of a market for the biomass (non-merchantable trees, limbs and tops) that is created from forest restoration treatments continues to be the bottleneck.. This is quite evident by the fact that a mere 125 miles away, where a bioenergy plant is located in Snowflake, Arizona, industry has been able to treat over SIX TIMES as many acres in the same timeframe precisely because there is a market for biomass. Support for biomass energy facilities as well as the ""High Hazard Area Wood Biomass Fund"" in S. 4603 to fund the processing, removal and hauling of biomass to end markets that can be hundreds of miles away from the source, is critical for increasing the pace and scale of forest restoration on federal lands.
In the early 1990's, much of Arizona's forest industry ""left town"" due to increasing litigation on federal timber sales. Add to that the Forest Service policy to put every forest fire out, we have created conditions where the forest is overstocked with trees and is a virtual tinderbox waiting to combust. Northern Arizona University's Ecological Restoration Institute cites that pre-1900, tree densities in Arizona's forests averaged around 24 trees per acre due to the frequent lightning caused fires naturally thinning the forest. However, that average today has skyrocketed to well over 1,200 trees per acre. The goal of forest restoration is to reduce the tree density to a healthy average of 80 trees per acre, allowing for the re-introduction of wildfire back into our fire adapted ecosystem. Attempting to do that work primarily through prescribed fire is too risky and not feasible based on the current density of trees. However, mechanical thinning treatments brings a multitude of benefits, although success depends on markets being made available for the forest products and biomass. One of the greatest benefits of mechanized thinning operations, aside from creating a healthy, fire-resistant forest, is the creation of well-paying jobs in some of the most rural areas of the country where they are desperately needed.
Biomass energy plays a significant role in the success rate of forest restoration in Arizona and yet has struggled to get support from state and federal lawmakers. Biomass energy is the only viable option, at this time, in our efforts to thin 30,000 to 50,000 acres per year for the next twenty years as we work diligently to improve forest health and reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires across the West. We often look only at the cost of bioenergy when determining its viability and knowing that it has a higher cost than green energy systems like solar and wind. Therefore, it often gets overlooked. However, we must not forget that the ecosystem benefits resulting from forest restoration treatments that supply the biomass for energy, is creating healthy forests and watersheds, improved wildlife habitat, protecting communities and lives from catastrophic wildfires and the negative air quality impacts, as well as recreational and economic opportunities within our national forest lands. S. 4603 is critical for support of biomass removal from federal lands and biomass energy to reduce the amount of carbon emissions from wildfire, open-burning fire and prescribed fire. In addition, the financial impact from forest restoration, made possible by having biomass energy as an end market for forest by-products, is the reduction of catastrophic wildfires that have cost the federal government nearly $3.4 billion in suppression costs alone in 2020, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Furthermore, it is estimated that the total economic impact from wildfires in 2020 will reach between $130 to $150 billion in losses.
The facts on the ground in our region prove out the need for biomass as a tool to dispose of the forest products in our area. Senator McSally's legislation, S. 4603, is a critical step towards creating this policy goal and funding that will plant the seeds for biomass utilization in forest restoration efforts in Arizona and elsewhere across the West.
In Arizona, where we have only one 30 MW bioenergy plant, there is a need for an additional 90 MW of biomass energy to consume the biomass residue that will be produced from the Four Forest Restoration Initiative. Over the last several years, the bioenergy facility captured over 98 percent of the particulate matter (PM) 2.5 created by burning biomass for energy. The EPA has published that ""Wildland fires now account for 40 percent of the total PM emitted in the country, making it a major source of the pollutant, which causes lung and health problems."" Consider that against all particulate matter emitted from vehicles, power generation, industrial facilities, etc. forest fire represents 40 percent of the PM emitted.
In conclusion, it is critical that the federal government upholds its responsibility to the American people in supporting the most viable and economic way to dispose of the millions of tons of small diameter trees, limbs and tops (biomass) that result from forest restoration projects across the West and more specifically in Arizona, where there are no other industry markets available, allowing for more acres to be treated each year. Without your support, we will continue to see catastrophic wildfires ravage the landscape and watersheds, turning once beautiful forests into a desolate wasteland of ash and dust. I applaud the subcommittee for holding this important hearing today and urge you to pass S. 4603 to protect our fragile forest ecosystem in the West.
