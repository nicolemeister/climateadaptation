The Club will make no further comment at this time.  \u2014 Nottingham Forest (@NFFC) October 18, 2025 It was Postecoglou's first job since being fired by Tottenham at the end of last season despite leading Spurs to the Europa League title to break their 17-year trophy drought.  Forest lost six and drew the other two of its eight games under Postecoglou. That included four losses from five in the league, scoring just one goal in the process, to leave Forest hovering just above the bottom three.  Nuno was fired despite leading Forest into Europe following a very public falling-out with Marinakis, reportedly stemming from a breakdown in relations with the club\u2019s recently hired global head of football, Edu Gaspar. Postecoglou seemed an odd choice as the replacement, given his preferred style of play \u2014 on the front foot and attacking \u2014 differed to Nuno's and the squad in place at the City Ground.  If the idea was for Postecoglou to bring a more expansive approach to Forest, it didn't materialize. In five league games under the Australian, the team scored one goal.  There were loud jeers at the fulltime whistle at the Chelsea game.  Who next?  There was no immediate word of a replacement but British media has already reported that Sean Dyche, the former Burnley and Everton manager, was in line to take over should Forest fire Postecoglou.  Dyche was sacked by Everton in January. He was a youth-team player at Forest before a career spent at lower-league clubs.  His direct and pragmatic playing style is more similar to Nuno's than Postecoglou's.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57966080426</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H0S-YYY3-RRVJ-T1BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NBC Los Angeles</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 18, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000668</classCode><className>EXECUTIVE MOVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp; TRAINERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000512</classCode><className>DISMISSALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QD4</classCode><className>NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The minister attributed this growth to policy reforms and increased private sector participation, according to an official statement.  Dr Singh emphasised that satellite communication will serve as the backbone of India's digital infrastructure and play a decisive role in connecting remote regions where terrestrial networks face geographical barriers. With more than 70 per cent of new ATMs being installed in rural areas, he said satellite communications would be vital for ensuring financial inclusion and expanding digital services.  Programmes like SVAMITVA have already provided land ownership rights to more than 2.4 crore rural property owners across 1.61 lakh villages through satellite mapping, the minister said. Satellites are now integral to disaster management, daily forest fire monitoring, and agricultural yield assessments, in addition to powering flagship schemes like Gati Shakti for infrastructure planning and NavIC for navigation.  The minister said India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s space diplomacy was strengthening through missions such as the upcoming Chandrayaan-5 in collaboration with Japan and the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission. Neighbouring countries, too, are increasingly dependent on Indian satellites for disaster management and communication support, he added.  \"Seventy per cent of our space technology is dedicated to development and ease of living, not just rocket launches,\" Dr Singh said.  The minister also said India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost-effective missions, expanding private partnerships, and ambitious space roadmap are positioning the country as a global leader.  Chandrayaan-3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic soft landing near the Moon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s south pole in 2023 earned India global recognition, including the World Space Award, at roughly half the cost of comparable international missions. Commercially, India has launched 433 foreign satellites, generating over $190 million and 270 million euros in revenue, and the country plans to set up its own Bharatiya Antariksh Station by 2035.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57884794804</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GXM-8H83-RRK5-536K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"414\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ProKerala.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 8, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DQ7E</classCode><className>EARTH OBSERVATION SATELLITES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DT12</classCode><className>TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002286</classCode><className>SPACE TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DN68</classCode><className>SPACE PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002280</classCode><className>ROCKETS &amp;

The embassy\u2019s statement says the Spanish Ministry of Internal Affairs has declared a high-level emergency in multiple regions\u2014namely Galicia, Castile and Le\u00f3n, and Extremadura. Citizens are being urged to remain vigilant, steer clear of fire-affected zones, adhere strictly to official guidance, and, if needed, contact the embassy\u2019s hotline at +34 691 387 221, or dial the emergency number 112.  Spain is currently enduring one of the most destructive wildfire episodes in recent memory. Over 115,000 hectares have burned in just the past week in Galicia and Castile and Le\u00f3n. The total area affected in 2025 has already nearly doubled the annual average, exceeding 157,000 hectares.  The fires have claimed at least three lives, including volunteer firefighters, and prompted mass evacuations across multiple regions.

The Australian manager lasted just 39 days at the club. The decision comes following a 3-0 home defeat to Chelsea.  Nottingham Forest have sacked head coach Ange Postecoglou after he failed to win any of his eight games in charge of the club. The decision came just 20 minutes after Forest\u2019s 3-0 home defeat to Chelsea on Saturday, October 18.  In an official statement, the club said: \u201cNottingham Forest Football Club can confirm that after a series of disappointing results and performances, Ange Postecoglou has been relieved of his duties as head coach with immediate effect.\u201d  STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD  Nottingham Forest Football Club can confirm that after a series of disappointing results and performances, Ange Postecoglou has been relieved of his duties as head coach with immediate effect.  The Club will make no further comment at this time.  \u2014 Nottingham Forest (@NFFC) October 18, 2025  Postecoglou was appointed as Forest\u2019s coach on September 9 after the departure of Nuno Espirito Santo. However, his time at the club lasted only 39 days, during which Forest lost six matches and drew two.  The Australian coach faced criticism from fans after a string of poor performances, including a 2-0 defeat to Newcastle United and a loss to Danish club FC Midtjylland, where supporters chanted \u201csacked in the morning.\u201d  After the Chelsea defeat, Postecoglou left the ground immediately, skipping media duties. Within 20 minutes, the club confirmed his dismissal through a statement. The club is yet to announce who will replace Postecoglou.  It was Postecoglou\u2019s first job since being fired by Tottenham at the end of last season despite leading Spurs to the Europa League title to break their 17-year trophy drought.  Forest lost six and drew the other two of its eight games under Postecoglou. That included four losses from five in the league, scoring just one goal in the process, to leave Forest hovering just above the bottom three.  STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD  Nuno was fired despite leading Forest into Europe following a very public falling-out with owner Evangelos Marinakis, reportedly stemming from a breakdown in relations with the club\u2019s recently hired global head of football, Edu Gaspar.  Postecoglou seemed an odd choice as the replacement, given his preferred style of play \u2014 on the front foot and attacking \u2014 differed to Nuno\u2019s and the squad in place at the City Ground.  If the idea was for Postecoglou to bring a more expansive approach to Forest, it didn\u2019t materialize. In five league games under the Australian, the team scored one goal.  There were loud jeers at the fulltime whistle at the Chelsea game.  There was no immediate word of a replacement but British media has already reported that Sean Dyche, the former Burnley and Everton manager, was in line to take over should Forest fire Postecoglou.  Dyche was sacked by Everton in January. He was a youth-team player at Forest before a career spent at lower-league clubs.  STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD  His direct and pragmatic playing style is more similar to Nuno\u2019s than Postecoglou\u2019s.

Surpassing the annual record of 988,524 hectares burnt in 2017, the figure reached 1,015,731 hectares by midday Thursday, representing an area larger than Cyprus.  This calculation is based on a total compiled by AFP from estimates by country by EFFIS, at a time when Spain and Portugal are still battling wildfires.  Four countries in the European Union -- Spain, Cyprus, Germany, and Slovakia -- have already experienced their worst year in two decades of existing data.  Spain is struggling with numerous fires in the west of the country, which have claimed four lives. By far it is the most affected EU country by fires, with more than 400,000 hectares burnt, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the EU total.  Portugal, which holds the EU record of 563,530 hectares burnt in 2017, is the second-most affected EU country. It has never had an area of this size (nearly 274,000 hectares) burnt as of August 21.  Romania follows with 126,000 hectares while in France, 35,600 hectares of forest have been reduced to ashes, mostly in the Aude region, which was ravaged by a massive fire in early August.  These calculations by EFFIS, a component of the European climate monitor Copernicus, only take into account fires that have burnt areas of at least 30 hectares.  lam-eab/dc</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57507235695</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJC-H5C3-RS28-S176-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"297\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Yahoo!

The 256-page document titled 'Himachal Pradesh Human Development Report 2025: Building the Future in a Climate Impacted World', prepared by the Department of Environment and Science in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), was released by Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu.    Around 1,700 people lost their lives in the past five monsoon seasons, the report said.  According to the report, water stress is intensifying with 70 per cent of traditional water sources drying up or under duress due to erratic precipitation, forcing several villages to depopulate.  Forest fire incidents have also surged from 856 in 2022-2023 to 2,580 cases in 2024-25, it said.  Average annual temperatures have risen by 1.5 degrees Celsius since 1901, with temperatures projected to rise to 2-3 degrees Celsius by the mid-century, the report said, warning that climate change can impact economic development through rising temperatures, extreme precipitation or cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) and forest fires.  Glaciers are retreating at rates exceeding 50 metres per year while the creation of new glacial lakes has increased the risk of GLOF.  The number of glacial lakes in Sutlej basin alone increased from 562 in 2019 to 1,048 in 2023, with similar trends observed in Chenab and Ravi basins. GLOF risks were highest in Kullu and Kinnaur districts, the report said.  It also assessed economic disruptions in agriculture, construction, and tourism sectors and said an estimated Rs 10,000 crore is required to augment the state's adaptability to climate crisis.  Releasing the report, Sukhu said the document reflects the state's progress, resilience and aspirations of its people. \"It is a matter of pride that according to the Human Development Report-2025, the average Human Development Index (HDI) of Himachal Pradesh is 0.78, higher than the national average of 0.63.\"  However, analysis of the climate-adjusted HDI at the district level suggested that the overall development in the state was more resilient to potential hazards.  Expressing concern over climate change, Sukhu said it has emerged as a serious global issue and if a sustainable solution was not worked out immediately, both present and future generations would have to face its severe consequences.  He further said the state has recently achieved the distinction of becoming a fully literate state, with literacy rate at 99.30 per cent, while the poverty rate in the state is below 7 per cent. Infant mortality rate has dropped to 21 per 1,000 live births and life expectancy has increased to 72 years, he added.  During this year's monsoon, Himachal has suffered heavy losses due to climate change patterns. From June to September, 47 cloudbursts, 98 flash floods, and 148 major landslides were reported in the state, and 270 people died in rain-related incidents, according to data provided by the state emergency operation centre.  Sukhu said currently the mountains, rivers, forests and glaciers are victims of global warming, due to which the state is grappling with problems like excessive rainfall, floods and landslides.  He said the world must act as one family and join hands to conserve the environment, ensuring planned economic development.  Stressing that the future must be human-centric and climate-resilient, he reiterated several initiatives started by the state government aimed at reducing the impact of global warming like use of solar energy, electric vehicles and others.  This is the first state human development report in India that examines the critical intersection between human development and climate change, providing climate-adjusted HDI which assesses how climate change is reshaping development outcomes, UNDP representative Angela Lusigi said.  Policy frameworks such as the State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC), green budgeting, Natural Farming Mission, and promotion of solar and hydrogen energy projects have been highlighted as positive initiatives in the report.  The report said \"business as usual\" is no longer an ideal approach and climate change requires urgent cross-sectoral action.  People, especially women, leading the change through local institutions should be at the heart of climate action, the report stressed, adding that data and technology would enable more effective decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58035719236</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H2T-CYD3-RT38-T166-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"807\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Deccan Chronicle</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 28, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>In-dex Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>301A</className><className>TKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: JP3153310002</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLY1</classCode><className>MONSOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001039</classCode><className>LITERACY &amp;

But with the advent of chatbots, people are seeking legal, medical, sexual, and other interactions that involve their most intimate and personal thoughts, queries and acts. And people believe it\u2019s just between them and their chatbot. It\u2019s not.    On New Year\u2019s Day, Jonathan Rinderknecht purportedly asked ChatGPT: \u201cAre you at fault if a fire is lift because of your cigarettes,\u201d misspelling the word \u201clit.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d ChatGPT replied. Ten months later, he is now being accused of having started a small blaze that authorities say reignited a week later to start the devastating Palisades fire.    Mr. Rinderknecht, who has pleaded not guilty, had previously told the chatbot how \u201camazing\u201d it had felt to burn a Bible months prior, according to a federal complaint, and had also asked it to create a \u201cdystopian\u201d painting of a crowd of poor people fleeing a forest fire, while a crowd of rich people mocked them behind a gate.       There are four types of privileged communications: Lawyer/client, doctor/patient, priest/penitent and spousal. There are reasons that these communications are protected by law.    All legal privileges rest on the idea that certain relationships \u2014 lawyer and client, doctor and patient, priest and penitent \u2014 serve a social good that depends on candor. Without assurance of privacy, people self-censor and society loses the benefits of honesty.    Historian Nils Gilman sees the problem as one of self-censorship, and thus undermining the \u201cbenefits of honesty.\u201d This seems somewhat optimistic and theoretical. People don\u2019t self-censor even when no privilege is involved. People tell their neighbors, buddies, garage mechanics and pretty much anyone who will listen all nature of personal information they would prefer not be made public. The problem isn\u2019t that people self-censor, but that people can\u2019t control themselves, and end up having their words used against them.    When it comes to the traditional legal privileges, the law has determined that the need for confidentiality is more important than the need to find any evidence against a person and nail them with it. Yes, it\u2019s because of the inherent need for confidentiality in the nature of the relationship. Yes, it\u2019s a means of assuring honest communication that\u2019s vital to the nature of the relationship. No, it\u2019s not just because of a concern that people will lie to their lawyer or doctor, but because the sanctity of the relationship is different than communications with one\u2019s BFF.    So where does a chatbot fit in?    People speak increasingly freely to A.I. systems, not as diaries but as partners in conversation. That\u2019s because these systems hold conversations that are often indistinguishable from human dialogue. The machine seemingly listens, reasons and provides responses \u2014 in some cases not just reflecting but shaping how users think and feel. A.I. systems can draw users out, just as a good lawyer or therapist does. Many people turn to A.I. precisely because they lack a safe and affordable human outlet for taboo or vulnerable thoughts.    Chatbots are replacing lawyers, doctors, therapists and best friends. The engagement may seem, to the user, to be little different than the real deal, and certainly easier and far cheaper, even if largely unreliable. And users often fail to grasp that chatbots not only remember what you said, but make your queries readily available to its owner and, subject to certain limitations, the government.    At present, most digital interactions fall under the Third-Party Doctrine, which holds that information voluntarily disclosed to other parties \u2014 or stored on a company\u2019s servers \u2014 carries \u201cno legitimate expectation of privacy.\u201d This doctrine allows government access to much online behavior (such as Google search histories) without a warrant.    But when chatbots are used in lieu of lawyers and doctors, should users get the benefit of privilege that would apply if they were the real deal?    But are A.I. conversations \u201cvoluntary disclosures\u201d in this sense? Since many users approach these systems not as search engines but as private counselors, the legal standard should evolve to reflect that expectation of discretion. A.I. companies already hold more intimate data than any therapist or lawyer ever could. Yet they have no clear legal duty to protect it.    Gilman argues that the law should evolve to recognize the way people use chatbots and clothe them in privilege which would apply if they were communicating with actual lawyers or doctors rather than a computer.    A.I. interaction privilege should mirror existing legal privileges in three respects. First, communications with the A.I. for the purpose of seeking counsel or emotional processing should be protected from forced disclosure in court. Users could designate protected sessions through app settings or claim privilege during legal discovery if the context of the conversation supports it. Second, this privilege must incorporate the so-called duty to warn principle, which obliges therapists to report imminent threats of harm. If an A.I. service reasonably believes a user poses an immediate danger to self or others or has already caused harm, disclosure should be not just permitted, but obligated. And third, there must be an exception for crime and fraud. If A.I. is used to plan or execute a crime, it should be discoverable under judicial oversight.    That user may mistake a bot for a lawyer or doctor somehow make a bot the equivalent of a lawyer or doctor? Are bots liable for malpractice? Of course not, just as asking for your neighbor\u2019s legal or medical advice over the backyard fence wouldn\u2019t give rise to a malpractice claim for bad advice. People do it all the time, with stunning honesty, and yet the confession is readily available for testimony against the speaker in court. Bummer, neighbor.    We use privilege to encourage people to speak honestly with doctors and lawyers, and protect those communications because they are doctors and lawyers and should not be punished for speaking with candor. But there is no reason why the law would similarly encourage people to seek legal or medical advice from a chatbot.    Much as Dr. Gilman has legitimate concerns about the use to which people put chatbots, and the use to which the government puts people\u2019s \u201cconfessions\u201d to chatbots, the better answer is to require that chatbots notify users that their communications with a computer aren\u2019t privileged and can be used against them in court. Will this stifle communication with chatbots? You bet it will, and given the quality of AI information on matters of life and death importance, that\u2019s hardly a bad thing. The danger isn\u2019t that communications with a chatbot aren\u2019t privileged, but that chatbot\u2019s answers may ruin people\u2019s lives, and even kill people. This is not something that\u2019s so vital to society that it deserves to be encouraged and protected.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58142152129</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H5N-0KV3-RSP2-92BC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1222\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Simple Justice</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>November 10, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>As Partners Co Ltd</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>160A</className><className>TKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: JP3119840001</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N621399QC</classCode><className>PHYSICIANS &amp;

When a forest fire broke out in January of the same year, the defendant was flying a drone to keep watch over the area around a friend's house, but after flying it for a while, he lost communication with the drone.  The drone collided with a Super Scooper that was fighting the fire, creating a hole approximately 3' x 6' in its left wing and rendering it unable to fly. The Super Scooper was repeatedly pumping approximately 12,000 gallons of seawater and dropping it from the air over the fire at the time. At the time of the collision, the Federal Aviation Administration had issued a temporary flight restriction prohibiting drones from flying in the vicinity.  by  CAL FIRE_Official  At the time, video footage of the Super Scooper flying at the scene was captured.  #Canadian CL-415 Super Scoopers at work in Los Angeles, helping battle the horrendous #LosAngelesWildfires The Quebec-based aircraft can scoop up 1600 gallons of water in 12 seconds. pic.twitter.com/SXcafJonL6  \u2014 Binks (@BinkyBaxter1) January 9, 2025  The defendant was charged with failing to operate a drone safely, which could have resulted in up to one year in prison. However, he was sentenced to 14 days in federal prison and one month of home detention. He also has to pay approximately $156,000 in restitution and fines. Repairs to the drone are estimated to cost $65,169.  The defendant reportedly said, 'It was only when I heard on the news that a drone had collided with an aircraft that I thought my drone might be involved.'  The Los Angeles fires have burned more than 23,000 acres, killed 12 people, and destroyed approximately 7,000 structures.  by CAL FIRE_Official  Akeman is also required to perform 150 hours of community service as a contribution to wildfire recovery efforts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57918871522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GYM-TX23-RS06-3029-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"486\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Gigazine</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 13, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Japan</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001335</classCode><className>PLEA AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp;

Courtesy of Nicolo Bini        Grocery prices and mortgages in cities are going through the roof. You\u2019ve decided to go rural and you are looking at the options. What about an inflatable concrete home like the one built by Robert Downey Junior? If you\u2019ve chosen this path, over superadobe, you wonder, how can you make the numbers work and make it sustainable?    Let\u2019s start: Imagine buying a modest rural plot, somewhere near Sudbury, Ontario, or in the Sierra foothills of California\u2014and building a 1,000-sq-ft (93 m\u00b2) home using an inflatable-shell method like that created by Binishell. A flat, fabric form is inflated on-site and filled with a low-carbon concrete mix that hardens into a seamless, dome-like shell.    Binishell Robert Downey Junior home in Malibu    Inside, the walls are finished and insulated with hempcrete , a breathable, carbon-negative material that stores carbon as it cures. The entire build aims to reduce dependence on expensive mortgages, rising energy bills, and urban living costs while embodying resilience and ecological balance.    Because there\u2019s no heavy scaffolding or formwork, construction is quick and more or less clean. Inflation and concrete pumping take a day; curing takes a week or so. The costs?    Ontario: Shell cost \u2248 US $25\u201340 / sq ft.    California: Shell cost \u2248 US $45\u201360 / sq ft.    After adding foundations (will you have a finished basement?), utilities, and finishes, total cost lands between US $120\u201316/sq ft\u2014far below conventional rural builds, which often exceed US $250/sq ft. The finished home is highly energy-efficient: thick hempcrete walls and thermal-mass concrete stabilize interior temperature, lowering heating and cooling bills by up to 50%. Over 15 years, savings on mortgage and energy can reach tens of thousands of dollars. For people who want to start a regenerative farm or an online business in the country, this is a no-brainer.    Concrete\u2019s carbon footprint is its biggest flaw, but newer mixes cut emissions dramatically. Take calcined-clay blends (LC\u00b3), fly-ash or slag substitutes, and carbon-mineralization technologies like CarbonCure which can reduce CO\u2082 output by 40 %. In California, renewable-energy credits further offset embodied carbon; in Ontario, pairing solar panels or micro-hydro with low-carbon materials can make the structure nearly net-zero.    Look out for hidden costs and restrictions. Some people prefer to buy land in unorganized townships to avoid too much government oversight. That doesn\u2019t mean you can do what you want. Permits are still needed. In Ontario, you need a building permit for any new structure over 10 square meters (108 sq ft), or for any structure, including sheds, over 15 square meters (sq ft) , depending on the municipality .    Hempcrete adds another layer of sustainability, absorbing CO\u2082 during curing and improving indoor air quality. Together, these materials turn a traditionally high-carbon building type into a model of circular design. Hempcrete is also fire resistant, and added bonus for people in forest fire prone areas in California.    The biggest barrier today in new sustainable building isn\u2019t technology\u2014it\u2019s building codes. Inflatable concrete shells fall outside most standard residential classifications. In both provinces and states, permits require engineering certification, structural testing, and often a variance from conventional framing standards. Builders must collaborate with local inspectors early, providing proof of structural integrity, insulation values, and fire ratings. If you are into dealing with those hassles you can create a model home for your neighbors to follow.    Inflatable-shell homes offer a credible path to affordable, durable, and lower-carbon living. For those willing to navigate permitting and pioneer new methods, this approach could define the next generation of rural housing\u2014fast to build, low in cost, and light on the planet. It always takes the first movers to start new dreams.   Inflatable Concrete Domes in Canada   The Monolithic Dome Institute (MDI) has helped bring air-formed concrete construction to Canada, proving that dome-shaped, energy-efficient homes can thrive even in cold northern climates. Its method, known as the Monolithic Dome system, relies on an inflatable air-form, steel-reinforced concrete, and foam insulation to create one continuous, highly durable shell.    In Yorkton, Saskatchewan (shown below), Canadian Dome Industries built a 40-foot (12.2 m) hemispherical home that demonstrates the system\u2019s practicality and strength.    Another dome, located in central Alberta, measures 55 feet in diameter and was built off-grid in 2005. This structure uses passive-solar orientation, thick insulation, and thermal-mass concrete to remain comfortable year-round, reducing energy demand in both heating and cooling seasons.    Yorkton Dome in Canada    Yorkdon Dome, finished        Construction begins with a flexible Airform membrane anchored to a circular foundation. The membrane is inflated to the desired dome shape, and workers spray its interior with polyurethane foam to form a stable surface. Steel reinforcement is attached to the foam, and layers of shotcrete (sprayed concrete) are applied, hardening into a self-supporting structure. The finished shell functions as roof, walls, and insulation all in one piece\u2014eliminating many of the weak points found in conventional buildings.    Monolithic dome planning    According to the Monolithic Dome Institute, these domes use up to 50% less energy than standard homes. Their rounded shape sheds wind and snow efficiently, making them highly resistant to storms, mold, fire, and pests\u2014key advantages in Canada\u2019s variable climate. We just need a new shape of bed to fit a square in a rounded room.    While MDI\u2019s technique differs from newer \u201cinflatable concrete bladder\u201d methods\u2014where the form itself is filled with concrete rather than sprayed over\u2014the principle remains the same: air replaces formwork.    Inside a Binishell home    These Canadian dome homes demonstrate that air-formed, reinforced concrete shells are a proven, climate-resilient housing solution and a foundation for more sustainable, low-carbon building methods in the future. With builds for industry, the Monolithic Domes aren\u2019t as pretty as Binishells .

The 256-page doc...</p><p>Shimla, Oct 27 (PTI) Himachal Pradesh suffered losses to the tune of Rs 46,000 crore over the past four years due to natural disasters and the impact of climate change, according to a state human development report released here on Monday.  The 256-page document titled 'Himachal Pradesh Human Development Report 2025: Building the Future in a Climate Impacted World', prepared by the Department of Environment and Science in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), was released by Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu.  Around 1,700 people lost their lives in the past five monsoon seasons, the report said.  According to the report, water stress is intensifying with 70 per cent of traditional water sources drying up or under duress due to erratic precipitation, forcing several villages to depopulate.  Forest fire incidents have also surged from 856 in 2022-2023 to 2,580 cases in 2024-25, it said.  Average annual temperatures have risen by 1.5 degrees Celsius since 1901, with temperatures projected to rise to 2-3 degrees Celsius by the mid-century, the report said, warning that climate change can impact economic development through rising temperatures, extreme precipitation or cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) and forest fires.  Glaciers are retreating at rates exceeding 50 metres per year while the creation of new glacial lakes has increased the risk of GLOF.  The number of glacial lakes in Sutlej basin alone increased from 562 in 2019 to 1,048 in 2023, with similar trends observed in Chenab and Ravi basins. GLOF risks were highest in Kullu and Kinnaur districts, the report said.  It also assessed economic disruptions in agriculture, construction, and tourism sectors and said an estimated Rs 10,000 crore is required to augment the state's adaptability to climate crisis.  Releasing the report, Sukhu said the document reflects the state's progress, resilience and aspirations of its people. \"It is a matter of pride that according to the Human Development Report-2025, the average Human Development Index (HDI) of Himachal Pradesh is 0.78, higher than the national average of 0.63.\"  However, analysis of the climate-adjusted HDI at the district level suggested that the overall development in the state was more resilient to potential hazards.  Expressing concern over climate change, Sukhu said it has emerged as a serious global issue and if a sustainable solution was not worked out immediately, both present and future generations would have to face its severe consequences.  He further said the state has recently achieved the distinction of becoming a fully literate state, with literacy rate at 99.30 per cent, while the poverty rate in the state is below 7 per cent. Infant mortality rate has dropped to 21 per 1,000 live births and life expectancy has increased to 72 years, he added.  During this year's monsoon, Himachal has suffered heavy losses due to climate change patterns. From June to September, 47 cloudbursts, 98 flash floods, and 148 major landslides were reported in the state, and 270 people died in rain-related incidents, according to data provided by the state emergency operation centre.  Sukhu said currently the mountains, rivers, forests and glaciers are victims of global warming, due to which the state is grappling with problems like excessive rainfall, floods and landslides.  He said the world must act as one family and join hands to conserve the environment, ensuring planned economic development.  Stressing that the future must be human-centric and climate-resilient, he reiterated several initiatives started by the state government aimed at reducing the impact of global warming like use of solar energy, electric vehicles and others.  This is the first state human development report in India that examines the critical intersection between human development and climate change, providing climate-adjusted HDI which assesses how climate change is reshaping development outcomes, UNDP representative Angela Lusigi said.  Policy frameworks such as the State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC), green budgeting, Natural Farming Mission, and promotion of solar and hydrogen energy projects have been highlighted as positive initiatives in the report.  The report said \"business as usual\" is no longer an ideal approach and climate change requires urgent cross-sectoral action.  People, especially women, leading the change through local institutions should be at the heart of climate action, the report stressed, adding that data and technology would enable more effective decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58033274455</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H2P-2923-S1T8-C0K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>TheWeek</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 27, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Press Release</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>In-dex Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>301A</className><className>TKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: JP3153310002</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLY1</classCode><className>MONSOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001039</classCode><className>LITERACY &amp;

Authorities have repeatedly warned the public not to engage in outdoor activities that could cause fires, such as welding work, burning weeds or lighting campfires and barbecues. Parks and forest areas are closed at times of high fire risk, and daily bulletins are issued on the level of fire risk around the country. Causing a forest fire is a criminal offence in Greece.</p><p>Last summer, more than 100 people died when a fast-moving forest fire broke out in a seaside area northeast of Athens and raged through the vacation-home settlement of Mati.

It is not yet under control at 0.1 of a hectare.</p><p>Algonquin Park 24 measures 0.1 of a hectare and was discovered late on the afternoon of Monday, Aug. 26 east of Robitaille Lake, in the southeast of the park. It is not yet under control.</p><p>North Bay 26 is under control at 0.1 of a hectare. It is located approximately three kilometres southeast of Buffalo Rock, near the border between Ontario and Quebec.</p><p>A total of 15 fires are burning across the Northeast. Algonquin Park 23, which was discovered Sunday, Aug. 25, remains not under control at 3.5 hectares, while the remaining 11 fires are either being held or under control.</p><p>The forest fire hazard ranges from moderate to high in areas north of Wawa and Timmins, and high to extreme in areas south of Wawa and Timmins. The Parry Sound Fire Danger Rating is high in most areas of the district.</p><p>For up to date forest fire hazard conditions in your area, see the interactive fire map at Ontario.ca/forestfires.</p><p>Tips on how to prevent forest fires</p><p>Adopt safe campfire practices! Choose the site of your campfire carefully and keep your fire small. Stay nearby: never leave it unattended. Put your fire out by drowning it with water. Be sure that it is extinguished prior to leaving the site. Stir the ashes with a stick to uncover hot coals and then drown it again. You can never be too safe.</p><p>Consider alternatives to burning brush or yard waste, such as chipping or composting when possible, or saving burn piles for the fall or after the fire season. Use of outdoor fires must follow the outdoor burning rules set out in the Forest Fire Prevention Act of Ontario. Fires are to be started no sooner than two hours before sunset and extinguished no later than two hours after sunrise. Fires should never be left unattended and tools and water should be close at hand to put the fire out.</p><p>For information about the current forest fire situation: 1-888-220-7242</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2019082655442612</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXD-94R1-JDH1-C1FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"358\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The 128 leading scientis...</p><p>TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - From heart attacks and heat exhaustion to mental health problems and the spreading of tropical diseases, the climate crisis is threatening more and more people worldwide, according to a report published Tuesday.   The 128 leading scientists behind the Lancet Countdown Report warn that the consequences of rising global temperatures have never been more threatening to human health.   \"This year's health stocktake paints a bleak and undeniable picture of the devastating health harms reaching all corners of the world,\" said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown, an independent international research collaboration, at University College London.   Heat-related deaths have surged 23% since the 1990s, according to the analysis, with rising temperatures claiming over half a million lives every year. Wildfire smoke was linked to a record 154,000 deaths in 2024, while air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels kills 2.5 million every year.   Health risks increased in last year   \"We're seeing millions of deaths that are occurring needlessly every year because of our persistent fossil fuel dependence, because of our delay in mitigating climate change and our delays in adaptation to the climate change that cannot be avoided,\" said Romanello.   The Lancet Countdown report is considered to be a renowned indicator of the scientific links between health and global warming. These are becoming more pronounced as climate change, driven by the burning of coal, oil and gas, continues to wreak havoc across the planet.    Last year was the warmest on record and saw CO2 levels in the atmosphere jump to new highs. This resulted in the average person experiencing a record extra 16 health-threatening hot days due to climate change. This increased to 20 additional heat wave days on average for the most vulnerable groups in society, such as babies and those over 65.   According to the report, 13 out of 20 indicators that represent human health risks have increased significantly in the past year.   The most worrying aspect is that almost all indicators are going in the wrong direction, explained Romanello.  Health and economic costs  Climate change is supercharging extreme weather events that are becoming more frequent and intense around the world.   Heat waves \u2014 the most deadly form of extreme weather \u2014  can overheat the body, straining vital organs and making it difficult to sleep. Heavy flooding, such as that witnessed in Pakistan this year, can lead to contaminated drinking water and the spread of infections, while droughts are exacerbating malnutrition and hunger as crops fail. Smoke from wildfires \u2014 which in 2024 burned an area of land larger than India \u2014 harms the lungs, heart and even babies in the womb.   In the aftermath of weather-related disasters, disrupted power and damaged infrastructure can also hinder access to medical care and supplies. According to Romanello, most of the people affected by extreme weather worldwide don't have health insurance, which leaves them even more vulnerable when it comes to health risks.    These risks are not only costing human lives, they also have an economic impact.   Water or food shortages and catastrophic sanitary conditions following disasters cost hundreds of billions of US dollars annually. Extreme heat alone is estimated to have cost more than one trillion US dollars in 2024 \u2014 roughly 1% of global economic output \u2014 due to labor losses from illness and absenteeism.  Dengue and tropical diseases are spreading    Mosquitoes, ticks, and sand flies \u2014 some of which transmit deadly infectious diseases \u2014 are also spreading to more regions as temperatures rise.  Last week, mosquitoes were documented for the first time ever on the northern European island of Iceland, which researchers have linked to climate change. As warmer temperatures open up new habitats for insects, the number of people infected with dengue, malaria, leishmaniasis, and other diseases is increasing worldwide.  In 2024, there was a record number of dengue infections worldwide, with more than 7.6 million cases. \"We know that climate change is fueling at least some of that spread,\" says Romanello.   Even if not all of these infections are fatal, those who fall ill are often unable to work for weeks, with major economic consequences.  According to the report, the global average transmission potential of dengue has risen 49% since the 1950s.  Mental health also impacted  Climate change is also increasing the risk of mental illness.    When someone experiences an extreme weather event such as a forest fire, hurricane, monsoon, typhoon or extreme flooding, it can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder, said Jenni Miller, executive director from Global Climate and Health Alliance, a US non-governmental organization.   For example, poor harvests due to droughts, water shortages, or a loss of livelihood can cause anxiety and lead directly or indirectly to mental health problems. This is exacerbated by lack of sleep due to excessively hot nights, according to the report.   Preventing further illness and death   The authors of the report call for three key measures in mitigating the health consequences of the climate crisis.   First, renewable energy must be expanded to curb rising global temperatures. Clean energy, which has boomed in recent years, has helped reduce air pollution and prevent over 160,000 deaths between 2010-2022, according to Romanello.   Measures to adapt to climate change, such as making residential buildings and public infrastructure fit for extreme weather conditions, must now also be accelerated. And lastly, scientists say global healthcare systems urgently need to be adapted and equipped to face the additional challenges climate change presents.

He informed that, henceforth, the power to grant permission for muck removal has been delegated to district disaster management authorities, instead of at the state level.  He also emphasised that Mandi, Kullu, Chamba and Shimla districts should be accorded top priority when it comes to muck removal.  Saxena also instructed the PWD secretary to coordinate closely with departments such as Forest, Jal Shakti and the National Highways Authority of India to ensure effective planning and implementation.  The chief secretary on Saturday presided over the 26th meeting of the State Executive Committee (SEC), which discussed the establishment of early warning systems by specified dam authorities. He stated that Himachal Pradesh has 30 major dams, of which 25 have been completed and five are under construction.  At the meeting, deliberations were held on the preliminary project report under National Landslide Risk Mitigation Programme with an outlay of Rs 139 crore. This will now be submitted to the National Disaster Management Authority.  Additionally, the SEC also took up the preliminary project report under Forest Fire Risk Mitigation and Management scheme, which has been granted an outlay of Rs 8.16 crore from the National Disaster Mitigation Fund, for ex-post facto approval.  The committee also considered ex-post facto approval for to utilise national and state disaster response force funds amounting to Rs 78.76 lakh for the removal of 46,988 cubic metres of debris from public places in Mandi district.  A proposal for the establishment of a State Disaster Response Reserve on the lines of the National Disaster Response Reserve was also discussed and approved in the meeting, officials said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57812818159</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GVN-WJ53-RY58-C11Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"373\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>TheWeek</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 29, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Press Release</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC000DESE</classCode><className>NATIONAL HIGHWAYS AUTHORITY OF INDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>NAICS237310 HIGHWAY, STREET &amp;

National G...</p><p>TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - National Geographic has once again released the Best of the World Destinations 2026 list, showcasing 25 global travel destinations that inspire. The list offers diverse choices, interests, and accessibility for all travelers.  National Geographic Editor-in-Chief Nathan Lump said the list also includes accompanying guides for travelers who wish to visit those destinations. \"I want to make sure that we're not just inspiring people, we're also helping them to get a head start, basically, if they're inspired to go places,\" he said as quoted from USA Today.  From the list, here are the top five outstanding destinations that offer unique experiences, from nature adventures to deep cultural trips, in line with the regenerative tourism and sustainability trends:  1. Akagera National Park, Rwanda  The Akagera National Park in Rwanda, East Africa offers an intimate safari experience with far fewer visitors compared to Serengeti or Masai Mara. With only 50,000 visitors per year, the park becomes a paradise for wildlife enthusiasts, where you can see lions, elephants, rhinos, and over 500 bird species.  After recovering from the damage caused by the civil war in the 1990s, Akagera has become a symbol of conservation success, with the relocation of 70 white rhinos in May 2025. Accommodations like the Wilderness Magashi Peninsula offer luxury in the midst of the savannah, ideal for quiet adventures.  2. Maui, Hawaii  Maui in Hawaii, United States has risen from the 2023 forest fire tragedy that destroyed Lhain, and invites tourists to support local economic recovery through responsible tourism. The now quieter beaches offer their own charm, while local businesses like Old Lhain L'au and Maui Ku'ia Estate Chocolate are back in operation.  As quoted from National Geographic, luxury hotels like the Grand Wailea with the largest spa in Hawaii and the voluntourism program of Mlama Hawai'i allow visitors to contribute to nature conservation, such as beach clean-ups and native plant restoration.  3. Beijing, China  The capital of China combines ancient history with modern conveniences in 2026. The Beijing Central Axis, newly designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, connects landmarks such as the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven, now easier to explore with new tour buses.  A visa-free policy for up to 30 days for 47 countries, including the United States, makes it easier for tourists to access. At night, the Great Wall at Mutianyu and Juyongguan offers night tours with spectacular illumination, adding to Beijing's charm as a must-visit cultural destination.  4. Route 66, Oklahoma  Route 66 in Oklahoma, United States has received significant investment to rejuvenate the iconic road spanning over 643 kilometers. Tulsa as the center of the road's history offers various unique attractions, such as creative sculptures and Western-style clothing stores. In Arcadia, the Pops gas station serves hundreds of soda flavors, while in Clinton, the Oklahoma Route 66 Museum showcases 1950s nostalgia and exhibitions about the history of this legendary road. Route 66 is now a colorful and revived destination.  5. Black Sea Coast, Turkey  The Black Sea coast in Turkey offers a unique experience where visitors can surf and ski on the same day. Located between the Pontic Mountains and the Black Sea, cities like Samsun, Bartin, and Trabzon enchant with sandy beaches, Greco-Turkish cultural heritage, and views of tea plantations in Rize. Local cuisine relies on fresh seafood and dishes like kuymak and Akaabat kftesi.  Visitors can also explore mountain valleys with medieval castles and the famous Byzantine architecture of the Smela monastery. For ski enthusiasts, Camba offers a variety of slopes and entertainment after activities. The village of Ayder is the center of adventure activities such as zip-lining, 4x4 safaris, and trekking to the picturesque Kakar Dalar National Park.

Himachal rain  Himachal Pradesh suffered losses to the tune of Rs 46,000 crore over the past four years due to natural disasters and the impact of climate change, according to a state human development report released here on Monday.  The 256-page document titled 'Himachal Pradesh Human Development Report 2025: Building the Future in a Climate Impacted World', prepared by the Department of Environment and Science in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), was released by Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu.  Story continues below Around 1,700 people lost their lives in the past five monsoon seasons, the report said.  According to the report, water stress is intensifying with 70 per cent of traditional water sources drying up or under duress due to erratic precipitation, forcing several villages to depopulate.  Forest fire incidents have also surged from 856 in 2022-2023 to 2,580 cases in 2024-25, it said.  Average annual temperatures have risen by 1.5 degrees Celsius since 1901, with temperatures projected to rise to 2-3 degrees Celsius by the mid-century, the report said, warning that climate change can impact economic development through rising temperatures, extreme precipitation or cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) and forest fires.  Glaciers are retreating at rates exceeding 50 metres per year while the creation of new glacial lakes has increased the risk of GLOF.  The number of glacial lakes in Sutlej basin alone increased from 562 in 2019 to 1,048 in 2023, with similar trends observed in Chenab and Ravi basins. GLOF risks were highest in Kullu and Kinnaur districts, the report said.  Story continues below It also assessed economic disruptions in agriculture, construction, and tourism sectors and said an estimated Rs 10,000 crore is required to augment the state's adaptability to climate crisis.  Releasing the report, Sukhu said the document reflects the state's progress, resilience and aspirations of its people. \"It is a matter of pride that according to the Human Development Report-2025, the average Human Development Index (HDI) of Himachal Pradesh is 0.78, higher than the national average of 0.63.\" However, analysis of the climate-adjusted HDI at the district level suggested that the overall development in the state was more resilient to potential hazards.  Expressing concern over climate change, Sukhu said it has emerged as a serious global issue and if a sustainable solution was not worked out immediately, both present and future generations would have to face its severe consequences.  He further said the state has recently achieved the distinction of becoming a fully literate state, with literacy rate at 99.30 per cent, while the poverty rate in the state is below 7 per cent. Infant mortality rate has dropped to 21 per 1,000 live births and life expectancy has increased to 72 years, he added.  During this year's monsoon, Himachal has suffered heavy losses due to climate change patterns. From June to September, 47 cloudbursts, 98 flash floods, and 148 major landslides were reported in the state, and 270 people died in rain-related incidents, according to data provided by the state emergency operation centre.  Sukhu said currently the mountains, rivers, forests and glaciers are victims of global warming, due to which the state is grappling with problems like excessive rainfall, floods and landslides.  He said the world must act as one family and join hands to conserve the environment, ensuring planned economic development.

Shimla: Himachal Pradesh suffered losses to the tune of Rs 46,000 crore over the past four years due to natural disasters and the impact of climate change, according to a state human development report released here on Monday.  The 256-page document titled 'Himachal Pradesh Human Development Report 2025: Building the Future in a Climate Impacted World', prepared by the Department of Environment and Science in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), was released by Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu.  Around 1,700 people lost their lives in the past five monsoon seasons, the report said.  According to the report, water stress is intensifying with 70 per cent of traditional water sources drying up or under duress due to erratic precipitation, forcing several villages to depopulate.  Forest fire incidents have also surged from 856 in 2022-2023 to 2,580 cases in 2024-25, it said.  Average annual temperatures have risen by 1.5 degrees Celsius since 1901, with temperatures projected to rise to 2-3 degrees Celsius by the mid-century, the report said, warning that climate change can impact economic development through rising temperatures, extreme precipitation or cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) and forest fires.  Glaciers are retreating at rates exceeding 50 metres per year while the creation of new glacial lakes has increased the risk of GLOF.  The number of glacial lakes in Sutlej basin alone increased from 562 in 2019 to 1,048 in 2023, with similar trends observed in Chenab and Ravi basins. GLOF risks were highest in Kullu and Kinnaur districts, the report said.  It also assessed economic disruptions in agriculture, construction, and tourism sectors and said an estimated Rs 10,000 crore is required to augment the state's adaptability to climate crisis.  Releasing the report, Sukhu said the document reflects the state's progress, resilience and aspirations of its people. \"It is a matter of pride that according to the Human Development Report-2025, the average Human Development Index (HDI) of Himachal Pradesh is 0.78, higher than the national average of 0.63.\" However, analysis of the climate-adjusted HDI at the district level suggested that the overall development in the state was more resilient to potential hazards.  Expressing concern over climate change, Sukhu said it has emerged as a serious global issue and if a sustainable solution was not worked out immediately, both present and future generations would have to face its severe consequences.  He further said the state has recently achieved the distinction of becoming a fully literate state, with literacy rate at 99.30 per cent, while the poverty rate in the state is below 7 per cent. Infant mortality rate has dropped to 21 per 1,000 live births and life expectancy has increased to 72 years, he added.  During this year's monsoon, Himachal has suffered heavy losses due to climate change patterns. From June to September, 47 cloudbursts, 98 flash floods, and 148 major landslides were reported in the state, and 270 people died in rain-related incidents, according to data provided by the state emergency operation centre.  Sukhu said currently the mountains, rivers, forests and glaciers are victims of global warming, due to which the state is grappling with problems like excessive rainfall, floods and landslides.  He said the world must act as one family and join hands to conserve the environment, ensuring planned economic development.  Stressing that the future must be human-centric and climate-resilient, he reiterated several initiatives started by the state government aimed at reducing the impact of global warming like use of solar energy, electric vehicles and others.  This is the first state human development report in India that examines the critical intersection between human development and climate change, providing climate-adjusted HDI which assesses how climate change is reshaping development outcomes, UNDP representative Angela Lusigi said.  Policy frameworks such as the State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC), green budgeting, Natural Farming Mission, and promotion of solar and hydrogen energy projects have been highlighted as positive initiatives in the report.  The report said \"business as usual\" is no longer an ideal approach and climate change requires urgent cross-sectoral action.

For composite poles specifically, these tests included the UL 94 Standard for Tests for Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances and the ASTM D635-14 Standard Test Method for Rate of Burning and/or Extent and Time of Burning Plastics in a Horizontal Position.</p><p>Beginning in 2011, RS undertook an initiative to design a reliable, quantitative test method that would simulate an actual full-scale fire, of a severe to extreme nature, as its flame front moves through a utility line right-of-way. To accomplish this, RS worked with third party forest fire expert Mark Ackerman from the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. The resulting test method uses a steel sheath that is placed around the base of an embedded pole. Flames are then introduced to the annular space between the pole and the sheath by the controlled ignition of propane. The heat flux, flame temperature and exposure duration are designed to represent a \"severe\" (two-minute exposure) or \"extreme\" (three-minute exposure) wildfire event. Additionally, the fire-exposed poles can be full-scale bend tested per the ASTM D1036 Standard Test Methods of Static Tests of Wood Poles to quantify any loss of strength and/or stiffness.</p><p>As part of RS's ongoing fire testing program, now in its ninth year, Mr. Ackerman recently embedded an RS pole, protected with an RS Fire Shield , in a forest in northern Canada. In a controlled burn exercise, the surrounding area was ignited to start a forest fire. Following ignition, the fire approached, engulfed and continued past the pole. The fire exposure time was approximately 30 seconds with flame temperatures reaching nearly 1,000\u00b0C [1,832\u00b0F]. After the fire passed, the pole self-extinguished thanks to the inherent material properties of the fiberglass and resin making up the pole. Upon inspection, the Fire Shield  was found to have exhibited some surface charring, while the underlying pole showed no signs of damage and hence retained its initial structural strength and stiffness.</p><p>\"This real-world wildfire test reinforces that RS poles and Fire Shields  are a proven solution for utilities dealing with high fire risk environments,\" stated Howard Elliott, President and CEO of RS. \"The temperature and speed of this forest fire have demonstrated that the fire testing protocols used by RS including the duration times for both severe and extreme fire conditions are scientifically representative. RS looks forward to continuing to lead the industry with this type of applied research and product deployment.\"</p><p>About RSRS Technologies Inc.

The p...</p><p>More than 343,000 hectares (848,000 acres) of land -- the equivalent of nearly half a million football pitches -- have been destroyed this year in Spain, setting a new national record, according to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).  The previous record of 306,000 hectares was set in the same period three years ago.  Two firefighters were killed on Sunday -- one in each country, both in road accidents -- taking the death toll to two in Portugal and four in Spain.  The head of Spain's Civil Protection and Emergencies, Virginia Barcones, told broadcaster TVE there were currently 23 \"active fires\" that pose a serious and direct threat to the population.  The fires, now in their second week, were concentrated in the northwest regions of Galicia, Castile and Leon, and Extremadura.  In Ourense province of Galicia, signs of the fires were everywhere, from ashen forests and blackened soil to destroyed homes, with thick smoke forcing people to wear facemasks.  Firefighters battled to put out fires, as locals in just shorts and T-shirts used water from hoses and buckets to try to stop the spread.  One resident in O Barco de Valdeorras, dousing his home with water from a hosepipe, described the wildfire that ripped through his area as \"like a bomb\".  \"It came from below and it was like a hurricane,\" he said. \"The good thing was that in two minutes it headed up and it didn't stay here long.  \"If not, our house would have been burnt, it would not have survived.\"  - 'Complicated situation' -  Barcones said she hoped weather conditions would turn to help tackle the fires. Spain's meteorological agency said the heatwave, which has seen temperatures hit 45C in parts of the country, was coming to an end.  Elsewhere, authorities in Turkey said two major fires had been brought under control, while rain and falling temperatures have helped firefighters extinguish dozens of blazes in the Balkans.  Spain is being helped with firefighting aircraft from France, Italy, Slovakia and the Netherlands, while Portugal is receiving air support from Sweden and Morocco.  \"It's a very difficult, very complicated situation,\" Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles told TVE.  The size and severity of the fires and the intensity of the smoke -- visible from space -- were making \"airborne action\" difficult,\" she added.  Officials in Castile and Leon said a firefighter died on Sunday night when the water truck he was driving flipped over on a steep forest road and down a slope.  Two other volunteer firefighters have died in Castile and Leon, while a Romanian employee of a riding school north of Madrid lost his life trying to protect horses from the fire.  In Portugal, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said a firefighter died on Sunday in a traffic accident that left two colleagues seriously injured.  A former mayor in the eastern town of Guarda died on Friday while trying to tackle a fire.  Some 2,000 firefighters were deployed across northern and central Portugal on Monday, with about half of them concentrated in the town of Arbanil.  Some 216,000 hectares of land have been destroyed across Portugal since the start of the year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The event brought together public and private sector voices to showcase the exciting and diverse opportunities within South Africa\u2019s Forestry Sector \u2013 and to offer practical guidance to students and graduates looking to launch meaningful careers in this vital industry.    Held in the lead-up to June 16, the webinar marked a bold step forward in the FSCC\u2019s evolving role from transformation auditor to active facilitator, with youth development now a key area of focus.    \u201cWe\u2019ve seen how impactful collaborative initiatives like She Is Forestry SA have been in advancing gender equality. Now it\u2019s it\u2019s time to apply that same collective energy to youth empowerment,\u201d said FSCC Executive Director Khosi Mavimbela.    Designed to bridge the gap between graduation and employment, the webinar featured insights from industry leaders, graduate recruitment experts, and young professionals. Sessions focused on building soft skills, identifying real-world skills gaps, and navigating the transition from student to industry contributor.    FORESTRY GRADUATE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMME    Norman Dlamini, FSA\u2019s Director of Business Development, delivered the keynote address and presented the Forestry Graduate Employment Programme (F-GEP) \u2013 a sector-wide initiative tackling youth unemployment. Designed as a one-year learnership, F-GEP is aimed at improving the employability of unemployed forestry graduates while nurturing an entrepreneurial mindset.    \u201cIt seeks to address critical skills shortages in the forestry sector, F-GEP prioritises graduates who show interest in pursuing scarce and in-demand skillsets,\u201d says Dlamini. Through a structured rotation model, participants are placed with industry experts across different areas of forestry operations, including:    Forest fire management  Forest engineering  (wheels and  mechanisation)  Forestry chemicals  Pests and disease control  Human resources within         forestry environments The programme\u2019s dual focus on skills development and enterprise creation makes it a unique intervention. \u201cF-GEP goes beyond traditional internships,\u201d explained Dlamini adding that while internships expose students and graduates to a workplace, they do not necessarily make them more employable. \u201cWe assess individual graduates\u2019 technical and interpersonal skills, close the gaps, and prepare them to be employable, entrepreneurial, and industry-ready.\u201d    STORIES THAT INSPIRE    Among the most memorable speakers were Sabelo Sithole, Managing Director of New Age Forest Solutions, and Eutricia Nkuna, FSCC Research Assistant. Both shared personal stories of perseverance, growth, and initiative \u2013 resonating deeply with students navigating similar journeys.    Both shared their own journeys, with Eutricia outlining the key attributes that enabled her to progress from an unemployed forestry graduate to a research assistant and Sabelo reiterating the importance of proactively seeking out available opportunities.    \u201cThe conversations were honest, relevant and inspiring,\u201d said Dr Blessing Karumbidza, Coordinator of the Higher Certificate in Forestry at TUT. \u201cEutricia\u2019s story, in particular, will serve as a blueprint for others. I hope this webinar becomes a regular feature \u2013 quarterly, even \u2013 because the doors it opened must stay open.\u201d    In a unique show of encouragement, FSA awarded R1 000 Cape Union Mart vouchers to the students who posed the most insightful questions during each of the six Q&amp;A sessions.    \u201cIn a small sector like ours, putting your hand up and speaking up can open doors,\u201d said Dr Katy Johnson, FSA Communication Manager and MC for the webinar. \u201cWe wanted to reward that confidence and help students realise that their voices matter.\u201d    With strong engagement, compelling storytelling, and renewed commitment to youth development, the FSCC Youth Webinar is set to become a cornerstone initiative in the sector\u2019s transformation and enterprise development agenda.

As India advances in space technology, mastering this invisible spectrum strengthens its global leadership and sovereignty  Space-based thermal imaging offers direct support for several critical areas.(Representative image)  When we imagine satellites in space, we usually think of them taking pictures of the Earth which are later transformed into maps\u2014perhaps even live visuals of landscapes. These images typically rely on visible light, which is only a small slice of the electromagnetic spectrum. But there\u2019s a much larger, more powerful way to observe the Earth\u2014through infrared, or what we often refer to as \u2018thermal imaging\u2019.  So, let us first unpack this concept. Simply put, infrared imaging allows us to see heat. Everything emits thermal radiation (or radiates heat) to some degree or the other. Unlike visible imaging, which only shows us what something looks like, thermal imaging tells us how it is behaving. For instance, a forest fire just beginning under a canopy of a thin cloud cover might escape detection in visible imagery but will immediately show up in thermal readings.  Story continues below This kind of space-based thermal monitoring has enormous value. In a world burdened with rising temperatures, unpredictable weather, and frequent natural disasters, real-time thermal data can help governments, researchers, and businesses plan better and act faster.  Why infrared matters India\u2019s geography, economy, and population density make it especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change and resource stress. Space-based thermal imaging offers direct support for several critical areas. In agriculture, for example, water use efficiency is low, just 25\u201335%, which means that approximately 70% of irrigation water is lost before it even reaches crops. This contributes greatly to crop stress (adverse conditions affecting crop growth) and low yields. Thermal imaging helps detect crop stress days or even weeks before it becomes visible to the naked eye. This, in turn, gives farmers enough time to respond and save yields.  Beyond agriculture and urban planning, thermal intelligence plays a crucial role in tracking greenhouse gas emissions\u2014one of the planet\u2019s most pressing challenges. Advanced thermal imaging enables the identification of methane leaks from oil fields, landfills, and agricultural sites that are often invisible to conventional monitoring.  Cities, too, benefit from thermal imaging. Urbanization has led to 60% more night\u2011time warming in more than 140 Indian cities compared to surrounding rural areas.  Between 2022\u20132023, daily peak electricity demand in India rose to over 220\u202fGW during heatwave events\u2014a 23% increase compared to normal seasons\u2014driven by increased cooling loads. With the rapid growth of urban heat islands\u2014localized zones of elevated temperatures\u2014thermal data can guide smarter urban design, from rooftop materials to green cover planning. Timely infrared insights can reduce costs, improve outcomes, and support more sustainable growth.  The strategic case for thermal imaging Beyond civil applications, infrared imaging plays a crucial role in facilitating national security. Unlike visual sensors, which can be blocked by darkness, thermal sensors continue working through most atmospheric conditions, even at night, detecting hidden infrastructure and energy use patterns.  Currently, only a few countries operate dedicated infrared satellites, primarily for defense. However, civilian access to thermal data is often limited or delayed, especially when the data originates from foreign-owned satellites.  Story continues below But what will it take to bridge the gap? Building a strong thermal imaging program is no small task. Infrared sensors require precise calibration, are sensitive to temperature fluctuations in orbit, and generate large volumes of data that need to be processed intelligently. But recent advances in satellite miniaturization and onboard computing have made it possible to build compact, affordable infrared payloads suited even for small satellites.  India already has strong launch capabilities, a growing private space sector, and experience in building remote sensing systems. What we need now is a focused push: dedicated investment in research and development, support for commercial players working in this space, and long-term policies that recognise thermal imaging as core national infrastructure.  At Satleo Labs, our vision is to help build this next generation of Indian space technology, where thermal data is as accessible and actionable today as a weather update.  Seeing what others are likely to missIn many ways, thermal imaging is about paying attention to what lies beneath the surface\u2014heat patterns, energy flows, and early warnings that can\u2019t be seen in visible light. It\u2019s a way of seeing more deeply and responding more wisely. As India moves forward in its space journey, this capability will become increasingly important for driving economic growth, and further building resilience, safety, and sovereignty.  It\u2019s time to step into the invisible spectrum and claim our place on the global thermal map.  (Shravan Bhati, Co-founder &amp; CEO, SatLeo Labs.)

Hazardous combustible waste! While there are plans for a permanent collection site, currently there is no place to drop off these highly flammable waste products.</p><p>I understand Salmo will have a drop-off location sometime in June or July. How many people will drive to Salmo, compared to how many people would drive locally or participate if there was an emergency drop-off location or pick up scheduled prior to forest fire season?</p><p>I've heard it would be expensive to set up an emergency/temporary collection system. I'm sure that is true. How expensive would it be if these waste products contributed to, or exacerbated a fire situation? This could be devastating for Nelson as we've been cited as a very high risk community for forest fires.</p><p>Perhaps a collection container could be set up on a temporary basis and that container could be dropped off in Salmo or somewhere.</p><p>Let's do everything we could to lessen the danger to our town. At the moment, there is a strong likelihood that this could be a long forest fire season. This is something we can be proactive on and at least minimize our exposure.</p><p>Howie Ross</p><p>Nelson</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-3810262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7G-0H51-F103-31WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"224\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nelson Star</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 30, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp; COMMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X0R</classCode><className>SOLID WASTE COLLECTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000830</classCode><className>HAZARDOUS WASTE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001736</classCode><className>TOXIC &amp; HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X0R</classCode><className>SOLID WASTE COLLECTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000830</classCode><className>HAZARDOUS WASTE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001736</classCode><className>TOXIC &amp; HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

This estimate pertains to deaths caused by exposure to wildfire smoke pollution containing fine particulate matter or PM2.5.  \"Our understanding of who is vulnerable to this exposure is much broader than we thought,\" said Marshall Burke, a social environmental science professor at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, as quoted from the official Stanford website on September 18.  The impact of wildfires on mortality rates has been published in the journal Nature on September 18, 2025, titled 'Wildfire Smoke Exposure and Mortality Burden in the US Under Climate Change'. This article was authored by 13 combined scientists from campuses in the UK and the United States.  The researchers' projections were obtained from analyzing state-level mortality data in the US from 2006 to 2019. This data was linked to fluctuations in deaths due to PM2.5 concentration from ground-level wildfire smoke, wind variations, and air particle movement.  The researchers also utilized machine learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) to predict changes in wildfire emissions in a particular area. Changes in these conditions can affect smoke concentrations in other areas. The change in smoke concentration is associated with historical variations in deaths. Climate models were also utilized to project future forest fire activities, including smoke levels and health impacts.  As a result, the researchers claimed that PM2.5-containing smoke exposure under emission scenarios could increase by more than 70 percent to 70,000 deaths per year. This figure exceeds the approximately 40,000 annual deaths associated with smoke from 2011 to 2020. The projected surge in annual deaths due to smoke exposure will occur in California (with an additional 5,060 deaths), New York (1,810), Washington (1,730), Texas (1,700), and Pennsylvania (1,600).  In this study, the researchers projected that the number of smoke-related deaths, with climate influence, would still exceed 60,000 lives per year by 2050. This means that the impact of wildfires would still be severe, even if global temperatures are successfully kept below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century.  Minghao Qiu, an assistant professor at Stony Brook University, said the climate models currently used for policy-making do not account for the impact of wildfire smoke on human deaths, despite its very real threat to healthcare and its effect on mortality rates. \"It's like leaving the main character out of a movie,\" Minghao said.

According to Thursday's update from the European Forest Fire Information System, wildfires have scorched 403,171 hectares of land in Spain so far this year. Around 350,000 hectares were destroyed in just the past two weeks, coinciding with a severe heat wave that began in early August, Xinhua news agency reported.  Martin-Vide emphasised that climate models point to worsening conditions in the coming decades. \"Adaptation is key to reducing the risk,\" he said, noting that temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in central and northern Europe will pose serious challenges to societies less accustomed to extreme heat.  He called for stronger prevention measures and better landscape management, highlighting the effects of rural depopulation. \"The woods are not as clean as in the past, when there were cattle, sheep, goats grazing and eating the vegetation that now acts as the fuel that starts a forest fire,\" he explained.  The climatologist urged innovative strategies, including the creation of \"mosaic landscapes with forest areas interspersed with cultivated fields,\" to make land more defensible against blazes.  He also pointed to adaptation already underway in agriculture, as olive and wine producers move production to higher altitudes, in search of more favorable climatic conditions to maintain both quality and output.  Martin-Vide welcomed the Spanish government's plan to establish a nationwide pact on fire prevention, calling it \"very necessary.\"  Spain is enduring its worst summer for wildfires this century, with more than 20 major blazes still burning, mainly in the northwestern provinces of Orense, Zamora and Leon. The interior ministry said over 33,000 people have been evacuated, while four people, including three firefighters, have died.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57511339326</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJH-H4S3-RRHY-126W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ProKerala.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 22, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC00059LB</classCode><className>WINE.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS445320 BEER, WINE, AND LIQUOR RETAILERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS424820 WINE &amp;

Unlocking the potential of forests  The Lai ChauDepartment of Agriculture and Environment, in collaboration with the CARE organization, has launched the project \"Capacity Building for Implementing Climate Change Mitigation Plans and Mobilizing Sustainable Finance for Forest Protection and Development, Including the High-Quality Forest Carbon Market - Carbon for Good (C4G).\"  The project is implemented by CARE, the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), and the University of British Columbia (UBC, Canada), with support from the Government of Canada. It is being carried out in four provinces, including Tuyen Quang, Lai Chau, Son La, and Can Tho. This project represents a major step toward readiness for participation in the economic market for forest carbon credits, contributing to the development of a sustainable forestry economy and Vietnam's goal of achieving net-zero emissions.  In addition, the initiative aims to strengthen climate change adaptation and promote sustainable forest management. The project\u2019s objectives are to leverage Canada's expertise in forestry management and combine it with local capacities to establish a high-quality, transparent, and efficient forest carbon market in Vietnam.  Mr. Nguyen Thanh Dong, Deputy Director of the Lai ChauDepartment of Agriculture and Environment, affirmed that the project will help local people access opportunities to develop forest-based economic activities.

According to Mr. Nguyen Thanh Dong, Deputy Director of the Lai ChauDepartment of Agriculture and Environment, the province currently has more than 501,000 ha of forests, including over 458,000 ha of natural forests, about 29,600 ha of planted forests, and 12,900 ha of rubber plantations.  In the context of increasingly severe climate change, this year's dry season is forecast to bring many cold days with low humidity, heightening the risk of forest fires. As a mountainous province with a sparse population, most local residents have yet to develop strong awareness of forest protection, partly because they have not seen tangible economic benefits from forests.  Therefore, the C4G project is expected to create a new direction that links forest protection goals with economic development, enabling local people to earn legal income from forest carbon values while encouraging communities to join hands in preserving the \"green lungs\" of the Northwest region.  Laying the foundation for the carbon credit market  Running until March 2028, the C4G project is part of Canada's commitment to supporting Vietnam in developing a high-quality forest carbon market, aiming at  climate change adaptation and impact mitigation.  CARE project officers and Lai Chau forest rangers talk with local people. Photo: Duc Binh.  Ms. Le Kim Dung, Country Director of CARE in Vietnam, stated that this initiative not only contributes to biodiversity conservation but also opens up opportunities for investment cooperation, green job creation, and inclusive socio-economic development at the local level.  Amid the global transition toward a low-carbon economy, the carbon credit market is considered a key economic tool that helps countries both achieve their net-zero emission target and generate new revenue sources from environmental protection activities.  Vietnam is in the process of establishing a legal framework for this market, which is expected to come into operation in the coming years. Therefore, Lai Chau's proactive participation in projects such as C4G is regarded as a strategic preparatory step.  The project aims to strengthen climate governance in a nature-positive direction while promoting the participation of private units in financing and developing forest-based carbon projects. A distinctive feature of C4G is its approach of \"combining local knowledge with innovative solutions to cope with climate change and ensure that community voices, especially those of ethnic minority women, are heard in decisions related to forest and climate management.\"  Under the C4G model, forest-dependent communities are not merely beneficiaries but central partners in governance and monitoring. When forest carbon values are quantified clearly and transparently, local people can receive economic benefits from forest protection.  The working delegation took part in a field experience in the forest. Photo: Duc Binh.  According to Ms. Dung, the C4G project focuses on four key result groups. First, assessing forest carbon potential through detailed studies of carbon sequestration and storage capacity in each area, serving as the basis for quantifying and issuing carbon credits in the future.  Second, evaluating the feasibility of emission reduction, enabling provinces, including Lai Chau, to proactively develop appropriate plans to meet national greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.  Third, developing market-ready data profiles that clearly outline each locality's potential for forest carbon credit development, thereby attracting investment once the market officially comes into operation.  Fourth, enhancing the professional capacity of officials, businesses, and forest owners through training courses on carbon credit valuation, project development, and market risk and opportunity assessment.  Connecting knowledge  Another key component of the project is multi-stakeholder collaboration among management agencies, international organizations, private units, and local communities, aimed at developing a carbon model that is locally inclusive, environmentally sustainable, and economically feasible.  Ms. Dung affirmed that with technical support from the Government of Canada, the project can fully leverage Canada\u2019s leading expertise in forestry management and carbon market development and expand cooperation in areas such as monitoring\u2013reporting\u2013verification (MRV) technologies, digital solutions, carbon project development and investment, sustainable wood value chains, carbon certification, landscape restoration, and forest fire prevention.  In the next three years, C4G will work closely with local governments, enterprises, and communities to promote sustainable forest management and climate-adaptive reforestation and create alternative income opportunities for forest-dependent households.  According to Mr. Ha Trong Hai, Vice Chairman of the Lai Chau Provincial People\u2019s Committee, with its high forest coverage rate and diverse ecosystems, the province has great potential to become a locality that meets the requirements of the forest carbon credit market. Once the national carbon market mechanism is in operation, projects like C4G will help Lai Chau quickly adapt, generate new revenue sources for the local budget, and contribute to the province's goals of green growth and low emissions.  The project launch ceremony marks a major step forward in Lai Chau's journey toward sustainable agricultural development. Photo: Duc Binh.  Lai Chau provincial leaders believe that once the project is implemented, the green forests will not only serve as \"environmental regulators\" but also open up new livelihood opportunities for local residents. Transforming forests into assets with carbon value is a modern approach, shifting the resource management mindset from exploitation to conservation, with clear economic benefits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58095818243</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H4C-9YW3-SBGB-P566-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1293\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Nong Nghiep Viet Nam Online</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>November 4, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Reliance Global Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Viet Nam</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South-Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>00723</className><className>HKG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: BMG8598B1413</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Renters want green features where they live, and they\u2019re willing to pay a premium. Some people won\u2019t rent from an apartment building unless they have at least some green practices in place, like LED lights, low-flow plumbing, and smart thermostats.     That\u2019s great news for landlords who are willing to add sustainability to their rental properties\u2019 features. Practical green amenities equal higher rents, faster lease signings, and happier, long-term tenants. For landlords in major cities, it gives them an edge on the competition. For example, Green Residential \u2013 a Houston property management company \u2013 helps their clients add eco-friendly amenities to their rentals so they rent faster and to higher quality tenants.     If you\u2019re a landlord looking for ways to go green, here are the top five features to prioritize.      Plug-and-play appliances      Swapping out old lightbulbs, washers, and refrigerators for efficient models is the cheapest way to reduce your tenants\u2019 bills. This makes premium rent a lot easier to charge. Lighting alone tends to be around 15% of a home\u2019s electricity use, and just by using LEDs, households save around $225 per year.    A smart thermostat by Nest    ENERGY STAR appliances use around 25% less energy, and washers use 33% less water, which makes them a marketable upgrade for tenants. Where thermostats are concerned, tenants can save a lot of money on their heating and cooling costs just by having a programmable thermostat. These appliances are low-friction upgrades with tangible cost savings that will make your property more attractive.     Heat pumps    Home heating and insulation. Sustainability is really just about pipes and pumps      Heat pumps are quickly becoming the new default for energy efficient, electric comfort. They can cut electricity use for heating by up to 75% compared to heat generated by electric resistance. They\u2019re up to 4.5 times more efficient than ENERGY STAR gas furnaces.       Heat pumps can heat and cool a space, they make excellent dehumidifiers in summer, and work well with ductless installs in older buildings. When prospects get to enjoy comfort and lower bills, charging premium rent is justified.    If you haven\u2019t already switched over to all-electric heat pumps from combustion like gas, it\u2019s worth considering before your hand is forced. States and cities are quickly passing laws that make combustion harder to maintain.    EV chargers      For tenants who own an electric vehicle, having an onsite EV charging station is a big draw. In fact, in some areas, it\u2019s becoming an expectation rather than a convenient amenity. In California, starting in 2026 , some landlords will be legally required to install EV charging stations in most new overnight parking spots.     A Tesla Powerwall can stabilize the grid and keep your home running during a blackout    It\u2019s not easy to find a place to charge an electric vehicle, and having an onsite EV charger will sweeten the deal and get you higher rent. In fact, according to a Multifamily Executive survey 58% of renters planning to buy an EV in the next five years said they\u2019d pay more rent for onsite charging.       EV-friendly rental listings are still pretty rare, so if you have chargers you\u2019ll stand out in search filters and shorten the time it takes to get leases signed.      Drought-resistant landscaping      Water is easy to waste, and nothing uses more water than having to maintain a front or backyard full of plants. And you can\u2019t just let them die \u2013 that would look awful. The solution is for landlords to install drought-resistant landscaping and smart irrigation controllers for plants that require regular watering.      The Treetoscope sensor collects information about water and soil nutrients to turn on irrigation systems at the right time    A smart irrigation system can reduce water usage by up to 40% and avoid the problem of watering the sidewalk. According to some reports, this translates to saving around 15,000 gallons of water per year per home.    A healthy air package (not just an HVAC system)      Tenants don\u2019t want literal headaches from their homes. But the average American spends 90% of the time indoors, where pollutant levels are 2-5 times outdoor levels. Upgrading your property to MERV-13 filtration, adding balanced ventilation, and using low-VOC paints and flooring is a simple way to support tenant health while justifying premium rent.    Lab tests show MERV-13 filtration can capture around 90% of PM2.5 contaminants and reduce cooking and wildfire particles. This is especially important in areas where air pollution and forest fire smoke are common.    Rooftop solar       Rooftop solar power can be a leasing magnet. On the right roof, a solar system can offset a meaningful chunk of electric usage to lower utility bills significantly. For tenants who prioritize green amenities, solar is at the top of the list of features they\u2019ll pay a premium for.    Add eco-friendly features renters value      When you \u201cgo green,\u201d you\u2019re actually building pricing power. By offering tenants amenities and appliances that save money while providing comfort, you\u2019re delivering the kind of value tenants won\u2019t hesitate to pay more for. That means shorter vacancies, faster lease signings, and higher profits.

which represents 49 First Nations across northern Ontario - said the situation on the ground was getting \"desperate.\"</p><p>\"There's concerns about how close the fire is to the community, smoke in the runway and the ability for planes to land,\" he said. \"The airport is the concern.\"</p><p>The decision on a full evacuation came a day after Pikangikum declared an emergency due to smoke from the nearby blaze, which is about 404 square kilometres in size and burning about six kilometres southwest of the community, on the opposite side of a lake.</p><p>\"The fire hazard is high to extreme for the province today, so high winds, low relative humidity and fuels that will burn can contribute to fast moving fires,\" said Jolanta Kowalski, a spokeswoman with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. \"That can challenge suppression efforts on new and existing fires.\"</p><p>Authorities said evacuees were being taken to the Ontario communities of Hearst, Smooth Rock Falls, and Kapuskasing while officials assessed the spaces available in other centres.</p><p>The Canadian Armed Forces said it was sending 20 Canadian rangers to the community provide ground support and a plane to airlift vulnerable community members to a safe location.</p><p>It was the second time in three months that some were forced to leave their homes - a different fire had led to vulnerable residents leaving in late May and early June.</p><p>Meanwhile, the northwestern Ontario First Nation of Keewaywin has also declared an emergency and evacuated its residents as a different forest fire - which is about 719 square kilometres in size - burns eight kilometres south of the community.</p><p>Fiddler said the forest fires highlighted larger issues around climate change. \"This has probably been one of the busiest fire seasons on record and it's only the middle of July,\" he said. \"Our fear is that it's communities like those that are situated in the NAN territories that will be most at risk.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-148773f56b4e49158e55f4f39033ff40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHS-6WV1-JBVR-334M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"471\"/><timeReceived>03:52 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 8, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>National</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ontario</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Forestry</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001196</classCode><className>NATIVE AMERICANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0008X7K</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They said that after igniting the tree, the fire spread to the thick layer of decomposed plant material on the ground known as humus lying in a remote area at an altitude of around 3,800 metres (12,500 feet.)</p><p>The 31 died after wind, dry air and combustible material creative an explosive effect.

On Thursday, Harris County commissioners will consider adding the county to the growing list of municipalities under burn bans, the Harris County Fire Marshal's Office said. They said they will ask for the unincorporated areas of the county to be placed under the burn ban until drought conditions improve.  There are already burn bans for several other counties in Southeast Texas. Take a look at the list below.  Fort Bend County  On Monday, the Fort Bend County Fire Marshal declared a burn ban was in effect after the Fort Bend County Commissioners Court approved an outdoor burn ban for all unincorporated areas.  Officials urged the public to cease activities such as outdoor burning, campfires, trash burning, open flames, and more.  Montgomery County  On Tuesday, Montgomery County Judge Mark Keough declared a Declaration of Local Disaster and ordered all outdoor burning to cease until further notice. He added that the decision was made in consultation with the county's fire marshal and the Office of Homeland Security &amp; Emergency Management.  Judge Keough cited the persistent lack of rainfall, high temperatures, low humidity, and other conditions as contributing factors to his decision.  Waller County  On Wednesday, the Waller County Commissioners Court voted and approved a burn ban for unincorporated areas of the county.  In a Facebook post, the Waller County Fire Marshal's Office urged residents to stop all outdoor burning due to the extreme drought conditions. They cited the county's high drought index range, used to determine forest fire potential, as evidence for needing the ban.  Liberty County  On Oct. 10, Liberty County Judge Jay Knight declared a local disaster and burn ban for all unincorporated areas of the county. In the official declaration document, the judge said Liberty County's current weather forecast does not predict rain for the next 30 days, meaning the conditions to reduce the county's Keaton-Byrum Drought Index (KDBI) range to a level below severe drought conditions will not happen soon.  You can read the full document by visiting Liberty County's website.  Matagorda County  Matagorda County issued its burn ban on Thursday, according to a Facebook post by the Matagorda County Emergency Operation Center.  \"This measure is critical to ensure public safety and protect air quality in our communities,\" said Amanda Campos, EMT-P, Emergency Management/911 Coordinator for Matagorda County OEM. \"We urge all residents, schools, and local organizations to comply fully and immediately with these restrictions,\" Campos added.  The county said the ban will remain in effect until weather conditions improve and the risk of wildfire subsides.  Chambers County  Chambers County issued its county-wide burn ban on Wednesday, according to a post on its Facebook page.  \"These measures are being taken due to elevated fire risk. We appreciate your cooperation in helping protect lives, property, and natural resources,\" the post said.  Austin County  A burn ban was declared in Austin County on Oct. 13, according to court documents.  The document stated that the use of combustible materials in an outdoor environment was prohibited, including trash, brush, and open campfires, but said the use of above-ground cooking grills was allowed, as long as it was in a safe area clear of debris.  Polk County  Polk County Judge Sydney Murphy issued an order on Oct. 7 prohibiting outdoor burning for 30 days.  Walker County  A burn ban for all of Walker County was issued on Oct. 6, according to an Instagram post from the county's Office of Emergency Management.  Wharton County  According to the Wharton County Office of Emergency Management, the county burn ban has been in effect since September.

He emphasised that the districts of Mandi, Kullu, Chamba and Shimla should be accorded the top priority. The Chief Secretary also instructed the Public Works Department (PWD) Secretary to coordinate with departments such like Forest, Jal Shakti and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to ensure effective planning and implementation.  He said that henceforth, the power to grant permission for muck removal has been delegated to the District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs), which was earlier exercised at the state level.  The Chief Secretary was presiding over the 26th meeting of the State Executive Committee (SEC), constituted under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, here.  The meeting laid special emphasis on reviewing and confirming the action taken reports on various directions issued during previous meetings.  The committee also discussed the establishment of early warning systems by the specified dam authorities, in accordance with the 2015 guidelines and the provisions of the Dam Safety Act of 2021.  The Chief Secretary said the state has 30 major dams, of which 25 have been completed and five are under construction.  The meeting also deliberated on the preliminary project report under the National Landslide Risk Mitigation Programme, amounting to Rs 139 crore, which will be submitted to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).  Additionally, the preliminary project report under the mitigation scheme for Forest Fire Risk Management (MSFFRM) through the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF), worth Rs 8.16 crore, was taken up for ex-post facto approval of the SEC.  The Committee also considered the ex-post facto approval for the utilisation of SDRF/NDRF funds amounting to Rs 78.76 lakh for the removal of 46,988 cubic meters of debris from public places in Mandi district.  A proposal for the establishment of a State Disaster Response Reserve (SDRR) on the lines of the National Disaster Response Reserve (NDRR) was also discussed and approved during the meeting.  --IANS  vg/pgh</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57800747356</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GV8-KH93-RS4P-62NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ProKerala.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 27, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC000DESE</classCode><className>NATIONAL HIGHWAYS AUTHORITY OF INDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS237310 HIGHWAY, STREET &amp;

Held in the charming coastal town of Sitges, just 25 miles from Barcelona, this renowned event offers a thrilling escape into the world of fantastic cinema. The festival promises a unique experience, featuring films that range from spine-chilling horror to intense martial arts action, all set against the picturesque backdrop of Catalonia. Whether you\u2019re a film enthusiast or a thrill-seeking traveler, the Sitges Film Festival 2025 is the perfect destination to indulge in unforgettable cinematic experiences.  A Thrilling Blend of Horror and Adventure at Sitges Film Festival 2025  This year, the festival surprised audiences with a series of films that blend terror with unexpected adventures. One of the most talked-about films, The Virgin of the Quarry Lake, captivated viewers with its intense and thrilling climax, featuring killer dogs in an eerie, slow-burning coming-of-age story. The film, set against the backdrop of Argentina\u2019s 2001 economic turmoil, explores supernatural elements with a shocking finale involving vicious animals.  For those looking for more canine carnage, Todos los Males offers a dark tale set in 1950s Chile, where a young boy uncovers his family\u2019s terrifying secrets, including bloodthirsty hounds. Meanwhile, in Shelby Oaks, a woman investigating her sister\u2019s disappearance makes the classic mistake of venturing into an abandoned prison, only to find it guarded by ferocious dogs.  Metaphors and Monsters Unveiled at Sitges Film Festival 2025  In the surreal film Balearic, young working-class teenagers are trapped in a pool by aggressive Belgian Malinois dogs while the wealthy ignore an encroaching forest fire. This allegorical tale delivers more than just thrills\u2014it raises questions about societal divides and human awareness. It\u2019s a great choice for travelers who appreciate films with deeper meaning and symbolism.  A Glimpse Into Ghostly Stories and Rogue Animals  For a lighter take on man\u2019s best friend, Good Boy offers a unique twist: the story unfolds from the perspective of a loyal Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever. The ghost story takes place in a dark house where the dog senses a malevolent force, much to the obliviousness of his owner.  Pets turning rogue didn\u2019t stop with dogs. Primate, set in Hawaii, introduces a terrifying chimpanzee that traps a group of teens in a swimming pool, leading to jaw-dropping action and thrills. It\u2019s a perfect film for animal lovers with a dark side, offering both adventure and fear in a tropical paradise.  New Tropes in Horror Cinema  While rogue pets stole the show, another notable trend was the use of vomiting as a cinematic trope, which popped up in several films at the festival. From Silencio\u2014a Spanish vampire series\u2014to We Bury the Dead, where a zombie twist shakes up traditional narratives, this theme was unexpected yet oddly entertaining.  A Local Flavor of Action and Martial Arts at Sitges Film Festival 2025  If you\u2019re a fan of martial arts, Sitges has something special in store. Forbidden City, a thrilling action-packed film, brings to life intense kitchen fight scenes and high-energy combat, reminiscent of Jackie Chan\u2019s iconic moves. But it\u2019s The Furious, a spectacular martial arts showdown, that leaves a lasting impression with its relentless choreography and action. Fans of fast-paced action won\u2019t want to miss this!  A Glimpse Into Japanese Surrealism: New Group  For a quirky yet thought-provoking experience, New Group, a Japanese film, captivates with its anti-conformist message and strange, surreal visuals. The film evokes comparisons to the work of famed horror manga artist Junji Ito. It\u2019s an excellent choice for travelers looking to explore both the bizarre and the beautiful in cinema.  A Festival Like No Other  The International Fantastic Film Festival of Catalonia is a must-visit for thrill-seeking travelers. It offers a perfect blend of horror, adventure, and culture.

According to Thursday's update from the European Forest Fire Information System, wildfires have scorched 403,171 hectares of land in Spain so far this year. Around 350,000 hectares were destroyed in just the past two weeks, coinciding with a severe heat wave that began in early August.  Martin-Vide emphasized that climate models point to worsening conditions in the coming decades. \"Adaptation is key to reducing the risk,\" he said, noting that temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in central and northern Europe will pose serious challenges to societies less accustomed to extreme heat.  He called for stronger prevention measures and better landscape management, highlighting the effects of rural depopulation. \"The woods are not as clean as in the past, when there were cattle, sheep, goats grazing and eating the vegetation that now acts as the fuel that starts a forest fire,\" he explained.  The climatologist urged innovative strategies, including the creation of \"mosaic landscapes with forest areas interspersed with cultivated fields,\" to make land more defensible against blazes.  He also pointed to adaptation already underway in agriculture, as olive and wine producers move production to higher altitudes, in search of more favorable climatic conditions to maintain both quality and output.  Martin-Vide welcomed the Spanish government's plan to establish a nationwide pact on fire prevention, calling it \"very necessary.\"  Spain is enduring its worst summer for wildfires this century, with more than 20 major blazes still burning, mainly in the northwestern provinces of Orense, Zamora and Leon. The interior ministry said over 33,000 people have been evacuated, while four people, including three firefighters, have died.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57508718200</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJD-5M83-SC22-S180-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"423\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>TheStar.com.my</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 21, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC00059LB</classCode><className>WINE.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS445320 BEER, WINE, AND LIQUOR RETAILERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS424820 WINE &amp;

Excelsior Correspondent NEW DELHI, Oct 8: India\u2019s space economy is projected to reach about $44 billion by 2033, Union Minister of State for Science and Technology Dr. Jitendra Singh said, underlining that landmark reforms and private sector participation are powering the country\u2019s emergence as a global space player. The summit brought together key stakeholders from government, industry, and academia to deliberate on the future of satellite communications in India\u2019s digital growth story. Dr. Jitendra Singh emphasised that satellite communication will serve as the backbone of India\u2019s digital infrastructure and play a decisive role in connecting remote regions where terrestrial networks face geographical barriers. With more than 70 per cent of new ATMs being installed in rural areas, he said satcom would be vital for ensuring financial inclusion and expanding digital services. The Minister highlighted that India\u2019s space economy, valued at $8.4 billion in 2022, is on track to expand nearly fivefold over the next decade. He credited reforms such as the creation of New Space India Limited (NSIL) and the establishment of IN-SPACe for dismantling decades of state monopoly and enabling private innovation. As a result, more than 300 space startups have emerged in just five years, making India the world\u2019s fifth-largest space startup ecosystem. India\u2019s achievements have also been marked by cost-effective innovation. Chandrayaan-3\u2019s historic soft landing near the Moon\u2019s south pole in 2023 earned India global recognition, including the World Space Award, at roughly half the cost of comparable international missions. Commercially, India has launched 433 foreign satellites, generating over $190 million and \u20ac270 million in revenue. Looking ahead, Dr. Jitendra Singh highlighted India\u2019s long-term space roadmap. By 2035, India plans to set up its own Bharatiya Antariksh Station, while by 2040, an Indian astronaut is expected to land on the Moon and announce the vision of \u201cViksit Bharat 2047.\u201d The roadmap also envisages launching more than 100 satellites over the next 15 years, most of them small satellites developed through government-private partnerships. The Minister also spoke of how space technology is shaping governance. Programs like SVAMITVA have already provided land ownership rights to more than 2.4 crore rural property owners across 1.61 lakh villages through satellite mapping. Satellites are now integral to disaster management, daily forest fire monitoring, and agricultural yield assessments, in addition to powering flagship schemes like Gati Shakti for infrastructure planning and NavIC for navigation. Dr. Jitendra Singh said India\u2019s space diplomacy was strengthening through missions such as the upcoming Chandrayaan-5 in collaboration with Japan and the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission. Neighbouring countries, too, are increasingly dependent on Indian satellites for disaster management and communication support. The event featured keynote addresses by Dr. Pawan Goenka, Chairman of IN-SPACe, and Dr. V. Narayanan, Chairman of ISRO and Secretary, Department of Space, who highlighted India\u2019s expanding role in the global space sector. The session concluded with a vote of thanks, marking a collaborative beginning to discussions on advancing universal connectivity through satellite networks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57887203495</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GXR-MC73-RS14-8144-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Daily Excelsior.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 8, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DQ7E</classCode><className>EARTH OBSERVATION SATELLITES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DT12</classCode><className>TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DQ7B</classCode><className>SMALL SATELLITES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX002286</classCode><className>SPACE TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DZPE</classCode><className>INNOVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0008WTA</classCode><className>SPACE EXPLORATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp;

Also quieter titles: a recreation of a 1970s interview with a celebrated New York art scene photographer, and a father-daughter drama from the filmmaker behind the 2022 standout The Worst Person in the World.  Christy  In theaters Friday  [embedded content]  Christy Martin, whose life story is featured in the new film Christy, grew up a coal miner's daughter in West Virginia. After playing Little League baseball and basketball with the boys, she got a basketball scholarship to college. Then she began boxing in local amateur tough-man contests. She wore pink trunks, had a mean left hook, and enjoyed trash-talking her opponents. She kept winning fights, and was the first woman signed by promoter and boxing impresario Don King.  In the 1990s, Christy Martin was considered the most exciting and successful female boxer. She won titles, fought at Madison Square Garden and made it onto the cover of Sports Illustrated. She was later inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Martin says inside the boxing ring, she felt safe. But her private life was a different story. For two decades, she suffered her husband's emotional and physical brutality. Actress Sydney Sweeney portrays Martin in the film, which is more than a rise-to-fame biopic: Christy depicts how Martin's then-husband tried to make good on decades of threats, and how Christy survived being stabbed and shot by him in 2010. \u2014 Mandalit del Barco  Die My Love  In theaters Friday  [embedded content]  Director and co-writer Lynne Ramsay adapts Ariana Harwicz's novel Die, My Love and gives Jennifer Lawrence the challenging role of Grace, a new mother in the throes of severe postpartum depression. Grace feels ignored in the isolated, rural family home she shares with her aloof partner Jackson (Robert Pattinson). Lawrence is a compelling presence and more than game to go through the pangs the part calls for, and she shares some strong scenes with Sissy Spacek, playing Jackson's empathetic mother Pam. But the storytelling is too abstract and at a remove to fully lock in emotionally, and as Grace's descent takes unsurprising turns, I was reminded of other, more successful works conveying this delicate subject matter \u2014 A Woman Under the Influence, for one. \u2014 Aisha Harris  Predator: Badlands  In theaters Friday  [embedded content]  In sequels and novels, comics and video games, various Predators have faced off against everything from Aliens to Batman to, recently, a very resourceful young Comanche woman, in 2022's Prey. Predator: Badlands is the latest iteration of the franchise about an alien race that hunts things using all sorts of space-gadgets. In this version, Dek, the runt of his Predator litter, goes to the deadly planet of Genna to hunt down a hideous monster, because he's determined to prove to his clan that he's got what it takes to belong to the species of intergalactic badasses that audiences first met back in a 1987 Schwarzenegger movie. This Predator, played by Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, is aided by the top half of an abandoned robot named Thia, played by Elle Fanning. \u2014 Glen Weldon  Peter Hujar's Day  In limited theaters Friday  [embedded content]  Writer and director Ira Sachs' character-portrait two-hander will likely sound stagy and static, but it turns out to be not just resonant, but surprisingly cinematic as played by Ben Whishaw and Rebecca Hall. Sachs is recreating an interview that writer Linda Rosenkrantz recorded with photographer Peter Hujar on Dec. 19, 1974, for a never-published book about the daily lives of artists. The two were friends, and she asked him to relate in detail his activities of the day before. The original audio tape was lost, but a typewritten transcript of the interview lived on, donated by Rosenkrantz to the Morgan Library and Museum in New York City. It was published as a book in 2021.  The film's recreation finds Hujar, fidgeting and chainsmoking as he namedrops casually about members of the 1970s downtown art scene \u2014 Susan Sontag, Lauren Hutton, Bob (Robert) Wilson, Fran Lebowitz, William S. Burroughs \u2014 to regale Rosenkrantz, who is comparatively laconic. The most sustained (and most amusing) anecdote begins with Hujar debating whether to wear his red ski jacket or a more bohemian coat to shoot Allen Ginsberg for The New York Times. He decides on the jacket, and regrets it as he heads to Ginsberg's apartment for the shoot. The beat poet proves a difficult, testy subject, but Hujar gets the shot he needs. Then he buys liverwurst for a sandwich, develops the photos in his darkroom, has a few conversations, lets a friend whose hot water isn't working take a shower. It's all minor key, but thoroughly engaging, somewhat in the manner of Louis Malle's My Dinner with Andre, or perhaps the less formal artists-gabbing films of Andy Warhol. The director lets daylight fade to a candlelit evening meal as the minutia of Peter Hujar's Day becomes an understated aria for Whishaw, and a spoken-word concert both for Hall's active listener \u2014 and for the movie audience. \u2014 Bob Mondello  Sentimental Value  In limited theaters Friday  [embedded content]  Joachim Trier's eloquent drama centers on the two long-neglected daughters of a film director (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) overly caught up in his career. Nora (Renate Reinsve, the star of Trier's The Worst Person in the World) is suffering a case of stage fright when we meet her, possibly because she knows her father won't show up. Her opening night will end in triumph with her sister Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), an academic and former child performer in their father's biggest artistic triumph, present to back her up.  Shortly after, at their mother's funeral, things are the other way around \u2014 Agnes a basket case and Nora the strong one \u2014 when dad shows up, not to mourn the wife he left long ago, but to drop off a script he's written for Nora. She angrily turns him down, and he reluctantly casts a visiting American star (Elle Fanning), having her alter her hair color to match Nora's. Trier anchors the film in the ornate Victorian home that's been in the family for generations. If its walls could talk, they'd tell of mom dying by suicide, the girls growing up, and dad's new movie, which is set at the home, almost incestuously. The dynamics are fraught, the performances as understated as they are heartbreaking. And the plot, which keeps you guessing up to the final moments of the final scene, is riveting. \u2014 Bob Mondello  Train Dreams  In limited theaters Friday; streaming on Netflix Nov. 21  [embedded content]  The grandeur of the Pacific Northwest, and the irrevocability of change, love, memory, cruelty and heartbreak all come together in Clint Bentley's gorgeous historical drama set in the early 20th century. It's the age of the steam locomotive and westward expansion, centered on an intimate portrait of Robert Grainier (Joel Edgerton) a taciturn day laborer and logger who meets Gladys (Felicity Jones), the love of his life and the mother of a daughter he seldom sees, since he's forever off working to support them. Grainier is passive, amazed, and often bewildered in a story crammed with incident \u2014 a Chinese coworker tossed off a bridge in a fit of anti-immigrant pique, a felled tree killing three loggers, a comet streaking in the night sky, memories made and lost, stones laid out in a square to mark the future walls of a log cabin, a forest fire laying waste to dreams. It's breathtaking, with Terrence Malick-esque visuals and wrenching emotions. \u2014 Bob Mondello</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

After the North Carolina Tar Heels dropped below .500 with a 38-10 loss against the Clemson Tigers, Bill Belichick has been squarely in the spotlight.  There have been numerous reports about the football program currently being in disarray, with fights between players, an assistant coach being suspended, and Belichick discussing an \"exit strategy\" with UNC's administration. Despite an obvious \"Toxic environment\" in Chapel Hill, there were separate statements released on Wednesday night from both Belichick and athletic director Bubba Cunningham to reassure everything was \"business as usual.\"   Outside of what seems like the beginning of the end for the legendary NFL coach, his handpicked general manager dropped an ill-timed article, leaving many to wonder what's really going on at UNC. Michael Lombardi latest, \"How Great Leaders Motivate the Already Great,\" was published on his \"The Daily Coach\" site Thursday morning. He used an example of the Ryder Cup struggles for the US, but also shared a bit about Bill Parcells using a fake trade to motivate NFL great and UNC alum Lawrence Taylor.    \"Parcells understood Taylor was capable of playing better, so he devised a motivational technique to stir Taylor\u2019s competitive juices,\" Lombardi wrote. \"Parcells placed a round-trip ticket to New Orleans on the stool in Taylor\u2019s locker, leaving Saturday, returning Monday. If Taylor used the ticket and headed to the Big Easy, he would have missed his game against the Rams. Taylor wasn\u2019t shy about having a good time and would\u2019ve loved a free first-class ticket to New Orleans if he didn\u2019t have a game that weekend.  \"Confused, Taylor went in to see Parcells and asked what the trip to New Orleans was all about. Parcells told Taylor he made a deal with the Saints to lend them Taylor for the weekend, and in return, they\u2019d send (Pat) Swilling to New York. Clearly, this fake trade pissed off Taylor, who went out and played his best against the Rams. What Parcells did was trigger his great player into proving his greatness. Parcells knew Taylor would want to prove him wrong. He made it personal, and Taylor would never want to hear Parcells complain again. There was no way Taylor could face Parcells if he didn\u2019t play his best.\"   Was this a subtle shot at the UNC players? If not, the timing is terrible. Lombardi took heat from several people on social media as well.   \"It's an unstructured mess,\" a source with first-hand knowledge of the UNC program told WRAL News. \"There's no culture, no organization. It's a complete disaster.\"  Multiple sources believe the Tar Heels locker room is divided due to a disorganized coaching staff and a failure to communicate.    \"It's all starting at the top, and the boys are being affected,\" a parent of a current UNC player said under the condition of anonymity told WRAL. \"I don't fault the players; I fault the leadership that created this toxic environment. There's an individualistic mindset. The boys are young, and they are feeding into it.\"  Lombardi's words are just fuel to the forest fire burning at UNC. Coming in with the \"33rd NFL team\" approach was clearly a mistake. This is a program in need of a coach and his staff to develop talent for the next level, not one who will foster what's happening currently.

Sugreeva expresses through hand gestures and facial expression his agonies and his hardships on living alone in a solitary wood.  Sugreeva, for fear of his elder brother Bali, has taken refuge in the Malyavan Mountain. Hounded out of his palace, Sugreeva bemoans his sad lot, living alone in the forest facing the rigours of nature. He sees around him in the forest, a reflection of his own mental state. \u201cMy good God, will my miseries never end? Exposed to the sun, drenched by the rains, shivering in the cold and open to the winds, I live in the forest. Would I ever see a normal comfortable life? He decides to take a leaf and tried to go deep into the issue. First he sees that there is no Friend but there is foe. At that time, he sees a deer running away frightened hearing a hunter\u2019s bow. On taking shelter in a cave, it is frightened to see a lion in it. When he takes up the leaf and looks a second time, he sees Friend and foe. In another angle, he sees a snake hiding in a hole fearing Garuda flying in the sky. Then, Hanuman comes and allies with him. Looking a third time, he sees that he has Friend but there is no foe. In a direction, a peacock dances seeing the dark clouds and a forest fire starts. Later he sees that it rains and the fire ends. Then, seeing Rama and Lakshmana on the banks of the river Pamba, he asks Hanuman, Please go and find the truth behind it and kindly bring them here and make them join hands with me. Sugreeva sees Hanuman returning with Rama &amp; Lakshmana .Here, with the fire as witness, the scene of Sugreeva making friends with Rama is acted out. Together with Rama, Lakshmana, and Hanuman, Sugreeva returns to Kishkindha and boldly challenges Bali to battle  On the Stage: Sugreeva: Nepathya Sreehari Chakyar Mizhavu: Kalamandalam Manikandan, Nepathya Jiensh Edakka: Kalanilayam Rajan Thalam: Dr. Indu G.

A leading climatologist warns these fires signal growing climate risks for all of Europe. The expert emphasizes that adaptation through better landscape management is crucial. Countries previously spared extreme heat must prepare for rising temperatures moving northward.  Madrid, Aug 22: The devastating wildfires sweeping across Spain this summer should serve as a warning to the rest of Europe about the rising dangers of climate change, a Barcelona-based climatologist said.  Key Points  Spain has lost over 400,000 hectares to wildfires this year alone  Climate models predict worsening heat conditions across Europe in coming decades  Rural depopulation leaves forests uncleaned creating more fire fuel  Adaptation strategies include mosaic landscapes and higher altitude farming  \"This is a warning to countries that have traditionally enjoyed temperate, cool summers... because these conditions of intense heat will increase in latitude and will reach these countries,\" Javier Martin-Vide, climatologist and professor of physical geography at the University of Barcelona, told Xinhua.  According to Thursday's update from the European Forest Fire Information System, wildfires have scorched 403,171 hectares of land in Spain so far this year. Around 350,000 hectares were destroyed in just the past two weeks, coinciding with a severe heat wave that began in early August, Xinhua news agency reported.  Martin-Vide emphasised that climate models point to worsening conditions in the coming decades. \"Adaptation is key to reducing the risk,\" he said, noting that temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in central and northern Europe will pose serious challenges to societies less accustomed to extreme heat.  He called for stronger prevention measures and better landscape management, highlighting the effects of rural depopulation. \"The woods are not as clean as in the past, when there were cattle, sheep, goats grazing and eating the vegetation that now acts as the fuel that starts a forest fire,\" he explained.  The climatologist urged innovative strategies, including the creation of \"mosaic landscapes with forest areas interspersed with cultivated fields,\" to make land more defensible against blazes.  He also pointed to adaptation already underway in agriculture, as olive and wine producers move production to higher altitudes, in search of more favorable climatic conditions to maintain both quality and output.  Martin-Vide welcomed the Spanish government's plan to establish a nationwide pact on fire prevention, calling it \"very necessary.\"  Spain is enduring its worst summer for wildfires this century, with more than 20 major blazes still burning, mainly in the northwestern provinces of Orense, Zamora and Leon. The interior ministry said over 33,000 people have been evacuated, while four people, including three firefighters, have died.   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57512724883</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJJ-5HB3-RRRR-53TC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"536\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NewKerala.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 22, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC00059LB</classCode><className>WINE.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>NAICS445320 BEER, WINE, AND LIQUOR RETAILERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>NAICS424820 WINE &amp;

The summit brought together key stakeholders from government, industry, and academia to deliberate on the future of satellite communications in India\u2019s digital growth story.  Dr. Jitendra Singh emphasised that satellite communication will serve as the backbone of India\u2019s digital infrastructure and play a decisive role in connecting remote regions where terrestrial networks face geographical barriers. With more than 70 per cent of new ATMs being installed in rural areas, he said satcom would be vital for ensuring financial inclusion and expanding digital services.  The Minister highlighted that India\u2019s space economy, valued at $8.4 billion in 2022, is on track to expand nearly fivefold over the next decade. He credited reforms such as the creation of New Space India Limited (NSIL) and the establishment of IN-SPACe for dismantling decades of state monopoly and enabling private innovation. As a result, more than 300 space startups have emerged in just five years, making India the world\u2019s fifth-largest space startup ecosystem.  India\u2019s achievements have also been marked by cost-effective innovation. Chandrayaan-3\u2019s historic soft landing near the Moon\u2019s south pole in 2023 earned India global recognition, including the World Space Award, at roughly half the cost of comparable international missions. Commercially, India has launched 433 foreign satellites, generating over $190 million and \u20ac270 million in revenue.  Looking ahead, Dr. Jitendra Singh highlighted India\u2019s long-term space roadmap. By 2035, India plans to set up its own Bharatiya Antariksh Station, while by 2040, an Indian astronaut is expected to land on the Moon and announce the vision of \u201cViksit Bharat 2047.\u201d The roadmap also envisages launching more than 100 satellites over the next 15 years, most of them small satellites developed through government-private partnerships.  The Minister also spoke of how space technology is shaping governance. Programs like SVAMITVA have already provided land ownership rights to more than 2.4 crore rural property owners across 1.61 lakh villages through satellite mapping. Satellites are now integral to disaster management, daily forest fire monitoring, and agricultural yield assessments, in addition to powering flagship schemes like Gati Shakti for infrastructure planning and NavIC for navigation.  Dr. Jitendra Singh said India\u2019s space diplomacy was strengthening through missions such as the upcoming Chandrayaan-5 in collaboration with Japan and the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission. Neighbouring countries, too, are increasingly dependent on Indian satellites for disaster management and communication support.  \u201cSeventy per cent of our space technology is dedicated to development and ease of living, not just rocket launches,\u201d Dr. Jitendra Singh said, adding that the convergence of space technology, digital infrastructure, and governance would serve as the digital nervous system of Viksit Bharat 2047.  Concluding his address, the minister said India\u2019s cost-effective missions, expanding private partnerships, and ambitious space roadmap are positioning the country as a global leader. \u201cIndia\u2019s space sector has earned for the country an enduring space in the world arena,\u201d he remarked.  The event featured keynote addresses by Dr. Pawan Goenka, Chairman of IN-SPACe, and Dr. V.
