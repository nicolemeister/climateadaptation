And we don't even care where they go. We've had to move out 45 head and their calves.''</p><p>Farmer Elwin Whyte said the flames shot 30 metres feet in the air within a few kilometres from his wheat and barley operation on Thursday as the fire leaped from tree top to tree top.</p><p>Whyte sent his wife and younger children to safety but stayed behind with an older son to dig trenches and water down the outbuildings.</p><p>He said the situation was \"pretty scary.''</p><p>\"I was worried. You get quite excited.''</p><p>The 40-square-kilometre fire broke out Wednesday near the CNR rail line, but the cause of the blaze is still under investigation, Kauffman said.</p><p>The area is mainly wooded hills and farmland. Drought conditions and moderate winds have made it difficult to contain the fire, she said.</p><p>Hundreds of gas wells are in the area, but they were shut down as a precaution before the flames got too close.</p><p>More than 160 firefighters, including helicopters, are battling the blaze.</p><p>A total of 17 fires were burning in the province Friday.</p><p>The dry conditions prompted the province to extend a ban on open fires from a line between Peace River and Lac la Biche in northern Alberta to points just above the U.S. border.</p><p>\"The continued drying trend will result in a build up of high to extreme forest fire hazard conditions,'' said a provincial release. \"These conditions will increase the potential for out-of-control fires.''</p><p>So far this spring Alberta has received only trace amounts of moisture instead of normal rainfall levels of between 50 and 100 millimetres.</p><p>Major rivers south of northern Alberta are running at three-quarters to less than half of normal water levels.</p><p>The lack of moisture and a near record low mountain snowpack coupled with a dry winter and two previous dry summers has officials bracing for one of the worst agricultural droughts since the 1930's.</p><p>\"Almost 90 per cent of the provincial agriculture area doesn't have enough soil moisture for annual cropping this year,'' said Alberta Agriculture spokesman Lloyd Andruchow.</p><p>\"These conditions are threatening to impact what is a $7 billion primary agricultural industry in Alberta.''</p><p>The government is expected to announce additional drought support programs if the province doesn't receive significant rainfall by the end of June.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-200105250161</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:46YX-VM20-01G6-828G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"566\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>May 25, 2001 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Joining us on the<br/>phone with the latest on this volatile situation is the mayor, Greg<br/>Kamenka.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Greg, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>KAMENKA: Good morning.  You're welcome.</p><p>O'REGAN: First of all, give us the current status of the fire<br/>right now.</p><p>KAMENKA: The current status is that it's still on the edge of<br/>town [unintelligible] \u2026 we are watching and waiting.  The fire is<br/>burning.  It's not under control yet, but as long as the winds are<br/>blowing away from Lillooet we're in no immediate danger.  If the<br/>winds shift and come in the other direction it would turn around<br/>and come right back into Lillooet.  And that's when the danger<br/>certainly would be obvious [overtalk] --</p><p>O'REGAN: Mr. Mayor, how far away is that?  How many kilometres?</p><p>KAMENKA: Three kilometres from town.</p><p>O'REGAN: And the hope is that it will burn back on itself?</p><p>KAMENKA: If it does come back on itself it'll probably jump and<br/>come back into town, if it changes direction.  As long as it stays<br/>where it is or progresses in the direction away from town we aren't<br/>in immediate danger.</p><p>O'REGAN: How many firefighters are on the scene right now?</p><p>KAMENKA: In excess of 220.  They're coming in continually from<br/>various areas in BC now.  The forestry department is bringing in<br/>various attack crews and outside contractors as well.</p><p>O'REGAN: How are people doing there?  They must be just sitting<br/>and waiting, I guess, with the car packed up.  Is that the case?</p><p>KAMENKA: That's about all we can do.  People with respiratory<br/>problems have left town.  Some of the people with young children<br/>and animals have moved away from the community.  But otherwise, the<br/>Lillooet residents have experienced it in the past.  Every 10 or 20<br/>or 30 years there's a fire of various magnitudes.  And so, they're<br/>quite prepared for it.  They're watching and waiting at the present<br/>time.</p><p>O'REGAN: How bad is the smoke right now?  Tell me about the<br/>visibility there in the town.</p><p>KAMENKA: The visibility is [unintelligible] \u2026 at the base of<br/>the mountain.  It's not too bad.  It's difficult to breathe<br/>sometimes.  There is an inversion up over the fire.  The smoke is<br/>very, very heavy.  It makes it almost impossible for the<br/>firefighters to go in with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft<br/>until that smoke clears.  It's just too dangerous.</p><p>O'REGAN: Mr. Mayor, thank you very much for joining us this<br/>morning.  And we wish you and the entire community there nothing<br/>but the best of luck right now.</p><p>KAMENKA: Good.  Thank you very much for your interest.</p><p>O'REGAN: Thank you.<br/></p><p>Here's a look at the costs of last year's wildfires in British<br/>Columbia.

The coastal district has had 135 fires, which burned 295 hectares. Last year by the same date, 229 fires had burned 257.1 hectares.</p><p>Provincewide, 976 fires have been recorded this season, compared with 1,188 by the corresponding time in 1995 and 3,038 in 1994.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199608160005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1996</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4705-JFD0-01G6-82R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"232\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1996 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>August 16, 1996 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>PACIFIC FOREST PRODUCTS LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(CP) - Students at the B.C. Institute of Technology can stand in the midst of a raging forest fire without getting a hair singed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the school's fire simulation training centre, one of only two in North America, screens and speakers surround forestry students with the sights and sounds of a real forest fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The idea is to put them as close into the real thing as possible,'' said fire boss Robin Lihou, who teaches a fire management course.</p><p>From a control room at the back of a lecture theatre, the simulator projects fire images onto a giant screen at the front. Flames roar through speakers at a volume of 5,000 watts.</p><p>The student is given a walkie talkie to communicate with other role players. Up to eight other role players may share the theatre and the student's every move is followed by an audience of classmates.</p><p>The exersize tests decision-making, communication, budget-control and observation skills.</p><p>\"The idea is to imply a stress load,'' said Lihou. \"Some people perform well under stress.

As a result of the the southwest winds, smoke was pushed across Highway 69 and into some communities to the east of the fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Resources yesterday included CL415 water bombers, two bird dog aircraft, heavy helicopters T802 amphibious aircraft and ground crews, the ministry reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Additional crews from Mexico arrived on the fire today, bringing the total number of firefighters helping to suppress the fire to 90. Values protection, or sprinklers, will continue to be put in place on structures along the Pickerel River today.</p><p>\"Given the unpredictability of the fire, all access restrictions, including water restrictions, remain in place for the foreseeable future,\" reads a ministry press release. \"In the interest of public safety, on July 21, 2018 the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF)'s Parry Sound district recommended that the communities, municipalities and townships within the area below impose a mandatory evacuation of their residents with boat access only: All areas ranging from the western and northern borders of French River Provincial Park, east to Highway 69, and as far south as the south shore of the Key River; including all residents and members of the public on both the north and south shores of the French River, and the Pickerel River, as well as Hartley Bay.\"</p><p>There is also a recommendation by the ministry Parry Sound district to impose an evacuation alert to all residents within this area who have road access to their residences or cottages. These residents should be prepared to evacuate pending a change in the fire situation.</p><p>By the evening of July 25 there were 50 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 16 are not yet under control, 34 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>There were two new fires confirmed in the region today. Hearst 14, located approximately 42 kilometres south of Hearst, is two hectares and not yet under control. Two crews provided initial attack on the fire with aerial suppression support. Wawa 11 is being held at 0.1 hectares 75 kilometres southeast of Longlac.</p><p>(Tuesday, July 24, 11:10 p.m.):The fire is expected to remain relatively quiet for the next couple of days.</p><p>\"However, fire conditions and behaviour can change quickly. Crews continue to monitor weather and fire behaviour closely. Residents will see smoke in the area as crews continue suppression efforts. Values protection have been put in place in Key Harbour, along parts of the south side of Pickerel River and along a portion of the train tracks east of the fire.\"</p><p>A total of eight helicopters worked the fire on July 24.</p><p>As of July 24 the fire was at 5,612 hectares and still not under control.</p><p>The cause of the fire was originally stated as \"human\" on the MNR's website but that classification has since been removed, McCool said, to avoid public speculation.</p><p>\"Because the cause is still unknown at this time and it is under investigation.\"</p><p>(11:59 p.m., Monday, July 23): The Key River forest fire, known as Parry Sound 33, is now covering an area of 5,612 hectares and the restricted fire zone has been expanded to north of Rosseau.</p><p>According to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, Parry Sound 33 saw aerial fire suppression again on Monday, July 23. CL415s dropped water on the fire which was remapped at 5,612 hectares. Three heavy helicopters bucketed water to reduce the fire's intensity and co-ordinated with ground crews.</p><p>On July 21, the MNRF's Parry Sound district recommended that the communities, municipalities and townships within the area ranging from the western and northern borders of French River Provincial Park, east to Highway 69, and as far south as the south shore of the Key River; including all residents and members of the public on both the north and south shores of the French River, and the Pickerel River, as well as Hartley Bay impose a mandatory evacuation of their residents with boat access only.</p><p>There is also a recommendation by the MNRF Parry Sound district to impose an evacuation alert to all residents within this area who have road access to their residences or cottages. These residents should be prepared to evacuate pending a change in the fire situation.</p><p>In addition, the MNRF's Sudbury district has recommended that all residents along Hartley Bay Road be placed on an evacuation alert, pending changes to the fire situation.</p><p>The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and Conservation Officers have been on site helping notify the public of the situation, and facilitating this evacuation.</p><p>Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services (AFFES) has also been advised by Ontario Parks that the French River Provincial Park is fully closed west of Highway 69/400. All campers have been or are being evacuated. Ontario Parks has also suspended permit sales for the French River Delta and Pickerel River areas and are restricting entry to park users (everything west of Highway 69/400).</p><p>Henvey Inlet First Nation declared a state of emergency as a precautionary measure. As of July 22, the community has successfully and safely evacuated all of its community members, who are receiving accommodation and food.</p><p>Due to the extreme fire hazard and the large number of wildfires burning, the MNRF has expanded the Restricted Fire Zone to include some areas of the southern region. The new zone includes areas north of the community of Rosseau, northwest to Caramat, over to the Quebec border along Hwy 11 (to north of Abitibi Canyon) and southeast to Renfrew. This includes Algonquin Park, Parry Sound, Lake Superior Provincial Park, the North Shore of Lake Huron, Wawa, and Hearst. To check out more specific boundaries, visit Ontario.ca/forestfire and click on the interactive fire map.</p><p>During a Restricted Fire Zone, the use of open fires - such as campfires, or burning of brush or debris, is restricted. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to $25,000 and three months in jail, as well as financial responsibility for the costs incurred in fighting a forest fire.</p><p>Portable gas or propane stoves are permitted for use for cooking or warmth, though they should be closely monitored. Portable charcoal barbecues and Hibachis are not permitted unless within 100 metres of a dwelling, or within an organized campground.</p><p>Commercial campground operators may allow their guests to enjoy campfires during a Restricted Fire Zone period provided they meet certain conditions.</p><p>The Restricted Fire Zone is a temporary measure to reduce the number of new human-caused wildfires as the Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ontario MNRF expects the elevated forest fire hazard to continue into the foreseeable future.</p><p>By the evening of July 23 there were 55 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 21 are not yet under control, 34 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>There was only one new start in the region today. Sudbury 92 located near Johnnie Lake in Killarney Provincial Park covers 0.1 of a hectare and is already under control.</p><p>TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS</p><p>Pursuant to the Emergency Area Order signed July 21, 2018, an Implementation Order has been issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry prohibiting access and travel in portions of Parry Sound District where there are public safety hazards as a result of increased fire activity from Parry Sound 33.</p><p>The order restricts travel, access and use in an identified area and may be modified regularly to reflect changing fire conditions. This measure has been put in place to ensure public safety while allowing fire personnel to safely and effectively suppress the fires in the identified area.</p><p>All travel and use on the French River waterway, Pickerel River (West of Hwy 69/400), Henvey Inlet, Key River basin, and all associated tributaries that access these river systems, including all access from Georgian Bay, and all islands on Georgian Bay within the French River Provincial Park boundaries, Dokis Island system, and Puddick island and all islands north of Henvey Inlet near shore is prohibited.</p><p>All access roads west of Hwy 69/400, from Henvey Inlet north to the French River area are closed.</p><p>If a member of the public believes that access within the restricted travel area is necessary for nonrecreational purposes, please call to 705-746-4201 to request a travel authorization permit. MNRF will review the request for access based on the rationale provided, local fire activity, and the potential fire risk.</p><p>For information about the fire situation: 705-564-6165</p><p>For inquiries about French River Provincial Park restrictions: 705-857-1630 ext 224</p><p>For Parry Sound District information, including all calls related to the recommendation of these evacuations and alerts, call 705-773-4218.</p><p>For updates on highway conditions, including closures, please call 5-1-1.</p><p>See the map at Ontario.ca/forestfire</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018072446969517</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SX4-MMD1-JDH3-G113-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1524\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The fire is holding at 11,362 hectares.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Crews continue to work the perimeter and containment around the fire is almost complete. The total perimeter is almost 120 kilometers long. There are 275 firefighters and support staff currently working on this incident. That number will continue to fluctuate as staff complete their 14 day assignment and more staff become available after days of rest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the evening of August 7, there were 43 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 14 are not yet under control, 29 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Tuesday, Aug. 7, 9:40 p.m.): Though not yet under control, according to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, Parry Sound 33 had no new growth Tuesday, August 7. The fire is holding at 11,362 hectares.</p><p>Although this fire received approximately 10 millimetres of rain, extremely dry fuel conditions remain.</p><p>Firefighters took advantage of the precipitation, high humidity and low winds to continue consolidating hose lines around the perimeter. Crews continued to move inward to solidify control lines.</p><p>By the evening of Aug. 6, there were 44 active forest fires across northeast Ontario. Of these, 18 are not yet under control, 26 are either being held, under control or being observed. There were four new fires confirmed on Monday, Aug. 6, two of which are already been called out, including Parry Sound 38, which was located south of Parry Sound 33. It was confirmed at 0.1 hectares and declared out on Monday, Aug. 6.</p><p>UPDATE (Sunday, Aug. 5, 10:55 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown once again, to 11,362 hectares and is still not yet under control.</p><p>The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry say it was a challenging, hot and windy day on Aug. 5 and the fire responded as they expected.</p><p>However, even with the challenges and high temperatures, the crews managed to maintain the perimeter of the fire, thanks to the placement of the hose lines. Two minor spot fires on the northeast flank were quickly contained in the morning of Aug. 5.</p><p>Crews have made excellent progress over the last few days and now have hose lines around most of the fire perimeter. More work still needs to be done as crews will work inward to solidify the control lines.</p><p>Some structure protection (sprinklers) will be removed in areas of the fire where full containment has been achieved and the threat from those structures has been removed.</p><p>Some precipitation was reported over the fire on Aug. 5 and the MNRF is hopeful that the interior of the fire receives more rain from the weather system.</p><p>Today (Aug. 6), once again, there is the potential for strong winds. Some unsettled weather may bring some scattered thunderstorms with the possibility of 10 to 15 millimetres of patchy rain. It is anticipated that temperatures will be in the mid to high 20s with high humidity. Winds could august up to 30 kilometres an hour or more.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE (Saturday, Aug 4, 11:23 p.m.)</p><p>No new fires reported.</p><p>News coming from the MNRF for the Northeast region on Aug 4 is positive.</p><p>By the evening of August 4, there were 44 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 19 are not yet under control, 25 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>Nine forest fires are still active to the south and west of Fort Severn in the Far North. FireRanger crews and Coastal Rangers are responding.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE (Friday, Aug. 3 11:39 p.m.)</p><p>\"The fire is suppressed nicely along the Key River.\"</p><p>This good news is coming from the most recent MNRF Northeast Region Forest Fire Situation Update.</p><p>However the fire is still more than 11,000 hectares - a single hectare is about the size of an international soccer pitch. So imaging 11,000 soccer pitches. The evacuees from Henvey are expected to be out of their homes for another week.</p><p>On Friday higher humidity helped firefighers work on the blaze, laying hose around the perimeter of the fire.</p><p>\"Bucketing helicopters assisted crews in keeping the spread of the fire in check,\" states the MNRF release.</p><p>Read the rest of the MNRF release here:</p><p>\"Helicopter bucketing helped suppress isolated pockets of higher intensity, including torching, within the perimeter of the fire.</p><p>The west side of the fire remained quiet. Crews started to work into the interior of the perimeter along the south end of Key Harbour.</p><p>Tomorrow's weather calls for higher temperatures with low humidity. The hot, dry weather, coupled with the forecasted southwesterly winds, may cause an increase in fire behaviour and test our fire lines. If such an event occurs, we have the resources to respond appropriately.</p><p>It is important to note that while good progress is being made, the fire remains active. The conditions continue to be very dry, and extreme burning conditions are still possible. Land and water restrictions remain in place at this time for protection of people, property and to allow our crews to do their work. Patrols from OPP and Conservation Officers will continue throughout the area around the fire.</p><p>We continue to work hard to manage Parry Sound 33 in order to get people back into their residences safely. We thank you for your patience and ongoing support.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Thursday, August 2, 11:40 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 11,185 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>The ministry reports that Thursday, August 2, was another great day for crews working and laying hose around the perimeter of the fire. Crews continue to make excellent progress in critical areas, especially along the northeast side of the fire near the Pickerel River. Higher winds out of the southwest today tested the northeast perimeter, but the hose lines held and kept the fire's spread in check. It is estimated that most of the east flank has been tied with hose line.</p><p>On Thursday, August 2, waterbombers and helicopters worked in conjunction with the crews to help tie off areas of activity. The fire remains south of Key Harbour, and north of the Henvey Inlet waterway. Crews are working on perimeter containment on the southeast side of the fire north of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>The west side of the fire remains unchanged; the fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. Crews continue suppression along the western flank of the fire. Structural protection continues.</p><p>Even with Thursday's winds, the fire remains approximately five kilometers away from Highway 69 and less than one kilometer south of the Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of Highway 69. Today's weather calls for another day of southwesterly winds.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Wednesday, August 1, 11:55 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 11,039 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>The ministry reports recent weather allowed more accurate aerial mapping of the fire and aerial ignition in the southeast added to the increased size. Fire behaviour was less active yesterday, August 1, as high humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. Winds were generally out of the east today and changed the fire's direction of spread to the west. Hose lines on the west side of the fire held the fire's spread in check.</p><p>The ministry reports that excellent progress was made on the eastern side of the fire as crews were able to establish lines due to reduced fire behaviour when compared to previous days. Crews are laying hose from the Pickerel River south to establish a perimeter on areas that have passed over the CN line. Structural protection continues along the Key and French Rivers.</p><p>Crews continue to work the perimeter of the fire by the north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters remain along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Aerial ignition occurred in the southeast part of the fire removing hazardous fuels and tying the fire into the northern shore of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>Even though the focus of aerial fire suppression is on the northeast side, crews continue to supress and monitor all portions of the fire. The fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. North and east winds yesterday, August 1, made for smoky conditions in communities to the south. Winds are forecasted to be out of the south today, August 2, moving to the southwest in the afternoon. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of highway 69.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Tuesday, July 31, 10:45 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 10,139 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 31, fire behaviour was less active as humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. The northeast portion of the fire closest to the Pickerel River was the most active part today. Winds from the southwest pushed some activity along the Pickerel, but it's still holding south of the river. The northeast corner of the fire is tucked along the west side of Little Canoe Channel. Ignition operations in that area were completed Tuesday evening, July 31, to tie the fire together and slow its progression down.</p><p>Structural protection continues. Additional protection occurred along the Key and French Rivers with sprinklers set up in noted priority zones. Crews worked the perimeter of the fire by continuing hose line north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters were placed along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Even though the focus is on the northeast side, the ministry continues to supress and monitor all portions of the fire.</p><p>Winds are forecasted to be out of the north today, Aug, 1. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River.</p><p>The Municipality of Killarney issued an evacuation order for residents in the areas of Travers, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick, Bigwood (including Hartley Bay Road), a portion of Mowat, the Unsurveyed Area, 14 Mile Island and French River Provincial Park. For information, call the municipality at 705-287-2424.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Monday, July 30, 11:52 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire reportedly expanded by 749 hectares on Monday, reaching 8,973 hectares, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services. The fire is now approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>On Monday, July 30, winds occurred from the west/southwest. The northeast and east portions of the fire were the most active and a few of these sections progressed eastward towards the CN Line. Crews have been working hard to slow the fire's progression in this part of the fire.</p><p>Structural protection continues, with sprinklers set up on structures along the Pickerel and Key Rivers, as well as on structures along the French River on Hartley Bay Road.</p><p>Crews worked on the southeast portion to hold the perimeter and complete hose line, while water bucketing and water bombers along the east flank continued aerial suppression efforts to attempt to close in the fire.</p><p>The ministry reported that although the focus is currently on the northeast side, they continue to suppress and monitor all portions of the fire. Aerial ignition on portions of the fire near Fox Island have brought the fire to natural boundaries removing the fire hazard in this area.</p><p>The fire behaviour today, Tuesday, July 31, is expected to remain the same as Monday. High temperatures mixed with low humidity will be present on the fire site. Winds from the west/southwest will occur again into today, possibly bringing more smoke into surrounding communities and along Highway 69.</p><p>An Evacuation Alert has been issued by the Municipality of French River for the Alban area, west of the high-powered hydro lines on Highway 64.

That area is protected and the MNRF does not expect any movement in that area over the next few days.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE: (11:55 p.m. Thursday, July 26): The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry reports Parry Sound 33 is still not under control and growing.</p><p>According to the ministry in a news release dated 11:55 p.m., Thursday, July 26, by the evening of July 26 there were 45 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 15 are not yet under control, 30 are either being held, under control or being observed. Of the 15 not under control, Parry Sound 33 is one of them.</p><p>As of July 26, the fire is estimated at 6,760 hectares and there was minimal grown on the north, west and south end of the fire. The implementation order and all access restriction, including water access restriction, remain in place. The southwest winds are expected to continue today, possibly gusting from 30 to 40 kilometres per hour. Unfortunately, there is minimal precipitation in the forecast.</p><p>\"Crews continue to make excellent progress around the southwest side of the perimeter, laying hose and working on hotspots north and south of Key River,\" reads the release.\"Today's focus was on the north and east flank of the fire, which were once again active due to sustained southern and southwesterly winds. The fire did put on some growth along the east flank, with one area of the fire crossing both Tower Lake and impacting the CN rail in one location.\"</p><p>Continued growth of the fire is expected on the northeast flank today. Water bombers and helicopters worked most of the day halting or slowing the spread of the fire. Values protection, or sprinklers, continue to be placed along Pickerel River and began in Henvey Inlet as a precautionary measure.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE: (11:55 a.m. Wednesday, July 25): The Ministry of Natural Resources and Fire has expanded Northeast region restricted fire zone.</p><p>Due to strong, warmer and drier lake effect winds the ministry required aerial fire suppression yesterday, July 25, as fire activity increased. As a result of the the southwest winds, smoke was pushed across Highway 69 and into some communities to the east of the fire.</p><p>Resources yesterday included CL415 water bombers, two bird dog aircraft, heavy helicopters T802 amphibious aircraft and ground crews, the ministry reports.</p><p>Additional crews from Mexico arrived on the fire today, bringing the total number of firefighters helping to suppress the fire to 90.

The hot, dry weather, coupled with the forecasted southwesterly winds, may cause an increase in fire behaviour and test our fire lines. If such an event occurs, we have the resources to respond appropriately.</p><p>It is important to note that while good progress is being made, the fire remains active. The conditions continue to be very dry, and extreme burning conditions are still possible. Land and water restrictions remain in place at this time for protection of people, property and to allow our crews to do their work.

Crews continue to make excellent progress in critical areas, especially along the northeast side of the fire near the Pickerel River. Higher winds out of the southwest today tested the northeast perimeter, but the hose lines held and kept the fire's spread in check. It is estimated that most of the east flank has been tied with hose line.</p><p>On Thursday, August 2, waterbombers and helicopters worked in conjunction with the crews to help tie off areas of activity. The fire remains south of Key Harbour, and north of the Henvey Inlet waterway. Crews are working on perimeter containment on the southeast side of the fire north of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>The west side of the fire remains unchanged; the fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. Crews continue suppression along the western flank of the fire. Structural protection continues.</p><p>Even with Thursday's winds, the fire remains approximately five kilometers away from Highway 69 and less than one kilometer south of the Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of Highway 69. Today's weather calls for another day of southwesterly winds.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Wednesday, August 1, 11:55 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 11,039 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>The ministry reports recent weather allowed more accurate aerial mapping of the fire and aerial ignition in the southeast added to the increased size. Fire behaviour was less active yesterday, August 1, as high humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. Winds were generally out of the east today and changed the fire's direction of spread to the west. Hose lines on the west side of the fire held the fire's spread in check.</p><p>The ministry reports that excellent progress was made on the eastern side of the fire as crews were able to establish lines due to reduced fire behaviour when compared to previous days. Crews are laying hose from the Pickerel River south to establish a perimeter on areas that have passed over the CN line. Structural protection continues along the Key and French Rivers.</p><p>Crews continue to work the perimeter of the fire by the north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters remain along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Aerial ignition occurred in the southeast part of the fire removing hazardous fuels and tying the fire into the northern shore of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>Even though the focus of aerial fire suppression is on the northeast side, crews continue to supress and monitor all portions of the fire. The fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. North and east winds yesterday, August 1, made for smoky conditions in communities to the south. Winds are forecasted to be out of the south today, August 2, moving to the southwest in the afternoon. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of highway 69.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Tuesday, July 31, 10:45 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 10,139 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 31, fire behaviour was less active as humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. The northeast portion of the fire closest to the Pickerel River was the most active part today. Winds from the southwest pushed some activity along the Pickerel, but it's still holding south of the river. The northeast corner of the fire is tucked along the west side of Little Canoe Channel. Ignition operations in that area were completed Tuesday evening, July 31, to tie the fire together and slow its progression down.</p><p>Structural protection continues. Additional protection occurred along the Key and French Rivers with sprinklers set up in noted priority zones. Crews worked the perimeter of the fire by continuing hose line north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters were placed along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Even though the focus is on the northeast side, the ministry continues to supress and monitor all portions of the fire.</p><p>Winds are forecasted to be out of the north today, Aug, 1. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River.</p><p>The Municipality of Killarney issued an evacuation order for residents in the areas of Travers, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick, Bigwood (including Hartley Bay Road), a portion of Mowat, the Unsurveyed Area, 14 Mile Island and French River Provincial Park. For information, call the municipality at 705-287-2424.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Monday, July 30, 11:52 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire reportedly expanded by 749 hectares on Monday, reaching 8,973 hectares, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services. The fire is now approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>On Monday, July 30, winds occurred from the west/southwest. The northeast and east portions of the fire were the most active and a few of these sections progressed eastward towards the CN Line. Crews have been working hard to slow the fire's progression in this part of the fire.</p><p>Structural protection continues, with sprinklers set up on structures along the Pickerel and Key Rivers, as well as on structures along the French River on Hartley Bay Road.</p><p>Crews worked on the southeast portion to hold the perimeter and complete hose line, while water bucketing and water bombers along the east flank continued aerial suppression efforts to attempt to close in the fire.</p><p>The ministry reported that although the focus is currently on the northeast side, they continue to suppress and monitor all portions of the fire. Aerial ignition on portions of the fire near Fox Island have brought the fire to natural boundaries removing the fire hazard in this area.</p><p>The fire behaviour today, Tuesday, July 31, is expected to remain the same as Monday. High temperatures mixed with low humidity will be present on the fire site. Winds from the west/southwest will occur again into today, possibly bringing more smoke into surrounding communities and along Highway 69.</p><p>An Evacuation Alert has been issued by the Municipality of French River for the Alban area, west of the high-powered hydro lines on Highway 64. For more information on the evacuation, call the municipality at 705-898-2294 or visit frenchriver.ca.</p><p>#OPP #MNRF #NER reminding the public that if you access the Key, French or Pickerel Rivers by boat or plane you will be charged.

Additionally, there was minimal growth along the southwest portion of the fire.</p><p>Hose lay and containment will continue along the northern portion as crews look to secure that area.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE: (8:20 a.m. Saturday, July 28) - Parry Sound 33 is still not under control and continues to grow.</p><p>In a news release sent out at 12:35 a.m. on July 28, the fire has grown to 7,297 hectares. Due to the southwest winds, the northeast side is the most active part of the fire.</p><p>The northeast side of the fire is the focus for Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry water bombers and helicopter bucketing, as it is closest to the rail line and more populated areas.</p><p>There has been minimal growth on the southwest end of the fire.</p><p>Southwest winds are expected to continue tomorrow, possibly bringing heavy smoke conditions periodically into surrounding commentates and along Highway 69. The fire is approximately seven kilometres west of Highway 69 and three kilometres south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>Wildfire crews continue to make progress around the southwest side of the perimeter by laying hose lines and actively attacking hot spots in the Key Harbour. That area is protected and the MNRF does not expect any movement in that area over the next few days.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE: (11:55 p.m. Thursday, July 26): The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry reports Parry Sound 33 is still not under control and growing.</p><p>According to the ministry in a news release dated 11:55 p.m., Thursday, July 26, by the evening of July 26 there were 45 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 15 are not yet under control, 30 are either being held, under control or being observed. Of the 15 not under control, Parry Sound 33 is one of them.</p><p>As of July 26, the fire is estimated at 6,760 hectares and there was minimal grown on the north, west and south end of the fire. The implementation order and all access restriction, including water access restriction, remain in place. The southwest winds are expected to continue today, possibly gusting from 30 to 40 kilometres per hour. Unfortunately, there is minimal precipitation in the forecast.</p><p>\"Crews continue to make excellent progress around the southwest side of the perimeter, laying hose and working on hotspots north and south of Key River,\" reads the release.\"Today's focus was on the north and east flank of the fire, which were once again active due to sustained southern and southwesterly winds. The fire did put on some growth along the east flank, with one area of the fire crossing both Tower Lake and impacting the CN rail in one location.\"</p><p>Continued growth of the fire is expected on the northeast flank today. Water bombers and helicopters worked most of the day halting or slowing the spread of the fire. Values protection, or sprinklers, continue to be placed along Pickerel River and began in Henvey Inlet as a precautionary measure.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE: (11:55 a.m. Wednesday, July 25): The Ministry of Natural Resources and Fire has expanded Northeast region restricted fire zone.</p><p>Due to strong, warmer and drier lake effect winds the ministry required aerial fire suppression yesterday, July 25, as fire activity increased. As a result of the the southwest winds, smoke was pushed across Highway 69 and into some communities to the east of the fire.</p><p>Resources yesterday included CL415 water bombers, two bird dog aircraft, heavy helicopters T802 amphibious aircraft and ground crews, the ministry reports.</p><p>Additional crews from Mexico arrived on the fire today, bringing the total number of firefighters helping to suppress the fire to 90. Values protection, or sprinklers, will continue to be put in place on structures along the Pickerel River today.</p><p>\"Given the unpredictability of the fire, all access restrictions, including water restrictions, remain in place for the foreseeable future,\" reads a ministry press release. \"In the interest of public safety, on July 21, 2018 the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF)'s Parry Sound district recommended that the communities, municipalities and townships within the area below impose a mandatory evacuation of their residents with boat access only: All areas ranging from the western and northern borders of French River Provincial Park, east to Highway 69, and as far south as the south shore of the Key River; including all residents and members of the public on both the north and south shores of the French River, and the Pickerel River, as well as Hartley Bay.\"</p><p>There is also a recommendation by the ministry Parry Sound district to impose an evacuation alert to all residents within this area who have road access to their residences or cottages. These residents should be prepared to evacuate pending a change in the fire situation.</p><p>By the evening of July 25 there were 50 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 16 are not yet under control, 34 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>There were two new fires confirmed in the region today. Hearst 14, located approximately 42 kilometres south of Hearst, is two hectares and not yet under control. Two crews provided initial attack on the fire with aerial suppression support. Wawa 11 is being held at 0.1 hectares 75 kilometres southeast of Longlac.</p><p>(Tuesday, July 24, 11:10 p.m.):The fire is expected to remain relatively quiet for the next couple of days.</p><p>\"However, fire conditions and behaviour can change quickly. Crews continue to monitor weather and fire behaviour closely. Residents will see smoke in the area as crews continue suppression efforts. Values protection have been put in place in Key Harbour, along parts of the south side of Pickerel River and along a portion of the train tracks east of the fire.\"</p><p>A total of eight helicopters worked the fire on July 24.</p><p>As of July 24 the fire was at 5,612 hectares and still not under control.</p><p>The cause of the fire was originally stated as \"human\" on the MNR's website but that classification has since been removed, McCool said, to avoid public speculation.</p><p>\"Because the cause is still unknown at this time and it is under investigation.\"</p><p>(11:59 p.m., Monday, July 23): The Key River forest fire, known as Parry Sound 33, is now covering an area of 5,612 hectares and the restricted fire zone has been expanded to north of Rosseau.</p><p>According to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, Parry Sound 33 saw aerial fire suppression again on Monday, July 23. CL415s dropped water on the fire which was remapped at 5,612 hectares. Three heavy helicopters bucketed water to reduce the fire's intensity and co-ordinated with ground crews.</p><p>On July 21, the MNRF's Parry Sound district recommended that the communities, municipalities and townships within the area ranging from the western and northern borders of French River Provincial Park, east to Highway 69, and as far south as the south shore of the Key River; including all residents and members of the public on both the north and south shores of the French River, and the Pickerel River, as well as Hartley Bay impose a mandatory evacuation of their residents with boat access only.</p><p>There is also a recommendation by the MNRF Parry Sound district to impose an evacuation alert to all residents within this area who have road access to their residences or cottages. These residents should be prepared to evacuate pending a change in the fire situation.</p><p>In addition, the MNRF's Sudbury district has recommended that all residents along Hartley Bay Road be placed on an evacuation alert, pending changes to the fire situation.</p><p>The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and Conservation Officers have been on site helping notify the public of the situation, and facilitating this evacuation.</p><p>Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services (AFFES) has also been advised by Ontario Parks that the French River Provincial Park is fully closed west of Highway 69/400. All campers have been or are being evacuated. Ontario Parks has also suspended permit sales for the French River Delta and Pickerel River areas and are restricting entry to park users (everything west of Highway 69/400).</p><p>Henvey Inlet First Nation declared a state of emergency as a precautionary measure. As of July 22, the community has successfully and safely evacuated all of its community members, who are receiving accommodation and food.</p><p>By the evening of July 23 there were 55 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 21 are not yet under control, 34 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>There was only one new start in the region today. Sudbury 92 located near Johnnie Lake in Killarney Provincial Park covers 0.1 of a hectare and is already under control.</p><p>RESTRICTED FIRE ZONES</p><p>Restricted fire zone has expanded to additional parts of the northeast fire region (southern region)</p><p>Due to the extreme fire hazard, several recent periods of heavy lightning, little precipitation and increased forest fire activity, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has expanded the Restricted Fire Zone to include parts of the southern region of Ontario as outlined on the interactive map. This expansion of the current Restricted Fire Zone will be in effect as of 12:01 a.m. on July 24, and will remain in place until further notice.</p><p>The expanded Restricted Fire Zone now includes Zones 24, 25, and 26 which would include areas south of the French River, including Parry Sound, from Georgian Bay east to the Quebec border, including Algonquin Provincial Park and from Renfrew north to Mattawa.</p><p>To date, the current MNRF Restricted Fire Zone covers Zones 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, and 26 and restrictions will remain in place until further notice. See the fire map for an outline of the zones covered.</p><p>During a Restricted Fire Zone, the use of open fires - such as campfires, or burning of brush or debris is restricted. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to $25,000 and three months in jail, as well as financial responsibility for the costs incurred in fighting a forest fire.</p><p>Portable gas or propane stoves are permitted for use for cooking or warmth, though they should be closely monitored. Portable charcoal barbecues and Hibachis are not permitted unless within 100 metres of a dwelling, or within an organized campground.</p><p>Commercial campground operators may allow their guests to enjoy campfires during a Restricted Fire Zone period provided they meet certain conditions in the Outdoor Fires Regulation (207/96).</p><p>The Restricted Fire Zone is a temporary measure to reduce the number of new human-caused wildfires as the Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ontario Ministry of Resources and Forestry expects the elevated forest fire hazard to continue into the foreseeable future.</p><p>TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS</p><p>Travel restrictions in the Parry Sound and Sudbury districts have been expanded in the vicinity of the Parry Sound 33 fire. For details, visit Ontario.ca/forestfire.</p><p>Pursuant to the Emergency Area Order signed July 21, 2018, an Implementation Order has been issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry prohibiting access and travel in portions of Parry Sound District where there are public safety hazards as a result of increased fire activity from Parry Sound 33.</p><p>The order restricts travel, access and use in an identified area and may be modified regularly to reflect changing fire conditions. This measure has been put in place to ensure public safety while allowing fire personnel to safely and effectively suppress the fires in the identified area.</p><p>All travel and use on the French River waterway, Pickerel River (West of Hwy 69/400), Henvey Inlet, Key River basin, and all associated tributaries that access these river systems, including all access from Georgian Bay, and all islands on Georgian Bay within the French River Provincial Park boundaries, Dokis Island system, and Puddick island and all islands north of Henvey Inlet near shore is prohibited.</p><p>All access roads west of Hwy 69/400, from Henvey Inlet north to the French River area are closed.</p><p>If a member of the public believes that access within the restricted travel area is necessary for nonrecreational purposes, please call to 705-746-4201 to request a travel authorization permit. MNRF will review the request for access based on the rationale provided, local fire activity, and the potential fire risk.</p><p>SMOKE CONCERNS</p><p>Smoke from large fires across the region will be visible until fire activity is reduced and weather patterns change.</p><p>Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services is reminding the public that if they do see flames or smoke, please report it, and stay away from the area in the interest of public safety.</p><p>If you have questions or concerns about smoke and your health, please contact Tele Health Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.</p><p>For information about the fire situation: 705-564-6165</p><p>For inquiries about French River Provincial Park restrictions: 705-857-1630 ext 224</p><p>For inquiries about Grundy Lake Provincial Park closure: 705-383-2286 or 705-795-0803</p><p>For Parry Sound District information, including all calls related to the recommendation of these evacuations and alerts, call 705-773-4218.</p><p>For updates on highway conditions, including closures, please call 5-1-1.</p><p>See the map at Ontario.ca/forestfire</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018072447039866</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T02-BB01-JDH3-G4V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The likelihood is that homes will be affected by embers from a forest fire that could travel one or two kilometres and land on the property.\"</p><p>The focus of the session is to make the village safe from fires by encouraging residents to make their properties \"ember safe.\" She said if there is a wildfire in the area, properties and homes that don't have any flammable materials will less likely burn if an ember lands.</p><p>\"If you have a good roof, which means not a wood shingle roof, and you fire smart your property up to 10 metres, the statistics show that you have a 90 per cent chance of your home surviving a wildfire.\"</p><p>Some of the FireSmart methods involve changing the vegetation and plants around homes and removing fire hazards.</p><p>\"We talk about changing the conifer trees on their yard to deciduous trees or taking woodpiles or piles of brush or things that are flammable like furniture and things, take them in if there is a wildfire in your area. You know clear up your property so there is nothing flammable,\" she said.</p><p>READ MORE: UPDATE: Three new fires sparked in the South Okanagan- Similkameen</p><p>As part of the session, Maslowski said forest fire experts looked at the community to determine where the risks are. While they concluded that the village was good shape to ward off wildfires, certain areas along Sykes Crescent, Vanderlinde Drive and Tweddle Street showed some risks. For example, she said there is a dike with some trees along it on Sykes Crescent and Vanderlinde Drive has a high quantity of ceder and the type of plants that are flammable.</p><p>\"The main message we want to get out is why homes burn,\" she said. \"We want to break that barrier of forest becoming a fire in the home so it is really is as simple as if you don't have anything flammable on your home, your home won't burn down. If private residents do private work on their own properties, they can really make a difference.\"</p><p>Later in the summer, Maslowski said a large demonstration on wildfire prevention methods will take place around one of the government buildings to show how to make the building fire safe. While the exact date has not yet been determined, she said it will likely take place at the end of July or beginning of August.</p><p>The money for the sessions come from a $50,000 grant funded by the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, and administered by the Union of BC Municipalities.</p><p>For more information about wildfire prevention methods, see the website.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KEMREV-3831907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KEMREV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ0-V291-F103-31PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438251</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"512\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Keremeos Review (Okanagan Falls)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 3, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001627</classCode><className>STATISTICS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001504</classCode><className>ROOFING MATERIALS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(CP) - The forest fire that has caused several days of havoc for firefighters northeast of here was likely started by humans, officials say.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ministry of Natural Resources investigators have ruled out lightning as the cause of a fire burning over 250 square kilometres.</p><p>Dave Jackson, fire information officer for the ministry, said lightning detectors did not pick up any lightning strikes two days prior to April 30, when the fire was reported.</p><p>\"We are investigating into the cause, but it looks to be human caused,'' said Jackson.</p><p>He said Thursday was a good day for firefighters because the fire didn't expand and there was time to attack it in several ways.</p><p>Crews were busy laying hose line around the perimeter of the fire and establishing new bulldozer lines.</p><p>\"It's hoped that this fire line will create a fire break. What happens is the bulldozer removes vegetation (and top soil) and leaves a sandy area underneath. When the fire hits this sand area, it usually doesn't go any further,'' said Jackson.</p><p>Two water bombers also worked steadily bombing the hot spots.</p><p>But the news was not all good. No rain is expected for at least five days, and the predicted sunshine, warm temperatures, low humidity and breezy conditions are perfect breeding fields for forest fires.</p><p>\"This weather represents a challenge for us. A combination of these conditions dries the forest out. This will make the fire become more active,'' said Jackson.</p><p>Because of the weather forecast, the ministry has extended a restricted fire ban that was to end Thursday night.</p><p>With the opening of many provincial parks this weekend, the decision was a tough one, said Jackson.</p><p>\"But under these circumstances, I think it was the right one.''</p><p>The fire ban, which takes in the area between the Manitoba border and the west side of Lake Nipigon, could be extended to the east side of Nipigon if the dry weather conditions continue.</p><p>Across the region, Fort Frances, Kenora, Dryden and Thunder Bay are all listed as high fire hazards.</p><p>Meanwhile, firefighters are still putting out hotspots from a forest fire in Timmins. That city will have to pick up the tab for at least $22,000 to cover the cost of Natural Resources fire crews.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199805070222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4700-NWF0-01G6-83H6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"371\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>May 7, 1998 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N712190QM</classCode><className>STATE PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000D170</classCode><className>BOMBINGS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N712190QM</classCode><className>STATE PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS169</classCode><className>MANITOBA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS176</classCode><className>QUEBEC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(CP) _ Being surrounded by water was no protection from a raging forest fire as hundreds of residents from a First Nations community in northern Ontario were forced from their homes on Sunday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fire swept over 30,000 hectares of land and eventually came too close to Kasabonika, a small community on an island in Kasabonika Lake, about 600 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, Ont.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>CP</p></bodyText></section><p>By Sunday evening, the entire population _ over 700 residents _ had been evacuated by planes from the town, said Bob Pinder, spokesman for the emergency response team in charge of the evacuation. The residents are being housed in a community centre in the nearby city of Greenstone.</p><p>\"They were worried about their homes being burnt,'' said Pinder, who added that none of the homes or buildings had been damaged as of Sunday night.</p><p>\"It's a very remote, traditional community,'' said Pinder, who spoke to Kasabonika residents through an interpreter, because many of the community's elders speak only Ojibway.</p><p>Pinder said the community of Greenstone was well-equipped to handle the emergency _ bus loads of Kasabonika children were taken to a nearby lake to swim during Sunday's heat, and Kasabonika teens were hired as monitors to make sure everyone's needs were met.</p><p>Deb MacLean, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Natural Resources, said it could be as long as two weeks before Kasabonika residents could return home.</p><p>She said the main priority of the fire prevention team in Kasabonika was \"values protection''. The team had already installed sprinklers on buildings in the town should the fire engulf the area. \"It's going to be a long-term effort,'' MacLean said.</p><p>Lightning strikes ignited the fire on June 17, and MacLean said lack of precipitation during fall and winter months had made the forests in northwest Ontario very susceptible to fire.</p><p>\"We've really entered early summer with underlying prevailing dry conditions,'' MacLean said.</p><p>A smaller fire burning near Ignace, Ont., about 200 kilometres northwest of Thunder Bay, forced the evacuation of a tourist resort and some cottages.</p><p>On Saturday, that fire forced the closure of the Trans-Canada Highway, but one lane was open on Sunday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20030623CPCPG2683</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2003</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:48X3-JNH0-01G6-93RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"364\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2003 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>June 23, 2003 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ENVIRONMENT; FORESTRY;</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001196</classCode><className>NATIVE AMERICANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X7K</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N721110MM</classCode><className>RESORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Military planes flew many of the residents into Thunder Bay. Evacuation centres in places like Dryden and Sioux Lookout are filling up, prompting the need to look south.

normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com\">http://www.digitaljournal.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  Chilean authorities said Thursday that forest fires in the tourist port city of Valparaiso, which left dozens of families homeless at Christmas, were started deliberately.No one died in the blazes that broke out on Tuesday and burned 150 hectares (370 acres) of forest, leaving 12 volunteer firefighters injured and affecting around 700 people living in 245 homes.But the Public Ministry, which is investigating the cause of the fires that began on two hills, described them as \"highly intentional.\" </p><p>\"We have evidence from photos, videos and conversations with locals that those fires in Valparaiso were produced intentionally,\" said Agriculture Minister Antonio Walker.The Valparaiso area is hot and dry at this time of year, but the government believes several other fires that have broken out recently have been started deliberately.Chile's President Sebastian Pinera traveled to the area on Thursday to lead the investigation.The government has announced subsidies for those affected to build new houses.Due to its 44 hills, which are mostly difficult to access, and its dense vegetation, fires are quite common in Valparaiso, which lies 120 kilometers (75 miles) to the west of the capital Santiago.In 2014, 15 people died and more than 3,000 homes were destroyed in a huge forest fire.Walker said more than 15,000 hectares have been affected by forest fires since July 1, whereas only 4,500 hectares were destroyed last year.

I'm not ready, are you?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A lot of opinion attributes the increased frequency and severity of B.C.'s forest fires to \"climate &amp;#0010;change.\" Although climate change can be linked to these fires, it's more in a role as a catch-all explanation. However, global warming and drought are different. Drought is due to lack of water vapour in the atmosphere, whereas the cause of global warming is excess of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p><p>The B.C. government and its pet, the forest industry, have been doing everything possible to cause the present drought. More than 100 years of rapacious, clear cut logging is what's done the job. Each tree normally emits into the atmosphere many hundreds of litres of water vapour per day. When the trees are cut, this no longer happens and the atmospheric water deficit begins.</p><p>Each block that's clear cut now exposes its soil directly to sunlight. This soil warms up more than the surrounding forest and convection currents form in the lower atmosphere. Over the denuded landscape, the air rises and these currents now draw moist air from the surrounding forest, drying it out.</p><p>In the past, we may have retrieved some of this water vapour as rain, but today things are different. So much land has been logged and so much burned that the air aloft is dry. It's so dry that the water vapour brought upward by these convection currents doesn't come back as rain. So, the forest dries out, reducing the fitness of the remaining trees.</p><p>This is what's happening to the red cedar on the coast.</p><p>With each massive forest fire, new areas of bare soil are exposed. These will further dry out the environment with the convection currents that arise.</p><p>The situation is dreadful, but isn't hopeless. This drought hasn't been made in China, made in the US or anywhere else. It's been made in BC and with a huge effort, it can be corrected.</p><p>Clear cut logging needs to be stopped immediately. Then, armies of tree planters need to get to work replanting both the logged and burned areas. This could be a boost for forestry workers. For every job lost cutting trees, there should be 100 more jobs replanting them. For every trucking job lost, many more would be created growing and distributing seedlings.</p><p>The trees to be planted should follow nature's preference for succession; broadleaf aspens, alders and birch. These trees grow quickly, emit more water vapour than conifers and would shade the forest floor, keeping it cool and reducing harmful convection currents.</p><p>In B.C., drought shouldn't be explained solely by climate change. Drought is due to a lack of water vapour and our disappearing forests are the cause.</p><p>The Bank of Canada recently said that climate change, into which drought is now lumped, represents a severe financial risk. B.C.'s fire refugees know this too well. How long will it be before the politicians quit practising their silly walks and assume the action required?</p><p>Dave Simms,</p><p>Clearwater, B.C.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BARSTR-3818139</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BARSTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCR-F1S1-F103-31FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Barriere Star Journal (N.

About 75 homes near the fire were evacuated overnight.</p><p>In Oregon, a massive air attack held back a forest fire that threatened a rural subdivision as firefighters began to tighten the nooses around blazes that have destroyed seven homes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-9208070163</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC1992</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:46W8-MK20-01GV-M44X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"384\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Record (Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1992 Metroland Media Group Ltd</copyright><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"1992\"><dateText>August 7, 1992 Friday Final Edition</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000D170</classCode><className>BOMBINGS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Dozens more returned to their<br/>communities, but about 3,500 were told it's still too dangerous.<br/>For some evacuees it's a time of terrible heartbreak.  In the<br/>hardest-hit towns near Kamloops -- Barriere and Louis Creek --<br/>people not only lost their homes, many have little hope of<br/>rebuilding them.<br/></p><p>CTV's Sarah Galashan reports.</p><p>SARAH GALASHAN [Reporter]: Some 3,500 people went back to their<br/>homes today --</p><p>JILL HAYWARD [Louis Creek Evacuee]: I could be carried over the<br/>threshold.</p><p>GALASHAN: -- while others went shopping for one.</p><p>BILL HAYWARD [Louis Creek Evacuee]: We really, really like the<br/>features in this house.</p><p>GALASHAN: There is nothing left of Bob and Jill Hayward's Louis<br/>Creek cattle ranch.  But their insurance has them covered, and<br/>already they are rebuilding their lives.  Not every story here has<br/>such a happy ending.  The White family lost just as much, or more.</p><p>JENNIFER WHITE [Louis Creek Evacuee]: If we were insured it would<br/>be at least, for just us, a ballpark off the top of my head, with<br/>contents and to rebuild our homes that were there, and our shop, it<br/>would be a half a million dollars for just us.</p><p>GALASHAN: Thomas White was one of hundreds of employees who lost<br/>his job when the mill burned down.  And now the social assistance<br/>they're receiving might not get them through the weekend.  They<br/>have no insurance.<br/></p><p>They are not alone.  If estimated half the residents from the<br/>towns hardest-hit were not covered for loss or damage.  The people<br/>of Barriere and Louis Creek are by no means wealthy, and insurance<br/>rates in those rural areas can be upwards of 900 dollars a year.</p><p>BRENDA CASTLE [Barriere Evacuee]: Well, there is a lot of single<br/>parents out there, low-income people.  And, you know, they can't<br/>afford that.  You're just trying to keep groceries in the house.</p><p>FIONA CLARE [Barriere Evacuee]: And I understand people who have<br/>insurance, I mean they've been paying out all those years and, you<br/>know, they've got insurance.  So they're okay.  And it's tough.  It<br/>is tough.</p><p>GALASHAN: So far, no agency, government or otherwise, has<br/>committed a fixed amount to cover the more than eight million<br/>dollars it's believed fire refugees will need.  The Red Cross hopes<br/>to raise a million for those unable to start over on their own.</p><p>LESLIE BRYVRYENHOEK [Red Cross]: Certainly we would not cover<br/>insured losses.  So, you know, in that sense we do differentiate.<br/>If people have insurance then they have another resource from which<br/>to draw.</p><p>GALASHAN: As for the Haywards, they can't wait to move in --</p><p>JILL HAYWARD: I think to nitpick and say, well, you had insurance<br/>and you didn't, is just sad.</p><p>GALASHAN: -- and wish everyone could have a house to go home to.<br/></p><p>Sarah Galashan, CTV News, Kamloops.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2003</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4986-8430-00RJ-F4NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"486\"/><timeReceived>23:00:00 - 23:30:00 Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>CTV Television, Inc.</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2003 CTV Television, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate month=\"08\" day=\"08\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>August 8, 2003, Friday</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>RED CROSS\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>RED CROSS\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Insurance Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDM4MzQ2QUYzMTY0NDQzQTkxRDQwRUUzRUM5RDg0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURCMkIyODk4NDUwNDQ2NkE3RkQ0Qzg3RUVCOENGQUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTA3MzFBREE5RDkxNEIyNkExMzYyNTkwMEI4ODA2MTQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00096UX</classCode><className>POOR POPULATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000263</classCode><className>CATASTROPHIC LOSSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A4KY</classCode><className>LOW INCOME PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001461</classCode><className>REFUGEES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N524000CC</classCode><className>INSURANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001888</classCode><className>PROPERTY &amp; CASUALTY INSURANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A2VZ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000263</classCode><className>CATASTROPHIC LOSSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>N112100CC</classCode><className>CATTLE RANCHING &amp; FARMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Forest Professionals, which says it will take hundreds of millions of dollars along with political and community will to fix the problem.</p><p>The 2003 fire season blackened huge sections of the province, saw hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed and thousands of people evacuated in Kelowna, Louis Creek and Barriere.</p><p>Several factors will play into this year's fire season, said association president Paul Knowles.</p><p>''The increase in the number of dead and dying pine trees due to the mountain pine beetle epidemic. A forecast for higher-than-normal temperatures . . . and the long-term buildup of forest fuels.''</p><p>Fires clean up the slash that collects on the forest floors, but fire suppression has left about 80 years of fuel in the forest that can create high-intensity fires. They can destroy a whole forest and even change the chemistry of the soil.</p><p>Low-intensity fires are needed to clean up the forest, allow grass to grow back and open cones to release seeds.</p><p>Knowles said B.C. communities need to take action in the nearby forests. But very few have wildfire protection plans.</p><p>''To date we have 89 communities with these plans either in progress or completed, and we estimate the number of communities that need them is probably in the neighbourhood of 360.''</p><p>The plans are costly and so is the cleanup at an estimated $200 per hectare.</p><p>''The forest service has identified 1.7 million hectares of area around communities. . . that need fuel management.''</p><p>Last year just 7,000 hectares of so-called interface forest was cleaned.</p><p>''So that gives you just some idea of the magnitude of the problem we have in front of us,'' he said.</p><p>The other problem may be community complacency.</p><p>Ian Wilson, Kelowna's urban forest supervisor, said there seems to be growing resistance to tree removal.</p><p>After the forest fire raced through in 2003 destroying 239 homes, Wilson said many residents were advocating clearcuts of the nearby forests. But he said the pendulum is now swinging the other way.</p><p>''I think we've all kind of forgotten a little bit about the drama of 2003,'' he said.</p><p>''We don't want to scare people but we want to keep that interest going, in that this is a real issue.''</p><p>Forest Minister Rich Coleman disagrees with the association's findings, saying all the recommendations of the report done by former Manitoba premier Gary Filmon were implemented.</p><p>''We've spent $30 million in just the last couple years, particularly in the beetle kill area, where we've gone in and done work with the communities.''</p><p>He does agree that all that dead beetle-killed wood will make for a more active fire season, but said that many of those fires wouldn't be near populated areas.</p><p>''I think we've been very active on following through on everything that Filmon recommended and will continue to do so.''</p><p>New Democrat forestry critic Bob Simpson said he wasn't surprised by the association's dire assessment.</p><p>''Forest Minister Coleman has three fire reports that were previously given to him,'' he said.</p><p>''They have ignored all three reports to date.''</p><p>Simpson said the government has dumped the responsibility of cleaning up the forests on municipalities, without providing the financial resources or authority.</p><p>Knowles said it will take every level of government _ local, provincial and federal _ to clean up the problem.</p><p>The association recommends controlled burns, an ecosystem restoration program, better forest management and more logging to fix the problem.</p><p>''The public must accept that forest fires are naturally occurring and necessary for the health of some forests,'' Knowles said.</p><p>Even Vancouver's Stanley Park and other urban parks won't be immune after last year's wind storm knocked down thousands of trees.

According to Gravenhurst Fire Department, this is due to \"crossover conditions,\" where temperature has exceeded relative humidity levels.</p><p>CAUTION: #Muskoka has now reached crossover conditions (temperature has exceeded relative humidity levels).</p><p>The Forest Fire Danger Rating has just been elevated to \"HIGH\"... no daytime burning is permitted, and evening burning only under strict conditions (check local by-laws). pic.twitter.com/bYcjcC8PG5 - GravenhurstFIRE (@GravenhurstFIRE) June 11, 2018</p><p>This means no daytime burning is permitted and only absolutely necessary municipally permitted activities should be carried out. However, it is recommended that no burning should occur. Forest fuels are very dry and the fire risk is serious. New fires may start easily, burn vigorously, and challenge fire suppression efforts. Extreme caution must be used in any forest activities.</p><p>Gravenhurst Fire Department also reminds anyone in the Muskoka area that they will receive a bill if they are burning in contravention of bylaws and their fire gets out of control.</p><p>A couple of people were in 2day to complain about the bill they received from us. Both were burning in contravention of the by-law, both caused fires that got out of control... if you choose to ignore the law, and we have to respond to a fire you cause, you WILL be billed.

For more information, check the bylaws for your municipality: Bracebridge, Gravenhurst, Huntsville, Muskoka Lakes, Lake of Bays, Georgian Bay.</p><p>The Muskoka Fire Danger Rating is determined using the Fire Weather Index (FWI), an internationally used method for determining the risk of fires in open air. It uses factors such as the relative humidity, temperature, previous 24-hour rain amount, wind directions and wind speed in combination with the forest fuel type and loads to determine the risk of the forest to certain fire types. From this calculation the Forest Fire Danger Rating is made in consultation with the fire chiefs of the six area municipalities and the Ministry of Natural Resources.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018061946495599</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SM7-TX51-JDH3-G3BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

It's a collection of songs about burning things down and building them up again, according to her website, and Caspi will be celebrating the release of the album with local performances Mar. 24 and Mar. 25.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's a lot of darkness in the new album,\" Caspi says in an email interview.</p><p>\"Some of it came out of how I was feeling, some of it was watching people around me in tough places or a more global struggle going on around all of us. But I kept looking for the light, for something positive to hang on to. So there is a vein of hope that runs through the album. I called it Forest Fire because the title seemed to evoke that theme &amp;#8211; a big fiery disaster and where it fits in the grand cycle of things.\"</p><p>Caspi has been singing since she was a child, and her roots are classical. Caspi sang in children's choirs when she was young and studied classical voice in high school. She started playing classical guitar as a teenager, and says it wasn't long after she picked up a guitar that she started getting interested in the folk music scene in Ottawa, where she grew up.</p><p>\"I went to a lot of live shows,\" she says.</p><p>\"A lot of the artists I was drawn to were singer-songwriters &amp;#8211; people who wrote their own stuff and performed live, accompanying themselves with just one instrument. I was fascinated by the power and intimacy of that format, and it inspired me to start writing my own songs and play them live.\"</p><p>After studying classical voice at an arts high school in Ottawa, Caspi went on to study music at York University in Toronto.</p><p>\"When I started writing and playing my own music, it took me a long time to find my own natural 'folk' singing voice.</p><p>\"It's very different from my classical singing voice. There are definitely useful technical skills that come from classical singing, but ultimately, the sound and feel is very different. My voice has evolved a lot since I've been doing folk music, and I think it's a lot softer and more relaxed now. I feel like it's still a work in progress.\"</p><p>Caspi says her classical guitar training has been a big influence on the finger-picking guitar style she uses to accompany herself.</p><p>\"I try to make the guitar accompaniment as full as possible, incorporating melodic and rhythmic elements into my guitar playing,\" she says.</p><p>\"It's a gentle, lyrical finger-picking style that's inspired by classical guitar.\"</p><p>As a touring musician, Caspi has a chance to see a lot of different landscapes, and she has started painting them as a way to share what she sees. She sells her miniature paintings at her shows, and her paintings are featured on the front and back covers of Forest Fire, as well as throughout the album artwork.</p><p>Caspi remembers that she started painting after returning from her first tour in northern Ontario, which was more or less the start of her touring career.</p><p>\"I drove from Toronto to Thunder Bay and back, and I saw these stunning landscapes that I never knew were there,\" she says.</p><p>\"It was overwhelming. I took tons of photos, and when got home, I felt compelled to share what I'd seen. I wanted to do more than just post the photos, so on a whim, I decided to try painting some of the scenes in those photos &amp;#8211; just to see if I still knew how to do it, years after taking a painting class in university. To my great surprise, people really liked the paintings and wanted to buy them. So I kept traveling and I kept painting, and I've been selling the paintings with my merch at shows. I've made about 150 at this point.\"</p><p>Later this month, Caspi will be touring northern British Columbia for the first time as she celebrates the release of Forest Fire.</p><p>Caspi will perform an all-ages show Mar. 24 at Pen-Y-Bryn Farm at 2911 Kersley Dale Landing Road, just south of Quesnel, at 8 p.m. Doors open at 7:30 p.m, and advance tickets are available at Circle 'S' Western Wear, online at penybrynfarm.ca or by contacting Lindsay at 250 510 5508. Baked goods and non-alcoholic refreshments will be available by donation to the Wounded Warriors Battlefield Bike Ride 2018 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://woundedwarriors.ca/bbr18/\">https://woundedwarriors.ca/bbr18/</url>).</p><p>Caspi then travels to Wells, and she will perform Mar. 25 at the Sunset Theatre at 2357 Pooley Street at 7:30 p.m. Bob Campbell will be the opening act for this all-ages show.</p><p>To learn more about Caspi or these shows, visit shawnacaspi.com.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-3554651</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RY2-CYW1-JDH3-G54H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Williams Lake Tribune Advisor</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp;

It felt like a lot of the songs had the theme of coming out of the darkness and into the light, so there are some darker themes on the album, but there is also a little bit of hope and a little bit of light that runs through it,\" she explains. \"I thought a forest fire would be an appropriate metaphor.\"</p><p>The artwork and theme were influenced by Caspi's touring of British Columbia during the fire season. The artwork is actually painted by her.</p><p>\"I toured B.C. during the fire season and just those images of the smoke and the sky in forest fire season inspired me to paint the album cover but I just really like the idea of something catastrophic and huge happening and new growth coming out of that,\" she said.</p><p>Caspi is also a classical guitar trained-musician, learning it when she was a teenager before heading off to York University where she took lessons for a year with a flamenco guitar teacher.</p><p>\"It's a more complex kind of lyrical guitar accompaniment rather than the strumming you might expect from a folk singer,\" she said of her music. \"I use my fingernails to pick the strings of the guitar instead of a pick and hopefully make the sound more fuller, more rich and complex.\"</p><p>Caspi has been a musician for ten years but has only been doing it full time for the past five years and as an independent musician has to book and promote shows herself.</p><p>\"I really love being an entrepreneur and being my own boss when I'm on the road or just in general. As an independent musician, I think it's really exciting and cool to make those decisions,\" she said but those reasons are also the most challenging aspect of being a touring artist. \"The biggest challenge is trying to do everything myself. That's the other side of the coin of being an independent artist. I have to do all the booking and all the promotion and all the advancing of the shows and when I'm actually on the road; I have to do all the driving. It's a real challenge to do all of those tasks and stay on top of everything.\"</p><p>However, she said she loves the travelling, something she didn't get to do much of before she was a travelling musician and has now been across all of Canada and has started to tour the United States.</p><p>Caspi is also a painter, focusing on the many landscapes she has witnessed while touring, which often also inspire her songs.
