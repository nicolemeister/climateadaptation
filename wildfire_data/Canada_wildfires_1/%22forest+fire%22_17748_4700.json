The admission by Iran's Revolutionary Guard undermined the credibility of information provided by senior officials, who for three days had adamantly dismissed allegations of a missile strike as Western propaganda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It also raised a host of new questions, such as why Iran did not shut down its international airport or airspace on Wednesday when it was bracing for the U.S. to retaliate for a ballistic missile attack on two military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq. No one was hurt in that attack, carried out in retaliation for the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in an American airstrike in Baghdad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran's acknowledgment alters the narrative around its confrontation with the U.S. in a way that could anger the Iranian public. Iran had promised harsh revenge after Soleimani's death, but instead of killing American soldiers, its forces downed a civilian plane in which most passengers were Iranian.</p><p>On Saturday night, hundreds gathered at universities in Tehran to protest the government's late acknowledgement of the plane being shot down. They demanded officials involved in the missile attack be removed from their positions and tried. Police broke up the demonstrations.</p><p>President Donald Trump tweeted messages of support to Iranians who back protests of the government, saying he and his administration are behind them. In the tweets, Trump called on the Iranian government to allow human rights groups to monitor the protests and expressed support for the \"brave, long-suffering people\" of Iran.</p><p>___</p><p>On the brink: Swing county tense as Trump tangles with Iran</p><p>MONROE, Mich. (AP) - He flipped anxiously between news stations, bracing for an announcement of bombs falling and troops boarding planes destined for the Middle East. It was a nightmare he hoped he would never see again.</p><p>Michael Ingram's son, Michael Jr., died in Afghanistan in 2010 at age 23. Every day since, Ingram has prayed for American presidents to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and bring every last soldier home. Instead, it seemed to him this week that the United States was edging perilously close to another one.</p><p>The highest-stakes week of President Donald Trump's administration, when a standoff with Iran pushed the countries to the brink of war, was felt most viscerally by people like Ingram and in places such as Monroe. This blue-collar corner of southeast Michigan has buried young soldiers at a rate higher than in most other places of the country. Here, matters of war and peace are deeply personal.</p><p>They may also be politically important come November. Monroe is a swing county in a swing state, part of a cluster of Rust Belt communities along the border of Ohio and Michigan that voted for Democrat Barack Obama but then flipped to help put Trump in the White House in 2016. Its assessment of his performance as commander in chief could decide whether he stays there next year.</p><p>Conversations with people here, including many with veterans and military families, reveal how complex that assessment is. Trump's campaign promise to stop the \"endless wars\" resonated with many, but so did his pledge to answer aggression with relentless strength. Trump supporters in Monroe say they are not against military action. They just want to win and win quickly. They said they trust Trump will.</p><p>___</p><p>Iran standoff shines spotlight on new Trump security adviser</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) - In a defining week for President Donald Trump on the world stage, national security adviser Robert O'Brien was a constant presence at the president's side as the U.S. edged to the brink of war with Iran and back again.</p><p>The contrasts with O'Brien's predecessor along the way - in secret consultations at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, in the Oval Office and in basement deliberations in the White House Situation Room - could not have been more stark.</p><p>While former national security adviser John Bolton spent decades as a conservative iconoclast in the public arena, O'Brien is far from a household name. While Bolton had strong opinions he shared loudly in the Oval Office, O'Brien has worked to establish an amiable relationship with Trump. And while Bolton's trademark moustache was a target of Trump's mockery, the president is drawn to O'Brien's low-key California vibe and style.</p><p>\"Right out of central casting,\" Trump says of O'Brien.</p><p>For all the differences between the two men, though, O'Brien ended up signing off on the same course of action that Bolton had long endorsed: a strike to take out Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani. The decision drew retaliatory missile strikes from Tehran.</p><p>___</p><p>'Fail Not:' What to watch ahead of Trump's Senate trial</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) - Hear ye, hear ye: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hitting the send button on President Donald Trump's impeachment.</p><p>That's after she paused the whole constitutional matter, producing a three-week standoff with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and complicating the campaigning picture for the five Democratic senators in the White House race.</p><p>By Friday, three weeks before the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, what leverage Pelosi, D-Calif., had possessed was in question.</p><p>She wanted McConnell to allow witnesses and documents. He answered that those decisions would be made later - by the Republican-controlled Senate, not anyone in the Democratic-run House. With 51 votes for that plan, McConnell never budged. Yet it now appears at least a few Republicans are open to witness testimony once the trial begins.</p><p>Here's what to watch as the impeachment charges make their slow-motion journey to the Senate this week.</p><p>___</p><p>Firefighter dies as Australia works on long-term battle plan</p><p>BURRAGATE, Australia (AP) - A firefighter was killed by a falling tree while b attling the Australian wildfire crisis overnight and the prime minister on Sunday said his government was adapting and building resilience to the fire danger posed by climate change.</p><p>Bill Slade - one of the few professionals among mainly volunteer brigades battling blazes across southeast Australia - died on Saturday near Omeo in eastern Victoria state, Forest Fire Management Victoria Executive Director Chris Hardman said.</p><p>The 60-year-old married father of two was in November commended for 40 years service with the forestry agency.</p><p>\"Although we do have enormous experience in identifying hazardous trees, sometimes these tree failures can't be predicted,\" Hardman said. \"Working on the fire ground in a forest environment is a dynamic, high-risk environment and it carries with it significant risk.\"</p><p>The tragedy brings the death toll to at least 27 people in a crisis that has destroyed more than 2,000 homes and scorched an area larger than the U.S. state of Indiana since September. Four of the casualties were firefighters.</p><p>___</p><p>Magnitude 5.9 shock again rocks quake-stunned Puerto Rico</p><p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) - A magnitude 5.9 quake shook Puerto Rico on Saturday, causing millions of dollars of damage along the island's southern coast, where previous recent quakes have toppled homes and schools.</p><p>The U.S. Geological Survey said the 8:54 a.m. (1254 GMT) quake hit 8 miles (13 kilometres) southeast of Guanica at a shallow depth of 3 miles (5 kilometres). It was followed by several aftershocks, including a magnitude 5.2 temblor less than two minutes later.</p><p>No injuries or deaths were reported, officials said.</p><p>Saturday's quake occurred four days after a 6.4 magnitude quake in the same area and amid a spate of more than 1,200 mostly small quakes over the past 15 days, all at shallow depths.</p><p>Gov. Wanda Vazquez estimated damage from Tuesday's earthquake at $110 million, with a total of 559 structures affected. She said her administration was immediately releasing $2 million to six of the most affected municipalities.</p><p>___</p><p>Storms sweep southern US, Midwest as death toll rises to 11</p><p>HOUSTON (AP) - Severe storms sweeping across southern portions of the U.S. and up into the Midwest were blamed Saturday in the deaths of at least 11 people, including two first responders, as high winds, tornadoes and unrelenting rain battered large swaths of the country.</p><p>Storm-related fatalities were reported in Texas due to icy weather, in Alabama from a deadly tornado and in Louisiana, where winds were so strong that a trailer home was lifted off its foundation and carried several hundred feet. A man drowned in Oklahoma and the storms even touched the Midwest with at least one death on an icy highway in Iowa. Hundreds of thousands of people were left without power from Texas to Ohio, parts of highways were closed in Oklahoma and Arkansas due to flooding and hundreds of flights were cancelled at Chicago's international airports.</p><p>Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson declared a state of emergency to assist crews working to restore power around the state.</p><p>Two first responders were killed and another was critically injured in Lubbock, Texas, Saturday morning after they were hit by a vehicle while working the scene of a traffic accident in icy conditions, officials said.</p><p>Police Officer Nicholas Reyna, 27, who had been with the department for one year, died at the scene. Firefighter Lt. David Hill, 39, was taken to a local hospital where he later died. Firefighter Matthew Dawson, 30, was hospitalized in critical condition.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Analysis: New questions rise as Iran says it downed plane</p><p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Iran's acknowledgement that it shot down a Ukrainian airliner, killing 176 people, raises new challenges for the Islamic Republic both externally amid tensions with the U.S. and internally as it deals with growing discontent from its people.</p><p>The country did itself no favours by having its air-crash investigators, government officials and diplomats deny for days that a missile downed the flight, though a commander said Saturday that he had raised that possibility to his superiors as early as Wednesday, the day of the crash.</p><p>While its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard took responsibility, the same commander claimed it warned Tehran to close off its airspace amid fears of U.S. retaliation over Iran launching ballistic missiles at Iraqi bases housing U.S. forces. That retaliation never came, but the worries proved to be enough to allegedly scare a missile battery into opening fire on the Boeing 737 operated by Ukrainian International Airlines.</p><p>Wider tensions between Iran and the U.S., inflamed after Iran's top general was killed in Iraq by a U.S. drone strike Jan. 3, have for the moment calmed. However, President Donald Trump vowed to impose new sanctions on Tehran and on Friday, his administration targeted Iran's metals industry, a major employer. Meanwhile, thousands of additional U.S. forces remain in the Mideast atop of the network of American bases surrounding Iran, despite Tehran's demands the U.S. leave the region.</p><p>That sets the stage for Iran's further steps away from its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, an accord Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from in May 2018 over his concerns it didn't go far enough in restraining Tehran. Iran said after the targeted killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani that it would no longer abide by any of its limits, while saying United Nations inspectors could continue their work.</p><p>___</p><p>New year, new headache for queen with Harry and Meghan rift</p><p>LONDON (AP) - Queen Elizabeth II ended 2019 with a public plea for global harmony after a rocky year. She's starting 2020 trying to heal disharmony within her own family after Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, decided to \"step back\" as senior royals -- and announced the news without consulting the monarch.</p><p>As the British media went into meltdown, the royal matriarch moved quickly to take back control, summoning her son and heir Prince Charles and grandsons Prince William and Harry to a crisis meeting to sort things out. Elizabeth, who assumed the throne in 1952, has weathered family crises before, and is determined not to let her restless grandson and granddaughter-in-law weaken the House of Windsor or undermine the monarchy.</p><p>After initial talks between courtiers to the senior royals over the couple's unorthodox declaration of independence, Buckingham Palace said Saturday that the queen would meet Monday at her Sandringham estate in eastern England with Charles, William and Harry to agree on \"next steps.\"\"</p><p>The palace said \"a range of possibilities\" was on the table, but the queen was determined to resolve the situation within \"days not weeks.\"</p><p>Harry's next scheduled public appearance is a rugby event at Buckingham Palace on Thursday. Meghan, meanwhile, has flown to Canada, where the couple and their 8-month-old son, Archie, spent a six-week Christmas break. They announced this week they plan to \"balance\" their time between the U.K. and North America, with Canada their likely base. Meghan is American but lived in Toronto for several years while filming the TV show \"Suits.\"</p><p>___</p><p>49ers win 1st playoff game in 6 years, 27-10 over Vikings</p><p>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) - Richard Sherman anticipated the route for an interception and then watched the San Francisco 49ers run eight straight times for the touchdown that put them in control of their first playoff game in six years.</p><p>The dominant defence and powerful running game that carried the Niners to an 8-0 start this season delivered a 27-10 victory over the Minnesota Vikings in the divisional round Saturday.</p><p>\"People keep disrespecting us. At the end of the day, all you can do is go out and execute,\" Sherman said. \"It felt good. That's what we look like when we're totally healthy.\"</p><p>The return of injured defensive starters Dee Ford, Kwon Alexander and Jaquiski Tartt had the Niners (14-3) playing as they did in the first half of the season as they set a franchise playoff record by allowing only 147 yards.</p><p>Jimmy Garoppolo threw a TD pass on his opening drive as a playoff starter and then mostly watched his defence and running game take over from there. The top-seeded 49ers turned a pair of second-half turnovers by Minnesota (11-7) into 10 points.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-21329e1caa0ecb36a29de332a1ca05df</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYF-1841-JBVR-32FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2362\"/><timeReceived>11:04 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 11, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Q1 2020 Financial and Operational Highlights //st * Revenue of $109.7 million in Q1 2020, compared to $89.6 million of revenue in the 13-week period ended March 29, 2019 (\"Q1 2019\"); * Adjusted EBITDA totaled $4.0 million in Q1 2020, compared to $7.1 million in Q1 2019; and * Sold 510,000 metric tonnes (\"MT\") of industrial wood pellets in Q1 2020 compared to 402,000 MT sold in Q1 2019. * Entwistle production exceeded expectations in the first full quarter of facility operations since recommissioning the dryer system. The facility achieved positive EBITDA1 contribution in March 2020 and achieved increasing production levels during the quarter; * Broke ground at the new industrial wood pellet production facility in the U.S southeast (the \"Demopolis Facility\") in Q1 2020. Commissioning the Demopolis Facility with initial industrial wood pellet production is expected in the second quarter of 2021, and it is expected to produce 360,000 MTPA; * Resumed construction of the High Level Facility as planned in March 2020 with the arrival of warmer weather conditions. </p><p>The High Level Facility is expected to be completed as planned in Q4 2020, and to produce 200,000 MTPA; and * In January 2020, Pinnacle entered into a long-term lease with NYK Bulk &amp;Projects Carriers Ltd., to charter a vessel to be used to carry wood pellets from Canada to Japan. The vessel is scheduled to be available for use by Pinnacle commencing in Q1 2021, for a period of 15 years;</p><p>Q1 2020 Challenges //st * Sales in Q1 2020 included a significant volume of high cost finished pellet inventory from year end and third party purchased pellets with no margin which were used to fulfill customer obligations due to production shortfall as a result of the Entwistle incident; * Operational challenges arising from CN Rail disruptions: * A January 2020 derailment in B.C. damaged Pinnacle leased railcars and resulted in some lost pellets and ten straight days of cold weather in January caused CN rail disruptions resulting in some facility downtime; * In February, CN Rail lines and B.C. ports were disrupted by blockades resulting in downtime at the Company's northern facilities; * CN Rail disruptions resulted in approximately 20,000 MT of production lost, with a $2.1 million EBITDA impact; * With challenges resolved, operational progress was realized in March with solid production volumes and cost performance as the facilities were able to operate continuously; (li)The Aliceville facility was down for five days during a flooding at the facility dock. Adjusted Gross Margin1 was negatively impacted due to the prolonged pellet storage on barges during this high-water event. This matter has now been resolved; (/li)(li)With the emergence of COVID-19 in Q1 2020 and the resulting supply chain disruptions and international travel restrictions affecting the onsite presence of our external experts, smaller projects have been proactively delayed in order to preserve capital and enforce federal safety standards in light of the pandemic.(/li)(/ul) Dividend Policy and Liquidity In light of the uncertainty in the global economic climate, a review of the Company's dividend policy was conducted by the Board. The Board determined that in order to ensure the Company is well-positioned to withstand the ongoing economic impacts from the COVID-19 health threat, and preserve liquidity for growth capital, the dividend will be revised to an annual level of $0.15 per common share during this period of uncertainty related to COVID-19, beginning with the dividend payable for the first quarter of 2020. Pinnacle currently has sufficient liquidity and is within its financial covenants with its lending syndicate, and this revision will help to ensure the business is prepared in the event of an extended global economic crisis. This cautious approach and re-prioritization of capital will contribute to maintaining a healthy balance sheet and provide greater flexibility for the Company to continue to pursue its strategy. The Board of Directors today approved the payment of the Company's Q1 2020 dividend of $0.0375 per Common Share. Payment will be made on June 5, 2020 to shareholders of record as at May 22, 2020. \"With little foresight on how and when the COVID-19 pandemic will come to an end, Management and the Board made the difficult but prudent decision to reduce the dividend during this period.\" said Rob McCurdy, CEO of Pinnacle. \"We have not seen a change in demand for industrial wood pellets and have strength with our long-term take-or-pay contracts supporting the Company, however the lumber industry, particularly in B.C., is under pressure as the economy continues under stress, and this in turn will impact our fibre supply and increase our costs. Our team continues to work diligently under the safety standards guided by the health authorities and have increased inventories of harvest residuals in preparation.\" Q1 2020 Financial Results Revenue for Q1 2020 totaled $109.7 million, an increase of 22.4% compared to $89.6 million for Q1 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher sales volumes. Cost, insurance, and freight (\"CIF\") sales in Q1 2020 were 1.2% lower than Q1 2019 and accounted for 48% of total sales in Q1 2020 which also contributed to a shift of revenue in Q1 2020 compared to Q1 2019. The Company also experienced shipping delays due to the CN Rail strike in Q4 2019 that resulted in a shift of revenue into Q1 2020. Production costs were $86.1 million for Q1 2020, an increase of $19.0 million, or 28.3% compared to $67.1 million for Q1 2019. The increase in production costs can be attributed to an increase in sales volume, higher fibre costs and higher rail costs. Production costs were also affected by the high cost of Q4 2019 inventory sold in Q1 2020. This inventory included high fibre costs consumed in Q4 as well as the costs associated with the CN Rail disruptions in Q4 2019. The higher costs were partially offset by lower cash conversion costs. During Q1 2020, we sold third-party pellets for a net loss of $0.4 million. Additional production costs were also incurred to manage the impact of the disruption from the CN Rail blockades. Adjusted Gross Margin was $9.0 million, or 8.2% of revenue in Q1 2020, compared to $10.4 million, or 11.6% of revenue in Q1 2019. The decrease in Adjusted Gross Margin Percentage was primarily due to an increase in operating loss, partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses and amortization expenses in Q1 2020. Production costs in Q1 2020 include $0.03 million of costs associated with fixed overhead and incident response costs for the Entwistle Incident. These costs are offset by $1.0 million of business interruption insurance receivable recorded in Q1 2020. Excluding the impact of the Entwistle Incident, Q1 2020 Adjusted Gross Margin was $8.0 million, or 7.3% of revenue. The Company reported a net loss of $4.1 million in Q1 2020, compared to a net loss of $7.0 million in Q1 2019. The change in net loss reflects higher SG&amp;A expenses, production and distribution costs and amortization costs reflecting the Company's new production facilities, partially offset by reduced finance costs. Excluding the impact of the Entwistle Incident, net loss in Q1 2020 was $5.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $4.0 million in Q1 2020, compared to $7.1 million in Q1 2019. The decrease is attributable to higher production costs due to increased sales volume, the sale of external finished pellet inventory and costs incurred to manage the impact of the CN Rail disruptions and higher port charges due to blockades. This was partially offset by the impact of business interruption amounts recoverable. Production Facility Construction and Upgrades In Q4 2019, Pinnacle announced a plan to begin construction of a new industrial wood pellet production facility in the U.S southeast near the Aliceville Facility. The new facility (the \"Demopolis Facility\") will be located adjacent to an existing large sawmill in Demopolis, Alabama. The Demopolis Facility is expected to have annual production volume of 360,000 MTPA that will be sold through Pinnacle's contracted backlog of long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts. As mentioned above, with added health and safety precautions in place, construction teams broke ground at this facility in Q1 2020 and construction has progressed as planned and within budget during the quarter. With the addition of the Demopolis facility, Pinnacle will have over 44% of its run-rate production capacity outside of the B.C. fibre basket. Commissioning the Demopolis Facility with initial industrial wood pellet production is expected in the second quarter of 2021. Construction at the High Level Facility resumed with added health and safety precautions, as planned, in March 2020 along with the arrival of warmer weather conditions. The High Level Facility is expected to be completed as planned in Q4 2020. Review of budget and schedule and advancement of scope for the CN rail infrastructure has resulted in additional capital required of $2.0 million, bringing the total to $60.5 million before the project's share of capital required for rail infrastructure, with Pinnacle's 50% share being $30.25 million plus 50% of the project's share of capital for rail infrastructure. The budget overruns are the result of concerns with the design and fabrication of structural elements of the facility. Tolko has indicated that additional fibre will be available for upcoming years due to forest fire log processing, providing a strong supply of fibre. We are confident that this will enable the High Level Facility to produce 200,000 MTPA. The installation of a chipper and additional pelleter at the Smithers facility for a total capital cost of approximately $6.0 million (Pinnacle's portion: $4.2 million funded from existing credit facilities) is expected to decrease costs and increase production run-rate output by approximately 15,000 MTPA. A substantial portion of this project was expected to begin in Q1 2020, but for the reasons stated above relating to COVID-19, Management has decided to extend the project schedule by approximately six months. Operations at the Williams Lake facility continue with the current dryer in place and the dryer upgrade project has been temporarily suspended as equipment vendors were not able to travel onsite for commissioning purposes due to travel restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As this project is near completion, Management is investigating various options to engage remote support in order to safely commission the remainder of the project in Q2 2020. Upgrades at the Meadowbank Facility have been put on an extended schedule in order to preserve capital due to COVID-19 as previously stated. The expansion of the Meadowbank Facility is expected to be completed in 2021. Outlook We expect growth in revenue and profitability over the next several years as a result of contracted price increases in most of our off-take agreements. In addition, as the potential demand for industrial wood pellets continues to grow globally, we are well positioned to meet this demand growth through a combination of expansion projects at existing production facilities and new greenfield and brownfield growth projects. Moreover, we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and joint ventures to grow our production platform and continue to capture opportunities in the growing Asian marketplace as a result of our longstanding relationships with customers in the region. The Entwistle Facility achieved increasing production levels during Q1 2020, exceeding the commissioning curve for the facility. The facility is expected to continue to improve and add production volume throughout the year making a positive contribution to Adjusted EBITDA1 in Fiscal 2020. As the Company's insurer monitors production ramp post restart, further business interruption insurance in Fiscal 2020 will be sought. Final insurance recoveries of capital costs incurred for the rebuild are expected in Fiscal 2020 as well. Production at the Aliceville facility has returned as water levels have receded and silo storage is back to normal as regular barge transportation has resumed. As both the Aliceville and Smithers facilities are both operating at full production run-rate, incremental production volume and Adjusted EBITDA1 contribution is expected for 2020. CN Rail blockades and port delays experienced in February have not impacted service since that time. Progress was realized in March with solid production volume and cost performance as the facilities were able to operate continuously without the earlier impacts of operational disruptions. Sawmills and key fibre suppliers have started to curtail output as a result of the impacts from COVID-19 on their businesses. As a result, the Company will be dependent on harvest residuals in 2020 more than in the last quarter. Fibre breakdown capital and operating requirements to meet production needs will continue to be addressed. As the proportion of wet, coarse fibre to dry fibre increases, drying capacity constraints at some mills are expected, resulting in production volume reductions in some of our B.C. mills impacting Adjusted Gross Margin1. In response to the announced and anticipated sawmill curtailments, inventory of fibre at B.C. mills has increased by 103% compared to the end of Q1 2019. As Q2 2020 continues we see B.C. sawmill residual supplies stabilizing as lumber demand is relatively constant, government incentives are enacted, and the industry looks toward reduction in stumpage rates in Q3 2020. Although there are some sawmill curtailments in Alabama, Pinnacle does not expect production volume or costs to be significantly impacted. The Company continues to have strong availability of wood fibre in Alberta. Over the last two quarters the incremental procurement cost of harvest residuals has been reduced. When the large curtailments were announced in Q3 2019, fibre was purchased at a higher cost to ensure consistency of supply and build inventories. In Q4 2019, and even more so in Q1 2020, a more selective approach to fibre quality and cost was utilized given the current strong inventory levels. The benefit of the cost reduction activities is not yet reflected in Q1 2020 results as older, higher cost fibre and shipping pellets made in prior months are being consumed.

(1) Non-IFRS Financial Measures This news release makes reference to certain non-IFRS measures. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. We use non-IFRS measures including \"EBITDA\", \"Adjusted EBITDA\", \"Adjusted EBITDA per Metric Ton\", \"Adjusted Gross Margin\", \"Adjusted Gross Margin per Metric Ton\", \"Adjusted Gross Margin Percentage\" and \"Free Cash Flow\". These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. As required by Canadian securities laws, we reconcile these non-IFRS measures to the most comparable IFRS measures in our Management Discussion &amp;Analysis for Q1 2020.

Adjusted Gross Margin1 was negatively impacted due to the prolonged pellet storage on barges during this high-water event. This matter has now been resolved; With the emergence of COVID-19 in Q1 2020 and the resulting supply chain disruptions and international travel restrictions affecting the onsite presence of our external experts, smaller projects have been proactively delayed in order to preserve capital and enforce federal safety standards in light of the pandemic.</p><p>Dividend Policy and Liquidity</p><p>In light of the uncertainty in the global economic climate, a review of the Company's dividend policy was conducted by the Board. The Board determined that in order to ensure the Company is well-positioned to withstand the ongoing economic impacts from the COVID-19 health threat, and preserve liquidity for growth capital, the dividend will be revised to an annual level of $0.15 per common share during this period of uncertainty related to COVID-19, beginning with the dividend payable for the first quarter of 2020.</p><p>Pinnacle currently has sufficient liquidity and is within its financial covenants with its lending syndicate, and this revision will help to ensure the business is prepared in the event of an extended global economic crisis. This cautious approach and re-prioritization of capital will contribute to maintaining a healthy balance sheet and provide greater flexibility for the Company to continue to pursue its strategy. </p><p>The Board of Directors today approved the payment of the Company's Q1 2020 dividend of $0.0375 per Common Share. Payment will be made on June 5, 2020 to shareholders of record as at May 22, 2020. </p><p>\"With little foresight on how and when the COVID-19 pandemic will come to an end, Management and the Board made the difficult but prudent decision to reduce the dividend during this period.\" said Rob McCurdy, CEO of Pinnacle. \"We have not seen a change in demand for industrial wood pellets and have strength with our long-term take-or-pay contracts supporting the Company, however the lumber industry, particularly in B.C., is under pressure as the economy continues under stress, and this in turn will impact our fibre supply and increase our costs. Our team continues to work diligently under the safety standards guided by the health authorities and have increased inventories of harvest residuals in preparation.\" </p><p>Q1 2020 Financial Results</p><p>Revenue for Q1 2020 totaled $109.7 million, an increase of 22.4% compared to $89.6 million for Q1 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher sales volumes. Cost, insurance, and freight (\"CIF\") sales in Q1 2020 were 1.2% lower than Q1 2019 and accounted for 48% of total sales in Q1 2020 which also contributed to a shift of revenue in Q1 2020 compared to Q1 2019. The Company also experienced shipping delays due to the CN Rail strike in Q4 2019 that resulted in a shift of revenue into Q1 2020.</p><p>Production costs were $86.1 million for Q1 2020, an increase of $19.0 million, or 28.3% compared to $67.1 million for Q1 2019. The increase in production costs can be attributed to an increase in sales volume, higher fibre costs and higher rail costs. Production costs were also affected by the high cost of Q4 2019 inventory sold in Q1 2020. This inventory included high fibre costs consumed in Q4 as well as the costs associated with the CN Rail disruptions in Q4 2019. The higher costs were partially offset by lower cash conversion costs. During Q1 2020, we sold third-party pellets for a net loss of $0.4 million. Additional production costs were also incurred to manage the impact of the disruption from the CN Rail blockades.</p><p>Adjusted Gross Margin\u00b9 was $9.0 million, or 8.2% of revenue in Q1 2020, compared to $10.4 million, or 11.6% of revenue in Q1 2019. The decrease in Adjusted Gross Margin\u00b9 Percentage was primarily due to an increase in operating loss, partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses and amortization expenses in Q1 2020. Production costs in Q1 2020 include $0.03 million of costs associated with fixed overhead and incident response costs for the Entwistle Incident. These costs are offset by $1.0 million of business interruption insurance receivable recorded in Q1 2020. Excluding the impact of the Entwistle Incident, Q1 2020 Adjusted Gross Margin\u00b9 was $8.0 million, or 7.3% of revenue. </p><p>The Company reported a net loss of $4.1 million in Q1 2020, compared to a net loss of $7.0 million in Q1 2019. The change in net loss reflects higher SG&amp;A expenses, production and distribution costs and amortization costs reflecting the Company's new production facilities, partially offset by reduced finance costs. Excluding the impact of the Entwistle Incident, net loss in Q1 2020 was $5.9 million. </p><p>Adjusted EBITDA\u00b9 totaled $4.0 million in Q1 2020, compared to $7.1 million in Q1 2019. The decrease is attributable to higher production costs due to increased sales volume, the sale of external finished pellet inventory and costs incurred to manage the impact of the CN Rail disruptions and higher port charges due to blockades. This was partially offset by the impact of business interruption amounts recoverable. </p><p>Production Facility Construction and Upgrades</p><p>In Q4 2019, Pinnacle announced a plan to begin construction of a new industrial wood pellet production facility in the U.S southeast near the Aliceville Facility. The new facility (the \"Demopolis Facility\") will be located adjacent to an existing large sawmill in Demopolis, Alabama. The Demopolis Facility is expected to have annual production volume of 360,000 MTPA that will be sold through Pinnacle's contracted backlog of long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts. As mentioned above, with added health and safety precautions in place, construction teams broke ground at this facility in Q1 2020 and construction has progressed as planned and within budget during the quarter. With the addition of the Demopolis facility, Pinnacle will have over 44% of its run-rate production capacity outside of the B.C. fibre basket. Commissioning the Demopolis Facility with initial industrial wood pellet production is expected in the second quarter of 2021.</p><p>Construction at the High Level Facility resumed with added health and safety precautions, as planned, in March 2020 along with the arrival of warmer weather conditions. The High Level Facility is expected to be completed as planned in Q4 2020. Review of budget and schedule and advancement of scope for the CN rail infrastructure has resulted in additional capital required of $2.0 million, bringing the total to $60.5 million before the project's share of capital required for rail infrastructure, with Pinnacle's 50% share being $30.25 million plus 50% of the project's share of capital for rail infrastructure. The budget overruns are the result of concerns with the design and fabrication of structural elements of the facility. Tolko has indicated that additional fibre will be available for upcoming years due to forest fire log processing, providing a strong supply of fibre. \u00a0We are confident that this will enable the High Level Facility to produce 200,000 MTPA. </p><p>The installation of a chipper and additional pelleter at the Smithers facility for a total capital cost of approximately $6.0 million (Pinnacle's portion: $4.2 million funded from existing credit facilities) is expected to decrease costs and increase production run-rate output by approximately 15,000 MTPA. A substantial portion of this project was expected to begin in Q1 2020, but for the reasons stated above relating to COVID-19, Management has decided to extend the project schedule by approximately six months.</p><p>Operations at the Williams Lake facility continue with the current dryer in place and the dryer upgrade project has been temporarily suspended as equipment vendors were not able to travel onsite for commissioning purposes due to travel restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As this project is near completion, Management is investigating various options to engage remote support in order to safely commission the remainder of the project in Q2 2020. </p><p>Upgrades at the Meadowbank Facility have been put on an extended schedule in order to preserve capital due to COVID-19 as previously stated. The expansion of the Meadowbank Facility is expected to be completed in 2021.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>We expect growth in revenue and profitability over the next several years as a result of contracted price increases in most of our off-take agreements. In addition, as the potential demand for industrial wood pellets continues to grow globally, we are well positioned to meet this demand growth through a combination of expansion projects at existing production facilities and new greenfield and brownfield growth projects. Moreover, we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and joint ventures to grow our production platform and continue to capture opportunities in the growing Asian marketplace as a result of our longstanding relationships with customers in the region. </p><p>The Entwistle Facility achieved increasing production levels during Q1 2020, exceeding the commissioning curve for the facility. The facility is expected to continue to improve and add production volume throughout the year making a positive contribution to Adjusted EBITDA1 in Fiscal 2020. As the Company's insurer monitors production ramp post restart, further business interruption insurance in Fiscal 2020 will be sought. Final insurance recoveries of capital costs incurred for the rebuild are expected in Fiscal 2020 as well.</p><p>Production at the Aliceville facility has returned as water levels have receded and silo storage is back to normal as regular barge transportation has resumed. As both the Aliceville and Smithers facilities are both operating at full production run-rate, incremental production volume and Adjusted EBITDA1 contribution is\u00a0expected for 2020. </p><p>CN Rail blockades and port delays experienced in February have not impacted service since that time. Progress was realized in March with solid production volume and cost performance as the facilities were able to operate continuously without the earlier impacts of operational disruptions.</p><p>Sawmills and key fibre suppliers have started to curtail output as a result of the impacts from COVID-19 on their businesses.\u00a0 As a result, the Company will be dependent on harvest residuals in 2020 more than in the last quarter. Fibre breakdown capital and operating requirements to meet production needs will continue to be addressed. As the proportion of wet, coarse fibre to dry fibre increases, drying capacity constraints at some mills are expected, resulting in production volume reductions in some of our B.C. mills impacting Adjusted Gross Margin1. In response to the announced and anticipated sawmill curtailments, inventory of fibre at B.C. mills has increased by 103% compared to the end of Q1 2019. As Q2 2020 continues we see B.C. sawmill residual supplies stabilizing as lumber demand is relatively constant, government incentives are enacted, and the industry looks toward reduction in stumpage rates in Q3 2020.\u00a0 \u00a0Although there are some sawmill curtailments in Alabama, Pinnacle does not expect production volume or costs to be significantly impacted. The Company continues to have strong availability of wood fibre in Alberta.</p><p>Over the last two quarters the incremental procurement cost of harvest residuals has been reduced.\u00a0 When the large curtailments were announced in Q3 2019, fibre was purchased at a higher cost to ensure consistency of supply and build inventories. In Q4 2019, and even more so in Q1 2020, a more selective approach to fibre quality and cost was utilized given the current strong inventory levels.\u00a0 The benefit of the cost reduction activities is not yet reflected in Q1 2020 results as older, higher cost fibre and shipping pellets made in prior months are being consumed.\u00a0 </p><p>Selected Consolidated Financial Information</p><p>The following\u00a0tables set forth selected financial information for Q1 2020 compared to the prior year period. Such information has been derived from Pinnacle's unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\"

These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. We use non-IFRS measures including \"EBITDA\", \"Adjusted EBITDA\", \"Adjusted EBITDA per Metric Ton\", \"Adjusted Gross Margin\", \"Adjusted Gross Margin per Metric Ton\", \"Adjusted Gross Margin Percentage\" and \"Free Cash Flow\". These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. As required by Canadian securities laws, we reconcile these non-IFRS measures to the most comparable IFRS measures in our Management Discussion &amp; Analysis for Q1 2020. </p><p>Forward-Looking Information</p><p>This news release may contain \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws in Canada.

Authorities have mobilized extensive aerial and ground resources to combat the rapidly spreading blaze. Strong winds reaching 50 km per hour are intensifying the fire's movement and complexity. The incident highlights the ongoing environmental challenges faced by northwestern Turkish provinces during extreme summer conditions.  Istanbul, Aug 17: A forest fire that erupted in Turkey's northwestern province of Canakkale has forced the evacuation of five villages, authorities said.  Key Points  Canakkale province faces rapid forest fire spreading due to strong winds  11 planes and 10 helicopters deployed for firefighting operations  Five villages evacuated as precautionary measure  Extreme heat and low humidity contribute to fire risk  Canakkale Governor Omer Toraman said on social media platform X that 11 planes and 10 helicopters, along with ground crews, have been deployed to battle the blaze.  The villages were evacuated as a precaution, as the fire spread rapidly due to strong winds, Toraman said.  According to weather reports, winds in the region are blowing at around 50 km per hour.  Meanwhile, Turkish Agriculture and Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli said on X that efforts are continuing \"with full force and without interruption\" to bring the blaze under control as soon as possible.  Canakkale, along with the northwestern provinces of Kocaeli and Bursa, has battled forest fires in the past month, driven by extreme heat, low humidity, and strong winds.  Yumakli said a wildfire that erupted on Friday in Kocaeli was brought under control as of Saturday, reports Xinhua news agency.  Additionally, a forest fire erupted on Friday in Turkey's northwestern province of Kocaeli, forcing the evacuation of a village as flames neared homes.  The blaze broke out around noon in the Karamursel district and spread rapidly due to strong winds, the Kocaeli Governor's Office said on social media. Residents of Akcat village were being evacuated.  Many homes were destroyed and rendered uninhabitable, the Demiroren News Agency reported, sharing images of charred buildings.  Firefighting efforts were underway from the air and on the ground, involving six planes, 10 helicopters, 75 vehicles, and 200 personnel, the governor's office said.  Winds in the area were forecast to reach 60 to 80 kilometres per hour until Saturday evening, the statement added, warning residents to take extra precautions.  Kocaeli, along with the northwestern provinces of Canakkale and Bursa, has battled forest fires in the past month, driven by extreme heat, low humidity, and strong winds.   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57475940769</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHJ-8P43-RSY4-C4SH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"493\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NewKerala.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 17, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CA</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9M</classCode><className>SEVERE SUMMER WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;

The decrease was primarily attributable to disruption to reduced production in the B.C. facilities with a greater concentration of harvest residuals and the Burns Lake maintenance capital shut as well as shipping delays due to the CN rail strike in Q4 2019. </p><p>Adjusted Gross Margin1 was $16.4 million, or 17.9% of revenue in Q4 2019, compared to $16.7 million, or 16.1% of revenue in Q4 2018. The increase in Adjusted Gross Margin1 Percentage was primarily attributable to $4.5 million of business interruption insurance receivable net of $1.1 million of costs associated with fixed overhead and incident response costs for the Entwistle Incident booked as a reduction of production costs and high start up costs incurred at Aliceville and repair and maintenance costs incurred at our Entwistle Facility in Q4 2018. B.C. same facility production levels in Q4 2019 were, however, lower compared to the prior year, mainly due to the CN rail strike, scheduled capital shut down at our Burns Lake Facility, as well a greater concentration of harvest residuals used in production in order to replace reduced sawmill residuals output.\u00a0Adjusted Gross Margin1 for Q4 2019 also reflects the Company's adoption of IFRS 162. Excluding the impact of the implementation of IFRS 162 and the Entwistle Incident, Q4 2019 Adjusted Gross Margin1 was $11.0 million, or 12.1% of revenue. The Company reported a net loss of $3.2 million in Q4 2019, compared to a net profit $7.4 million in Q4 2018. The change in net profit reflects higher selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses and amortization costs reflecting the Company's new production facilities, as well as increased finance costs, partially offset by reduced production costs. Excluding the impact of the Entwistle Incident, net loss in Q4 2019 was $5.5 million. </p><p>Adjusted EBITDA1 totaled $11.3 million in Q4 2019, compared to $13.8 million in Q4 2018. The decrease is attributable to lower revenues in Q4 2019 compared to Q4 2018, increased distribution and sales, general, and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") costs and an increase in other expenses. Excluding the impact of $3.2 million associated with the Entwistle Incident, as well as $2.0 million related to the adoption of IFRS 162, Q4 2019 Adjusted EBITDA1 was $6.1 million.</p><p>Fiscal 2019 Financial ResultsRevenue for Fiscal 2019 totaled $377.8 million, an increase of 8.7% compared to $347.4 million for Fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes mostly due to a full year of revenue contribution from the production and sale of pellets from the Smithers and Aliceville facilities, each of which contributed no production volume in Q1   Q3 2018, offset by lower production volumes at our B.C. facilities due to sawmill curtailments and reductions in sawmill residual deliveries.\u00a0</p><p>Adjusted Gross Margin1 was $65.0 million, or 17.2% of revenue in Fiscal 2019, compared to $67.6 million, or 19.5% of revenue in Fiscal 2018. The decrease in Adjusted Gross Margin1 Percentage was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues offset by an increase in production and distribution costs. Production costs include $7.3 million of costs associated with fixed overhead and incident response costs for the Entwistle Incident, offset by an amount of $13.0 million for business interruption insurance proceeds. Adjusted Gross Margin1 for Fiscal 2019 also reflects the Company's adoption of IFRS 162. Excluding the impact of the implementation of IFRS 162 and the Entwistle Incident, Fiscal 2019 Adjusted Gross Margin1 was $51.5 million, or 13.6% of revenue. </p><p>The Company reported a net loss of $9.9 million in Fiscal 2019, compared to a net profit of $2.7 million in Fiscal 2018. The change in net profit reflects higher distribution costs, higher amortization costs reflecting the Company's new production facilities, and higher production costs due to higher fibre costs, cash conversion costs and costs incurred for third party wood pellet purchases,\u00a0 partially offset by reduced selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses. Excluding the impact of the Entwistle Incident, net loss in Fiscal 2019 was $12.8 million. </p><p>Adjusted EBITDA1 totaled $47.2 million in Fiscal 2019, compared to $55.1 million in Fiscal 2018. Increased revenue was offset by higher distribution costs, higher production costs, including higher cash conversion costs (due primarily to fibre mix constraints which increased repair and maintenance costs), higher fibre costs due to extended sawmill curtailments in the B.C. region, and costs associated with the Entwistle Incident, partially offset by the impact of IFRS 162 and business interruption amounts recoverable. Excluding the impact of $3.9 million associated with the Entwistle Incident, as well as $7.8 million related to the adoption of IFRS 162, Fiscal 2019 Adjusted EBITDA1 was $35.5 million.</p><p>As at the end of Fiscal 2019, the Company had available liquidity of $57.1 million from cash balances and debt facilities (excluding the delayed draw facility), compared to $49.1 million at the end of 2018, which Pinnacle expects to be sufficient throughout Fiscal 2020. At the end of Fiscal 2019 the ratio of net debt to last twelve month Adjusted EBITDA1 was 6.3 times. This ratio was elevated due to the investment in the Aliceville Facility in Q4 2018, significant new capacity at the Entwistle and Smithers Facilities, expansion projects at Williams Lake and Meadowbank, and initial construction costs of the High Level Facility that have not yet generated their run-rate Adjusted EBITDA1. As these facilities reach their run-rate capacity, this ratio is expected to decline.</p><p>Q1 2020 CN Rail Disruptions</p><p> Revenue of $377.8 million in Fiscal 2019, compared to $347.4 million of revenue for the 52-week period ended December 28, 2108 (\"Fiscal 2018\"); Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\")1 for Fiscal 2019 totaled $47.2 million, compared to $55.1 million in Fiscal 2018; Excluding the impact of the implementation of IFRS 162 and the incident at the Company's Entwistle facility, Fiscal 2019 Adjusted EBITDA1 was $35.5 million; and Sold 1.72 metric tonnes (\"MT\") of industrial wood pellets in 2019 compared to 1.61 MT sold in 2018.</p><p>New Off-take AgreementsDuring the quarter, Pinnacle entered into a long-term, take-or-pay contract with Mitsui for 100,000 MTPA commencing in 2023. </p><p>This is the ninth contract signed with customers in Japan since the beginning of Fiscal 2018 demonstrating the Company's successful advancement of the strategy for sales growth into Japan. New contracts improve The Company's customer diversification across Japan, the U.K., South Korea, and Europe. </p><p>New Facility in Demopolis, AlabamaIn Q4 2019, Pinnacle announced the construction of a new industrial wood pellet production facility in the southeast United States, in close proximity to Pinnacle's Aliceville facility. The new facility (the \"Demopolis Facility\") will be located adjacent to an existing large sawmill in Demopolis, Alabama. The Demopolis Facility and Aliceville Facility will operate under a single partnership with Pinnacle, The Westervelt Company (\"TWC\") and Two Rivers Lumber Company, LLC (\"TRL\"), each holding a 70%, 20% and 10% interest, respectively, and is expected to have annual production volume of 360,000 metric tonnes per annum (\"MTPA\"). Anticipated capital costs to construct the Demopolis Facility are expected to be approximately US$99 million, and Pinnacle will fund its portion of the capital costs from draws on its existing credit facilities. Commissioning the Demopolis Facility with initial industrial wood pellet production is expected in the second quarter of 2021. </p><p>With the addition of the Demopolis facility Pinnacle will have over 44% of its run-rate production capacity outside of the B.C. fibre basket.</p><p>Production Facility Construction and UpgradesPlans to install a chipper and additional pelleter at the Smithers facility have been finalized for a total capital cost of approximately $6.0 million (Pinnacle's portion: $4.2 million funded from existing credit facilities). The upgrade will decrease costs and increase production run-rate output by approximately 15,000 MTPA. The project is expected to begin in Q1 2020, with completion expected in Q3 2020.</p><p>Construction at the High Level facility progressed in Q4 2019 and is now in a planned suspension due to winter weather conditions until spring 2020 when warmer temperatures will allow for efficient construction to continue. An additional capital requirement of $6.0 million is expected, bringing the total capital cost to $60.0 million, with Pinnacle's 50% share being $30.0 million. Tolko has indicated that additional fibre will be available due to forest fire log processing, providing a strong supply of fibre for commissioning. As a result, Management is confident that this will enable the facility to produce at the upper end of the 170,000 MTPA to 200,000 MTPA range. The Facility is expected to be completed as planned in the fourth quarter of 2020.</p><p>The upgrades at our Williams Lake and Meadowbank facilities are progressing on schedule\u00a0and are expected to be completed and begin commissioning in Q1 2020 and Q3 2020 respectively. The upgrades will allow the two facilities, to process a broader array of available fibre sources and achieve a series of safety and environmental advancements. This strategic investment will enhance the operating flexibility of the facilities and position Pinnacle to adapt to cyclical changes in wood fibre supply within the B.C. interior. Further, the equipment, technology and infrastructure improvements will result in an increase of 80,000 MTPA in combined overall production capacity. </p><p>At the Aliceville facility, the second phase of the planned capital improvement plan is expected to commence in Q2 2020 and will focus on further improvements to fibre flow and processing in order to drive cost effective increases in production capacity. Ongoing work with fibre suppliers to optimize fibre mix and production levels have steadily increased through 2019. </p><p>Entwistle RestartThe Entwistle rebuild has been completed, the furnace and dryer have been restarted, and commissioning of the new equipment is in process. </p><p>Restoration of the facility is expected at a total estimated capital cost of approximately $14.0 million. Other costs are estimated to be approximately $9.5 million, of which $9.1 million has been incurred year-to-date. Pinnacle is actively working with customers and partners to mitigate the impacts of the 2019 production shortfall and continues to work with the Company's insurance providers to determine the insurance recoveries available for the Entwistle Incident. Pinnacle expects substantially all costs incurred to be recoverable through insurance, subject to deductibles.</p><p>In Q4 2019 there were no additional asset impairment charges recorded, $9.4 million was recognized in Q1 2019 for assets impaired in the incident which has reduced property, plant and equipment and lowered net income for the period. The net income impact has been partially offset by property insurance proceeds recorded in net income on the income statement of $9.0 million as at the end of Fiscal 2019 (net of deductibles). At the end of Fiscal 2019, a total of $13.0 million for business interruption insurance was recognised in net profit (loss) as a reduction of production costs, $4.5 million was recognised in Q4 2019. As at December 27, 2019 $8.5 million had been received in cash for business interruption insurance and $4.5 million had been included in other receivables.</p><p>OutlookWe expect growth in revenue and profitability over the next several years as a result of contracted price increases in most of our off-take agreements. In addition, as the potential demand for industrial wood pellets continues to grow globally, we are well positioned to meet this demand growth through a combination of expansion projects at existing production facilities, some of which are currently underway, and new greenfield and brownfield growth projects. Moreover, we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and joint ventures to grow our production platform, and continue to capture opportunities in the growing Asian marketplace as a result of our longstanding relationships with customers in the region. </p><p>The recent restart of the Entwistle Facility and strong initial performance combined with the commissioning of the destoner will add production volume throughout the year, and an expected positive contribution to Adjusted EBITDA in 2020. Additionally, as the Aliceville and Smithers facilities are both operating at full run-rate production, incremental production volume and Adjusted EBITDA contribution is expected for 2020.</p><p>The above mentioned derailment and blockade of CN rail service has continued to impact the ability to get production to port, and in some cases has caused production disruption in Q1 2020. We incurred additional costs to divert finished goods from our facilities for ship loading to different ports for some shipments. In Q1 2020 thus far we have lost 20kMT of production because of disruption to rail and port service, and we currently anticipate approximately two million dollars of Adjusted EBITDA will be missed in Q1 2020 as a result of the CN and port blockades and the subsequent rail delays.</p><p>Production output of Pinnacle's B.C. sawmill suppliers has continued at consistently lower levels. Although current forecasts are for reduced stumpage costs for B.C. logs in mid-2020 and improved sawmill economics, Pinnacle continues to retain fibre inventories and employ other sourcing strategies to manage unforeseen disruptions. </p><p>While Pinnacle remains focused on improving fibre, fibre processing, haulage, and cash conversion costs, production and revenue are expected to continue to be impacted through 2020, as will the Adjusted Gross Margin\u00b9 as our B.C. facilities continue to process a wider mix of harvest residuals.</p><p>DividendThe Board\u00a0of Directors today approved the payment of the Company's Q4 2019 dividend of $0.15 per Common Share. Payment will be made on March 26, 2020 to shareholders of record as at March 12, 2020. </p><p>Selected Consolidated Financial InformationThe following\u00a0tables set forth selected financial information for Q4 2019 compared to the prior year period.

These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. We use non-IFRS measures including \"EBITDA\", \"Adjusted EBITDA\", \"Adjusted EBITDA per Metric Ton\", \"Adjusted Gross Margin\", \"Adjusted Gross Margin per Metric Ton\", \"Adjusted Gross Margin Percentage\" and \"Free Cash Flow\". These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. As required by Canadian securities laws, we reconcile these non-IFRS measures to the most comparable IFRS measures in our Management Discussion &amp; Analysis for Q4 2019. </p><p>(2) IFRS 16 ImplementationPinnacle adopted IFRS 16 Leases at the beginning of Fiscal 2019. For a description of IFRS 16 please refer to the Company's Management Discussion &amp; Analysis for Q4 2019. \u00a0As a result of initially applying IFRS 16, in relation to the leases that were previously classified as operating leases, Pinnacle recognized $36.8 million of right-of-use assets and $36.8 million of lease liabilities as at December 29, 2018. Further, in relation to those leases under IFRS 16, Pinnacle has recognized depreciation and interest costs, instead of operating lease expense. During Fiscal 2019, the Company recognized $8.2 million of depreciation charges and $2.4 million of interest costs from these leases. </p><p>As a result of applying IFRS 16, Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2019 have increased by $2.0 million related to lease payment expenses that were previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17. Also in relation to applying IFRS 16, Free Cash Flow for Q4 2019 has increased by $2.0 million related to lease payment expenses that were previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17.</p><p>Forward-Looking InformationThis news release may contain \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws in Canada. Forward-looking information may relate to Pinnacle's future financial outlook and anticipated events or results and may include information regarding its financial position, business strategy, growth strategies, budgets, operations, financial results, taxes, dividend policy, plans and objectives.

The study by Dr. Daniel Pang from the University of Calgary Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and a colleague from the University of Montreal, says cats are notoriously hard to diagnose when it comes to their pain levels. But they have created a scale that looks at the feline facial expression, including ears, eyes and even their whiskers. A closing or narrowing of the eyes or a flattening of the ears can be a sign that the animal is in pain. Pang said veterinarians have historically under prescribed pain medication to cats as opposed to dogs. The study, by Pang and Dr. Paulo Steagall at the University of Montreal, was published last month in 'Scientific Reports'.</p><p>Filename: n_Cat-Pain-Study20200117T1638</p><p>Companion: Cat-Pain-Study</p><p>Category: NEWS</p><p>Time Published: 4:38 p.m. ET Friday, January 17</p><p>Headline: Calgary begins process of abolishing conversion therapy</p><p>Caption: The controversial practice of conversion therapy will go to a Calgary council committee next week with a vote on banning it likely occurring next month.

(/ul) \"While Fiscal 2019 offered up some challenges for Pinnacle, mainly due to the incident at Entwistle and fibre supply issues as a result of B.C. sawmill curtailments, our team worked diligently to remedy both situations and we look forward to realizing on the opportunities 2020 presents,\" said Rob McCurdy, CEO of Pinnacle. \"We continue to strengthen and diversify the Company through growth and expansion of our existing facilities and through the construction of new facilities, and I am confident that the Pinnacle team will continue to successfully execute on the Pinnacle strategy this year and well into the future.\"</p><p>Q4 2019 Financial Results Revenue for Q4 2019 totaled $91.5 million, a decrease of 11.8% compared to $103.7 million for Q4 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to disruption to reduced production in the B.C. facilities with a greater concentration of harvest residuals and the Burns Lake maintenance capital shut as well as shipping delays due to the CN rail strike in Q4 2019.</p><p>Adjusted Gross Margin1 was $16.4 million, or 17.9% of revenue in Q4 2019, compared to $16.7 million, or 16.1% of revenue in Q4 2018. The increase in Adjusted Gross Margin1 Percentage was primarily attributable to $4.5 million of business interruption insurance receivable net of $1.1 million of costs associated with fixed overhead and incident response costs for the Entwistle Incident booked as a reduction of production costs and high start up costs incurred at Aliceville and repair and maintenance costs incurred at our Entwistle Facility in Q4 2018. B.C. same facility production levels in Q4 2019 were, however, lower compared to the prior year, mainly due to the CN rail strike, scheduled capital shut down at our Burns Lake Facility, as well a greater concentration of harvest residuals used in production in order to replace reduced sawmill residuals output. Adjusted Gross Margin1 for Q4 2019 also reflects the Company's adoption of IFRS 162. Excluding the impact of the implementation of IFRS 162 and the Entwistle Incident, Q4 2019 Adjusted Gross Margin1 was $11.0 million, or 12.1% of revenue. The Company reported a net loss of $3.2 million in Q4 2019, compared to a net profit $7.4 million in Q4 2018. The change in net profit reflects higher selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses and amortization costs reflecting the Company's new production facilities, as well as increased finance costs, partially offset by reduced production costs. Excluding the impact of the Entwistle Incident, net loss in Q4 2019 was $5.5 million.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA1 totaled $11.3 million in Q4 2019, compared to $13.8 million in Q4 2018. The decrease is attributable to lower revenues in Q4 2019 compared to Q4 2018, increased distribution and sales, general, and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") costs and an increase in other expenses. Excluding the impact of $3.2 million associated with the Entwistle Incident, as well as $2.0 million related to the adoption of IFRS 162, Q4 2019 Adjusted EBITDA1 was $6.1 million.</p><p>Fiscal 2019 Financial Results Revenue for Fiscal 2019 totaled $377.8 million, an increase of 8.7% compared to $347.4 million for Fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes mostly due to a full year of revenue contribution from the production and sale of pellets from the Smithers and Aliceville facilities, each of which contributed no production volume in Q1 - Q3 2018, offset by lower production volumes at our B.C. facilities due to sawmill curtailments and reductions in sawmill residual deliveries.</p><p>Adjusted Gross Margin1 was $65.0 million, or 17.2% of revenue in Fiscal 2019, compared to $67.6 million, or 19.5% of revenue in Fiscal 2018. The decrease in Adjusted Gross Margin1 Percentage was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues offset by an increase in production and distribution costs. Production costs include $7.3 million of costs associated with fixed overhead and incident response costs for the Entwistle Incident, offset by an amount of $13.0 million for business interruption insurance proceeds. Adjusted Gross Margin1 for Fiscal 2019 also reflects the Company's adoption of IFRS 162. Excluding the impact of the implementation of IFRS 162 and the Entwistle Incident, Fiscal 2019 Adjusted Gross Margin1 was $51.5 million, or 13.6% of revenue.</p><p>The Company reported a net loss of $9.9 million in Fiscal 2019, compared to a net profit of $2.7 million in Fiscal 2018. The change in net profit reflects higher distribution costs, higher amortization costs reflecting the Company's new production facilities, and higher production costs due to higher fibre costs, cash conversion costs and costs incurred for third party wood pellet purchases, partially offset by reduced selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses. Excluding the impact of the Entwistle Incident, net loss in Fiscal 2019 was $12.8 million.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA1 totaled $47.2 million in Fiscal 2019, compared to $55.1 million in Fiscal 2018. Increased revenue was offset by higher distribution costs, higher production costs, including higher cash conversion costs (due primarily to fibre mix constraints which increased repair and maintenance costs), higher fibre costs due to extended sawmill curtailments in the B.C. region, and costs associated with the Entwistle Incident, partially offset by the impact of IFRS 162 and business interruption amounts recoverable. Excluding the impact of $3.9 million associated with the Entwistle Incident, as well as $7.8 million related to the adoption of IFRS 162, Fiscal 2019 Adjusted EBITDA1 was $35.5 million.</p><p>As at the end of Fiscal 2019, the Company had available liquidity of $57.1 million from cash balances and debt facilities (excluding the delayed draw facility), compared to $49.1 million at the end of 2018, which Pinnacle expects to be sufficient throughout Fiscal 2020. At the end of Fiscal 2019 the ratio of net debt to last twelve month Adjusted EBITDA1 was 6.3 times. This ratio was elevated due to the investment in the Aliceville Facility in Q4 2018, significant new capacity at the Entwistle and Smithers Facilities, expansion projects at Williams Lake and Meadowbank, and initial construction costs of the High Level Facility that have not yet generated their run-rate Adjusted EBITDA1. As these facilities reach their run-rate capacity, this ratio is expected to decline.</p><p>Q1 2020 CN Rail Disruptions //st * CN rail service has impacted the ability to effectively get product to</p><p>port and has caused production disruption in Q1 2020.</p><p>* The January derailment in B.C. damaged Pinnacle leased railcars and</p><p>resulted in some lost pellets. Full recovery of costs from CN is</p><p>expected.</p><p>* The derailment caused service disruptions which impacted production</p><p>output for a period of clean up for which we will not be compensated.</p><p>* Ten straight days of cold weather in January caused CN rail disruptions</p><p>resulting in some facility downtime.</p><p>* In February CN rail lines and B.C. ports have been disrupted by</p><p>blockades resulting in downtime at our northern facilities.</p><p>New Off-take Agreements During the quarter, Pinnacle entered into a long-term, take-or-pay contract with Mitsui for 100,000 MTPA commencing in 2023.</p><p>This is the ninth contract signed with customers in Japan since the beginning of Fiscal 2018 demonstrating the Company's successful advancement of the strategy for sales growth into Japan. New contracts improve The Company's customer diversification across Japan, the U.K., South Korea, and Europe.</p><p>New Facility in Demopolis, Alabama In Q4 2019, Pinnacle announced the construction of a new industrial wood pellet production facility in the southeast United States, in close proximity to Pinnacle's Aliceville facility. The new facility (the \"Demopolis Facility\") will be located adjacent to an existing large sawmill in Demopolis, Alabama. The Demopolis Facility and Aliceville Facility will operate under a single partnership with Pinnacle, The Westervelt Company (\"TWC\") and Two Rivers Lumber Company, LLC (\"TRL\"), each holding a 70%, 20% and 10% interest, respectively, and is expected to have annual production volume of 360,000 metric tonnes per annum (\"MTPA\"). Anticipated capital costs to construct the Demopolis Facility are expected to be approximately US$99 million, and Pinnacle will fund its portion of the capital costs from draws on its existing credit facilities. Commissioning the Demopolis Facility with initial industrial wood pellet production is expected in the second quarter of 2021.</p><p>With the addition of the Demopolis facility Pinnacle will have over 44% of its run-rate production capacity outside of the B.C. fibre basket.</p><p>Production Facility Construction and Upgrades Plans to install a chipper and additional pelleter at the Smithers facility have been finalized for a total capital cost of approximately $6.0 million (Pinnacle's portion: $4.2 million funded from existing credit facilities). The upgrade will decrease costs and increase production run-rate output by approximately 15,000 MTPA. The project is expected to begin in Q1 2020, with completion expected in Q3 2020.</p><p>Construction at the High Level facility progressed in Q4 2019 and is now in a planned suspension due to winter weather conditions until spring 2020 when warmer temperatures will allow for efficient construction to continue. An additional capital requirement of $6.0 million is expected, bringing the total capital cost to $60.0 million, with Pinnacle's 50% share being $30.0 million. Tolko has indicated that additional fibre will be available due to forest fire log processing, providing a strong supply of fibre for commissioning. As a result, Management is confident that this will enable the facility to produce at the upper end of the 170,000 MTPA to 200,000 MTPA range. The Facility is expected to be completed as planned in the fourth quarter of 2020.</p><p>The upgrades at our Williams Lake and Meadowbank facilities are progressing on schedule and are expected to be completed and begin commissioning in Q1 2020 and Q3 2020 respectively. The upgrades will allow the two facilities, to process a broader array of available fibre sources and achieve a series of safety and environmental advancements. This strategic investment will enhance the operating flexibility of the facilities and position Pinnacle to adapt to cyclical changes in wood fibre supply within the B.C. interior. Further, the equipment, technology and infrastructure improvements will result in an increase of 80,000 MTPA in combined overall production capacity.</p><p>At the Aliceville facility, the second phase of the planned capital improvement plan is expected to commence in Q2 2020 and will focus on further improvements to fibre flow and processing in order to drive cost effective increases in production capacity. Ongoing work with fibre suppliers to optimize fibre mix and production levels have steadily increased through 2019.</p><p>Entwistle Restart The Entwistle rebuild has been completed, the furnace and dryer have been restarted, and commissioning of the new equipment is in process.</p><p>Restoration of the facility is expected at a total estimated capital cost of approximately $14.0 million. Other costs are estimated to be approximately $9.5 million, of which $9.1 million has been incurred year-to-date. Pinnacle is actively working with customers and partners to mitigate the impacts of the 2019 production shortfall and continues to work with the Company's insurance providers to determine the insurance recoveries available for the Entwistle Incident. Pinnacle expects substantially all costs incurred to be recoverable through insurance, subject to deductibles.</p><p>In Q4 2019 there were no additional asset impairment charges recorded, $9.4 million was recognized in Q1 2019 for assets impaired in the incident which has reduced property, plant and equipment and lowered net income for the period. The net income impact has been partially offset by property insurance proceeds recorded in net income on the income statement of $9.0 million as at the end of Fiscal 2019 (net of deductibles). At the end of Fiscal 2019, a total of $13.0 million for business interruption insurance was recognised in net profit (loss) as a reduction of production costs, $4.5 million was recognised in Q4 2019. As at December 27, 2019 $8.5 million had been received in cash for business interruption insurance and $4.5 million had been included in other receivables.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>We expect growth in revenue and profitability over the next several years as a result of contracted price increases in most of our off-take agreements. In addition, as the potential demand for industrial wood pellets continues to grow globally, we are well positioned to meet this demand growth through a combination of expansion projects at existing production facilities, some of which are currently underway, and new greenfield and brownfield growth projects. Moreover, we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and joint ventures to grow our production platform, and continue to capture opportunities in the growing Asian marketplace as a result of our longstanding relationships with customers in the region.</p><p>The recent restart of the Entwistle Facility and strong initial performance combined with the commissioning of the destoner will add production volume throughout the year, and an expected positive contribution to Adjusted EBITDA in 2020. Additionally, as the Aliceville and Smithers facilities are both operating at full run-rate production, incremental production volume and Adjusted EBITDA contribution is expected for 2020.</p><p>The above mentioned derailment and blockade of CN rail service has continued to impact the ability to get production to port, and in some cases has caused production disruption in Q1 2020. We incurred additional costs to divert finished goods from our facilities for ship loading to different ports for some shipments. In Q1 2020 thus far we have lost 20kMT of production because of disruption to rail and port service, and we currently anticipate approximately two million dollars of Adjusted EBITDA will be missed in Q1 2020 as a result of the CN and port blockades and the subsequent rail delays.</p><p>Production output of Pinnacle's B.C. sawmill suppliers has continued at consistently lower levels. Although current forecasts are for reduced stumpage costs for B.C. logs in mid-2020 and improved sawmill economics, Pinnacle continues to retain fibre inventories and employ other sourcing strategies to manage unforeseen disruptions.</p><p>While Pinnacle remains focused on improving fibre, fibre processing, haulage, and cash conversion costs, production and revenue are expected to continue to be impacted through 2020, as will the Adjusted Gross Margin as our B.C. facilities continue to process a wider mix of harvest residuals.</p><p>Dividend The Board of Directors today approved the payment of the Company's Q4 2019 dividend of $0.15 per Common Share. Payment will be made on March 26, 2020 to shareholders of record as at March 12, 2020.</p><p>Selected Consolidated Financial Information The following tables set forth selected financial information for Q4 2019 compared to the prior year period.

These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. We use non-IFRS measures including \"EBITDA\", \"Adjusted EBITDA\", \"Adjusted EBITDA per Metric Ton\", \"Adjusted Gross Margin\", \"Adjusted Gross Margin per Metric Ton\", \"Adjusted Gross Margin Percentage\" and \"Free Cash Flow\". These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. As required by Canadian securities laws, we reconcile these non-IFRS measures to the most comparable IFRS measures in our Management Discussion &amp;Analysis for Q4 2019.</p><p>(2) IFRS 16 Implementation Pinnacle adopted IFRS 16 Leases at the beginning of Fiscal 2019. For a description of IFRS 16 please refer to the Company's Management Discussion &amp;Analysis for Q4 2019. As a result of initially applying IFRS 16, in relation to the leases that were previously classified as operating leases, Pinnacle recognized $36.8 million of right-of-use assets and $36.8 million of lease liabilities as at December 29, 2018. Further, in relation to those leases under IFRS 16, Pinnacle has recognized depreciation and interest costs, instead of operating lease expense. During Fiscal 2019, the Company recognized $8.2 million of depreciation charges and $2.4 million of interest costs from these leases.</p><p>As a result of applying IFRS 16, Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2019 have increased by $2.0 million related to lease payment expenses that were previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17. Also in relation to applying IFRS 16, Free Cash Flow for Q4 2019 has increased by $2.0 million related to lease payment expenses that were previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17.</p><p>Forward-Looking Information</p><p>This news release may contain \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws in Canada.

Canakkale Governor Omer Toraman said on social media platform X that 11 planes and 10 helicopters, along with ground crews, have been deployed to battle the blaze.  The villages were evacuated as a precaution, as the fire spread rapidly due to strong winds, Toraman said.  According to weather reports, winds in the region are blowing at around 50 km per hour.  Meanwhile, Turkish Agriculture and Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli said on X that efforts are continuing \"with full force and without interruption\" to bring the blaze under control as soon as possible.  Canakkale, along with the northwestern provinces of Kocaeli and Bursa, has battled forest fires in the past month, driven by extreme heat, low humidity, and strong winds.  Yumakli said a wildfire that erupted on Friday in Kocaeli was brought under control as of Saturday, reports Xinhua news agency.  Additionally, a forest fire erupted on Friday in Turkey's northwestern province of Kocaeli, forcing the evacuation of a village as flames neared homes.  The blaze broke out around noon in the Karamursel district and spread rapidly due to strong winds, the Kocaeli Governor's Office said on social media. Residents of Akcat village were being evacuated.  Many homes were destroyed and rendered uninhabitable, the Demiroren News Agency reported, sharing images of charred buildings.  Firefighting efforts were underway from the air and on the ground, involving six planes, 10 helicopters, 75 vehicles, and 200 personnel, the governor's office said.  Winds in the area were forecast to reach 60 to 80 kilometres per hour until Saturday evening, the statement added, warning residents to take extra precautions.

Even though the nights remain cool at this time of the year, days can be warm and often windy and just one unattended or poorly managed campfire can be enough to cause serious damage.    Campers are reminded to extinguish campfires with water, not soil, and to check fire restrictions and the weather forecast \u2013 especially the projected wind speeds \u2013 before they leave.    CFA Chief Officer Jason Heffernan said campers should check to make sure there are no Total Fire Bans in place at their camp site.    It\u2019s essential to understand what is permitted at their destination to avoid putting people and the environment at risk,\u201d Chief Officer Heffernan said.    Victoria\u2019s Chief Conservation Regulator, Kate Gavens, said campers breaking the rules would be caught.    \u201cWe\u2019ll have authorised officers visiting our parks and forests this weekend to make sure that campers are following the rules and to make sure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable long weekend,\u201d Ms Gavens said.    People who breach campfire regulations on public land face a maximum penalty of $19,759.    The maximum penalty for lighting or maintaining a fire during a day of Total Fire Ban is $47,421.60 and-or 2 years in jail.    Campers should report unattended campfires to DEECA at 136 186 or call 000 to report a bushfire.    To check fire restrictions, download the VicEmergency app or go to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.emv.vic.gov.au\">www.emv.vic.gov.au</url>.

The fire has spread to four neighborhoods and has reached areas where residential buildings are located. While aerial and ground interventions against the flames are ongoing, nearly 100 houses and around 50 villas have been evacuated. Due to the strong winds affecting the area, electricity has been cut off as a precaution.  ```html  A forest fire broke out yesterday around 23:00 in the Aliefendi neighborhood of Alanya district in Antalya. Many teams were dispatched to the area to extinguish the fire, which was close to residential areas. Electricity was cut off in the region as a precaution due to the strong winds. The teams from the Forestry Management and Fire Department were mobilized to extinguish the fire.  GREENHOUSES BURNED, HOUSES DAMAGED  The fire that broke out in Aliefendi neighborhood spread over a wide area due to the wind. After the fire threatened the nearby residential areas, evacuation efforts were initiated. The residential areas within the fire zone were evacuated while many teams continued their firefighting efforts. As citizens moved away from the flames, they also evacuated their livestock. Some greenhouses caught in the flames burned, and houses were damaged.  IT SPREAD TO \u0130SPATLI NEIGHBORHOOD  The fire that started in Aliefendi neighborhood spread to \u0130spatl\u0131 neighborhood due to the wind, and teams intervened throughout the night. 20 water tankers from the Forestry Management, AFAD, fire department, municipality, and gendarmerie teams intervened throughout the night.  Alanya District Governor \u015eakir \u00d6ner \u00d6zt\u00fcrk and Alanya Mayor Osman Tar\u0131k \u00d6z\u00e7elik visited the area for inspection. Governor \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, who received information about the situation, stated that there were no casualties and that intense efforts were being made to extinguish the flames, and that the work was ongoing.  AIR AND GROUND INTERVENTION CONTINUES  With the first light of the morning, aerial intervention to the fire also began. 2 planes and 5 helicopters participated in the firefighting efforts. In the area where the wind is very strong, aerial and ground interventions continue to bring the fire under control.  FLAMES SPREAD TO 3 MORE NEIGHBORHOODS  The fire also reached the nearby \u0130shakl\u0131, Karg\u0131cak, and Kocao\u011flanl\u0131 neighborhoods. The fire, which intensified due to the wind, is being intervened by 2 planes, 8 helicopters, 30 water tankers, 1 construction machine, and 190 personnel. While evacuation efforts are being carried out in the region, aerial and ground interventions against the flames continue.  \"WE EVACUATED NEARLY 50 VILLAS\"  The flames reached the point where residential areas are located. Work has begun to evacuate the residential areas. Karg\u0131cak Neighborhood Muhtar Muammer Asilt\u00fcrk stated, \"The fire is growing, putting residential areas at risk. Therefore, we evacuated nearly 50 villas in Karg\u0131cak. We hope it goes out as soon as possible.\"  \"WE EVACUATED NEARLY 100 HOUSES IN THE REGION\"  Alanya District Governor \u015eakir \u00d6ner \u00d6zt\u00fcrk stated, \"The fire is affecting 3 neighborhoods. We evacuated nearly 100 houses in the region. We have been conducting effective efforts since last night. Aerial vehicles have also been deployed since the morning hours. However, the wind is making our job difficult. We have largely brought the fire under control in Aliefendi and \u0130spatl\u0131 neighborhoods, but the fire has shifted towards Karg\u0131cak neighborhood due to the wind.\" he said.  \u00d6zt\u00fcrk stated that all teams have been mobilized. He also urged citizens to be careful, saying, \"Thank God, so far there have been no injuries or fatalities. There are no seriously damaged houses. Largely, forested areas and greenhouses have been damaged. The wind can suddenly change the direction of the fire, so our citizens should also be more careful.\" he added.  CITIZENS ARE MOVING THEIR ANIMALS TO SAFE PLACES  Meanwhile, citizens who evacuated their homes are also transporting their animals to safer areas by loading them onto tractors or trucks.  On the other hand, the firefighting helicopters intervening in the fire are taking water from the nearby sea and dropping it on the flames. Meanwhile, vacationers on the beach watched the firefighting helicopters.  ```</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57733913597</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GSJ-BC43-RS75-02YX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"760\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Haberler.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 19, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Turkey</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Western Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00095AD</classCode><className>FOREST RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0008XNH</classCode><className>GENDARMERIE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DVSL</classCode><className>EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00096KL</classCode><className>RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00095AD</classCode><className>FOREST RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STLL000CPD2</classCode><className>LIVESTOCK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GT113</classCode><className>ASIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC328</classCode><className>TURKEY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>GR140</classCode><className>WESTERN ASIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>Energy &amp;

Even though the nights remain cool at this time of the year, days can be warm and often windy and just one unattended or poorly managed campfire can be enough to cause serious damage.    Campers are reminded to extinguish campfires with water, not soil, and to check fire restrictions and the weather forecast \u2013 especially the projected wind speeds \u2013 before they leave.    CFA Chief Officer Jason Heffernan said campers should check to make sure there are no Total Fire Bans in place at their camp site.    It\u2019s essential to understand what is permitted at their destination to avoid putting people and the environment at risk,\u201d Chief Officer Heffernan said.    Victoria\u2019s Chief Conservation Regulator, Kate Gavens, said campers breaking the rules would be caught.    \u201cWe\u2019ll have authorised officers visiting our parks and forests this weekend to make sure that campers are following the rules and to make sure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable long weekend,\u201d Ms Gavens said.    People who breach campfire regulations on public land face a maximum penalty of $19,759.    The maximum penalty for lighting or maintaining a fire during a day of Total Fire Ban is $47,421.60 and-or 2 years in jail.    Campers should report unattended campfires to DEECA at 136 186 or call 000 to report a bushfire.    To check fire restrictions, download the VicEmergency app or go to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.emv.vic.gov.au\">www.emv.vic.gov.au</url>.

The president noted that Indonesia already operates C-130 Hercules transport aircraft equipped with air ambulance containers and emphasized the importance of upgrading the A400M with similar capabilities.  Prabowo, who previously served as defense minister, said the A400M will not only strengthen Indonesia\u2019s air military fleet but also enhance the TNI\u2019s ability to assist civilians during disasters.  \u201cThe TNI serves as a state instrument to assist the people, particularly in times of emergency,\u201d he said.  He added that Indonesia\u2019s vast archipelagic geography, which is comparable in size to Europe, requires strong air capabilities.  \u201cAir power is crucial for us. We are strengthening all branches of the TNI to be more effective, not only in safeguarding our territory but also in supporting national development,\u201d Prabowo said.  The Airbus A400M, a multi-role military transport aircraft, arrived in Indonesia on Monday morning after a three-day flight from Seville, Spain. With a capacity of up to several dozen tons, it can carry armored vehicles, light helicopters, and other heavy cargo.  The aircraft can also operate on short and unpaved runways, making it a valuable asset for both defense operations and humanitarian missions across the Indonesian archipelago.  The delivery stems from a 2021 contract between Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Defense and Airbus for two A400M units configured for multirole tanker and transport functions. The agreement took effect in 2022, alongside a Letter of Intent (LoI) for the potential purchase of four additional units.  Dani Aswara contributed to the writing of this article.

The training camps ensure seasonal forest and fire operations officers are well-prepared to respond to emergencies and carry out vital work to reduce bushfire risk.    This summer, FFMVic is introducing 636 seasonal firefighters who will work alongside their experienced permanent crews.    14 training camps are being held across the state over the coming weeks.    Recruits complete two weeks of classroom and field-based learning, covering topics such as fire behaviour, safety and survival techniques, fire suppression, working around aircraft, and planned burning.    The camps offer hands-on experience, including operating water pumps and chainsaws, and driving specialised firefighting vehicles.    Beyond emergency response, seasonal forest and fire operations officers also carry out important land management tasks such as mulching, mowing, slashing, and spraying.    They help maintain fuel breaks, public land roads, trails, recreation sites, and assist with planned burns.    This summer, 92 seasonal firefighters will be based in the Loddon Mallee Region, working from depots across the region.    Last year, FFMVic firefighters responded to more than 1,265 bushfires across Victoria and delivered priority planned burns to help reduce the impact of future fires.    FFMVic chief fire officer Chris Hardman said they have had a diverse intake of recruits.    \u201cOur seasonal forest and fire operations officers join us from diverse backgrounds, reflecting the communities we serve,\u201d he said.    \u201cThey play a critical role alongside our experienced crews, responding to bushfires in some of the state\u2019s most remote and challenging environments to keep communities safe.    \u201cThis summer, they\u2019ll be part of a team of nearly 1800 frontline personnel and 1200 accredited incident management staff.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58019547070</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H28-8D53-RS9P-906K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"371\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Sunbury &amp;

Creating firebreaks to prevent forest fires  Nam Phat is a disadvantaged village in Ban Bo commune, with 100% of its population being Mong ethnic residents and an economy relying mainly on agriculture. Since the introduction of payments for forest environmental services, the people's incomes have become more stable, and their awareness of forest protection has improved significantly.  Ms. Giang Thi Ghenh in Nam Phat village shared, \"The commune government tells us that we must protect the forest, so I also have the responsibility to preserve and bring life to the forest. Green forests ensure our access to clean water; only when there is water can our maize and rice plants grow. Additionally, the State also supports us with payments for forest protection. Thanks to this, many households have been able to buy televisions, motorbikes, refrigerators, etc., and our lives have become more stable.\"  Forest rangers instruct local residents on clearing underbrush in the buffer zone of Hoang Lien National Park.

Previously, forest protection and fire prevention around the village encountered many difficulties due to the people\u2019s limited awareness. Villagers often cooked and stayed overnight in field huts or smoked out bees to collect honey, which easily led to forest fires. While these activities brought very little benefit, the damage to the forest was enormous. However, since Nam Phat village established a specialized forest protection team with more than 40 members, such practices have completely ended.  Before the dry season, the team discussed implementing fire prevention measures and strengthening communication on forest protection and development. Immediately afterward, together with forest rangers, villagers went up the mountain to create firebreaks as a preventive measure against forest fires.  Mr. Phan A Nay, Secretary of the Nam Phat Village Party Cell, said that members of the specialized team regularly coordinate with forest rangers to disseminate legal regulations on forest protection, guide villagers on creating firebreaks, and teach them how to burn fields without letting the fire spread into the forest. The village also requires households with fields near the forest to conduct burning only within the prescribed time and to notify the forest protection team for supervision, ensuring that forest fires do not occur.\u201d  Raising awareness through communication  Mr. Nguyen Van Trinh, a forest ranger at the Tam Duong Forest Protection Department, said, \"As the forest ranger assigned to Ban Bo commune, I regularly advise the local government to strengthen the Steering Committee for Forest Fire Prevention and Control, develop fire prevention and firefighting plans, reinforce specialized forest protection teams, and stay in the field to disseminate fire prevention measures. We also coordinate patrols and inspections to prevent forest fires and violations of forestry regulations.\"  The commune's Party Committee and government have signed forest protection commitments, disseminated legal regulations, and guided residents on safe burning practices, strictly prohibiting burning during prolonged hot, dry days. Since the beginning of the year, the commune has organized more than 50 communication sessions on the Law on Forestry for over 4,800 participants. As a result, public awareness has improved, and the forest has been better protected.  According to Mr. Nguyen Dinh Thuong, Chairman of the Ban Bo Commune People's Committee, the commune has a large forest area and is located in the buffer zone of Hoang Lien National Park, so forest protection is always a top priority. The government has strengthened the steering committee, assigned tasks, and developed forest fire prevention and firefighting plans at the beginning of the dry season, while intensifying patrols and controlling people entering the forest to carry out communication. Thanks to these efforts, there has been no forest fire occurring in the commune for many years.\"  In addition, the commune continues to implement many solutions, focusing on disseminating legal regulation, strengthening 21 specialized forest protection teams with more than 500 members, assigning tasks, and maintaining 24/7 on-duty shifts during peak dry periods.  Thanks to the consensus between the government and local residents, Ban Bo's forests have become increasingly greener, with improved forest cover. The forest not only helps regulate the climate and provide water but also opens direction for developing sustainable livelihoods through forest environmental services and forestry economic activities.  Ban Bo commune has more than 4,113 hectares of forested land, including 3,871 hectares of natural forest and 242 hectares of planted forest, with a coverage rate of over 40%.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58182018356</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H6N-P6W3-RS0V-1209-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"908\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Nong Nghiep Viet Nam Online</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>November 15, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Viet Nam</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South-Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Brazil's then President Jair Bolsonaro falsely claimed in November 2019 that actor Leonardo DiCaprio had funded nonprofit groups that he alleged were partly responsible for setting the fires.  The accusation, though false, created risks for Scannavino and his work promoting sustainable development and citizens' rights in a region along the Tapajos River popular with tourists for its blend of rainforest and beaches.  Four of Scannavino's friends who volunteered as forest firefighters were jailed for two days and then prosecuted as alleged perpetrators of fires in the region, only to be cleared later. Police scrolled through documents of Scannavino's Sa\u00fade e Alegria nonprofit for weeks. Scannavino received anonymous threats, and his car was set on fire.  DiCaprio takes notice  =============  But Bolsonaro's comments helped DiCaprio take notice of Scannavino's work and decide to sponsor his work through Re:wild, a nonprofit conservation group that the actor helped found. Their partnership has already lasted five years, the Brazilian activist said.  \u201cWhen the accusations emerged, DiCaprio came out to say he was not funding us, but added we deserved his support after he saw our work,\u201d Scannavino told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \u201cI've never been with him or spoken to him. But he gives us support, uses his social media to show what this partnership does.\u201d  The 59-year-old Scannavino founded Saude e Alegria, or Health and Happiness, in 1987 to promote integrated and sustainable community development in Para state, whose capital Belem will host the United Nations' Conference of the Parties, or COP30, next week.  Scannavino arrived in Belem on Tuesday from Santarem, the city where the initiative is based, after a two-day boat ride that featured broadcasts with journalists, activists and climate experts.  Local products hub  ============  The project started as a health care initiative, but it has since grown to work with rural communities to improve their quality of life and exercise of citizenship.  One project sponsored by DiCaprio's institute is the Forest Economy EcoCentre in Santarem, which serves as a hub for processing, storage and commercialisation of products made by locals. Organisers said the facility enhances the economic viability of sustainable practices in the region.  The hub was opened a year ago, and is also supported by the governments of Brazil, Germany and Norway, all contributors of the Amazon Fund, a Brazilian initiative that pays for anti-deforestation and sustainable development efforts.  Scannavino said that the initiative cost about 5 million Brazilian Reais (USD 9,38,000), mostly paid for by the Amazon Fund.  \u201cThose first few days after Bolsonaro's accusation were terrible. People insulted us and our families on the streets, the firefighters had to leave. But then a surprising thing happened,\u201d Scannavino said.  \u201cUsually people get away from you if such a big target appears on your back. It was the opposite with us. Eventually the accusations went away, the firefighters were released, and people were curious about us \u2014 including DiCaprio,\u201d he added.  'Meet the moment'  ===========  In an Instagram post this week, DiCaprio said the world leaders gathering in Brazil must ensure that those defending nature have the resources they need. He said Re:wild is pledging more money to protecting forests.  \u201cI urge leaders to unite and meet the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cOur future depends on it.\u201d  The AP emailed Re:wild seeking further comment on its work with Scannavino and at COP30.  Scannavino, who left the Brazilian metropolis Sao Paulo for the Amazon more than 37 years ago, said that DiCaprio and other backers of his nonprofit also came in support because he chose to show Bolsonaro he was working with the support of local police and armed forces instead of trying to score political points.  The former president was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for a coup attempt in 2023 after losing his reelection bid.  \u201cOur critics are specialists in hatred, and since that incident we chose to be polite, provide evidence we worked with all stakeholders, everyone who mattered in the region. We refused to leave our local communities without due health care assistance just because of an absurd accusation,\u201d Scannavino said.  Many awards and acknowledgments later, Scannavino is expected to meet with Re:wild officials and perhaps DiCaprio himself at COP30.  Scannavino said that he nearly met DiCaprio about 20 years ago while setting up for a photo exhibition in New York. He said that the team preparing the photo exhibition didn't recognise the actor under a cap and complained that he was getting in the way, so he left.  \u201cShortly later our producer raced to tell me that was Leonardo DiCaprio,\u201dScannavino said. \u201cI told her to run after him and get him back. She caught him on his bike a few blocks away. He thanked her, but had to leave.  \u201cI hope that the next encounter is a very different one, so we can thank him duly,\u201d he added.

Brazil\u2019s then President Jair Bolsonaro falsely claimed in November 2019 that actor Leonardo DiCaprio had funded nonprofit groups that he alleged were partly responsible for setting the fires. The accusation, though false, created risks for Scannavino and his work promoting sustainable development and citizens\u2019 rights in a region along the Tapajos River popular with tourists for its blend of rainforest and beaches.  Four of Scannavino\u2019s friends who volunteered as forest firefighters were jailed for two days and then prosecuted as alleged perpetrators of fires in the region, only to be cleared later. Police scrolled through documents of Scannavino\u2019s Sa\u00fade e Alegria nonprofit for weeks. Scannavino received anonymous threats, and his car was set on fire.  DiCaprio takes notice  But Bolsonaro\u2019s comments helped DiCaprio take notice of Scannavino\u2019s work and decide to sponsor his work through Re:wild, a nonprofit conservation group that the actor helped found. Their partnership has already lasted five years, the Brazilian activist said.  \u201cWhen the accusations emerged, DiCaprio came out to say he was not funding us, but added we deserved his support after he saw our work,\u201d Scannavino told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \u201cI\u2019ve never been with him or spoken to him. But he gives us support, uses his social media to show what this partnership does.\u201d  The 59-year-old Scannavino founded Saude e Alegria, or Health and Happiness, in 1987 to promote integrated and sustainable community development in Para state, whose capital Belem will host the United Nations\u2019 Conference of the Parties, or COP30, next week. Scannavino arrived in Belem on Tuesday from Santarem, the city where the initiative is based, after a two-day boat ride that featured broadcasts with journalists, activists and climate experts.  Local products hub  The project started as a health care initiative, but it has since grown to work with rural communities to improve their quality of life and exercise of citizenship.  One project sponsored by DiCaprio\u2019s institute is the Forest Economy EcoCenter in Santarem, which serves as a hub for processing, storage and commercialization of products made by locals. Organizers said the facility enhances the economic viability of sustainable practices in the region.  The hub was opened a year ago, and is also supported by the governments of Brazil, Germany and Norway, all contributors of the Amazon Fund, a Brazilian initiative that pays for anti-deforestation and sustainable development efforts.  Scannavino said that the initiative cost about 5 million Brazilian reais ($938,000), mostly paid for by the Amazon Fund.  \u201cThose first few days after Bolsonaro\u2019s accusation were terrible. People insulted us and our families on the streets, the firefighters had to leave. But then a surprising thing happened,\u201d Scannavino said.  \u201cUsually people get away from you if such a big target appears on your back. It was the opposite with us. Eventually the accusations went away, the firefighters were released, and people were curious about us \u2014 including DiCaprio,\u201d he added.  \u2018Meet the moment\u2019  In an Instagram post this week, DiCaprio said the world leaders gathering in Brazil must ensure that those defending nature have the resources they need. He said Re:wild is pledging more money to protecting forests.  \u201cI urge leaders to unite and meet the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cOur future depends on it.\u201d  The AP emailed Re:wild seeking further comment on its work with Scannavino and at COP30.  Scannavino, who left the Brazilian metropolis Sao Paulo for the Amazon more than 37 years ago, said that DiCaprio and other backers of his nonprofit also came in support because he chose to show Bolsonaro he was working with the support of local police and armed forces instead of trying to score political points.  The former president was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for a coup attempt in 2023 after losing his reelection bid.  \u201cOur critics are specialists in hatred, and since that incident we chose to be polite, provide evidence we worked with all stakeholders, everyone who mattered in the region. We refused to leave our local communities without due health care assistance just because of an absurd accusation,\u201d Scannavino said.  Many awards and acknowledgments later, Scannavino is expected to meet with Re:wild officials and perhaps DiCaprio himself at COP30.  Scannavino said that he nearly met DiCaprio about 20 years ago while setting up for a photo exhibition in New York. He said that the team preparing the photo exhibition didn\u2019t recognize the actor under a cap and complained that he was getting in the way, so he left.  \u201cShortly later our producer raced to tell me that was Leonardo DiCaprio,\u201d Scannavino said. \u201cI told her to run after him and get him back. She caught him on his bike a few blocks away. He thanked her, but had to leave.  \u201cI hope that the next encounter is a very different one, so we can thank him duly,\u201d he added.  ___  Follow AP\u2019s Latin America coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america\">https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america</url>  ___  The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Brazil's then President Jair...</p><p>Being falsely accused of setting fire in the Amazon with funds from an Oscar-winning actor eventually became a blessing in disguise for Caetano Scannavino, the founder of a nonprofit organization in the heart of the rainforest.  Brazil's then President Jair Bolsonaro falsely claimed in November 2019 that actor Leonardo DiCaprio had funded nonprofit groups that he alleged were partly responsible for setting the fires. The accusation, though false, created risks for Scannavino and his work promoting sustainable development and citizens' rights in a region along the Tapajos River popular with tourists for its blend of rainforest and beaches.  Four of Scannavino's friends who volunteered as forest firefighters were jailed for two days and then prosecuted as alleged perpetrators of fires in the region, only to be cleared later. Police scrolled through documents of Scannavino\u2019s Sa\u00fade e Alegria nonprofit for weeks. Scannavino received anonymous threats, and his car was set on fire.  DiCaprio takes notice  But Bolsonaro's comments helped DiCaprio take notice of Scannavino's work and decide to sponsor his work through Re:wild, a nonprofit conservation group that the actor helped found. Their partnership has already lasted five years, the Brazilian activist said.  \u201cWhen the accusations emerged, DiCaprio came out to say he was not funding us, but added we deserved his support after he saw our work,\u201d Scannavino told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \u201cI've never been with him or spoken to him. But he gives us support, uses his social media to show what this partnership does.\u201d  The 59-year-old Scannavino founded Saude e Alegria, or Health and Happiness, in 1987 to promote integrated and sustainable community development in Para state, whose capital Belem will host the United Nations' Conference of the Parties, or COP30, next week. Scannavino arrived in Belem on Tuesday from Santarem, the city where the initiative is based, after a two-day boat ride that featured broadcasts with journalists, activists and climate experts.  Local products hub  The project started as a health care initiative, but it has since grown to work with rural communities to improve their quality of life and exercise of citizenship.  One project sponsored by DiCaprio's institute is the Forest Economy EcoCenter in Santarem, which serves as a hub for processing, storage and commercialization of products made by locals. Organizers said the facility enhances the economic viability of sustainable practices in the region.  The hub was opened a year ago, and is also supported by the governments of Brazil, Germany and Norway, all contributors of the Amazon Fund, a Brazilian initiative that pays for anti-deforestation and sustainable development efforts.  Scannavino said that the initiative cost about 5 million Brazilian reais ($938,000), mostly paid for by the Amazon Fund.  \u201cThose first few days after Bolsonaro's accusation were terrible. People insulted us and our families on the streets, the firefighters had to leave. But then a surprising thing happened,\u201d Scannavino said.  \u201cUsually people get away from you if such a big target appears on your back. It was the opposite with us. Eventually the accusations went away, the firefighters were released, and people were curious about us \u2014 including DiCaprio,\u201d he added.  \u2018Meet the moment\u2019  In an Instagram post this week, DiCaprio said the world leaders gathering in Brazil must ensure that those defending nature have the resources they need. He said Re:wild is pledging more money to protecting forests.  \u201cI urge leaders to unite and meet the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cOur future depends on it.\u201d  The AP emailed Re:wild seeking further comment on its work with Scannavino and at COP30.  Scannavino, who left the Brazilian metropolis Sao Paulo for the Amazon more than 37 years ago, said that DiCaprio and other backers of his nonprofit also came in support because he chose to show Bolsonaro he was working with the support of local police and armed forces instead of trying to score political points.  The former president was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for a coup attempt in 2023 after losing his reelection bid.  \u201cOur critics are specialists in hatred, and since that incident we chose to be polite, provide evidence we worked with all stakeholders, everyone who mattered in the region. We refused to leave our local communities without due health care assistance just because of an absurd accusation,\u201d Scannavino said.  Many awards and acknowledgments later, Scannavino is expected to meet with Re:wild officials and perhaps DiCaprio himself at COP30.  Scannavino said that he nearly met DiCaprio about 20 years ago while setting up for a photo exhibition in New York. He said that the team preparing the photo exhibition didn't recognize the actor under a cap and complained that he was getting in the way, so he left.  \u201cShortly later our producer raced to tell me that was Leonardo DiCaprio,  \" Scannavino said.  \"I told her to run after him and get him back. She caught him on his bike a few blocks away. He thanked her, but had to leave.  \"I hope that the next encounter is a very different one, so we can thank him duly,\u201d he added.  ___  Follow AP\u2019s Latin America coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america\">https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america</url>  ___  The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

It\u2019s the second week of the annual Seasonal Firefighter Training Camp, one of several running across the state to prepare over 500 seasonal firefighters for the months ahead.    As Victoria heads into another potentially dangerous bushfire season, Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic)\u2019s training is as rigorous as ever.    The two-week training scheme combines theory with intensive, hands-on drills. Participants are trained in everything from radio communication and fireline safety to equipment use, driving, and chainsaw operations.    Map reading and navigation as well as health and fitness awareness training, and aircraft safety are also a part of the training scheme.    Taking place at the Yarra Valley Estate over a period of two weeks, the training program is designed to fast-track learning, equipping new firefighters to join the ranks of the state\u2019s firefighting force by the end of November.    Dan White, District Manager for the Metro District in the Portfield region, confirmed that the program is an essential part of Victoria\u2019s fire readiness.    \u201cForest Fire Management Victoria is gearing up for the summer. Every year, we recruit seasonal firefighters to support our permanent staff to help protect communities and the environment during the fire season,\u201d Mr White said.    One of the first lessons involves the fire table, a miniature landscape simulation that demonstrates how fire behaves when it encounters slopes, wind changes, and varying fuel loads.    Mr White said, \u201cIt\u2019s a simple but powerful way for new firefighters to understand how fire moves uphill and how vegetation affects its intensity.\u201d    After completing the camp, recruits will spend several weeks refining their skills, including chainsaw and four-wheel drive training, before being assigned to depots across Victoria.    By late November, they\u2019ll be on the ground clearing access tracks, maintaining fuel breaks, and preparing recreation areas for the summer.    This year\u2019s 2025 Yarra Valley camp is a partnership between Forest Fire Management Victoria, Parks Victoria, Melbourne Water, and traditional owner groups including the Wurundjeri and Bunurong people.    Mr White said, \u201cWe work closely with these organisations throughout the fire season,\u201d    \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to have everyone training side-by-side, sharing skills and perspectives,\u201d he said.    Recruitment for the new seasonal firefighters occurs every July, with FFMVic launching its statewide recruitment drive for seasonal firefighters.    The campaign attracts hundreds of applicants eager to play a role in protecting Victoria\u2019s natural landscapes.    Tamara Beckett from FFMVic\u2019s recruitment and training team, said the seasonal workforce is a crucial part of the organisation\u2019s summer operations.    \u201cEach year we recruit around 500 seasonal firefighters,\u201d Ms Beckett said.    The seasonal recruits work alongside FFMVic\u2019s permanent staff and can be deployed anywhere in the state, depending on fire activity and conditions.    Ms Beckett said, \u201cOur staff are well trained to assess each situation.\u201d    \u201cThe strategy we use depends on the fire\u2019s size, location, weather, and proximity to communities and assets,\u201d she said.    While aerial firefighting tools like helicopters attract public attention, Tamara stressed that people on the ground remain the backbone of Victoria\u2019s fire response.    \u201cThere\u2019s no substitute for human intelligence,\u201d she said. \u201cFirefighters adapt in real time to what they see on the ground which is something the aircraft simply can\u2019t do.\u201d    Ms Beckett also emphasised the importance of community responsibility.    \u201cThere\u2019s only so much we as public land managers can do,\u201d Ms Beckett said.    \u201cResidents in bushfire-prone areas need to manage their properties and have a fire plan.\u201d    As the new recruits prepare to deploy, both Mr White and Ms Beckett share a common message: fire preparedness is everyone\u2019s responsibility.    \u201cOur teams are trained, ready, and committed, but the best way to protect communities is for everyone to be prepared and that includes not only our firefighters, but also our residents in high-risk areas,\u201d Mr White said.    With hundreds of new faces joining the firefighting effort this year, Victoria is once again reinforcing its first line of defence. The men and women on the ground.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

While aerial firefighting tools like helicopters attract public attention, Tamara stressed that people on the ground remain the backbone of Victoria\u2019s fire response.  \u201cThere\u2019s no substitute for human intelligence,\u201d she said. \u201cFirefighters adapt in real time to what they see on the ground which is something the aircraft simply can\u2019t do.\u201d  Ms Beckett also emphasised the importance of community responsibility.  \u201cThere\u2019s only so much we as public land managers can do,\u201d Ms Beckett said.  \u201cResidents in bushfire-prone areas need to manage their properties and have a fire plan.\u201d  As the new recruits prepare to deploy, both Mr White and Ms Beckett share a common message: fire preparedness is everyone\u2019s responsibility.  \u201cOur teams are trained, ready, and committed, but the best way to protect communities is for everyone to be prepared and that includes not only our firefighters, but also our residents in high-risk areas,\u201d Mr White said.  With hundreds of new faces joining the firefighting effort this year, Victoria is once again reinforcing its first line of defence. The men and women on the ground.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Karacabey underlined that T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s leadership position in global forest fire management stems from a combination of robust infrastructure and effective use of modern technology. He pointed out that traditional methods and existing technologies were no longer sufficient to combat today\u2019s wildfire challenges, signaling the start of a new era requiring innovative and adaptive approaches.  He explained that over the past decade, T\u00fcrkiye has undergone a major transformation in detecting, monitoring and extinguishing forest fires. The General Directorate of Forestry (OGM), he said, has accelerated its digitalization process in fire management, actively integrating UAVs into early detection systems, real-time fire line tracking and strategic decision-making.  Karacabey also emphasized that OGM\u2019s aerial fleet has been significantly strengthened. In 2024 alone, T\u00fcrkiye deployed 27 aircraft, 105 helicopters, 14 UAVs, 1,786 fire trucks, 2,742 first response vehicles and 831 heavy-duty machines in firefighting operations.  With increased use of technology and expansion of operational capacity, fires can now be detected at an early stage and contained rapidly. Karacabey said that the newly developed Fire Decision Support Systems analyze historical fire data, meteorological patterns and geographical factors to identify high-risk zones in advance.  He explained that artificial intelligence-supported systems further enhance firefighting operations by generating fire probability maps, risk analyses and fire behavior models, offering valuable insights to on-ground teams. \u201cThese technologies enable fire managers to make faster, data-driven and scientifically grounded decisions. As a result, the average initial response time to forest fires in T\u00fcrkiye is now just 11 minutes,\u201d he said.  Citing the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) reports, Karacabey stated that T\u00fcrkiye has the lowest ratio of burned forest area to total forest assets among Mediterranean countries. This success, he said, demonstrates the efficiency and resilience of T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s fire management system and the effectiveness of its preventive strategies.  Karacabey also highlighted that one of the critical components supporting this success is the fight against forest pests. He explained that OGM adopts entirely eco-friendly and sustainable methods, avoiding chemical interventions and prioritizing natural balance through biological control mechanisms.  \u201cAs of the end of October, 55 laboratories produced a total of 930,318 beneficial organisms, which were released into affected forest areas to naturally combat pests. Additionally, 14 anthill relocations were conducted, 20,415 birdhouses were installed, and biological, mechanical and biotechnical control methods were applied across 36,464 hectares,\u201d he said.  He added that these innovations have positioned T\u00fcrkiye among the world\u2019s top nations in forest fire management. \u201cWith its technological infrastructure, operational capacity, and skilled workforce, T\u00fcrkiye has become a model that many countries aspire to replicate,\u201d he said.  Looking ahead to the 2026 fire season, Karacabey announced plans to further expand T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s firefighting capacity by adding 165 new fire trucks, 38 heavy-duty machines, and 14 first response vehicles to the OGM\u2019s fleet. He detailed that 58 of the aircraft in use are leased from domestic and international sources, while 88 belong to the General Directorate, the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior.  Currently, OGM\u2019s inventory includes 35 aircraft, 9 helicopters (6 for management and three for firefighting), 14 planes (including 2 for management) and 12 UAVs.  Karacabey noted that T\u00fcrkiye had received 12 of the 20 Airtractor AT-802F amphibious firefighting aircraft ordered in 2023, each capable of carrying 3 tons of water, with the remaining eight aircraft scheduled for delivery by 2027.  He added that under an agreement with Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSA\u015e), the first delivery of eight domestically produced firefighting helicopters is planned for 2028. T\u00fcrkiye also continues to conduct international tenders for additional aircraft leasing to bolster its aerial firefighting capacity for the 2026 season.  Recalling that 3,797 forest fires occurred in T\u00fcrkiye last year, damaging 27,485 hectares of forest land, Karacabey said that as of Nov. 4 this year, 3,032 forest fires had affected 81,438 hectares.  He noted that recovery operations begin immediately after each fire, with field inspections, soil analysis and project planning launched without delay. Rehabilitation, regeneration and reforestation activities are implemented across all affected areas to ensure that burned lands are restored within the same year.  \u201cReforestation typically takes two to three years to complete. The General Directorate of Forestry continues these efforts tirelessly under the principle that every burned area will once again become a forest,\u201d Karacabey concluded.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58120003443</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H50-K6P3-RRHT-T4XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"944\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Daily Sabah</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>November 7, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000792O</classCode><className>DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SIC5045 COMPUTERS &amp;

According to a new study  The carbon emissions from fires in 2024 surpassed those from deforestation for the first time on record. Brazil was the largest contributor, accounting for 61% of these emissions, followed by Bolivia with 32%, the study found.  \u201cThe escalating fire occurrence, driven by climate change and unsustainable land use, threatens to push the Amazon towards a catastrophic tipping point,\u201d the authors write  The researchers estimated that the total emissions from deforestation and fire-driven degradation in the Amazon in 2024 was 1,416 million metric tons of CO2. This is higher  The 2023-24 Amazon drought was one of the most severe in recent history, fueled by the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which causes lower rainfall in the region. Water levels in the Amazon\u2019s main rivers, including the Solim\u00f5es, Negro and Madeira, dropped to their lowest in more than 120 years.  Human-driven climate change has in fact made the Amazon Rainforest nearly 30 times more prone to fire, the 2023-24 State of Wildfires report found.  However, most blazes in 2024 would have likely been started by humans engaging in arson. Ane Alencar, director of science at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, previously told Mongabay contributor Lucas Berti that in 2024, the dry, flammable forest became an opportunity for those wanting to deforest illegally.  According to the new study, fires affected 3.3 million hectares (8.2 million acres) of Amazon forest last year alone. The estimate is less than that of a Brazil-based government figure, which put the number at 6.7 million hectares  Facilitated by the large swaths of burned forest, deforestation in 2025 has also been rising after a historic drop of 31%  \u201cWith a worsening of climate change and the greater fragility of forest cover, including primary cover, we are beginning to see a shift,\u201d Jo\u00e3o Paulo Capobianco, executive secretary for Brazil\u2019s Environment Ministry, said in June 2025.  \u201cThe tropical forest, which is naturally immune to large fires due to its humidity, is suffering a huge impact from climate change, reducing its resistance to fires and becoming more vulnerable,\u201d he added.

Firefighters deployed 12 planes, 18 helicopters, and 900 personnel to battle the flames, as thousands more fled from nearby areas in subsequent blazes  On the Gallipoli peninsula, which borders the Dardanelles Strait, a wildfire blazed overnight, forcing more than 250 residents to evacuate. Turkish firemen were fighting to put out the fire on Sunday, according to officials.  The fire broke out on Saturday in the northwestern province of Canakkale and spread swiftly due to strong winds in the hills near the town of Gelibolu, on the beaches of the important maritime strait.  \u201cAs a precaution, 251 residents from five villages were relocated to safe areas,\u201d Canakkale governor Omer Toraman wrote on X.  STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD  The footage showed massive clouds of smoke pouring into the night air as the hillsides were lit by dazzling flames.  Toraman stated that the region, which is a popular vacation spot for tourists visiting the ancient remains of Troy and the Gallipoli battleground where thousands of troops perished in World War I, has experienced a \u201cextremely severe drought\u201d over the previous year.  While the weather has been generally average for this time of year, much of north-western Turkey was hit by severe winds in recent days, which eased off on Sunday.  Firefighters worked through the night, with 12 planes and 18 helicopters returning to the scene before dawn in a 900-person operation, the forestry directorate posted on X.  The authority in charge of the war memorials said on X that access to historical sites near the town of Eceabat had been closed \u201cdue to the ongoing forest fire\u201d.  On Monday, another fire on the other side of the strait forced 2,000 people to flee, with around 80 treated for smoke inhalation.  Several days earlier, another fire forced the evacuation of 120 people and the suspension of shipping through the Dardanelles Strait, which links the Mediterranean with the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea.  STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD  According to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) website, there have been 192 wildfires in Turkey this year, which have ravaged more than 110,373 hectares (273,000 acres) of land.  Experts say human-driven climate change is causing more frequent and more intense wildfires and other natural disasters, and have warned Turkey to take measures to tackle the problem.

The bans are in place in the Lanaudiere, Laurentides, Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie, Outaouais and Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue regions.  Quebec\u2019s forest fire protection agency first notified the the public about the bans on Friday, as 11 forest fires were underway.  Related Videos  0:39  Helicopter crews scoop up water to contain Minnesota wildfires  As of Saturday afternoon there were eight active fires in the province, including four in the Outaouais region. All were listed as being under control.  The forest fire protection agency says conditions since August have resulted in close to 80 fires since the beginning of this month, well above the average of 16 for the entire month of October.  It says nearly all of the fires ignited since the beginning of this month were caused by humans.  Anyone caught lighting campfires, barbecues or fireworks in the areas impacted by the ban could be fined.  This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 18, 2025.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57966110865</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H0S-YYY3-RRVJ-T0XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"226\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Global News Canada</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 18, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp;

Associate professor Serhun Sa\u011flam, a faculty member at Istanbul University-Cerrahpa\u015fa\u2019s Faculty of Forestry, provided detailed insights into the scale, risks and causes of forest fires in 2025, highlighting ongoing concerns and the importance of preventive measures.  According to Sa\u011flam, over the past decade, T\u00fcrkiye has experienced 28,000 forest fires and 29,500 rural fires, which together burned a total of 255,000 hectares. In 2025 alone, 6,800 fires were reported, with 2,800 occurring in forests and 4,000 in rural areas, resulting in approximately 80,000 hectares of burned land.  While the number of fires this year has already surpassed that of 2021, the year that holds the record for the largest area burned at 139,503 hectares, the total area burned in 2025 remains smaller, ranking it as the second-highest in the last decade. In comparison, 2024 saw 2,798 forest fires and 4,339 rural fires, which collectively burned a total of 28,107 hectares.  Sa\u011flam emphasized that, although October is only the 10th month of the year, the fire season is far from over and additional fires could further increase the total burned area. \u201cThese figures include not only forest fires but also rural fires that spread to forests, as well as forest fires that reached rural areas,\u201d he noted, underlining the interconnected nature of fires in rural and forested regions.  The risk of forest fires remains particularly high in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions until Oct. 15. In contrast, Istanbul and surrounding provinces have experienced cooler temperatures, which have reduced the likelihood of fire outbreaks. However, southern provinces continue to experience elevated temperatures, maintaining a high fire risk. \u201cThese numbers may rise further,\u201d Sa\u011flam said, stressing that the fire season is ongoing.  Meteorological conditions play a crucial role in the spread and containment of fires. Sa\u011flam explained that high daytime temperatures and strong winds can help fires start and spread quickly, whereas lower nighttime temperatures and calmer winds can aid firefighting efforts and prevent the rapid expansion of fires. He referred to recent events in K\u00f6yce\u011fiz, where 2,500 hectares burned, and in Antalya, where two separate fires occurred, as evidence that the threat remains real despite seasonal changes.  Sa\u011flam also detailed the causes of the 2025 fires. Approximately 50% of forest fires have unknown origins, making it unclear whether they were accidental, natural or intentional. Nevertheless, human negligence remains a leading factor. Carelessness, such as discarding cigarettes from vehicles, accidents near forest edges and mistakes during activities like beekeeping or using smudge sticks near forests, has led to numerous fires.  Additionally, sparks from agricultural machinery have caused several fires that spread from farmlands into forests. Farmers and residents often burn waste without considering the risk of the fire spreading into nearby forested areas. Energy transmission lines and lightning strikes have also contributed to the outbreaks. \u201cThis year, fires originating from agricultural lands and spreading to forests were particularly common,\u201d Sa\u011flam stated. He emphasized that human negligence remains the top issue in forest fire prevention, noting that many fires with unknown causes could be either intentional or accidental.  To mitigate the risks, Sa\u011flam stressed the importance of public awareness. He called for regular educational programs in schools and the inclusion of forest fire prevention in the curriculum to teach children and communities about the dangers and responsibilities associated with fire. \u201cSociety\u2019s awareness and vigilance are critical to reducing the number and severity of forest fires,\u201d he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57883471885</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GXK-SW63-RRRW-G2H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"694\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Daily Sabah</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 8, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Turkey</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Western Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001203</classCode><className>NEGLIGENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Used by Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic) for rapid response and access to remote terrain, the fleet has been grounded for the second time, despite Premier Allan warning this could be one of the most dangerous fire seasons in years.  Launched in 2017 under Labor\u2019s $32 million \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d upgrade, the vehicles were touted as world-class firefighting assets.  Now, all are parked up due to chassis and sub-frame faults, forcing CFA volunteers to fill the gap and stretching already overworked brigades.  Leader of The Nationals and Shadow Minister for Emergency Services, Danny O\u2019Brien, said it was extraordinary that the same government which boasted about the vehicles\u2019 cutting-edge design has now sidelined the entire fleet.  \u201cLabor promised Victorians a state-of-the-art firefighting fleet \u2013 eight years later \u2013 Labor has delivered a world-class failure,\u201d Mr O\u2019Brien said.  \u201cWhen the Premier warns of a dangerous fire season, Victorians deserve answers on how this failure was allowed to happen and what steps will be taken to ensure community safety.\u201d  Mr O\u2019Brien called on Premier Allan to reveal how many vehicles are affected and what contingencies are in place to protect communities.  \u201cVictorians are paying an additional $3 billion through Labor\u2019s new emergency services tax, yet the CFA is relying on ageing vehicles and is now being asked to cover for FFMV, an organisation now being funded by these additional taxes,\u201d he said.  Shadow Minister for Public Land Management, Melina Bath, slammed the Allan Labor Government for leaving regional Victoria dangerously exposed ahead of a high-risk fire season.  \u201cGrounding Victoria\u2019s frontline fleet weeks before fire season is an unacceptable failure, given nearly 40 per cent of the state is public land.  \u201cLabor\u2019s flawed bushfire policy \u2018Safer Together\u2019 has delivered just 1.6 per cent of land treated for fuel reduction annually since 2015 and the government  routinely fails to meet its own fuel-driven risk targets.  \u201cVictorians are paying more but getting less protection. Labor\u2019s failure to manage bushfire preparedness is putting lives at risk,\u201d said Ms Bath.  \u201cAt a time when we need every piece of equipment and personnel working to reduce risk, it is our CFA volunteers who are asked to carry the load with ageing equipment and limited resources.  \u201cLabor can\u2019t manage money or emergency services while Victorians pay the price.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57960199718</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H0N-P4M3-RW66-R4FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"478\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>SnowyRiverMail.com.au</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 18, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Lawmakers launch another study committee to solve the problem.  ATLANTA \u2014 Georgia\u2019s Department of Family and Children Services told a legislative study committee it is caring for about 500 kids \u2013 abandoned by their parents \u2013 who believed it was the only way to get them mental and behavioral healthcare.  Earlier this month, lawmakers on the House committee listened to about four hours of testimony from state agencies that work with these children. On Tuesday, they gathered once again to hear from advocates.  Three years ago, 11Alive News Investigates exposed this problem with its national award-winning series #Keeping. Lawmakers, led by the late House Speaker David Ralston, later passed HB1013 \u2013 the mental health parity act.  The legislation championed by Ralston passed unanimously in both the House and Senate. But even now, those in the mental health profession say the state lacks the workers and types of facilities needed to provide these children care.  Audrey Brannen, with DFCS, told lawmakers it was fighting a forest fire with a squirt bottle.  \u201cDFCS became so effective with that tiny squirt bottle that folks started saying we should be called to every single fire. In fact, it felt like we were the only ones that everyone thought could fight a fire with a squirt bottle,\u201d Brannen explained.  While DFCS may seem like the right option as a last resort, Brannen explained DFCS is designed to help abused and neglected children, not children with loving parents, in crisis.  \u201cI want this committee to understand that foster care is not a place. It\u2019s a legal custody status. When kids enter foster care from a hospital, they still need a place to go. If they could go to a foster home, they could go to their home with their families. And they can\u2019t. We don\u2019t have the place for them to go.\u201d  On Tuesday, lawmakers will hear from Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta. The hospital system has tried to build case management around kids repeatedly cycling through their emergency room.  The committee will also hear from several non-profits that have studied solutions to these problems and the Georgia Advocacy Office. The GAO is a federal watchdog group that works directly with families.  GAO advocate Joe Sarra helps families navigate the system. He says there are three large bureaucracies that impact whether these children receive care, but no one number to call. He calls it a fragmented and ineffective system.  The GAO has a class action lawsuit against the state for allegedly failing to meet the federally mandated needs of these children.   The GAO, along with several national organizations involved in the lawsuit, are seeking intensive case coordination, more residential treatment facilities and levels of care, an expansion of who is eligible for in-home services, and more mobile crisis units so workers can respond faster.  11Alive News Investigates year-long series, #Keeping, talked with parents about the barriers faced to getting care.  The children impacted are usually teenagers with a dual diagnosis. That means they have an intellectual or developmental disability -- and a significant mental health need.  Senior Investigator Rebecca Lindstrom spoke with families who had their children placed at facilities out of state or experienced a cycle of local admissions because Georgia doesn\u2019t have certain levels of care, enough step-down services, and limited access to in-home services.  DFCS told lawmakers it has since started a complex care tracking system and says one key tool missing in many of these cases is intensive case management to help parents coordinate and receive consistent care for their child.  Department of Community Health started a pilot program called MATCH to help do just that. They said one of the problems in accessing services is that there\u2019s no billing code \u2013 basically a way for case managers or doctors to get reimbursed for associated services.  Speakers also discussed workforce shortages and lack of specialized training to help those with a dual diagnosis, the need for respite care, and more family education to help parents continue the lessons learned while their child was in residential care.  They also testified that the state needs to hold health care systems accountable when they deny necessary coverage.  Lawmakers will hold one more meeting before deciding whether to present a plan on how to address some of these challenges in the 2026 legislative session.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57822067367</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GVX-69W3-RRPT-P243-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>11 Alive</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 30, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000289</classCode><className>CHILD WELFARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001291</classCode><className>PARENTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000286</classCode><className>CHILD CUSTODY &amp;

Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ) said the blaze has swelled in size and is now estimated to be covering about 1000ha.  Dozens of hikers have been evacuated from the park, and the public is asked to stay away from the area.  Loading Instagram content  Skotel Alpine Resort owner Sam Clarkson said the resort had a grandstand view of the fire on Saturday night.  \"It was like a hellscape \u2014 welcome to Mordor \u2014 it really was,\" he said.  \"Last night, there was quite a brisk westerly wind, which pushed the fire both east and northwards and the wall of flame was enormous \u2026 I would estimate some of those flames are 30 metres high.  \"It was hard to see across the flames to the far side, but any time we did, it was just this wall of orange that was at least 4 kilometres long. Everything the fire service was valiantly trying to throw at it was achieving nothing.\"  He said, fortunately, the fire was heading away from his resort, progressing up the Mangatepopo Road towards the Tongariro Crossing.  Spring bushfire outlook released  Parts of Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria will see increased fire risk this spring, as emergency services unveil their outlook for the season.  The wind had since dropped along with a blanket of fog on Sunday morning, but rain was not forecast until Monday, Mr Clarkson said.  \"I watched, literally weeping as the fire went closer and closer and closer to the hill, Pukeonake, which is a sensitive sub-alpine environment where the little communities of plant life all huddle together and live out their lives, and it just got toasted,\" he said.  \"It's just an ecological disaster. There is no risk to people or structures, unless the wind really got up.\"  Despite six weeks of rain, the fire has proven to be insatiable, he added.  \"The park was utterly saturated and then it fined up about a week ago, and I think we'd only had seven or eight days of fine weather in a row after a good six weeks of solid rain, so you would not think it's that tinder dry,\" Mr Clarkson said.  \"But the predominant species in the park, at least on the flats, is tea tree, and tea tree is the most flammable native plant there is \u2014 once it's off, it's away.\"  The community had rallied together in the face of the evacuation and closure of Tongariro National Park, he said.  On Saturday, 43 hikers and a warden from Mangatepopo Hut were airlifted out in response to the fire, according to the Department of Conservation (DOC).  \"In fact, we ended up putting up those people and feeding them \u2026 we were part of the effort to look after everybody,\" Mr Clarkson said.  On Sunday morning, a further nine hikers were evacuated from the national park, having left Waihohonu Hut, a DOC spokesperson said.  DOC said it expects there will be \"significant biodiversity impacts\", given the size of the fire.  'Pretty chill about it'  A local who runs a food truck in Waimarino, a township near Tongariro National Park, said locals were hopeful the fire would not be fanned by winds that had picked up slightly on Sunday.  Johnny Ryburn said he was down swimming at the Whakapapa River on Saturday when the blaze began.  \"It pretty much kicked off while I was out there,\" he said. \"It was pretty small when it started, and from what I know it started around the the road that takes you towards the Tongariro Crossing. From there it just got massive and went up the road and stuck towards the side of Tongariro.\"  Despite this, locals were not too worried, Mr Ryburn said.  \"Everybody's still pretty chill about it, you know? I think because it seems to be staying a lot closer to Tongariro and [Mount] Ngauruhoe people aren't super concerned,\" he said.  A number of helicopters with monsoon buckets and planes are fighting the blaze in Tongariro National Park. (RNZ: Hamish Cardwell)  Six fire trucks, five tankers, six helicopters and two planes  Firefighters from Taranaki and Manawat\u016b-Whanganui were briefed on Sunday morning before beginning work on the second day of operations.  Assistant Commander Nick West said the fire service will have six fire trucks and five tankers on the fireground, supported by six helicopters and two aeroplanes.  There are no reports of structures being damaged or destroyed and no residents were evacuated overnight.  Mr West said it could take a full day of operations to bring the fire under control.  An RNZ reporter on the scene said the southern line of the fire stretched from State Highway 47 a number of kilometres east into the scrub and young pine, but it was not clear whether the fire had reached the Tongariro crossing track itself.  The were huge flames in a couple of places in the line, and helicopters appeared to be concentrating on those areas.  The cause of the fire has not been established and a specialist wildfire investigator will be working on Sunday.  Weather outlook raises bushfire risk  An atmospheric \"tug of war\" for control of Australia's weather is taking place this spring, and it is a forecasting nightmare.  Residents in the area are being urged to stay alert to the fire, and keep doors and windows shut to minimise exposure to the smoke. Anyone who feels unsafe, or is vulnerable to smoke is encouraged to self-evacuate and stay with family or friends.  FENZ advises those to the north of the fire should go towards Turangi and those to the south of the fire should go towards National Park.  State Highway 47 Waimarino to Tongariro remains closed between the intersections with State Highway 48 and State Highway 46 with no detours available.  The Department of Conservation has closed the Tongariro Crossing and associated areas.  A no-fly zone is in place covering the airspace over the fireground and surrounding area, so that firefighting aircraft are not endangered by other aircraft or drones.

FFMVic Murray Goldfields District acting manager Andrew Koren said crews will be slashing a total of 2000 hectares across 700 locations in the coming weeks.  \u201cOne of the ways that we reduce bushfire risk in the lead up to summer is by managing long dry grass by slashing, which complements other activities such as planned burning, mulching and spraying,\u201d Mr Koren said.  Works will take place across Kyneton and Macedon.  \u201cGrass slashing works are carefully timed to align with the anticipated increase in grass growth; if it\u2019s done too early, it will encourage regrowth and require follow-up treatment,\u201d Mr Koren said.  \u201cIn the Murray-Goldfields District, we start this work in the north and move toward the south to align with the changing grass conditions.\u201d  FFMVic crews carry out fire preparedness work all year round to reduce the risk posed by bushfires and grassfires to our communities.  \u201cWe encourage residents to cut long grass, remove leaves and twigs from the yard and clear space around the house of all flammable materials,\u201d said Mr Koren.  Reducing fuels like grass, leaves, bark and fallen branches means a fire would be less intense and slower to spread. Less fuel for fire helps firefighters keep bushfires smaller and contained before they pose a risk to  people, communities and the environment.

Using this model, combined with global data on terrestrial plant carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios and gross primary productivity (GPP), the researchers estimated that the gross carbon consumed for nitrogen assimilation by global terrestrial plants amounts to 208 \u00b1 12 teragrams of carbon per year (Tg-C/yr). Notably, this figure surpasses the annual carbon emissions from forest fires and degradation (155 Tg-C/yr) and is comparable to the magnitude of forest carbon sequestration driven by atmospheric nitrogen deposition.  The study was published in Nature Geoscience on Oct. 6.  Plant uptake of soil nitrogen (N) and internal nitrogen assimilation both rely on carbon (C) fixed through photosynthesis. Biochemical studies have shown that the theoretical carbon costs for plant assimilation of nitrate, ammonium, and dissolved organic nitrogen average 5.81, 4.32, and 2.16 grams of carbon per gram of nitrogen (g-C/g-N), respectively.  Prior research has largely focused on the positive impacts of nitrogen on plant growth and carbon sequestration, while the metabolic carbon costs of plant nitrogen assimilation have not been thoroughly evaluated. This gap has long been a \"blind spot\" in terrestrial carbon cycle research. The new study highlights that this hidden carbon expenditure must be included in carbon balance accounting.  Climate warming is expected to boost soil nitrogen transformations, increasing the supply of bioavailable nitrogen\u2014especially inorganic forms like nitrate and ammonium. Additionally, it will raise plants' nitrogen demand due to accelerated growth. These changes may lead to a higher proportion of inorganic nitrogen being assimilated by plants and a corresponding increase in associated carbon consumption, thereby driving up the total carbon cost of plant nitrogen assimilation.  To test this hypothesis, the researchers simulated the contributions of different nitrogen sources under a 2.0 \u2103 warming scenario. By combining these simulations with corresponding data on plant C/N ratios and GPP, they projected that the total carbon consumed for nitrogen assimilation by global terrestrial plants under this warming scenario will reach 249 \u00b1 15 Tg-C/yr. This represents an average increase of 47% (41 \u00b1 19 Tg C) compared to the current level (208 \u00b1 12 Tg-C/yr). Regionally, the increases are 9% in tropical areas, 62% in temperate regions, and 105% in boreal zones.  Climate warming enhances the availability of soil inorganic nitrogen and its contribution to plant total nitrogen assimilation. However, it also increases the metabolic carbon expenditure related to plant nitrogen assimilation, offsetting a portion of the carbon gained through photosynthesis. This effect is particularly significant at high latitudes.  This study reveals new mechanisms of coupling between vegetation carbon-nitrogen cycling processes and their climate responses and feedbacks, providing new evidence for refined accounting of the global carbon balance and for formulating future carbon-neutral and climate-response strategies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57925304052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GYV-08Y3-SBVM-W2RM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"607\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Chinese Academy of Sciences</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 14, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Press Release</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0008YYT</classCode><className>GEOLOGY &amp;

W...</p><p>EN E-003490/2025 Answer given by Mr Hoekstra on behalf of the European Commission (3.11.2025) 1 1. Multiple peer-reviewed papers establish a strong link between climate change and the  increase in frequency, intensity, and destructiveness of forest fires. Warmer climates create  conditions more conducive to large and severe wildfires, such as drier vegetation, longer fire  seasons, increased fire weather (e.g. heat waves), and more dry fuel associated with higher  tree mortality. Other studies on recent increase in fire weather conditions found that Europe has experienced  2 a marked increase in the intensity of fire-prone weather conditions , and another found an  increase in the area affected by severe fire weather conditions, especially in central Europe  3 and the Mediterranean in spring and summer . For Spain, statistics collected by the European  4 Forest Fire Information System show a clear increasing trend for both the number of fires  and the area burnt since the measurements began in 2006. 2. Greenhouse gases spread globally affect the planet's climate universally (but differently  across the globe), regardless of their origin. Local emissions reductions are crucial as every  reduced tonne slows down global warming. However, more reductions in one region do not  mean stronger local effects. 3. The Commission is familiar with the concept of \u2018climate shelter\u2019, and there are some EU- 5 funded projects/initiatives supporting these spaces in different regions. However, the  Commission does not have a position nor criteria to classify a territory as such. 1  1. Burton, C., Lampe, S., Kelley, D.I. et al.

And a dry winter in regional Victoria throughout 2025 has presented forest fire management teams with opportunities for extra fuel load reduction burns.   But as Victorians brace for heightened fire risks this summer, particularly in western and south-western regions of the state, a growing chorus of ecologists and environmentalists is challenging the planned burns methodology.  Some say planned burns are causing more harm than good, with resources better directed to new technologies and a more bespoke approach to fuel reduction ahead of the fire season.   Country Fire Authority (CFA) assistant chief fire officer Brian Russell said conditions, particularly in South Gippsland, had been dry during winter and into spring.   He said while rain was on the way this spring, it was \"not going to make a big difference\".   \u201cThe fire danger is still there,\" Mr Russell said.   \"As soon as we get a bit of sun and a bit of wind, we will have those fire conditions again.\"  Some researchers say planned burns can do more harm than good. (ABC News: Cameron Best, file photo)  Peter Brick is a regional manager for Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic) in Gippsland.   He said autumn and winter presented opportunities to undertake extra fuel reduction in the state.   \"We were able to treat nearly 4,000 hectares of public lands across 81 different planned burns,\" he said.  \"They'll provide immediate benefit this summer to reduce the risk of bushfire to the community.\"   Other fuel reduction works conducted throughout winter include fuel break maintenance, roadside slashing, and track maintenance.   Mr Brick said planned burns had a role to play in reducing fire risk, particularly around houses and communities.   \"But we also burn further out across the landscape, and those larger landscapes really give firefighters a chance to get there, and keep fires small,\" he said.  'It isn't the simple fix'  Planned burns have been used in Victoria since the late 1930s to manage bushfire risk.  But it is a mode of fire fuel load management that some have been pushing back on.   Australian National University professor David Lindenmayer has published more than 1,442 scientific works, and is an expert in forest ecology and resource management.  He has questioned the practicality of using burns as a fuel reduction technique, and said there was evidence showing planned burning could increase fire risk instead of reducing it.  \"The evidence to support prescribed burning is actually remarkably thin,\" Professor Lindenmayer said.  He said the vigorous nature of regrowth after a fire created flammable material, whereas older forest material was less flammable, known as disturbance-stimulated flammability.  David Lindenmayer says embracing technology is the way forward. (ABC News: Alan Weedon)  He said while burns did work for a short window of time \u2014 about five years \u2014 the system could become more flammable for 40 to 50 years after.   \"It generally has limited effect under extreme fire weather conditions,\" he said.   \"It costs a lot of money and has limited effectiveness when we are most likely to lose houses under extreme fire weather.  \"The aim of the game is to reduce fire risk, but in some cases ... prescribed burning could be making it worse in the medium to long-term.\"  Professor Lindenmayer said turning to new technologies, such as firefighting drones which can quickly reach remote fires while they are small, could be a better way to mitigate fire risk.   \"You can do it within five to 10 minutes if you've got the right density of drones.\"  With more than 20 years experience monitoring forest ecosystems, ecologist Karl Just has conducted more than 1,000 fuel hazard assessments using Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA) and FFMVic methods.   \"Planned burning isn't the simple fix it's often made out to be,\" Mr Just said.   \"In most forests, fuels for two or three years before regrowth makes things worse. Fire actually triggers dense shrub growth that can last decades, meaning long-unburnt forests often end up with less fuel than those burned more frequently.\"   Mr Just said planned burning should remain part of future fuel reduction strategies, but would be better used near homes instead of in bushland.   A sign alerts visitors to a planned burn at Wilsons Promontory. (ABC News: Madeleine Stuchbery )  'We use science'   But authorities say Gippsland's fuel-driven bushfire risk is well within the target range, off the back of opportunities to carry out risk reduction works through 2023-24.   FFMVic chief fire officer Chris Hardman said their bushfire risk management program was underpinned by a significant body of evidence and the department continued to invest in research and the best science.   \"We use science and modelling tools to choose the right time and approach to deliver our bushfire risk management program, including planned burns, mowing, slashing and spraying,\" he said.   \"We know from both research and practical experience that fuel management slows the spread of fire, and helps firefighters reduce threats to communities, critical infrastructure and the environment.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57972622803</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H11-3T93-S879-T210-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"915\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ABC Online</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 19, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000834W</classCode><className>BEST INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC5999 MISCELLANEOUS RETAIL STORES, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>BEST (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DT12</classCode><className>TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DTIO</classCode><className>FIRE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSY2</classCode><className>DISASTER RISK REDUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DT1H</classCode><className>NATURAL SCIENCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp;

Yarman said that the forest fire was successfully controlled after two days of struggle by joint officers. The fire points were in the Rangga Pande Forest area, Sembalun Lawang Village or the area within the Mount Rinjani National Park conservation area.  Yarman mentioned that joint personnel from the TNGR Office, Dalkarhutla Jabalnusra, local police and TNI members, as well as the Fire Care Society, had to face steep topography, strong winds, and easily flammable dry vegetation. \"The efforts began since Saturday morning, tracing the fire points, extinguishing the fire, until ensuring the area was safe again,\" he said.  The fire point in Rangga Gede Forest was discovered last Friday after a previous fire occurred in another location, Gelogor Paok, Sembalun Lawang Village, on Thursday. In this location, the fire burned an area of 10 hectares. \"The fire that occurred was a surface fire, which burned bushes, grass, shrubs, and dry foliage,\" said Yarman.  He explained that the personnel at the Sembalun Resort initially received information from the public about a forest fire in the SPTN II TNGR area. The officers then confirmed it through remote monitoring.  Meanwhile, the actual location of the fire caused vegetation such as tree ferns, mountain cypress, acacia, and acacia decurrens to become fuel for the fire. \"As a result, the fire quickly spread, especially due to fairly strong winds and steep terrain,\" he said, urging the public or tourists to increase vigilance and prohibiting burning in the forest area.

In  particular, by way of example, Greece still  relies on a fire risk map established in  1980 and Portugal\u2019s assessments are  based on historical data from 1975\u20132018.  It is to be stressed therefore that there is a  need for clear, harmonised, and regularly  updated indicators and reporting  obligations to ensure the effective use of  EU funds and to enhance the Union\u2019s  capacity to prevent and respond to forest  fires. It is considered that effective  implementation of this Regulation would  address those shortcomings by providing a  common EU framework for data  collection, monitoring and reporting,  ensuring that investments, as well as  forest fire prevention and reaction  measures, are guided by accurate and  comparable information across all  Member States. _________________ 1a  Special report 16/2025: EU funding to  tackle forest fires AM\\P10_AMA(2025)0176(001-001)_EN.docx PE778.767v01-00 EN United in diversity EN Or. en AM\\P10_AMA(2025)0176(001-001)_EN.docx PE778.767v01-00 EN United in diversity EN</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57954534716</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H0H-1WV3-RSPR-P351-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"324\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>European Parliament</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 17, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Reports</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Belgium</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Western Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF3C</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION REGULATION &amp;

The ministry says 643 wildfires were recorded between April and October, with 597,654 hectares   or just over 5,976 square kilometres   burned.  The province says 480 fires burned nearly 900 square kilometres in 2024 and the 10-year average for Ontario is 712 fires and about 2,100 square kilometres burned.  Figures released by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre in August showed that Canada\u2019s 2025 wildfire season was the second-worst on record.  1:39  Fire bans continue across eastern Ontario  Those figures suggested the fires tore through 72,000 square kilometres, an area roughly the size of New Brunswick.  Scientists say that climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, has made Canada\u2019s fire seasons longer and more intense.  The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources says although the 2025 wildfire season had \u201can early active start,\u201d co-ordinated efforts of front-line staff, municipalities, Indigenous communities and firefighting crews ensured a quick response.  Ontario also sent fire crews to help battle wildfires in other provinces.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58089065614</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H46-5P73-S8T3-V283-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"252\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Global News Canada</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"11\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>November 3, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST000DSGI</classCode><className>FOSSIL FUELS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS170</classCode><className>NEW BRUNSWICK, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to official records obtained by Dunya News, a total of 268 forest fire incidents were reported in Punjab over the last three years, affecting 6,117 acres of forest land. Nationwide, 479 incidents of forest fires were recorded, damaging nearly 15,497 acres in total\u2014of which Punjab accounted for about 40 percent.  The data reveals that 2024 proved to be the worst year for forest fires in recent history. In 2023, Punjab reported only four incidents, burning 25 acres. However, the situation worsened dramatically in 2024, when 165 fire incidents destroyed 3,363 acres of forest. In 2025 so far, 97 incidents have been recorded, ravaging another 2,729 acres.  In Balochistan, two incidents in 2024 burned 590 acres, while 14 incidents this year have destroyed 4,629 acres. Sindh recorded five incidents in total, affecting 63 acres. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 60 fire incidents in 2024 turned 1,235 acres to ash, though no fires have been reported in 2025. Islamabad witnessed 17 incidents in 2024 and 31 so far this year, affecting 336 acres collectively.  Experts attribute the rising frequency of wildfires to climate change, illegal logging, negligence, and prolonged dry weather. The Forest Department has recommended awareness campaigns, technological monitoring, and restoration of fire lines to prevent future disasters. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58119705065</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H50-DH23-RTD2-G3DF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"296\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Dunya News</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>November 7, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Pakistan</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009F75</classCode><className>ILLEGAL LOGGING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009F75</classCode><className>ILLEGAL LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX248</classCode><className>ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>GC309</classCode><className>PAKISTAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GT113</classCode><className>ASIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to Tian Gangyin, chairman of United Aircraft Group, the T1400 has a maximum takeoff weight of 1,400 kg, marking a significant advance in both payload capacity and durability, overcoming long-standing limitations in industrial drones.  The twin-rotor T1400, resembling the U.S. Army's Boeing Chinook CH-47, is powered by two 130-kilowatt engines, allowing it to stay airborne for up to eight hours and cover over 900 km, the South China Morning Post reported.  The helicopter\u2019s service ceiling reaches 6,500 meters, and it can withstand extreme temperature ranges from -40\u00b0C to 55\u00b0C. It can also operate in winds up to Beaufort level 6 during take-off and level 8 while in flight, making it suitable for harsh environments.  Targeting Heilongjiang\u2019s vast agricultural, forestry, and waterway areas, it has potential applications in agriculture, cargo transport, emergency rescue, and forest fire prevention. Tian emphasized that the helicopter will see widespread deployment across China in the future.  The low-altitude economy (LAE) in China has gained significant momentum since being highlighted as a new growth driver in the 2024 government work report. According to forecasts from the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the LAE market is expected to reach 1.5 trillion yuan (approximately $211.6 billion) by 2025 and grow to 3.5 trillion yuan by 2035.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58117934720</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H4Y-KJF3-S6KG-F43X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"321\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>VN Express International</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>November 7, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic) and the Department of Environment, Energy, and Climate Action (DEECA) have grounded their fleet of 290 Mercedes-Benz G-Wagons and 59 Unimogs due to safety concerns.  The vehicles, critical for rapid response and navigating remote terrain, were part of a $32 million government investment made in 2017 to strengthen the state's firefighting capacity.  Brigades became aware of the mechanical and safety issues late last week, followed by a decision to take the vehicles off the roads.  It comes just 24 hours after Premier Jacinta Allan issued a warning about the likelihood of an upcoming dangerous and active fire season.  With summer approaching, emergency authorities have scrambled to implement contingency plans, including the possibility of relying more heavily on CFA crews, a move some fear will stretch already under-resourced brigades.  Fire Forest Management fleet vehicles are important for managing remote terrain. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)  Brigades under pressure  Erica and District CFA Fire Brigade captain Russell Wright said the situation could place increased pressure on local brigades across Victoria.   \"Our tanker is 42 years old, and we're supported by other fire brigades, so that also puts pressure on them to support us [while] we're supporting DEECA,\" Mr Wright said.  Mr Wright said FFMVic and DEECA vehicles had crush protection systems installed, whereas CFA trucks did not, creating risks to workers.  \"So there's an increased awareness around volunteers to be extra careful when we're working out in the forest on crown management land,\" he said.  But he said there was much about the situation that remained unclear.  \"For regional and remote brigades that interface with the forest and the fire landscape out during summer, the concerns are how this will impact us and how long is it going to last?\" he said.  \"Are we talking a few weeks, a few months, a year? And when will it be resolved?\"  Mr Wright said the situation would be difficult for DEECA crews.  \"It's not easy when you've got equipment failures, but for us as CFA, it's really business as usual,\" he said.  \"We are there for the community to provide a service, and that's what we will do; there's plenty of backup systems in place.  Union raises concerns  Australian Workers Union (AWU) Victorian representative Ross Kenna said the union had \"vast concerns\" when the G-wagons were purchased several years ago.  The AWU represents FFMVic firefighters and is in the process of negotiating a new enterprise agreement with the organisation.  \"Late September, we had custom reports. Through that, there were cracks found in the chassis of some of the G-wagons in the firefighting fleet,\" Mr Kenna said.  \"From that period on, there's been inspections of the vast majority of the fleet.\"  Russell Wright said CFA staff are used to dealing with failing equipment. (Supplied: CFA)  Demands for urgent action  Nationals leader and emergency services spokesperson Danny O'Brien told ABC Statewide Mornings the government needed to act as quickly as possible.  \"I'm not aware of the operational limits that this places on those vehicles, but certainly these are the vehicles that we have that go into the bush, that are supporting our seasonal firefighters and making sure that we're getting on top of fires early,\" he said.  \"And to have them taken offline at this time of year is a real concern.\"  Mr O'Brien said it was \"unacceptable\" for fire brigades to be left on stand-by for tanker and water supply.  \"We shouldn't be relying on them for back-up on crown land jobs when we're spending a hell lot of money and we're all copping a $3 billion tax hit on the new emergency services tax in part to fund Forest Fire Management Victoria, which is being funded under this arrangement,\" he said.  \"And at the same time, we're seeing cuts to the CFA budget; it's simply not fair.\"  A Victorian government spokesperson said it would be fast-tracking repairs to the grounded fleet.  \"FFMVic has brought online additional vehicles to continue undertaking critical bushfire season preparations and respond to bushfire emergencies,\" the spokesperson said.  \"These repairs are being fast-tracked over the next two months and FFMVic is working on agreements to secure additional emergency response vehicles from other states if required.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57889038526</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GXS-M133-S01D-P41C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"798\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ABC Online</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 9, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N813930MM</classCode><className>LABOR UNIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

The Commission and Member States share the management of the EAFRD and the ERDF.  The managing authorities of the funding programmes in Member States are responsible for  the selection and monitoring of the projects, in line with the programmes approved. 1 For the period 2014-2020, the EAFRD co-financed more than EUR 238 million for  prevention of fires and natural disasters within the Rural Development Programme of  2 Galicia . In addition, there are two interventions planned in Galicia with more than EUR 83  3 4 million under the 2021-2027 Common Agricultural Policy Strategic Plan . The current  implementation rates of these two interventions are of 20.23% and 7.97% respectively. 5 The ERDF programme of Galicia financed in the 2014-2020 period three operations related  6 to fires, with an EU contribution of more than EUR 44 million. For the 2021-2027 period ,  EUR 15.6 million are planned for similar measures, with EUR 2.3 million already allocated to  fire preventive actions. Implementation has started for both funds and the Commission is closely monitoring  progress. 7 Finally, the RRF funded the acquisition in Galicia of 13 special purpose vehicles for  firefighting alongside investments in sustainable forest management to combat forest fires.  1  Total public expenditure. 2  <url normalizedValue=\"https://pdr-mediorural.xunta.gal/gl/pdr/o-programa\">https://pdr-mediorural.xunta.gal/gl/pdr/o-programa</url>.  3  Total public expenditure. 4  <url normalizedValue=\"https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/cap-my-country/cap-strategic-plans/spain_en\">https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/cap-my-country/cap-strategic-plans/spain_en</url>. 5  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.conselleriadefacenda.gal/areas-tematicas/planificacion-e-fondos/periodo-comunitario-2014-\">https://www.conselleriadefacenda.gal/areas-tematicas/planificacion-e-fondos/periodo-comunitario-2014-</url> 2020/programas-operativos-2014-2020/po-feder-galicia-2014-2020/programa-operativo-feder-galicia-2014- 2020. 6 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.conselleriadefacenda.gal/es_ES/areas-tematicas/planificacion-e-fondos/periodo-comunitario-\">https://www.conselleriadefacenda.gal/es_ES/areas-tematicas/planificacion-e-fondos/periodo-comunitario-</url> 2021-2027/programas-2021-2027/programa-feder-2021-2027. 7  Under component 4 of the Spanish Recovery and Resilience Plan.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57811817277</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GVN-CTF3-RRRC-53M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"423\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>European Parliament</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 29, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Reports</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Reliance Global Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Belgium</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Western Europe</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>00723</className><className>HKG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: BMG8598B1413</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008WWJ</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY REGULATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00095A9</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE REGULATION &amp;

The AWU's review of Victorian Public Service data found women employed as forest firefighters by the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA) received pay increases averaging $3,781 between 2019 and 2023, compared to $8,036 for men.  The AWU said it meant female firefighters missed out on an average of $4,255 in pay growth over the four-year period.  The union also said the gender pay gap for Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMV) and DEECA field staff nearly tripled, increasing from 3.4 per cent to 9.5 per cent in the same period.   In 2023, the median salary for female forest firefighters was $58,787, while the median for men was $64,966 \u2014 a difference of $6,179.  \"DEECA don't discriminate in what men and women can do in the forest firefighter role,\" AWU regional organiser Shanae Murray said.  \"They just won't pay equally.\"  DEECA forest firefighters help protect Victoria's public land by responding to bushfires, conducting planned burns, and managing forest fuel loads to reduce fire risk across state forests and national parks.  The department said the increase in the gender pay gap was linked to an increase in women joining its frontline firefighting teams at entry-level roles in recent years.  \"Our analysis shows there is no gender pay difference in wages across comparable roles in FFMVic,\" a DEECA spokesperson said.    It said programs were also in place to help remove barriers and support women to progress into senior positions, to narrow the pay gap over time.  Women and men from Forest Fire Management Victoria worked on containing the Halls Gap fire earlier this year.  (Supplied: Horsham Incident Control Centre)  Calls to address inequality   The AWU has called on DEECA to address what it says is a growing inequality in pay between male and female firefighters.  Ms Murray said the pay disparity was \"disappointing\".  \"For example, with the Halls Gap fires last year, DEECA made up a large number of people fighting those blazes,\" she said.   \"There were women and men who weren't home with their families for Christmas and school holidays; they were out fighting fires, working in the heat and dangerous conditions.\"  DEECA said the proportion of women in its seasonal firefighting teams had more than doubled over the past decade \u2014 from 15 per cent in 2015 to 33 per cent in 2025.   It said the number of women taking part in fire deployments was also rising, with women making up 33 per cent of those deployed in 2024\u201325, up from 29 per cent in 2021\u201322.  The median salary for female forest firefighters in 2023 was $58,787 (Supplied: FFMV)  Victorian Treasurer Jaclyn Symes said the government was always looking to fix gender pay gaps.  \"(DEECA) is currently in negotiations for the next EBA, so there'll be a range of issues that will be considered in relation to pay and allowances,\" Ms Symes said.   \"I'm sure it can be addressed through the EBA discussions.\"  Gender Equity Victoria CEO Micaela Drieberg said the pay difference was concerning.  \"It's surprising, given the concerted effort to address gender pay gaps across multiple professions, to see it go backward for female forest firefighters,\" Ms Drieberg said.    \"There needs to be a targeted response to be supportive of the needs of women.   \"That might include more women in leadership positions and also offering more flexibility to both men and women.\"   Ms Drieberg said the first female firefighters started their careers in Victoria in 1988.  \"That wasn't so long ago. The industry hasn't adjusted to be able to support the women in their workforce,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58060178075</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H3B-M653-SJ6Y-03BR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"669\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ABC Online</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 30, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000CRWX</classCode><className>EQUAL PAY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00097Z3</classCode><className>GENDER &amp;

There was no report of casualties or structural damage yet. However, operations have been carried out to evacuate tampers in the national park and people in the nearby facilities. The fire has not been controlled yet.  New Zealand Fire and Emergency Assistant Commander Craig Gold said air operations were prioritised to fight the fire, with additional aircraft being used. Five fixed-wing planes and 12 helicopters are being deployed. In the meantime, four teams of firefighters are fighting on the ground with additional crews supporting the aircraft operations, Xinhua news agency reported.  The forest fire was reported to the Fire and Emergency New Zealand on Saturday afternoon, initially covering 50 hectares. Fire brigades and three helicopters were deployed to fight the fire.  Due to the terrain and extent of the fire, overnight operation was deemed too dangerous for active firefighting, and aircraft were all stood down at nightfall on Saturday.  Established in 1887, Tongariro National Park is New Zealand's first national park. It has an area of around 80,000 hectares. The park is a dual UNESCO World Heritage for both its cultural significance to M\u0101ori as well as its outstanding natural features.  The Tongariro Crossing and associated areas, which are a world-famous tourist attraction, are now closed due to the fire. A section of State Highway 47 leading to the national park is closed. A no-fly zone is in place covering the airspace over the fireground and surrounding area, so that firefighting aircraft are not endangered by other aircraft or drones.  The cause of the fire has not been established yet.  In 1993, Tongariro became the first property to be inscribed on the World Heritage List under the revised criteria describing cultural landscapes, according to the UNESCO website. The mountains at the heart of the park have cultural and religious significance for the Maori people and symbolise the spiritual links between this community and its environment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58133425805</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H5D-VJ33-RWG4-H3YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"399\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ProKerala.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"11\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>November 9, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>First National Corp</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>FXNC</className><className>NAS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp;
