Its cause was not immediately clear.</p><p>Ximo Puig, the president of the Valencia region that incorporates Castellon, told reporters the fire was \u201cvery early in the spring, very voracious from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Puig added that the effects of climate change \u201care undeniable, so the perspective of firefighting must be considered on an annual basis.\u201d</p><p>Emergency services in the region said eight villages had been evacuated, as well as a home for older people in Montan.</p><p>As of Friday afternoon, 18 water-dropping planes and helicopters and more than 500 firefighters and soldiers were tackling the fire. The Spanish military and the nation's ecological transition ministry deployed additional support to try to bring the blaze under control.</p><p>The state weather agency, AEMET, tweeted that \u201cunfavorable weather conditions, especially considering the early date of the year, have favored the (fire's) rapid spread.\" Temperatures were above 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit) when the fire broke out, and relative humidity sank below 30% following an unusually dry winter in the area. </p><p>The risk of more fires in Castellon was classified as \u201cextreme\" on Friday.</p><p>Miguel Sandalinas, the mayor of one of the villages affected, said that fallen trees left over from winter and the general lack of care for dried vegetation had given the fire \u201ca lot of ammunition.\u201d</p><p>In 2022, wildfires burned through 306,555 hectares of land in Spain, an area almost four times the size of New York City, according to European Union data. Last year was also Spain's hottest since records began.</p><p>Despite extensive planning, early warning surveillance and prediction models, preparing for wildfires remains a huge challenge. </p><p>Spain officially entered a period of long-term drought at the end of last year, owing to high temperatures and low rainfall over the past three years.</p><p>Spain has warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the 1960s, a warming that is noticeable all year round but especially in summer, when average temperatures have risen by 1.6 degrees.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a319e73fa686fd1aeda71417f13e2fef</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67VG-PJ31-DY9S-T22Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><timeReceived>11:17 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 24, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

All MPs except the Conservatives voted in favour. </p><p>\u201cWe have a right to know if Suncor is going to be a good corporate citizen at this time of climate crisis,\u201d Angus told Canada\u2019s National Observer in a phone interview on Sept. 18. </p><p>Suncor did not respond to Canada\u2019s National Observer\u2019s request for comment by publication time. </p><p>\u201cSuncor hits up the Canadian government all the time in meetings and backroom meetings. They hit us up for huge tax credits and incentives to do the work that I think they should be doing,\u201d said Angus. He says the least Kruger should do is be willing to come and explain his vision for the company and fossil fuel burning and how he sees Suncor and other oil companies playing a part in addressing the climate crisis. </p><p>Conservative MP Shannon Stubbs said in general, they support Canadian energy company executives appearing to inform committee members \u201cwho sometimes seem woefully uninformed\u201d that Suncor and other energy companies have driven the development of renewables and alternative fuels. Nonetheless, she voted against the motion asking Kruger to speak. </p><p>Another Conservative committee member, Alberta MP Earl Dreeshen, said it's misguided to \u201cpoke the finger at one of Canada\u2019s largest employers\u201d when \u201cforestry issues\u201d and the global energy situation are also in play. </p><p>Angus said this is a public interest issue because oil and gas companies are looking to the Canadian government and Canadian taxpayers to subsidize carbon capture technology. </p><p>\u201cTalking about the urgency of making more money at a time when people were being burned out of their homes\u201d on the August investor call demonstrated \u201ccomplete indifference or disconnect,\u201d said Angus. </p><p>Suncor is far from the only oil and gas company failing to walk the talk on climate change. Earlier this year, BP swapped out its pledge to cut emissions 35 to 40 per cent by 2030 for a less ambitious promise of a 20 to 30 per cent reduction and Shell will not be increasing spending for renewables this year. </p><p>The fossil fuel industry has a well-documented history of denying the existence of climate change and delaying climate action. California is currently suing five major oil companies and the American Petroleum Institute (the U.S.\u2019s largest oil and gas lobby group) over the sector\u2019s decades-long efforts to delay climate action. The lawsuit seeks compensation for damages caused by extreme weather events \u2014 like wildfires, droughts and extreme heat \u2014 made more frequent or intense by climate change. </p><p>This has been Canada\u2019s worst wildfire year on record. As of Sept. 15, more than 17.6 million hectares of land have been burned and more than half of the 923 active fires were classified as \u201cout of control,\u201d according to data published by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. </p><p>So far, nearly 200,000 people have been forced to evacuate during the 2023 fire season, Reuters reported in mid-August. Indigenous communities were disproportionately impacted by the wildfires, with over 90 First Nations evacuated since May, more than the previous four fire seasons combined, data analysis by Canada\u2019s National Observer revealed. </p><p>While Canadians choked on smoke and fled their homes, oilsands companies continued to record handsome profits, according to Pembina Institute\u2019s Sept. 14 update on industry profits and investments in emission reductions. </p><p>The Pembina Institute\u2019s 2023 mid-year update shows oilsands companies \u2014 Canadian Natural Resources, Suncor, Imperial Oil, Cenovus and MEG Energy \u2014 are on track to record their second-highest profits, just behind what they raked in in 2022. The Pembina Institute says there have been no new investments in reducing oilsands emissions since its last update was put out six months ago. </p><p>The oil and gas industry is consistently the country\u2019s highest-emitting economic sector, responsible for 28 per cent of national emissions in 2021, according to Canada\u2019s annual inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p>Suncor tripled its profits in a single year and announced it will lay off 1,500 workers this year, the motion points out. </p><p>Angus told Canada\u2019s National Observer he expects Kruger \u201cwill take us up on the offer\u201d to testify before the committee. </p><p>\u201cIf Mr. Kruger is not interested in coming to speak to parliamentarians, I would be willing to call for a subpoena,\u201d said Angus, referring to the committee\u2019s ability to issue a summons for witnesses who decline an invitation. </p><p>\u201cThe Canadian public is living with huge levels of climate uncertainty, climate fear, and they need to know that everybody \u2014 from corporations to public figures to politicians \u2014 everybody is taking this seriously,\u201d said Angus.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-3db76a96712c4005860d3f529ea02377</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:696W-FN91-DY9S-T13V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"913\"/><timeReceived>10:54 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 19, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The internal combustion engine was seen as an almost miraculously positive gift to economic growth and well-being.</p><p>The same was true for coal-fired electricity generation. The impact of airborne particles spewed high into the atmosphere from massive smokestacks was just beginning to be recognized.</p><p>Then the picture changed.</p><p>By the 1960s, air pollution from vehicles was a growing concern. Lung tissue damage and increases in respiratory diseases were being identified.</p><p>In the 1980s \"acid rain\" was recognized as the menacing byproduct of coal-fired electricity. Sulphuric and nitric acid falling from the sky was killing Ontario's lakes, leaving them scrubbed of vegetation, fish and other wildlife.</p><p>Polluted yellow skies were smoggy, and \"smog days\" became a thing.</p><p>In each case, governments acted to contain the danger. In the '50s the City of Toronto and the provincial government began regulating emissions, something not previously considered.</p><p>In 1970 the U.S. government passed the first Clean Air Act, regulating vehicle emissions. Canada followed along, and controls have been tightening ever since.</p><p>In March 1991 the Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement was signed to combat emissions from electricity plants and other heavy industries. At that time, more than half the airborne pollution affecting Ontario floated up on air currents from the U.S. northeast.</p><p>Twenty years ago, the Ontario government went beyond regulation, adopting a policy of shutting down all coal-fired generating plants.

Sometimes they are very easy to trace \u2014 when you have lightning storms, it\u2019s easy to trace.

The internal combustion engine was seen as an almost miraculously positive gift to economic growth. The same was true for coal-fired electricity generation. The impact of airborne particles spewed high into the atmosphere from massive smokestacks was just beginning to be recognized.<br/><br/> Then the picture changed. <br/><br/> By the 1960s, air pollution from vehicles was a growing concern. Lung tissue damage and increases in respiratory diseases were being identified.<br/><br/> In the 1980s, \"acid rain\" was recognized as the menacing byproduct of coal-fired electricity. Sulphuric and nitric acid falling from the sky was killing Ontario's lakes, leaving them scrubbed of vegetation, fish and other wildlife. Polluted yellow skies were smoggy and \"smog days\" became a thing. <br/><br/> In each case, governments acted to contain the danger. In the 1950s, the City of Toronto and the provincial government began regulating emissions, something not previously considered.<br/><br/> In 1970 the U.S. government passed the first Clean Air Act, regulating vehicle emissions. Canada followed along, and controls have been tightening ever since.<br/><br/> In  1991 the Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement was signed to combat emissions from electricity plants and other heavy industries. At that time, more than half the airborne pollution affecting Ontario floated up  from the U.S. northeast.<br/><br/> Twenty years ago, the Ontario government went beyond regulation, adopting a policy of shutting down all coal-fired generating plants. The first one closed in 2005, the last in 2014.<br/><br/> Those measures worked.<br/><br/> Acid rain is largely a thing of the past in Ontario. The dead lakes recovered, and trees began to grow again around Sudbury, the smelting capital of Canada and former epicentre of atmospheric sulphuric acid production. <br/><br/> Smog days also become nearly extinct, although it took time. <br/><br/> In 2005 Ontario had 53 smog days, when air quality was deemed poor enough to be a health hazard. <br/><br/> Peterborough was particularly hard hit by air pollution. Prevailing winds brought heavy pollution loads here, and the unfortunate geography of the Otonabee River valley surrounded by a range of low hills made it common for them to hang over the city, trapped and capped by a temperature inversion.<br/><br/> It was not uncommon for local air quality to be the worst, or among the worst, in the province.<br/><br/> In 2014, thanks largely to that bilateral regulatory agreement and end of Ontario's coal-fired plants, there were none.<br/><br/> All that history makes it clear: massive air pollution threats can be contained, even largely eliminated. <br/><br/> The forest fire effect now being felt is not in itself as overwhelming - not the result of daily, deliberate production of pollutants for what was thought to be progress and the good of society.<br/><br/> But neither is it as easy to solve. Hot weather, high winds and unchecked forest fires are a byproduct of climate change, the most dangerous threat yet.<br/><br/> Climate change is being slowed, although not quickly enough. <br/><br/> The past 70 years have shown that large-scale threats to the planet and our co-dependent existence with it can be turned back.<br/><br/> If anyone needed it, a return of the bad old days when the air we breathe becomes a threat is more piece of evidence that the fight is a long way from over. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2023061068144438</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68F4-HNF1-JDV5-F4YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"606\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 10, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Business &amp;

Some do. Some do. But a lot of times the workers are forgotten.\u201d</p><p>The think tank meetings in Quesnel were, by their nature, aimed at disruption and innovation of old forestry practices. Bains said these were exciting conversations built on solid ideas, but innovation must always have lines drawn closely to the worker, in the policy development that must go along with developments in timber harvesting, forest regrowth, and new uses for wood. These innovations would trigger new training, re-train-ing, new hardware, company investment decisions, and necessary consultation with First Nations. He outlined how government was already involved in those shifts, and would be there for the next steps not yet taken.</p><p>For example, he said, sometime at the end of 2023 or early 2024 would be the next labour relations review for B.C. \u201cI expect all of you to participate in that review, because the forestry workplace is changing, the laws governing that work have to keep up. We must modernize the relationship between employers and workers.\u201d</p><p>Safety was always his first priority, he said. Not only would that ensure the people who go to work at the start of shift also went home to their families at the end of shift, but if companies and governments kept their own focus on the safety of the individual worker, other factors would organically extend from that in corporate and governance decisions.

In the '50s the City of Toronto and the provincial government began regulating emissions, something not previously considered.<br/><br/> In 1970 the U.S. government passed the first Clean Air Act, regulating vehicle emissions. Canada followed along, and controls have been tightening ever since.<br/><br/> In March 1991 the Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement was signed to combat emissions from electricity plants and other heavy industries. At that time, more than half the airborne pollution affecting Ontario floated up on air currents from the U.S. northeast.<br/><br/> Twenty years ago, the Ontario government went beyond regulation, adopting a policy of shutting down all coal-fired generating plants.

Park Hill is next and then Coyote Park, although neither of these latter two parks is slated to be logged as much as Little Mountain Park.</p><p>All of this logging is supposed to make us safer from forest fires. Yet in 1998, when a forest fire was on our very doorstep and firefighting crews were working to create fire guards along the base of Mount Ida, no one said, \u201cIf only we had logged our woodland parks, our homes would be safe now.\u201d</p><p>Of course not. The true danger from fire is in the foothills surrounding our city, not in our parks.</p><p>The city\u2019s own Community Energy and Emissions Plan states that \u201cCommunity planning which preserves the surrounding natural environment can have significant health and well-being impacts.\u201d</p><p>Surely preserving the beauty, serenity, peace and privacy of places for our citizens to walk in nature is more important than the very limited benefit such a moon-scaping of our environment would have in preventing or mitigating a forest fire.</p><p>Another concern is the decision to do this logging appears to have been made without any consultation with park user. Such a radical change to our parks should never have been undertaken without extensive public consultation. The city asks for input when other public facilities are being changed. Widespread input was solicited on the planned upgrading of the aquatic centre. The future of Lakeshore Road even warranted a public survey.</p><p>Why weren\u2019t park users consulted? Consultation could have been done by posting signs at park entrances; putting a notice in the newspaper; or doing an online survey. Even something as simple as a heads-up phone call to the naturalist club would have been helpful. Ideally, consultation needs to be done at the very beginning of the planning process-not after city staff have spent hours producing (and committing to) a plan of action.</p><p>Better late than never though. I ask that the city do this consultation work now.</p><p>Find out whether our citizens truly want this logging. A good start would be to attend a meeting on this issue being held at 2:30 p.m. on May 20 at the Field of Dreams entry to Little Mountain Park. Everyone is welcome.</p><p>Sandra J.

(QNI or the Company) reports the completion of its 2023 exploration programs at its 100% owned Ducros Property, located 85 kilometers northeast of Val-dOr, Qubec.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Summary of 2023 Work Programs &amp;Results: //st * Drilling of almost 18,000 metres in 50 holes across the Ducros Property * Scoping-level metallurgical study of Fortin Sill Zone Ni-Cu-PGE sulphides * Discovery of multiple large Ni-Co-bearing ultramafic intrusions * Numerous new Ni-Cu-PGE targets identified through Artificial Intelligence targeting study * Start of project environmental baseline study work</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">David Patterson, QNIs CEO and Chairman, comments I want to congratulate and thank the Ducros project team for accomplishing so much work during the year. Between the unusually warm winter to start the year off and the two-month work stoppage during the summer because of the unprecedented forest fires in this part of Qubec, its been very challenging to get our work programs completed this year. I am very confident the results from the large amount of work done over the past two years has set the table for continued success at Ducros.</p><p>2023 Exploration Diamond Drilling</p><p>The 2023 drilling program tested a wide variety of prospective Ni-Cu-PGE targets across the entire Ducros Property. In total, 17,815 metres were completed in 50 holes at multiple target areas such as the Ducros Ultramafic Sill Complex (DUSC), the Ducros Sill Trend, the Q-Zone Target as well as at the greater Fortin Sill Zone area. Of note, and as previously announced, two large nickel + cobalt-bearing ultramafic intrusions were discovered at the Ducros Sill Trend and Q-Zone target earlier this year (see July 12, 2023 and September 12, 2023 News Releases for more information).</p><p>Drilling at the Fortin Sill Zone began in April with the completion of four short holes at the main Ni-Cu-PGE showing. These HQ-diameter holes supplied the materials required for a scoping-level metallurgical test program of the Fortin Sill Zone sulphides. Upon the lifting of the summer 2023 forest fire-related work stoppage, drilling at Fortin Sill resumed in August. The program was designed to explore for additional Ni-Cu-PGE sulphides at regular intervals along strike of the main outcropping mineralized zone. A total of eight holes for 5,883 metres was completed over a distance of approximately 1.2 kilometres along the interpreted strike of the Fortin Sill Zone. Downhole electromagnetic geophysical surveys were completed in four of the longer holes in efforts to locate sulphide-related conductors. Although this new drilling encountered mafic and ultramafic intrusive rocks as far away as 750 metres from the Fortin Sill Zone, no new Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization was identified in this new drilling.</p><p>Fortin Sill Zone Metallurgical Study</p><p>As discussed in the Companys May 10, 2023 News Release, SGS Canada was contracted to complete a scoping-level evaluation of the amenability of the Fortin Sill Zone to produce saleable Critical Metals concentrate. A total of 150 kilograms of Ni-Cu-Co-PGE-Au mineralized HQ diameter drill core was collected and delivered to SGSs Qubec City laboratory for the study. The scope of the work program includes bond ball mill grindability testing, floatation test work, solid-liquid separation testing and environmental analyses. As of this news release, the test program is approximately 95% complete and the delivery of the results and interpretative report is expected in the coming weeks.</p><p>AI Targeting Project</p><p>In October 2023, QNI released the results from a Ducros property-wide Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted Ni-Cu-PGE targeting exercise that was completed by ALS GoldSpot Discoveries Ltd. (ALS GoldSpot). The results of this study are highlighted by the identification of more than a dozen new and untested nickel-sulphide targets distributed across the Ducros Property (see October 3, 2023 News Release for more details, Figure 1). The unique geological and geophysical fingerprint of the Ni-Cu-PGE Fortin Sill Zone was used to train ALS GoldSpots SmartTARGETTM targeting AI algorithms.</p><p>In parallel with the AI targeting project, ALS GoldSpot also completed a litho-structural reinterpretation of the Ducros Property. It is expected this new geological interpretation will greatly enhance the Companys exploration efforts going forward by allowing future work programs to focus on the most prospective Ni-Cu-PGE targets within the large )15,000 hectare Ducros property.</p><p>Environmental Baseline Studies</p><p>In March 2023, Qubec Nickel commissioned BluMetric Environmental, of St-Laurent Qubec, to complete a baseline description of the hydrological and biological characteristics of QNIs Ducros property and surrounding lands. Together with its partner, T2 Environment, of McMasterville Qubec, BluMetric technical teams completed two separate site visits during the 2023 field season to obtain the necessary samples and data for the study. The results from this first years work are being synthesized into a final report, which is expected to be delivered early in the new year and will serve as the basis for future environmental baseline and monitoring work.</p><p>Other Exploration Work</p><p>In addition to the work summarized above, the Company completed further studies during the year that have greatly advanced the understanding of the Ducros Property geology and have led to the development of new highly prospective Ni-Cu-PGE targets. Examples of some of these other studies include the semi-automated detailed petrographic characterization of 33 drill core samples collected from the 2022 &amp;2023 exploration drilling programs. This work, which was completed by IOS Services Goscientifiques inc. (IOS), of Ville de Saguenay, Qubec, builds upon the petrography IOS and the micro-XRF work completed by the Mineral Deposit Research Unit of the University of British Columbia completed in 2022.</p><p>In addition, to follow-up on positive results of a 2022 biogeochemistry orientation survey completed across much of the Ducros property, over 500 additional samples were collected during the 2023 field season at the Fortin Sill Zone. The samples were collected from a 50 metre by 50 metre-spaced northwest-southeast oriented grid covering an area of ~2.5 kilometres long by 750 metres wide and included the Fortin Sill Zone surface showing and its interpreted strike extension. Results from the 2022 and 2023 biogeochemistry surveys were fed into the AI targeting exercise completed by ALS GoldSpot. Distinctive biogeochemical anomalies coincident with Fortin Sill Zone are highlighted as well as additional anomalies along the interpreted strike from the Zone in areas that have yet to be drill tested.</p><p>About Qubec Nickel Corp.</p><p>Qubec Nickel Corp. is a mineral exploration company focused on acquiring, exploring, and developing critical metals (Ni-Cu-Co-PGE) projects in Qubec, Canada.

While the flames didn't reach any of the province's nine Cree communities, cabins, traplines and hunting grounds have been lost, said Lee-Roy Blacksmith, the regional fire marshal for the Cree Nation Government.</p><p>\"There's going to be a lot of grieving because that's their land. They were born and raised in the land,\" Blacksmith said of the hunters and trappers. \"The food that they gather won't be the same.\" For some, the loss of cabins will be painful, he said in a recent interview, because of \"all the memories that they built throughout those years.\"</p><p>There will also be a financial loss for community members, Blacksmith said. For some, their cabins couldn't be insured because they're too old, while others have lost boats and ATVs. Many hunters had to leave so quickly they didn't have time to properly store geese killed during the recent hunting season, he said.</p><p>In hopes of reducing such losses in the future, Blacksmith is pushing to get more Cree trained as auxiliary forest firefighters.</p><p>This month,70 people have gone through the training \u2014 40 from inland communities where the fires are no longer a threat and 30 from the coastal communities near where fires continue to burn. The last group finished their training last week, he said, and were scheduled to be deployed within days.</p><p>He said it took years to get Quebec's forest fire prevention agency, SOPFEU, to agree to the training for his people. \"We had to push them, we had to keep asking,\" he said. Now he wants to expand it to ensure necessary resources are available. </p><p>Jos\u00e9e Poitras, a spokeswoman for SOPFEU, said she didn't know why Blacksmith's earlier requests went unanswered. She said SOPFEU trains auxiliary firefighters in areas where it expects they'll be needed. For example, she said, this year in the Atikamekw community of Manawan to the south, Indigenous auxiliary received training before the start of this fire season.</p><p>But, she said, the collaboration with the Cree is going well. </p><p>\"Certainly, the local crews help us a lot to fight the fires and they have the added advantage of knowing the territory they have to protect better,\" she said.</p><p>SOPFEU reported Wednesday that 86 fires continue to burn in the province, with 69 in its \"northern zone\" \u2014 roughly the northern half of Quebec. Areas near James Bay, where four Cree communities are located, remain the most affected. While recent rains have slowed the progression of the fires, road access to several Cree communities on James Bay remains limited due to heavy smoke.</p><p>Blacksmith said this is the first year since 2013 \u2014 when a major fire burned near Eastmain on James Bay \u2014 that Cree communities have been directly threatened by forest fires. </p><p>\"In the past, we used to have one fire at a time, SOPFEU would control it, would put it out in a quicker fashion. With this fire (season), we had several fires happening in a short period of time,\" he said. \"It's a lot different than in previous years.\"</p><p>Since early June, eight Cree communities have undergone full or partial evacuations due to heavy smoke. All residents have since been allowed to return.</p><p>Poitras described the fires in the northern zone as \"historic.\" This year, 128 fires in the zone have burned approximately 3.4 million hectares of forest, she said. Over the past 10 years, that part of the province has seen an average of 37 fires a year, burning an average of 208,000 hectares.</p><p>Poitras and Blacksmith attribute the size and number of fires in the northern zone to an extremely dry June. \"That's when we had lightning, thunderstorms that passed by and lightning was just shooting everywhere, and it ignited the territory like nothing,\" Blacksmith said. </p><p>He sees it as a sign of a changing climate that's slowly leading to the \"different weather, different seasons we've been having,\" he said. </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 26, 2023. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-f614b9c1560f4497a9e9036526647e55</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68T5-2G71-JBVR-312T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"704\"/><timeReceived>02:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 26, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Sometimes they are very easy to trace \u2014 when you have lightning storms, it's easy to trace. When you have a train derailment, that's easy to trace.\"</p><p>Scientists have said fires are larger and more intense, often burning throughout the night, due to climate change.</p><p>Jespersen followed up with Smith during Thursday's interview, noting that the hot and dry conditions that allow fires to grow are connected to climate change.</p><p>Smith again didn't acknowledge his comment, instead suggesting the Alberta government needs to do a better job building fireguards around communities.</p><p>\"You have to make sure when a forest fire begins that it doesn't jump over into a town or a city because that's when you end up with real trouble,\" she said. \"I think we did a fantastic job this time around.\"</p><p>Alberta has had an unprecedented start to its wildfire season, with fires scorching more than 10,000 square kilometres of forest since March.</p><p>Xianli Wang, a fire research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service, said climate change is a major factor.</p><p>\"It creates longer drought spells in the fire season, and also fire season is going to start early and end late,\" he said. \"It creates more opportunity for fire to ignite.\"</p><p>Wang said about half of the wildfires in any given year are caused by lightning strikes, while the other half are human caused.</p><p>No matter how they start, though, he said hot and dry conditions also make the fuel \u2014 plants and logs in the forests \u2014 drier so fires burn more intensely and cover more ground.</p><p>The amount of land burned surpassed the 40,000-square-kilometre mark on Wednesday, making the 2023 fire season Canada's fourth-worst on record before the summer has officially begun.</p><p>\"It is just not a random thing. Climate change is playing a major role to make it happen,\" Wang said.</p><p>Other conservative politicians have also tried to downplay the link between climate change and the hundreds of wildfires burning across Canada, which led to air quality alerts in U.S. cities such as New York and Washington, D.C. this week. </p><p>On Wednesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford suggested the issue was being politicized when he was asked by the opposition parties to go on the record to connect this year's fire season to climate change.</p><p>Maxime Bernier, leader of the People's Party, accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of lying on social media after Trudeau tweeted that Canada is seeing more fires due to climate change.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 8, 2023.</p><p>\u2014 By Colette Derworiz in Calgary</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-87096c51f4304fecb0bab93ccaf611c7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DX-G031-JBVR-3486-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"582\"/><timeReceived>06:09 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 8, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Some do. Some do. But a lot of times the workers are forgotten.\u201d</p><p>The think tank meetings in Quesnel were, by their nature, aimed at disruption and innovation of old forestry practices. Bains said these were exciting conversations built on solid ideas, but innovation must always have lines drawn closely to the worker, in the policy development that must go along with developments in timber harvesting, forest regrowth, and new uses for wood. These innovations would trigger new training, re-training, new hardware, company investment decisions, and necessary consultation with First Nations. He outlined how government was already involved in those shifts, and would be there for the next steps not yet taken.</p><p>For example, he said, sometime at the end of 2023 or early 2024 would be the next labour relations review for B.C.</p><p>\u201cI expect all of you to participate in that review, because the forestry workplace is changing, the laws governing that work have to keep up. We must modernize the relationship between employers and workers.\u201d</p><p>Safety was always his first priority, he said. Not only would that ensure the people who go to work at the start of shift also went home to their families at the end of shift, but if companies and governments kept their own focus on the safety of the individual worker, other factors would organically extend from that in corporate and governance decisions. One example he underlined was making sure women were paid the same money for the same work as male counterparts, to unlock the underrepresented female population in trades professions and forestry professions like never before, at a time when the sector needs all the workers it can get.</p><p>\u201cThe future of forestry affects all of us, and together we are building a stronger and more resilient B.C. , and an economy that works for all,\u201d he said.</p><p>Staff writer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CALCOU-news20230511PPOA0003566737</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CALCOU2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:686T-6RJ1-JD2C-J3C9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

And the situation is expected to deteriorate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Unfortunately, tomorrow it looks like it's going to get worse,\" Environment Canada meteorologist Victoria Nurse said on Wednesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She said fine particulate matter in the air over Niagara reached more than 100 micrograms per metre cubed (g/m\u00b3) on Wednesday, caused by smoke from wildfires burning in northeastern Ontario and Quebec.</p><p>\"It's not good at all,\" Nurse said.</p><p>But that number is expected to more than double on Thursday reaching as high as 250 g/m\u00b3.</p><p>In comparison, she said, about 15 g/m\u00b3 is considered on the high range of acceptable levels.</p><p>Nurse said a map posted online by BlueSky Canada - a system developed by Alberta and British Columbia to forecast the impact forest fire smoke may have on communities - shows a dark brown smudge of smoke expected to arrive over Niagara Thursday morning.</p><p>\"I think it's a fair thing to say that this is the worst it's been in the last 10 to 20 years,\" Nurse said. \"This is a very unusual event in terms of its scale.\"</p><p>Although wind in Niagara typically blows from the west, she said it is currently blowing from the north due to a stagnant high-pressure zone in eastern Canada, carrying smoke with it.</p><p>\"We're in that weird zone with that northerly flow at the moment,\" she said, adding that isn't expected to change in the next few days.</p><p>While the smoke grows worse Thursday, Nurse said winds from the north will increase, too. \"Friday is not looking great either,\" she said.</p><p>Nurse said there may be some relief Saturday, with a change in weather possibly bringing rain showers.</p><p>Environment Canada issued a special air quality statement for Niagara, warning poor air quality will persist throughout the weekend, with \"high risk\" air quality health index values forecast.</p><p>In a statement, Niagara Region Public Health said \"wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations.\"</p><p>\"People with lung disease such as asthma, or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke,\" the statement said.</p><p>The statement said the air quality index for St. Catharines-Niagara is forecast to reach nine on Thursday, placing Niagara at the top of the \"high risk\" level. For high-risk situations, the recommendations include avoiding strenuous activities outdoors for at-risk people, children and the elderly, as well as people experiencing coughing and throat irritation.</p><p>Public health said the recommendations also encourage people to watch for symptoms such as irritated eyes, mucus, shortness of breath or cough. \"If you experience these symptoms, take a break and consider seeking health care, especially if you are more susceptible or experiencing more severe symptoms.\"</p><p>Recommendations also include keeping doors and windows closed, and using air conditioning to filter incoming air when possible, drinking plenty of water and checking on others who may be at higher risk.</p><p>While Nurse said N95 masks can provide some protection, Niagara's medical officer of health, Dr. Azim Kasmani, said \"wearing a cloth or surgical mask is not the best way to protect your health during a smoke event.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, schools are trying to protect students. Both Niagara Catholic District School Board and District School Board of Niagara have cancelled outdoor activities such as track and field, and announced that students will not be outdoors for recess on Thursday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-news20230608TNI2023060868123543</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DP-2VY1-F197-51S0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"595\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Friday, March. 8, 18 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> TICKETS<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.<br/><br/> PAST LOCATIONS<br/><br/> \\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8<br/><br/> \\x95 Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and

A haze of smoke from wildfires burning hundreds of kilometres away. And the situation is expected to deteriorate.<br/><br/> \"Unfortunately, tomorrow it looks like it's going to get worse,\"  Environment Canada meteorologist Victoria Nurse said on Wednesday.</p><p><br/><br/> She said fine particulate matter in the air over Niagara reached more than 100 micrograms per  metre cubed (g/m\u00b3) on Wednesday, caused by smoke from wildfires burning in northeastern Ontario and Quebec.<br/><br/> \"It's not good at all,\" Nurse said.<br/><br/> But that number is expected to more than double on Thursday reaching as high as 250 g/m\u00b3.<br/><br/> In comparison, she said, about 15 g/m\u00b3 is considered on the high range of acceptable levels. <br/><br/> Nurse said a map posted online by BlueSky Canada - a system developed by Alberta and British Columbia to forecast the impact forest fire smoke may have on communities - shows a dark brown smudge of smoke expected to arrive over Niagara Thursday morning.<br/><br/> \"I think it's a fair thing to say that this is the worst it's been in the last 10 to 20 years,\" Nurse said. \"This is a very unusual event in terms of its scale.\"<br/><br/> Although wind in Niagara typically blows from the west, she said it is currently blowing from the north due to a stagnant high-pressure zone in eastern Canada, carrying smoke with it.<br/><br/> \"We're in that weird zone with that northerly flow at the moment,\" she said, adding that isn't expected to change in the next few days.<br/><br/> While the smoke grows worse Thursday, Nurse said  winds from the north will increase, too. \"Friday is not looking great either,\" she said.<br/><br/> Nurse said there may be some relief Saturday, with a change in weather possibly bringing rain showers.<br/><br/> Environment Canada issued a special air quality statement for Niagara, warning poor air quality will persist throughout the weekend, with \"high risk\" air quality health index values forecast.<br/><br/> In a statement, Niagara Region Public Health said \"wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations.\"<br/><br/> \"People with lung disease such as asthma, or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke,\" the statement said.<br/><br/> The statement said the air quality index for St. Catharines-Niagara is forecast to reach nine on Thursday, placing Niagara at the top of the \"high risk\" level. For high-risk situations, the recommendations include avoiding strenuous activities outdoors for at-risk people, children and the elderly, as well as people experiencing coughing and throat irritation. <br/><br/> Public health said the recommendations also encourage people to watch for symptoms such as irritated eyes, mucus, shortness of breath or cough. \"If you experience these symptoms, take a break and consider seeking health care, especially if you are more susceptible or experiencing more severe symptoms.\"<br/><br/> Recommendations also include keeping doors and windows closed, and using air conditioning to filter incoming air when possible, drinking plenty of water and checking on others who may be at higher risk.<br/><br/> While Nurse said N95 masks can provide some protection, Niagara's medical officer of health, Dr. Azim Kasmani, said \"wearing a cloth or surgical mask is not the best way to protect your health during a smoke event.\"<br/><br/> Meanwhile,  schools are trying to protect students. Both Niagara Catholic District School Board and District School Board of Niagara have cancelled outdoor activities such as track and field, and announced that students will not be outdoors for recess on Thursday. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CATHIE-2023060868123764</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CATHIE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DP-K201-JDV5-F0TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"600\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 St. Catharine's Standard All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Standard (St. Catharines, Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 8, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924110GJ</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY REGULATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N621399MG</classCode><className>NURSES &amp; NURSING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX001481</classCode><className>RESPIRATORY DISORDERS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000125</classCode><className>ASTHMA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001232</classCode><className>PARTICULATE MATTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001885</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY MONITORING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DIF5</classCode><className>ADULTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000C4A1</classCode><className>HEART DISEASE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N621399MG</classCode><className>NURSES &amp; NURSING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS176</classCode><className>QUEBEC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Some do. Some do. But a lot of times the workers are forgotten.\u201d</p><p>The think tank meetings in Quesnel were, by their nature, aimed at disruption and innovation of old forestry practices. Bains said these were exciting conversations built on solid ideas, but innovation must always have lines drawn closely to the worker, in the policy development that must go along with developments in timber harvesting, forest regrowth, and new uses for wood. These innovations would trigger new training, re-training, new hardware, company investment decisions, and necessary consultation with First Nations. He outlined how government was already involved in those shifts, and would be there for the next steps not yet taken.</p><p>For example, he said, sometime at the end of 2023 or early 2024 would be the next labour relations review for B.C. \u201cI expect all of you to participate in that review, because the forestry workplace is changing, the laws governing that work have to keep up. We must modernize the relationship between employers and workers.\u201d</p><p>Safety was always his first priority, he said. Not only would that ensure the people who go to work at the start of shift also went home to their families at the end of shift, but if companies and governments kept their own focus on the safety of the individual worker, other factors would organically extend from that in corporate and governance decisions. One example he underlined was making sure women were paid the same money for the same work as male counterparts, to unlock the underrepresented female population in trades professions and forestry professions like never before, at a time when the sector needs all the workers it can get.</p><p>\u201cThe future of forestry affects all of us, and together we are building a stronger and more resilient B.C. , and an economy that works for all,\u201d he said.</p><p>Staff writer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20230510PSCA0003562799</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:686K-7B21-JD2C-J559-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Both Niagara Catholic District School Board and District School Board of Niagara have cancelled outdoor activities such as track and field, and announced that students will not be outdoors for recess on Thursday. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WELTRI-2023060868123662</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WELTRI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DP-K201-JDV5-F10M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433814</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"600\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Welland Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Welland Tribune (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 8, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N621399MG</classCode><className>NURSES &amp; NURSING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX001481</classCode><className>RESPIRATORY DISORDERS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000125</classCode><className>ASTHMA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001232</classCode><className>PARTICULATE MATTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001885</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY MONITORING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DIF5</classCode><className>ADULTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000C4A1</classCode><className>HEART DISEASE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N621399MG</classCode><className>NURSES &amp; NURSING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS176</classCode><className>QUEBEC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But that progress is threatened by smoke from wildfires, which are becoming more frequent and more intense with climate change. Canada\u2019s 2023 wildfire season is the worst on record, with more than 5,800 reported fires and over 15 million hectares burned to date. Globally, air pollution is a leading cause of death and disease. One of the best indicators of health risk from air pollution is the concentration of very small particles called PM2.5 (which stands for particular matter smaller than 2.5 micrometres). PM2.5 particles can deposit deep in the lungs and long-term exposure can cause a wide range of health effects including respiratory and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung cancer and pregnancy complications. Health effects can occur even at low concentrations, including those below current Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards. Wildfires produce enormous quantities of PM2.5 and several other hazardous pollutants. Wildfire smoke can travel long distances, exposing large populations \u2014 both close to and far away from fires \u2014 to very high concentrations of pollution.</p><p>The health impact of wildfire smoke The pollution mixture and chemical composition of wildfire smoke is often different from the pollution emitted by other sources, and these differences may influence toxicity. The toxicity of wildfire smoke also depends on the type of vegetation and burning conditions and may change as the smoke \u201cages\u201d in the atmosphere. This underscores the need to distinguish the health impacts of wildfire smoke from the impacts of other pollution sources. Evidence linking wildfire smoke with adverse health effects has been accumulating for years and the notion that wildfire smoke is \u201cnatural,\u201d and therefore less harmful than other types of air pollution, is not supported by the evidence. Most studies have evaluated the relationships between daily changes in smoke levels and indicators of health such as emergency department visits, hospital admissions or deaths. There is strong evidence that these \u201cacute\u201d exposures to wildfire smoke increase the risk of respiratory illness and death, and evidence of effects on the cardiovascular system is also growing. Older adults, people living in lowincome areas, and those with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and other chronic conditions are most susceptible. The health effects of wildfire smoke likely extend beyond the lungs and heart. Recent studies indicate that exposure during pregnancy may increase the risks of preterm birth and decreased birth weight. Smoke may also reduce attention measured on cognitive tests and increase dementia risk. More studies are needed, but these effects could have important implications for health during vulnerable stages of life. Much less is known about the impacts of exposure to wildfire smoke over longer durations or from multiple episodes. As more Canadians are exposed to smoke, and as the duration of the forest fire season increases, it will be critical to understand the long-term health impacts of repeated smoke exposure, especially among the most at-risk populations.</p><p>Strategies to protect health Unlike anthropogenic sources of air pollution, emissions of wildfire smoke cannot be readily controlled at the source. But there are strategies that individuals and communities can use to reduce exposure and health risks. Before fires begin, those with chronic conditions can discuss strategies for managing their health with their health-care providers, and ensure access to necessary medications. During smoke events, staying indoors can be beneficial because buildings reduce exposure to outdoor-generated pollution when windows and doors are closed. Correctly sized portable HEPA filter air cleaners can reduce indoor PM2.5 by as much as 80 per cent. And well-fitting N95 respirators (or comparable respirators designed and certified for occupational use) can reduce PM2.5 exposure when outdoors or in transit. The Air Quality Health Index and smoke forecasts can help Canadians decide when these strategies are needed. These strategies also have limitations. For example, the recommendation to stay indoors assumes that individuals have stable and safe housing. It is also complicated by heat, a major threat to health that may amplify the effects of PM2.5. Portable air filters are prohibitively expensive for some families, they do not remove the gases found in wildfire smoke, and they will be less effective for those who spend time in other locations, such as outdoor workers. High quality respirators may be unavailable in some communities, may cause discomfort and a good facial fit will be impossible for many children and some adults. Government and public health agencies can help to offset some of these limitations and ensure more equal protection from smoke by providing accessible and clear messages to the public and establishing clean air shelters in libraries, schools and other public buildings. Multiple overlapping strategies are needed to mitigate the health impacts of Canada\u2019s worsening wildfires. Ryan W.

Churipuy.</p><p>And even those who think they are healthy may be affected if there is a health condition they don't know about, which worsens due to the contaminated air.</p><p>People who are high

healthy, but could also be much worse for those who are not.<br/><br/> \"For those who are otherwise healthy they may experience some superficial symptoms, like their eyes may be irritated or you may feel something in the back of your throat ... coughing and difficulty breathing, especially during exercise,\" said Churipuy.<br/><br/> \"People with existing illnesses, they may experience a pretty substantial increase in some symptoms.\"<br/><br/> Those with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may cough more or have more phlegm while those with heart failure can experience shortness of breath or swelling in their ankles and feet.<br/><br/> \"Others with heart rhythm problems may notice a fluttering in their chest or feeling light-headed, and anybody with angina or coronary artery disease may have increased chest or arm pain.\"<br/><br/> Anyone who feels chest pain, tightness, sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, consistent coughing or light-headedness should seek medical assessment, added Churipuy.<br/><br/> And even those who think they are healthy may be affected if there is a health condition they don't know about, which worsens due to the contaminated air.<br/><br/> People who are high risk should limit their time outdoors, especially for prolonged periods of time and strenuous activities.<br/><br/> \"Those types of activities can actually make their underlying medical conditions worse,\" said Churipuy.<br/><br/> Only be outdoors for a short amount of time, don't overexert yourself so you don't put too much strain on your heart and lungs, and wear an N95 or KN95 mask if you have access to them, she advises.<br/><br/> While many households likely have masks lying around after their time dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, Churipuy says you should only use masks with a tight-fitted seal. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

With the wildfires that are active in a large part of Quebec, particularly near the city of Lebel-sur-Quvillon, the Ministre des Ressources naturelles et des Forts (MRNF) has modified the ban of forest access on Crown land and closure of roads. Following that directive, Bonterra has stopped its exploration activities and evacuated safely all personnel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Marc-Andr Pelletier, President and CEO commented: \"The forest fire situation is exceptional and Bonterra remains on the lookout for any development. The Barry and Gladiator camps and the Bachelor Mill Complex are not currently in danger, but we continue to monitor the situation with the authorities. We sincerely hope the situation will improve over the week.\"</p><p>About Bonterra Resources Inc.</p><p>Bonterra is a Canadian gold exploration company with a large portfolio of advanced exploration assets anchored by a central milling facility in Quebec, Canada. The Company has four main assets, Gladiator, Barry, Moroy, and Bachelor that collectively have a total of 1.24 million ounces in Measured and Indicated categories, and 1.78 million ounces in Inferred category. Importantly, the Company owns the only permitted and operational gold mill in the region.

This forward-looking information includes, among other things, statements with respect to Bonterra's exploration and development plans and placing the Bachelor-Moroy deposit under long-term care and maintenance. The words \"will\", \"anticipated\", \"plans\" or other similar words and phrases are intended to identify forward-looking information. This forward-looking information includes namely information with respect to the planned exploration programs and the potential growth in mineral resources. Exploration results that include drill results on wide spacings may not be indicative of the occurrence of a mineral deposit and such results do not provide assurance that further work will establish sufficient grade, continuity, metallurgical characteristics, and economic potential to be classed as a category of mineral resource. The potential quantities and grades of drilling targets are conceptual in nature and, there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the targets being delineated as mineral resources. Forward-looking information is subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause Bonterra's actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information. Such factors include but are not limited to: uncertainties related exploration and development; the ability to raise sufficient capital to fund exploration and development; changes in economic conditions or financial markets, environmental and other judicial, regulatory, political, and competitive developments; technological or operational difficulties or inability to obtain permits encountered in connection with exploration activities; and labour relations matters. This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect our forward-looking information. These and other factors should be considered carefully, and readers should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking information.</p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2023 Market News Publishing Inc.

Lower Mainland. <br/><br/> The BC Wildfire Service said Friday that more than 600 lightning strikes were reported in the Kamloops area as a storm swept through.<br/><br/> A new out-of-control wildfire visible from the city of Kamloops was reported about 11 kilometres southwest of the Interior city.<br/><br/> Evacuation alerts for more than 100 properties were issued northeast of Kamloops as crews battled the Lower East Adams Lake fire, said the service.<br/><br/> The service says on its website there are more than 400 active wildfires in the province, with 247 listed as out of control and 23 ranked as fires of note, where they are a threat to safety or are especially visible to the public.<br/><br/> This week, B.C. reported more than 14,000 square kilometres had been burned so far this season, surpassing the previous record set in 2018.<br/><br/> Federal and provincial government officials have said B.C. and Canada are on the way to the worst fire season in 100 years.<br/><br/> Environment Canada issued heat warnings Friday, saying unseasonably hot weather in B.C.'s Okanagan, Thompson, and Boundary regions will push temperatures into the mid 30s into the weekend.<br/><br/> The agency said daytime temperatures are expected to reach 38 C in the Boundary region, while temperatures in the south and central Okanagan, south and north Thompson, and Fraser Canyon regions will reach up to 36 C.<br/><br/> The latest heat wave broke records in parts of the province, including a 38.2 C temperature in Nelson on Thursday, surpassing the last high from 1938, while records were also set in McKenzie, Nakusp, Richmond and Smithers.<br/><br/> The extended heat wave comes as B.C. expected the arrival of 100 firefighters from Brazil Friday, adding to the province's growing international wildfire force.<br/><br/> Cliff Chapman, a BC Wildfire Service spokesperson, said about 500 international firefighters are already in the province, boosting the ranks of the more than 2,000 provincial wildfire service personnel on the front lines battling hundreds of blazes.<br/><br/> He said the firefighters from Brazil will join crews from Mexico, the United States and Australia now in the province.<br/><br/> Bowinn Ma, B.C.'s emergency management and climate readiness minister, recently requested 1,000 international firefighters through the non-profit Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, which co-ordinates national and international fire management.<br/><br/> Chapman said the international firefighters are providing much-needed relief and assistance to crews battling the more than 400 fires currently burning in the province.<br/><br/> The Canadian Press <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023072268544626</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68S3-9431-F197-54SF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"756\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

The answer is, not much.</p><p>Instead of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy, the NDP spends our tax dollars on building higher dikes and hiring more forest fire fighters. But these measures are not going to stop a changing climate. Not at all.</p><p>The NDP/Liberal track record for achieving a sustainable economy is a solid zero over the past 20 years \u2014 they have never met any carbon reduction goals, and the B.C. economy continues to use fossil fuels for about 80 per cent of its energy needs.</p><p>So the NDP has a moral problem, or conundrum. They can choose to continue the unsustainable use of fossil fuels like gas; or they can make our planet's future less dangerous by investing in renewable energy systems like solar electricity.</p><p>Regrettably, the NDP's choice so far has been to ramp up the export of fracked gas or LNG, and in so doing to increase our carbon emissions when that gas is burned in Asia. Like my chickens coming home to roost, those burnt carbon gases inevitably return to B.C. in the form of atmospheric storms. And worse, they plan to decrease the price paid for solar electricity to 4 cents/kWh \u2014 much lower than the 9-15 cents they charge you on your electrical utility bill. Clearly, they want people to use gas instead of solar energy \u2014 more hydro energy is not a future choice since its ability to expand is limited.</p><p>The consequences of this choice to favour gas over solar are obvious: 600 people died during the heat dome crisis, fires destroyed whole towns, and recent floods are costing us all billions in increased insurance and taxes.</p><p>These economic costs and human misery will only increase if we do nothing.</p><p>So ask your MLA to demand that the government make the right choice when they are confronted with this NDP carbon conundrum: they should not choose to pollute our atmospheric nest by exporting and burning fracked gas; and they should choose to decarbonize society by paying a fair price for clean renewable energy.</p><p>Because in terms of stopping the climate emergency, and in comparison to solar energy, natural gas is as dirty as my chicken coop.</p><p>Peter Nix, Cowichan Carbon Buster</p><p>Maple Bay</p><p>Copyright 2023 Cowichan Valley Citizen</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COWCIT-news20230223ICZ4441281</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COWCIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67MF-NFG1-JD2C-J1F7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438285</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"397\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Tuesday, Jan. 30, all 22 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> TICKETS<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.<br/><br/> PAST LOCATIONS<br/><br/> \\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8<br/><br/> \\x95 Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and

But that progress is threatened by smoke from wildfires, which are becoming <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.4236/jep.2018.95028\">more frequent and more intense with climate change</url>. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Canada's 2023 wildfire season is <url normalizedValue=\"https://ciffc.net/statistics\">the worst on record</url>, with more than 5,800 reported fires and over 15 million hectares burned to date. </p><p>Globally, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stateofglobalair.org/sites/default/files/documents/2022-09/soga-2020-report.pdf\">air pollution is a leading cause of death and disease</url>. One of the best indicators of health risk from air pollution is the concentration of very small particles called PM2.5 (which stands for particular matter smaller than 2.5 micrometres). </p><p>PM2.5 particles can deposit deep in the lungs and long-term exposure can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stateofglobalair.org/sites/default/files/documents/2022-09/soga-2020-report.pdf\">cause a wide range of health effects including respiratory and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung cancer and pregnancy complications</url>. <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abo3381\">Health effects can occur even at low concentrations</url>, including those below current <url normalizedValue=\"https://ccme.ca/en/air-quality-report#slide-7\">Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards</url>.</p><p>Wildfires produce enormous quantities of PM2.5 and several other hazardous pollutants. Wildfire smoke can travel long distances, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/06/us/new-york-air-pollution-canada-wildfires-climate/index.html\">exposing large populations - both close to and far away from fires - to very high concentrations of pollution</url>. </p><h>The health impact of wildfire smoke</h><p>The pollution mixture and chemical composition of wildfire smoke is often different from the pollution emitted by other sources, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.3300\">these differences may influence toxicity</url>. The toxicity of wildfire smoke also <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2200\">depends on the type of vegetation and burning conditions</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40726-023-00272-9\">may change as the smoke \"ages\" in the atmosphere</url>. This underscores the need to distinguish the health impacts of wildfire smoke from the impacts of other pollution sources. </p><p>Evidence linking wildfire smoke with adverse health effects has been accumulating for years and the notion that wildfire smoke is \"natural,\" and therefore less harmful than other types of air pollution, is not supported by the evidence. </p><p>Most studies have evaluated the relationships between daily changes in smoke levels and indicators of health such as emergency department visits, hospital admissions or deaths. </p><p>There is strong evidence that these \"acute\" exposures to wildfire smoke <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1409277\">increase the risk of respiratory illness and death</url>, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12989-020-00394-8\">evidence of effects on the cardiovascular system</url> is also growing. Older adults, people living in low-income areas, and those with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and other chronic conditions <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsr2028985\">are most susceptible</url>. </p><p>The health effects of wildfire smoke likely extend beyond the lungs and heart. Recent studies indicate that exposure during pregnancy may increase the risks of <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111872\">preterm birth</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41370-020-00267-4\">decreased birth weight</url>. Smoke may also <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10498\">reduce attention measured on cognitive tests</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.3300\">increase dementia risk</url>. </p><p>More studies are needed, but these effects could have important implications for health during vulnerable stages of life. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121041\">Much less is known about the impacts of exposure to wildfire smoke over longer durations or from multiple episodes</url>. As more Canadians are exposed to smoke, and as the duration of the forest fire season increases, it will be critical to understand the long-term health impacts of repeated smoke exposure, especially among the most at-risk populations. </p><h>Strategies to protect health</h><p>Unlike <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.5772/9751\">anthropogenic sources</url> of air pollution, emissions of wildfire smoke cannot be readily controlled at the source. But there are strategies that individuals and communities can use to reduce exposure and health risks. </p><p>Before fires begin, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.airnow.gov/publications/wildfire-smoke-guide/wildfire-smoke-a-guide-for-public-health-officials/\">those with chronic conditions can discuss strategies for managing their health with their health-care providers, and ensure access to necessary medications</url>. During smoke events, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1104447\">staying indoors can be beneficial</url> because buildings reduce exposure to outdoor-generated pollution when windows and doors are closed. </p><p>Correctly sized portable HEPA filter air cleaners can <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.11.058\">reduce indoor PM2.5 by as much as 80 per cent</url>. And well-fitting <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40572-020-00296-z\">N95 respirators (or comparable respirators designed and certified for occupational use) can reduce PM2.5 exposure</url> when outdoors or in transit. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://weather.gc.ca/airquality/pages/index_e.html\">Air Quality Health Index</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://weather.gc.ca/firework/\">smoke forecasts</url> can help Canadians decide when these strategies are needed.</p><p>These strategies also have limitations.

The threat of losing a treasured family home left a deep imprint on him where the importance of limiting and fighting the destructive power of climate change must be addressed, Eby said.</p><p>Bowinn Ma, the minister of emergency management and climate readiness, said the ministry\u2019s preparedness fund has previously supported projects that include a dike in Merritt, public cooling infrastructure in Victoria and tsunami evacuation planning in Tofino.</p><p>The new fund will also provide a one-stop online platform for communities and First Nations to review flood, wildfire, weather and other hazardous events data that had previously been spread over various government websites, said Ma.</p><p>\u201cWe need to be ready, and that means understanding the hazards, the risks, what is ahead of us, and working with communities to get the work that needs to happen done, now,\u201d said Ma.</p><p>The program also includes supports for communities to prepare for the effects of extreme cold and heat, she said. Since 2017, local governments and First Nations have received funds for more than 1,300 projects to prepare for natural disasters and climate-related emergencies, the Emergency Preparedness Ministry says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230222RDA0003362422</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67M3-9T61-F0HF-813H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"415\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

And a forecast model suggested fire hot spots were unlikely to receive the more significant precipitation expected farther south over the next few days, he added.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There has been a bit of help from the rain for those battling forest fires, but unfortunately those fires continue,\" Flisfeder said. Areas most affected by fires received between 15 and 40 millimetres of rain between Sunday and Wednesday, with possibly higher amounts in localized areas.</p><p>Meanwhile, wildfire smoke led the federal weather agency this week to issue special air quality statements for all of southern Ontario and much of western Quebec. The meteorologists said they expected air quality in the Montreal area to worsen as that smoke moved into the city by Wednesday evening.</p><p>Quebec's forest fire prevention agency reported 110 active fires Wednesday afternoon, including 73 in the southern half of the province. It has said that lightning is the cause of the majority of fires in the province this year.</p><p>Several communities in northern and western Quebec were still under evacuation orders due to fires and smoke, though residents of the town of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon and the Cree community of Mistissini will be able to return home this week, officials have announced. Mistissini lifted its evacuation order Tuesday evening.</p><p>Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon Mayor Guy Lafreni\u00e8re said Wednesday that recent temperatures and a favourable weather outlook for July made it possible for the community to begin a gradual return after their second evacuation in a month. Members of the general public are scheduled to begin coming back starting Saturday, he said.</p><p>However, fires still pose a threat to the town, the mayor said, adding that a third evacuation is still possible.</p><p>\"There is a risk of fires coming back in full force in July,\" he warned. \"However, we think it would be unrealistic to wait until all of these fires are under control because we'd still be evacuated for four to six weeks.\"</p><p>Almost 1,200 vulnerable people from Cree communities, including Mistissini, are among the evacuees.</p><p>Dr. Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost of the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay said the evacuation process has gone relatively well, but he added that the situation poses particular health, logistical and cultural challenges for evacuees \u2014 including elders, medical patients, pregnant women and infants \u2014 who have been transferred across hotels and health-care facilities in Montreal, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec City and Saguenay.</p><p>He likened the evacuation to \"going camping without prior notice,\" uprooting people from their homes and lands. </p><p>The resulting separation of families has taken a mental health toll in a community that places high value on familial bonding, said Virginia Wabano, who is co-ordinating evacuee services from a hotel in Beaupr\u00e9, Que., a town about 40 kilometres east of Quebec City.</p><p>\"Family is very important to us,\" she explained. \"When we go through a crisis, families want to be together. But sometimes there are processes and protocols that hinder that. And then it creates a lot of social issues.\"</p><p>The displacement, she added, has deprived community members of some of the traditional foods that make up their regular diet. There's also concern among evacuees that fires could destroy traditional camps and trap lines.</p><p>Pr\u00e9vost said he worries about not only the potential adverse health effects from the evacuations \u2014 which in some cases have been weeks long \u2014 but also the mental health and social impacts that could linger after evacuees return home.</p><p>\"Being evacuated is one thing. Returning home is another thing,\" he said, describing the evacuees as climate refugees. \"It's a heavy situation.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 28, 2023.</p><p>\u2014 With files from Marie-\u00c8ve Martel in Montreal. </p><p>---</p><p>This story was produced with the financial assistance of the Meta and Canadian Press News Fellowship.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-bf569bb9102c44f38f0c326d6f8112e5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K5-WDG1-JBVR-34RJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><timeReceived>05:27 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 28, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A small success is that 24 of those 64 fires are either being held or considered out at this time, the Northwest Fire Centre\u2019s Ryan Chapman told reporters Wednesday (July 13) afternoon.</p><p>He was joined by Todd Flannagan, an incident commander for the Vanderhoof and Fort St. James region, and Cliff Chapman, operations director for the BC Wildfire Service in providing an update for the Nadina, Bulkley-Nechako, Fort St. James and Vanderhoof regions.</p><p>\u201cWe have seen more fire on the landscape in terms of number of starts, as well as the continuation of hectares burned on the landscape than we have seen in previous years at this point,\u201d said Cliff Chapman.</p><p>More than 1,000 fires started in April and just under 400 are still burning. In total, over 1.2 million hectares have burned so far this year throughout the province, compared to a 10 year average, which is roughly 76,000 hectares.</p><p>Lighting strikes, (with 51,000 strikes recorded in B.C. in the last seven days with 76 per cent of those concentrated in the Northwest and Prince George Fire Centres) and dry weather conditions are further challenging firefighters.</p><p>\u201cWe have had 392 fires in the last seven days, 230 of those fires remain out of control and many of those fires are present in the Prince George and Northwest fire centres,\u201d said Ryan Chapman.</p><p>More than 2,000 firefighters are in the province right now and the wildfire service is asking for an additional 1,000 through the Canadian interagency Forest Fire Center.</p><p>Another 200 to 300 are expected from Australia, Mexico and the U.S.over the next six to 10 days. The province has also requested people, helicopters and aircraft from the federal government.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to plan ahead for the next two months,\u201d Cliff Chapman added.</p><p>But he said finding help is a challenge because resources are spread thin due to wildfires in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta.</p><p>Northwest Fire Centre update:\u201cOur main priority is to prevent these fires from impacting life and property,\u201d Ryan Chapman said. However, owing to weather con-ditions, not all fires can be fought at this time, Chapman said firefighters are focusing on the west side of the fire closest to Burns Lake and the south part of the fire that\u2019s near the Tintgael residential area. Parrot Lake and Peacock Creek, which is south of Houston, are also drawing in resources.</p><p>\u201cSo we have had favorable winds over the west. We have been able to get quite close to the fire so we\u2019re using heavy equipment bulldozers, excavators followed up by ground crews. And we have established a guard from this line here which is a main 500 kilowatt transmission line. We\u2019re building that guard as close to the fire as possible. And our main goal is to try to stop the fire at that guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re running air controls every day. We appreciate the public finding fires and phoning them in. We are expecting to keep finding new fires and addressing those as quickly as we can while they\u2019re small.\u201d</p><p>Public is also being told unnecessary risks and be aware of fire locations heading into the woods.</p><p>Vanderhoof and Fort St. James area update:Vanderhoof and Fort St. James have seen 54 new wildfires since July 7. There are currently 63 fires burning and majority of those are out of control, said Todd Flannagan, the incident commander for the area.</p><p>Currently, in Vanderhoof\u2019s G4 zone there are 36 active wildfires and 2,500 hectares burning. In Fort St. James G5 zone there are 27 active wildfires and 35,000-plus hectares burning.</p><p>Heavy smoke is expected to continue through the next several days.</p><p>\u201cAt this time, our main objective is to keep transportation corridors open for access and to support fire operations and all evacuations,\u201d Flannagan said, adding, \u201cThe number one priority for the BC wildfires services is to ensure the safety of first responders and all personnel all wildfire response personnel.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CALCOU-news20230720PPOA0003741873</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CALCOU2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68RR-5TD1-JD2C-J0Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"704\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

All personnel have been demobilised until the situation improves. Helicopters assigned to the Project have been requisitioned by the government for the firefighting activities in the province.</p><p>The wildfires are having minimal direct impact on the property.

The TDEM survey aimed to follow up on a selection of shallow VLF-EM conductive anomalies spatially correlated with mapped ultramafic rocks of the Lac Guyer Greenstone Belt which are anomalous in Ni (Nickel), Co (Cobalt) and Cr (Chromium) and deemed prospective for base metals mineralisation. Targets generated will thereafter be evaluated on the ground concurrent with the planned exploration efforts for lithium-bearing pegmatites once the crew is able to go back into the field.</p><p>About Champion Electric Metals Inc.</p><p>Champion Electric is a discovery-focused exploration company that is committed to advancing its highly prospective lithium properties in Quebec, Canada and cobalt properties in Idaho, United States. In addition, the Company owns the Baner gold project in Idaho County and the Champagne polymetallic project in Butte County near Arco.</p><p>The Company's shares trade on the CSE under the trading symbol \"LTHM\", on the OTCQB under the trading symbol \"GLDRF\", and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol \"1QB0\".

privately with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on the sidelines of the annual Nordic leaders' summit, which Canada's leader is attending as a guest.</p><p>The two-day event follows a weekend of

Russia's invasion.</p><p>Toronto votes on next mayor</p><p>Polls are set to open today as Toronto voters elect the next mayor of Canada's most populous city, capping a hotly contested byelection campaign to replace scandal-departed John Tory. </p><p>It's the second mayoral election for the city since October after Tory admitted to having an affair with a staffer and resigned just a few months into his third term. </p><p>A record 102 candidates lined up to replace him, with roughly a half-dozen names rising to the top of the field over the course of the 12-week campaign.</p><p>The next

tourists to be respectful after noting inappropriate behaviours in the run-up to the 10-year anniversary of the rail disaster that claimed 47 lives. </p><p>The municipality has asked a team of social

victims of the 2013 train derailment and explosion were inside the popular Musi-Caf\u00e9 restaurant, which has seen an increase in visitors since a pair of TV series about the disaster aired earlier this year.</p><p>Wildfires could cancel Canada Day fireworks</p><p>The number of wildfires across Canada increased over the week, adding more smoke to the already cloudy and hazy skies above Ontario and Quebec.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre says there are 462 active fires burning across the country, and 237 of them are out of control.</p><p>Almost one-quarter of those fires are in Quebec, and Environment Canada warned wind patterns were causing smoke from some of those blazes to settle over the western part of the province as well as eastern Ontario.</p><p>The

But when they arrived Sunday morning, they found a coating of ash on their bicycles and a thick haze floating in the air.<br/><br/> \"In working with provincial health authorities due to the ash alert and high concentrations of fine particles causing poor Air Quality Index (AQI) spreading across the Tremblant region, we regret to share that Sunday's IRONMAN 70.3 Mont-Tremblant triathlon has been cancelled for the safety of all involved,\" race organizers posted on their website.<br/><br/> The record-breaking fire season and expectation of continued hot, dry weather has some cities also cancelling or reconsidering fireworks planned for Canada Day next weekend.<br/><br/> Gatineau disallowed fireworks planned for Saturday for the Saint-Jean-Baptiste holiday and is also barring them on July 1. North Bay, Ont., reported Friday it had considered cancelling fireworks for Canada Day, but for now will allow them to go ahead.<br/><br/> North Bay was among the cities blanketed by smoke again Sunday.<br/><br/> Environment Canada said the air quality index in eastern and northern Ontario, including Ottawa, North Bay and Sudbury, was above 10 on Sunday, which is considered to be very high risk. Gatineau, Montreal and its suburbs were given the same rating.<br/><br/> Vulnerable people are advised to avoid strenuous outdoor exercise entirely while everyone else should severely limit it.<br/><br/> \"People with lung disease such as asthma, heart disease patients, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke,\" the weather agency said in its air quality warnings.<br/><br/> The agency said the air quality in Quebec City would also pose a high risk Sunday. Winnipeg and the northern Manitoba town of Flin Flon were expected to see high-risk air quality Sunday evening.<br/><br/> The poor air quality is expected to dissipate in Manitoba and northern Ontario by Monday, but may remain above safe levels in eastern Ontario and western Quebec until at least Monday night.<br/><br/> Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said last week the biggest risk from wildfire smoke is the fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5 than settles in your lungs when inhaled and causes inflammation and irritation. <br/><br/> She said a well-fitted, high-quality face mask, like an N95, can help reduce the amount of PM2.5 someone inhales.<br/><br/> The number of fires actively burning has jumped over the past week. CIFFC reported 412 active fires with 208 out of control on June 18. Ontario and Alberta saw the biggest spikes in fire activity. <br/><br/> Nearly 72,000 square kilometres of forest land has burned this year so far, an area nearly four times the size of Lake Ontario.<br/><br/> There are differing reports on the exact record for the most amount of land burned from wildfires in a single year in Canada, but all indexes show this year is rapidly closing in on becoming the worst fire year the country has ever seen.<br/><br/> The Canadian Press <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023062668300723</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JJ-23F1-JDV5-F0GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"648\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

In the past, restrictions consisted of allowing irrigation two days per week from May 15 to Oct. 15, regardless of drought and other conditions limiting water supply.</p><p>Rob Niewenhuizen, the city\u2019s director of engineering and public works, explained to council on April 24 that the proposed multistage restrictions consist of four stages, each stage allowing fewer days of irrigation, ranging from three days per week in Stage 1 to no irrigation in Stage 4. \u201cIt\u2019a quite a change from the last 25 years.\u201d</p><p>Niewenhuizen\u2019s report pointed out that in the summer of 2021, the city experienced a Level 4 drought and record-breaking daily water demands. The high water demands added strain to the entire water distribution system, resulting in the system being unable to keep up with demand in some areas.</p><p>This created dangerously low reservoir levels and strain on the water treatment plant.</p><p>\u201cWhile the 2021 event was unprecedented, even in average years the Zone 2 pumps are unable to keep up with peakhour demand during periods of high irrigation, resulting in severe/extreme/disturbing/concerning draw-down of the reservoirs. This results in potentially insufficient fire storage and could potentially interfere with firefighters\u2019 ability to effectively stop a fire.\u201d</p><p>He added that freshet is still to come, but the city wants to be \u201cahead of the game.\u201d</p><p>High summer water demands are primarily the result of watering lawns and other residential irrigation needs, Niewenhuizen noted.</p><p>He added the city is criticized for its irrigation practices but it has changed them and has gone through all its parks.</p><p>The only fields it won\u2019t stop irrigating are sports fields, he said, as \u201cwe can\u2019t lose that infrastructure.\u201d</p><p>Water restrictions in splash parks will be at his discretion.</p><p>Ten new permanent signs will be going up around the community at the beginning of May, informing residents of the current stage of water restrictions.</p><p>They will have movable arrows that are adjusted with conditions. A small sign will also be set up at city hall.</p><p>Coun. Sylvia Lindgren asked if water restrictions will ever touch water usage inside homes.</p><p>It comes down to water meters and if the city goes with universal water metering at some point, the amount of water being used could be monitored, Niewenhuizen said.</p><p>Coun. Tim Lavery said he\u2019s a strong proponent of universal water meter-ing. He also likes the city\u2019s chart of water usage restrictions (see April 24 council agenda, pg. 109) that shows what practices are allowed as water usage moves into Stage 2 and 3. Coun. Kevin Flynn pointed to the city\u2019s strategic plan, which lists universal water metering as a longer range priority for 2028 to 2030.</p><p>He added it\u2019s up to everyone to monitor wasted water use as the system is complaint-based. He said he made a couple of calls last year about water running down the street in the middle of the day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALARM-news20230503PSHA0003546285</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALARM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6857-38S1-JD2C-J3C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438273</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"522\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

The Bouchie Lake resident was moved by the outpouring of effort by all the frontline wildfire fighters, this summer, and the emergency workers who respond to our times of greatest need.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Hey B.C\u2026.yeah, we're B.C. strong\u2026working together\u2026and we're standing tall,\" Strang's naturally bluesy voice growls. \"Neighbour helping neighbour\u2026just the B.C. way.\"</p><p>Strang is a prolific songwriter, and he frequently releases albums at a much faster clip than the big-label acts who take up all the commercial radio airspace. He's a DIY musician and loves his craft to the tune of four albums in the past three years, two of them in 2023 alone. But he admitted that his most recent two, Acoustic Crossroads and Digital Dust, took a lot out of him.</p><p>\"When Digital Dust was done, my cup was pretty much empty. It has taken awhile for that creative cup to fill again,\" he said. But he felt those sparks when the climax of the forest fire season was upon us, a few weeks ago. He grabbed his banjo and started rolling over the strings, he added some gritty electric guitar, he brushed on a little underlay of piano, and spattered it with a snappy snare drum. He called up his frequent vocal collaborator Laura Kelsey, with a chorus by Deb Strang, Gage Landrud, Shannah Yager and Sarah Eberle.</p><p>Whipping up a home-based song is what he wishes other musicians would do more of, to share the creative voice and sending out those vibes that music isn't held inside some unattainable elite production system. He's not even in a band, although he loves and appreciates his many collaborators. He has a part-time group of like-minded friends who call themselves Easy Act To Follow, but otherwise, Strang creates for the sake of his own fun and to share.</p><p>\"The whole gist of my music is positive songs that uplift people or give someone something to ponder on,\" he told The Observer. \"Global unity is important. As we travel together around the sun, let's be kind together and work together.\"</p><p>Some of his songs are sober examinations of the human condition. A track called Nothing came to him when he saw some graffiti on a cement wall where a mattress on the ground was clearly the sleeping spot for a homeless person. The graffiti drew a picture of what a room might look like, were that mattress indoors. Gone from Strang's lyrics were the pomp and sizzle of celebrating firefighters. Gone from the melody were the dancing bounces of joy. Nothing could stand as the national anthem for understanding those less fortunate, and an ode to appreciating the simple things in life. Dry eyes are a challenge, on first listening, with the picture of that graffiti staring back at you and the vibration of his lone cello across your heart.</p><p>But in the spirit of the great all-around entertainers of the world - Robin Williams, Charlie Chaplin, Sammy Davis, Carol Burnett - Strang plays all the notes of the human emotional instrument. In true pull-my-finger fashion, he loves to make the listener laugh, as well. While many songwriters turn their nose up at the comedy tune or the novelty song, in their pursuit of the serious hit, Strang channels his mirth for life into music. He loves Pick Your Nose and Crazy Ole Fart as much as Dark November Skies or Different Shade of Grey on his spectrum of songs.</p><p>He might be under the influence of instrument addiction. His home studio walls are hanging with a variety of string and wood, every corner touched by cables or keys.</p><p>\"I don't know how accomplished I am on any of them,\" he says, modestly. His latest addition is a National Tricone guitar, for its distinctive metallic jangle. It's one of only two in Canada, of that model. He found it at Rufus Guitar Shop in Vancouver where he also bought his beloved Martin J40 acoustic that he's played so often the surface has a thin spot where his hand has rubbed it down.</p><p>\"Any sound and style will take you one way. It will transcend you into a feeling or a mood where the song will sort of emerge out of the fog,\" he said.</p><p>He found his trusty electric guitar in the garbage bin after the fire at B&amp;B Music in Prince George in 2006, and only now does he think it might be finished its playing days.</p><p>And if you can't find what you're listening for, you make it. He turned himself into a luthier for one particular project, when his hunt for the rare banjola - a banjo-ukulele hybrid - came up empty. Fine. He built his own. Don't tell the elitists, but those sweet sounds he gets come out of a door skin and leftover pallet wood.</p><p>Strang releases most of his music to online radio and streaming services, and he gets updates on the many places around the world that play it for their listening audiences. He even gets some small royalty cheques, every so often.</p><p>But Strang is well aware that money is not the true musician's motivation. He simply says, \"It's a gift.\"</p><p>You can find him on YouTube and share the gifts yourself.</p><p>READ MORE: Live Quesnel music builds to spring crescendo</p><p>READ MORE: Quesnel's Tasquin uses music to convey connection as art form</p><p>***</p><p>Don't miss out on your local news.

raging in the northern parts of the province set more communities on high alert for new evacuation orders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Environment Canada issued smog warnings for wide swaths of the north, south and west of the province, including Montreal, Qu\u00e9bec, Laval, Longueuil and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Montreal and Ottawa, the air quality health index was listed at 10 or more, a level described as \"very high risk.\"</p><p>Environment Canada said the poor air quality will likely continue until Monday morning, adding the risk is highest for people with lung or heart disease, elderly people, children, pregnant women and those who work outdoors. </p><p>\"Stop any outdoor activities and contact your health care provider if you or someone in your care experience shortness of breath, wheezing (including asthma attacks), severe coughing, dizziness or chest pain,\" it wrote. \"If you experience any symptoms or feel unwell, stay indoors.\"</p><p>In Montreal, the smell of smoke lingered under yellow-gray skies as officials cancelled activities and urged people to stay indoors.</p><p>A triathlon in Montreal and an ironman race in Mont-Tremblant were both cancelled, along with local soccer and baseball matches.</p><p>Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said on Twitter that the fires in the province's north remain a concern, as does the smog.</p><p>\"Air quality is affected by smoke in all regions of Quebec,\" he wrote. \"It's best for people at risk to stay indoors and close your windows.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the 7,500 residents of the northern Quebec municipality of Chibougamau were on edge after being warned they may need to evacuate their homes for a second time this month as two out-of-control wildfires gain ground.</p><p>Officials have asked residents to stay vigilant and calm in case they have to leave, although they said Sunday that an evacuation order was not yet necessary.</p><p>In an afternoon update, Mayor Manon Cyr said the two fires remained 13 and 15 kilometres away from the \"trigger point\" that would give the municipality seven to 10 hours to carry out an orderly evacuation.</p><p>\"Right now, we're at a good distance from the fire,\" she said.</p><p>She said a rainy weather forecast for the next days was raising hopes the situation will improve, although she warned that \"I'll believe (in the rain) only when I see it.\"</p><p>Since Thursday, thousands of people have been asked to leave their homes in northern Quebec due to heavy smoke from the fires.</p><p>Those include the 2,000 or so residents of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, sectors of Senneterre and Val-d'Or in the northwest, as well as several smaller villages. </p><p>Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon councillor Denis Lemoyne said in an update that the smoke and temperature conditions were \"pretty intense,\" but officials were hopeful that calmer winds \"should give us a chance.\" The community was forced to asked residents to leave for a second time last week, only days after being allowed back home.</p><p>The Cree Nation of Mistissini said Saturday on its Facebook page that firefighting teams and armed forces were being forced to relocate as fires threaten an access road.</p><p>They said the community could also be at risk of \"heavy smoke and potential fire\" if unfavourable winds cause a worst-case scenario, and said it was providing buses to help those remaining in town to evacuate.</p><p>Several other communities have relocated vulnerable residents due to smoke risk.</p><p>St\u00e9phane Caron, a spokesman for the province's forest fire prevention agency, said the heavy smoke was limiting the ability of water bombers to fly

Firefighters always hope to get through spring. We come out of winter and the ground cover is dry, it's brown, the vegetation hasn't taken on much hydration.<br/><br/> \"We believe that climate change contributes to volatility,\" he said. \"We're seeing more severe storms than we've seen before. Winds are very important to us. We're seeing wind action that exacerbates fires, and certainly long dry spells are becoming more common in many regions.\"<br/><br/> By Monday morning, temperatures had dropped, and the wind had receded somewhat, shifting direction so the fire was moving back on itself, a small bit of good news, said Meldrum. But he characterized the fire as \"uncontrolled\" and said, with residents relocated, firefighters were prioritizing protecting homes and buildings still threatened by the fire. <br/><br/> Meldrum said there was no timeline for residents to return to their homes. Once fire crews do get the blaze contained, he said, there will still be days of mop-up work, stamping down any smoldering portions of the fire that might reignite the forest.<br/><br/> \"Traditionally, we want to get hose lines around the entire perimeter of a fire and have what's called a wet hose line around the perimeter. This is a big perimeter.\"<br/><br/> At the same time as wildfires burned outside of Halifax, Nova Scotia fire crews were also battling another, larger wildfire in Shelburne County, in the southwestern part of the province.<br/><br/> Provincial officials said the uncontrolled wildfire in the remote area around Barrington Lake had nearly tripled in size to 2,296 hectares by Monday morning, propelled by high winds and high temperatures.<br/><br/> Evacuation orders were also in place for several communities in that area along with highway closures.<br/><br/> Meanwhile, about 400 homes in southwestern New Brunswick had been evacuated because of forest fires that began Sunday after an all-terrain vehicle burst into flames. Mayor Brad Henderson of Saint Andrews, N.B., said the fires were burning near the towns of Bocabec and Chamcook, and that flames have destroyed one home.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">With files from The Canadian Press</emphasis><br/><br/> Steve McKinley is a Halifax-based reporter for the Star.
