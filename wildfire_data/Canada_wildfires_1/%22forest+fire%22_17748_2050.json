The shaded fuel break is expected to balance forestry and social values, mitigating risk to key community resources and creating a defensible location for wildfire crews and safe escape routes for the public.</p><p>The project involves a combination of manual and mechanical treatments, such as the removal of dead trees and reducing the number of trees through commercial thinning processes.

Though Oliver Paipoonge\u2019s fire departments is mainly dedicated to combating house fires and responding to vehicle collisions and other local emergencies, Horan said the wildfire concern has become a part of how it approaches future equipment needs, training and public education about fire prevention. He recalled a 2021 grass fire on Saari Road, which quickly grew to 100 hectares in size. The 2022 and 2023 wildfire seasons were light by comparison, even though much of the Northwest Territories and parts of Quebec were blanketed in smoke for weeks at a time. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening (fire-wise) on a national scale doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect what\u2019s happening in a municipality,\u201d Horan noted. Oliver Paipoonge operates six fire halls. The municipality\u2019s fire department covers an area of 350 square kilometres, with six pumper trucks, three tankers, six light-rescue vehicles and an array of other equipment at its disposal, including a side-by-side all-terrain vehicle with fire-fighting equipment on board. This summer, the municipality approved in principle an updated fire master plan, although no specific changes to the department have been finalized, Horan said. The fire department relies on about 40 volunteers, including Horan. It has so far this year responded to 450 calls for service, most of which were medical in nature, Horan said. More than 400 calls in a single year is on the high side, he added. Meanwhile, the Conservative government again last week came under fire for allegedly under-funding the provincial program for fighting forest fires and failing to address an acute staffing shortage. \u201cThe problem contributing to the poor retention of forest firefighters is that Ontario\u2019s wages are not in line with that of other provinces and nations,\u201d Independent MPP Mike Mantha said in a news release. \u201cOntario\u2019s wildfire fighters are classified and paid as resource technicians (who) are not generally exposed to the high-risk, harmful toxins, high-intensity flames and life-threatening situations that forest firefighters face,\u201d Mantha (Algoma-Manitoulin) said. Mantha added: \u201cWhat\u2019s more, they work to literal exhaustion for endless hours daily in remote locations under unbearably difficult conditions for months at a stretch with little to no time off.\u201d According to an Ontario Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services bulletin on Monday, there were eight wildfires burning across Northwestern Ontario, with three classified as under control and five \u201cbeing observed.\u201d The risk for new fires across the region is low, the bulletin added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-1ed38177feef467fb46294f6476778f6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69GB-F9F1-JBVR-33H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"524\"/><timeReceived>12:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 24, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As of Saturday evening, access to the area and many other forests was restricted by the provincial government. </p><p>\"At the moment, I don't know, because we don't have road access, so we can't go there. We can't fly over in a plane because of the smoke. I was in contact with SOPFEU and they're not flying over our sector anymore because they're concentrating their efforts on areas where people live, like Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon and Norm\u00e9tal,\" he said.   </p><p>June is his busiest month and peak fishing season, so the fires are a blow to his business. \"The longer it goes on, the more it threatens,\" he said. \"We had three years of pandemic and now we're hit again. It's very difficult.\"</p><p>He, too, thinks there should be government aid for those affected by the fires, like there was for those affected by recent flooding in the province. \"It's also a natural disaster. They should help people who are affected by the forest fires,\" Trudel said.</p><p>Asked about aid for outfitters, Quebec Natural Resources Minister Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Blanchette V\u00e9zina called the situation \"exceptional\" and said the government is reviewing existing support programs.</p><p>\"We don't want to let regional economies down,\" she told reporters in Quebec City. \"We will adapt quickly by adjusting our measures.\"</p><p>In Clova, Que., a small hamlet around 325 kilometres northwest of Montreal, residents and firefighters \u2014 along with a change in weather conditions \u2014 combined to avert disaster from a forest fire on Monday. But Jean-Lou Simard, co-owner of Caesars North Camps, said his fly-in fishing and hunting operations run out of the community are still in jeopardy.</p><p>\"As to how long this is going to last, I have the impression that we're talking about weeks, plural, so it's another heavy blow for us, there's no doubt,\" he said in an interview.</p><p>Many outfitters operate in Crown land zones that are managed by local non-profits, known as ZECs. Guillaume Ouellet, the president of the association that represents those groups, said that of the 63 zones in the province, 53 are in forests that have been closed. He said he was aware of active fires in just five zones as of Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 7, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-f00fe2c092664e068590d5f6b82c4902</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DG-HBV1-DY9S-T0VC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><timeReceived>08:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 7, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But now, the Star is winking out. On Friday, the owners announced that they will be shutting the paper down after years of financial hardship and a failed last-ditch effort to sell. Jim Butler has worked at the White Horse Star for 43 years. He has been its editor for 36. We reached him in Whitehorse, Yukon.</p><p><br/><br/>NK: Jim, 43 years is certainly a long time to be in any job. This one was, was a passion project for you. Can you -- at this point -- even imagine working anywhere else?<br/><br/>JIM BUTLER: It'll be very difficult. I joined the staff 43 years ago out of Montreal. I'm a product of Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce, originally. Thought I'd come up for two years, [NK chuckles] wound up staying 43 years and counting because it's such an interesting territory. And, doing something else at this stage is completely foreign. It'll be a huge adjustment. Should I do something else and not retire?<br/><br/>NK: This news was, was building for a while. You've known it was coming. When did you first find out? How did that hit you?<br/><br/>JB: Well, there was a small group of local investors negotiating for a possible sale of the paper, but it never came to fruition in the end. So it was mid last week the owners informed me what was planned and then the balance of the staff was informed later in the week. And we ran out that announcement on Friday saying thank you and farewell type thing.<br/><br/>NK: The Star had announced a new business strategy just at the beginning of the year. So, so what happened ultimately? Why is it not sustainable?<br/><br/>JB: It's just that there are so many negatives against the industry that the, the, the potential investors were willing to make a go of it. But you know how business things go. They just couldn't meet the price that the, the current owners were asking for. There's a lot of potential here, but -- of course -- money talks, eh? And it never came to fruition in the end.<br/><br/>NK: How's the staff handling the news?<br/><br/>JB: Oh, you know, it's no secret internally or even out in the community that things were not good Our full-page ads -- by local and major businesses -- were disappearing. Our flyers were gone. Classified ads were 99 per cent eliminated. Very significant fall lapse in Yukon government and City of Whitehorse advertising lineage. And the other damaging thing, Nil, carriers. People don't think of news carriers, but they were our lifeline to our paid circulation and distribution system. They were absolutely invaluable for us. And -- of course -- they disappeared a few years back. And the disintegration of that, you know, distribution system was very, very detrimental to our cause. Because if someone doesn't happen to go into a store for the couple of days your average issue sat in the newsstands, you don't sell that issue.<br/><br/>NK: It's one of the, the last independent newspapers there. What do you think that's going to mean for telling stories in, in the community?<br/><br/>JB: Well, Whitehorse is about 32,000 people. And it's very fortunate to have several radio stations and still three more newspapers -- smaller newspapers -- to, to bring people the news. The thing that, the whole tragedy of this is -- I think -- is the, historic nature of the Star. It was one of the oldest businesses in the territory -- 124 years. Believe it or not -- Nil -- it began in a tent in Bennett, B.C. in 1899. And then the White Pass Railway was put through from Skagway, Alaska to Whitehorse, and the owners of the time thought it made much more sense to come to Whitehorse. And we've been here ever since. But there have been some amazing stories over those decades.<br/><br/>NK: Which ones do you think the paper -- the Whitehorse Star -- will be remembered for?<br/><br/>JB: Well, there was the famous Helen Klaben story. She and her pilot, in a small plane crashed near Watson Lake, southeast Yukon, in 1963 and were stranded in the wilderness for 49 days, and they were found alive, believe it or not. That made Life magazine with Whitehorse Star photos. Robert F Kennedy, in 1965, he came here to a scale Mount Kennedy, which had been named after his slain brother John. Once again, the Star got those photos -- exclusive photos -- and they made Life magazine. Just so many amazing stories. In June of 1991, we were almost wiped out by a forest fire. Only a change in the wind saved the city. Dawson City flooded to incredible extent in 1979. So many historic buildings destroyed.<br/><br/>NK: Story after story. What about ones for you? I mean, you were around for some of those. The later ones, certainly. [JB chuckles] But are there ones that, are there ones that that stay with you that you have framed or, or in a folder that you keep close?<br/><br/>JB: One of my favourite ones was in 1986 -- that was two years before I became editor -- Eric Nielsen suddenly resigned as Brian Moroney's deputy prime minister. And he retreated to his haven in Quiet Lake, Yukon. And he wasn't talking to any levels of media, national, local, nothing. So Mike Hornibrook of CBC Whitehorse at the time and the Star, we chartered a float plane, flew into Quiet Lake about a half hour flight from Whitehorse, landed, we got onto his property and started going up the hill to where he was, and suddenly, Eric came out on his deck and said, no, I'm not going to talk to you. And we tried to reason with him for a few minutes, but he would not speak to us. So we finally gave up, and we were retreating to our float plane when Eric suddenly yells out. Jim, I saw a bear in the area 15 minutes ago, so you better watch it. And I thanked him profusely, sincerely, because I'd known him for years in advance. He was doing me a favour. We got on our float plane safely without being mauled and flew off again. But that sticks in my memory.<br/><br/>NK: [chuckling] Oh yeah, I bet it would. Why wouldn't it? Well, you know, you mentioned the other outlets. Are you, are you going to work somewhere else? Is this, is this the start of a new path for you? Are you going to go back to Quebec?<br/><br/>JB: No, I think I'll stay in the Yukon. I own a nice piece of property here. As a matter of fact, last Thursday evening I was, I laid out a few pages alone in the building for the Friday edition, then went home and walked to the riverbank where I have a great view of the wonderful river called the Takhini River. And I just reflected on things. And I said to myself, the river is going to flow on, life will go on and I'll just have to have a major personal adjustment in life and decide what to do next. I don't know what I'll do next yet. It's been too soon to make any, any firm plans.<br/><br/>NK: Well that's beautiful -- Jim -- how you put it. A storyteller always, clearly. Thank you.<br/><br/>JB: Thank you for your interest in the Star, Nil. Nice chatting with you.<br/><br/>NK: Likewise, Jim. Take care.<br/><br/>CH: Jim Butler is the editor of the Whitehorse Star. Its last edition will run on May 17th. We reached him in Whitehorse, Yukon.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCBCT-AIH2404086</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCBCT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BS6-K9J1-F0BD-C005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487018</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1167\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

While primary residences have seemingly been missed so far, some outbuildings, recreational areas, and agricultural values have been lost, as has a great deal of timber.</p><p>The weather turned the situation more favourable, this week compared to last. On Monday (July 17), the Cariboo Regional District was able to downgrade several evacuation orders to alerts, as cooler temperatures and some rain aided the firefighting efforts. Residents in the Pelican Lake, Teepee Lake (partial), Lhoosk'uz, and Townsend Creek areas were able to return home but still advised to be at the ready to flee again should conditions change. The Branch Road forest fire complex is also causing ongoing evacuation alerts.</p><p>The helpful rain early in the week has now dissipated. The latter part of this week is expected to bring warm, dry air so firefighters have to battle hard during the window of opportunity provided by the cooler, wetter conditions.</p><p>There are 19 active fires in the Quesnel Zone of the Cariboo Fire Centre region. Three of them are listed as Wildfires of Note.</p><p>Fire protection officials urge all residents to Register for the emergency notification system at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cariboord.ca/register\">www.cariboord.ca/register</url>.

So many Cowichan citizens know they must decarbonize; that is, burn a lot less fossil fuels \u2014 starting now, not in 2050.</p><p>I use the word \u201cmust\u201d not to annoy readers, but because many elected municipal councils have declared a climate emergency. If we must pull over for a rushing ambulance, then we must likewise stop burning gas, oil, or wood. Climate chaos is also an emergency.</p><p>One action many can take is to install solar panels, whenever and wherever possible. Free photon energy from the sun emits vastly less carbon gases than fossil fuels, and even hydro.</p><p>Injecting solar\u2019s cheap energy into the electric grid would accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. Because in our competitive market, cleaner and cheaper solar will replace dirty fossil fuels. Electric heat pumps provide cheaper and cleaner heat than furnaces.</p><p>And so my congratulations to the many Cowichan citizens who are participating in BC Hydro\u2019s net metering program which allows solar panels on rooftops or backyards. In this way, clean electricity is injected into both homes and the publiclyowned electric grid.</p><p>Unfortunately, future climate disasters are guaranteed unless we decarbonize more rapidly. Therefore, we should vastly expand Hydro\u2019s program. If you have a house, put solar panels on the roof \u2014 the federal government may give you $5,000 cash. You will make money.</p><p>And if your home is under a shady tree or is an apartment, ask your local councillor to encourage community solar co-operatives or to vote for a public solar utility \u2014 both ideas will make money.</p><p>Buying solar panels is an investment, not a cost. You get a financial pay back of over eight per cent per year. And yes, that little bit of electricity will only minimally reduce the climate chaos; but it\u2019s a meaningful personal action you can take against climate change. How do I know this? Because China gets 50 per cent of its vast solar electricity network from the cumulative impact of individual rooftop solar panels, compared with B.C. \u2019s tiny 0.06 per cent. Clearly there is huge potential for supplying more clean electricity with our many empty roofs and abundant sunshine.</p><p>But this climate emergency will take that sunshine away unless every individual takes action \u2014 our health will go down and our taxes will go up. For that reason, I believe it\u2019s OK for me to say that you \u201cmust\u201d install solar panels, as soon as possible and wherever you can. It\u2019s a socially responsible action.</p><p>When you install solar, you will improve lives in the future, and make money in the now.</p><p>NOTE:Please join us at a free solar information workshop with contractors and guest speakers; to be held at the Heritage Hall, Cowichan Community Centre, Friday, Dec. 1, 7.30 p.m. Contact <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:pgnix47@gmail.com\">pgnix47@gmail.com</email> for further information.</p><p>Peter Nix, Cowichan Carbon Buster Maple Bay</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECG-news20231019PQSA0003954140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECG2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69F4-HJY1-JD2C-J2JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"488\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

A total of 865 people have been evacuated from Pikangikum First Nation, with the other people being housed in Sudbury, Sioux Lookout and Thunder Bay.  </p><p>As of Monday afternoon, there were 111 active forest fires in the northwestern region of the province. </p><p>\u201cI just call it a normal evacuation. There\u2019s nothing spectacular and we\u2019re looking at the community\u2019s needs and what supports we can put in place to help with that,\u201d Laughren said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got good staff, good community partnership support.\u201d </p><p>The evacuees are staying at The Ramada Inn. The Timmins Police Service (TPS) has issued a traffic advisory with the increased pedestrian traffic in the city\u2019s west end. </p><p>Laughren said there are healthcare supports in place and recreational activities and games going on for evacuated children and youth. </p><p>\u201cWe have basketball nets set up. We\u2019ve got hockey sticks, we\u2019ve got YMCA people from the CDSSAB helping to support the activities for the kids. We try to ensure we have movies, entertainment to keep them active and keep them busy,\" he said. </p><p>The Cochrane District Social Services Administration Board (CDSSAB) is also looking for summer clothing donations for the evacuees. </p><p>About 50 per cent of the evacuees are people under 18, according to the fire chief. Out of about 150 people, Laughren estimated there are about 20 people who are aged 30 and over, about 70 people are under the age of 10, and about 30 to 40 people between 10 and 20 years old. </p><p>A state of emergency has also been declared in the city. According to the fire chief, it's more administrative and is not related to COVID-19. </p><p>\u201cA lot of it is for awareness, not only for the community that has to evacuate as well as our own community. It helps with the supports,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything you can do to help get the message out, to make people more aware, is a good thing for sure.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s unknown how long the evacuees will be staying in Timmins. </p><p>At this time, the city is not looking to host more evacuees as it\u2019s at the capacity based on the services and supports available within the community, according to Laughren </p><p>\"I'm sure it's not easy for the people who evacuated. They've got community concerns and everything else, so we try to work with them as much as we can to alleviate that,\" he said. </p><p>Timmins has been a host community for evacuations for a number of years.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-db7cddbf330f43fb97699b13edae48b5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6366-KYS1-DY9S-T3BM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"435\"/><timeReceived>02:43 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 20, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001196</classCode><className>NATIVE AMERICANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFTB</classCode><className>STATES OF EMERGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DNU3</classCode><className>SPORTING GOODS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000171</classCode><className>BASKETBALL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DNU3</classCode><className>SPORTING GOODS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

However, the wildfire season isn\u2019t yet over.</p><p>As of Thursday, 370 people are on evacuation order and more than 18,000 remain on alert. Conditions continue to be challenging in northern B.C. , with 125 active fires in the Prince George Fire Centre.</p><p>\u201cWhile the provincial state of emergency is no longer required, the wildfire season is not over. Many communities still have local states of emergency in place and the expiration of the provincial state of emergency does not impact wildfire-fighting resources or our ability to continue to provide emergency supports to communities,\u201d explained Ma.</p><p>There are still 600 out-of-province wildfire personnel currently helping with wildfire response, and the province is continuing to coordinate additional resources through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>The province first declared the state of emergency on Aug. 18. At the time, roughly 5,000 properties provincewide were on evacuation order, mostly in the Okanagan, Cariboo and Boston Bar areas.</p><p>During the state of emergency, the province enacted an order Aug. 19 to make accommodation available for evacuees in several communities in the central Interior and the southeast. B.C. banned non-essential travel to six Okanagan communities. The ban was lifted Aug. 25.</p><p>Ma extended the state of emergency once on Aug. 31 for an additional two weeks when nearly 70,000 people were on evacuation order or alert.</p><p>This year has been the worst wildfire season on record, with more than 2.3 million hectares burned.</p><p>Meanwhile, the province is issuing a local state of emergency for the Stikine region to maintain an evacuation order in the area. It\u2019s in effect for 14 days, and can be extended or rescinded as necessary.</p><p>B.C. issued an evacuation order for the area on Aug. 26 on the recommendation of BC Wildfire Service due to the Little Blue River wildfire.</p><p>The Little Blue River wildfire was first discovered July 6 and is an estimated 60,064.12 hectares as of Sept. 14.</p><p>The area extending north from Wheeler Lake to Blue River Bridge, south of Wheeler Lake to the Beaver Dam Rest Area, west of Highway 37, and to the east of Highway 37 (to two kilometres east of the confluence of the Blue and Dease rivers) remains under evacuation order. However, no primary residences have been identified within in the area.</p><p>It\u2019s B.C. \u2019s only unincorporated region, so the province is responsible for implementing evacuation orders for the region</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FREPRS-news20230921PQEA0003887913</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FREPRS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6975-BCH1-F0HF-80HB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438278</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"448\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Reporter Sarah Simpson has been combing through old newspapers with the assistance of the Kaatza Station Museum and Archives so we can jog your memory, give you that nostalgic feeling, or just a chuckle, as we take a look at what was making headlines this week around Cowichan Lake in years gone by.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week around the Cowichan Lake area\u2026 10 years ago \u201cFields set to open in Lake Cowichan\u201d was a headline in the Sept 4, 2013 edition of the Lake Cowichan Gazette.</p><p>\u201cThe store, which will stock items for all your family needs, is in a well known location and even comes with a well known manager. Val [Rajala] spent 29 years working in the building when it was doing business as the Co-op. The staff are excited to be opening the store in Lake Cowichan and look forward to seeing, and serving, all the area residents. As with all new openings, sometimes the best laid plans go awry, so the staff suggest you watch for the \u2018Now Open\u2019 signs to appear on the store later this week.\u201d</p><p>In other new beginnings of a decade ago, \u201cNew totes coming soon to a curbside near you\u201d was an Ashley Degraaf headline.</p><p>\u201cFolks living in the Youbou, Mesachie Lake and Honeymoon Bay areas can expect delivery of a new easy-roller recycling tote as well as a garbage tote this September. It\u2019s part of the regional district\u2019s new curbside collection program, \u2018The new blue recycling tote will replace all yellow and blue bags previously used for recycling,\u2019 explained superintendent of solid waste operations Jason Adair in a press release. \u2018Electoral areas currently receiving garbage collection will also receive a new grey tote to be used for garbage.\u2019 Under the new program, residents\u2019 current services will stay the same, but at a lower annual fee. Curbside bills have already been reduced by between $1 and $11, depending on the electoral area.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Automated curbside collection systems are in place throughout the province and have been very successful at increasing worker safety, increasing efficiency, and boosting recycling rates by as much as 30%,\u2019 Adair said. \u2018It\u2019s a significant step towards achieving our goal of Zero Waste and has the added benefit of lowering current operating costs, as reflected in the user fees.\u2019\u201d</p><p>25 years ago It was dry back then, too. Twenty-five years ago the top headline on the front of the Sept. 9, 1998 Lake News was \u201cTinder dry area woods pose major fire hazard\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real danger of forest fire in the Cowichan Valley, warns Fire Chief Dick Newman. People should be aware that fires have been banned throughout the area.</p><p>\u201c\u2018A forest fire can get away from you so quickly that it\u2019s hard to believe,\u2019 said the Chief, who has had a good deal of experience with them.</p><p>The forests around the Lake are tinder dry. Labour Day weekend, with campsites crowded, was potentially dangerous but the risk will continue until there is substantial rain. Despite the extreme hazard, some people are still lighting fires. Last week Lake Cowichan firemen were called to a big campfire apparently on private property in the Marble Bay area. When they spoke to him, the property owner put the fire out. But not everyone is as co-operative. On Friday, their warnings were ignored at another campfire in Lake Cowichan. \u2018We called the police,\u2019 said the chief.\u201d</p><p>And a story from the \u201cwhat the heck!?\u201d files, from the same edition, headlined:\u201cA nude at the museum\u201d.</p><p>\u201cSex and nudity running rampant at the Kaatza Station Museum? Whatever next? Well maybe not really sex, and not quite rampant. But nudity, definitely. There is a man in town who shall nameless, whose nude photo can be seen at the Museum. He knows it is there and doesn\u2019t mind a bit, says curator Barbara Simkins. It\u2019s a baby picture, not taken very recently.\u201d</p><p>What an odd little page 2 story. There was no other context and that was the entire story as it ran.</p><p>40 years ago The Lake News of Sept. 7, 1983 had a lot happening on the front page.</p><p>\u201cBig changes as schools back\u201d, \u201cLoggers set for strike vote\u201d and \u201cDeveloper appeal foes to minister on Black 28 plan\u201d were all headlines.</p><p>First, the school situation:\u201cCowichan Lake district students and teachers returned to the classroom yesterday but it may take a while before everyone is accustomed to the new surroundings. Many local schools underwent a shift during the summer and have emerged in new guises. Little kindergarten and Grade 1 students could be seen in the halls of Palsson School Tuesday as the school begins its first year as a primary school housing Grades 1-4, while at A.B. Greenwell School, Grade 4 students who would normally have left for Palsson this year find themselves kings of the hill at their old haunt. Stanley Gordon School has become a true \u2018middle school\u2019 this year with transitional Grades 5, 6 and 7 in residence. Grade 8 students, meanwhile, will now attend classes at Lake Cowichan Secondary School with Grades 9, 10, 11 and 12.\u201d</p><p>Next up the strike vote:\u201cAbout 1,000 loggers and mill-workers in the Cowichan Lake district will take a strike vote this week, joining their counterparts across the province in deciding whether to strike. The workers, members of the International Woodworkers of America, will be asked to support their negotiating team in a rejection of the latest contract offer from Forest Industrial Relations the group that negotiates for the companies.\u201d</p><p>Finally, the development:\u201cRed Cedar Estates will appeal to Municipal Affairs Minister Bill Ritchie to use his influence in cabinet so that an application to bring the company\u2019s Block 28 property into the Village of Lake Cowichan is not delayed further.</p><p>\u201c\u2018We\u2019ll make a personal appeal to the minister,\u2019 Bob Hardy of Wright, Hillyard and Parry \u2014 a Duncan surveying and engineering firm \u2014 said Tuesday. His company has been handling plans for a prospective development of the land. Hardy said a letter would be sent to Ritchie this week.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECG-news20230907PQSA0003853329</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECG2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6945-RKY1-F0HF-80RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"978\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

The same was true for June.</p><p>Most Brazilian blazes are manmade, often started illegally by land-grabbers clearing forest for cattle or crops. Fires tend to begin increasing in June and peak in September, according to historical data. They can easily get out of control during the dry season, burning large swaths of forest to the ground.</p><p>Brazil is home to the world\u2019s largest rainforest and tropical wetlands \u2014 the Amazon and Pantanal \u2014 which saw dramatic fires in 2019 and 2020, respectively, that caused the greatest annual forest loss since 2015. That drew global criticism of the response from the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly called for development of the region. </p><p>This year, it\u2019s the Cerrado savanna stretching across Brazil\u2019s center-west region that is suffering more than usual. An area almost as big as Connecticut and New Jersey burned there in the first seven months of 2021.</p><p>Ane Alencar, science director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, said in a July 27 online panel that there have been fewer Amazon fires this year due to cool weather, which limits fire's potential to spread. But deforestation remains on par with the last two years, so much dry material remains on the ground waiting to be burned, she added.</p><p>\u201cI am afraid about the coming months,\u201d said Alencar, who is also coordinator of MapBiomas Fogo, which compiles data on deforestation and fires across the region. \u201cWhen this cold front goes away, the vegetation will be drier and then we will have warmer temperatures. ... I\u2019m not sure that the people who cut down the forest will not light it.\u201d</p><p>Citing heightened hazard due to Brazil\u2019s worst drought in nine decades, the Justice and Environment ministries on July 22 announced a task force to prevent and investigate fires in 11 states of the Amazon, Pantanal and Cerrado biomes. Some 6,000 people, including federal and state police and firefighters, as well as state public security and environmental officials will participate in the effort, according to a statement. </p><p>On June 29, Bolsonaro decreed redeployment of soldiers to the Amazon to combat fires and deforestation, and also issued a 120-day ban on unauthorized outdoor fires. </p><p>Similar measures in previous years didn't prevent illegal fires, however. More than 90% of the Pantanal hot spots detected in 2020 came after a similar presidential ban, according to Vin\u00edcius Silgueiro, coordinator of territorial intelligence at the Center of Life Institute in Mato Grosso state. </p><p>\u201cThe sense of impunity is very high. Enforcement is well below what is necessary,\u201d Silgueiro said.</p><p>In Mato Grosso state, half of whose territory is in the Amazon, the federal and state governments last year began coordinating actions to put an end to overlap that frequently left other areas unmanned and vulnerable, according to Mauren Lazzaretti, the state's environment secretary.</p><p>The state is also purchasing a helicopter and plans to deploy dozens of planes loaned by Pantanal farmers and businesses to drop fire retardant onto blazes.</p><p>Last year, over 4 million hectares (about 15,000 square miles) of the Pantanal went up in flames, or about 27% its area \u2014 by far the most since official record-keeping began in 2003. While the biome regenerates quickly, unlike rainforest, fires often kill local wildlife, such as jaguars, caimans and giant otters.</p><p>\u201cThe size of the fires last year drew society's attention to the component of individual responsibility,\u201d Lazzaretti said. \u201cThe engagement of cities, farmers and even traditional and Indigenous communities is much greater this year.\u201d </p><p>The year before, fires in the Amazon roused global concern, and several European governments openly criticized Bolsonaro\u2019s administration. Bolsonaro countered that fires nationwide and in the Amazon, while up from 2018, were roughly in line with the average of the preceding several years and were down sharply from 15 years earlier. He called on European leaders to mind their own backyards. </p><p>Earlier studies showed the Amazon absorbs about 2 billion of the 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide the world emits into the atmosphere each year, making it an important part of the global effort to curb climate change. But a study led by the Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation,  published in Nature on July 14 \u2014  spanning 10 years and involving nearly 600 flyovers \u2014 found the dry season's intensification and increased deforestation had caused more fires and higher carbon emissions. The southeastern part of the Amazon, particularly ravaged by logging, has become a net source of carbon. </p><p>Paulo Artaxo, professor of environmental physics at the University of Sao Paulo and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said other recent studies have shown even the more preserved western Amazon region is now carbon neutral in terms of emissions, while a few years ago, it was a carbon sink.</p><p>Carlos Nobre, a prominent climatologist, says Brazil\u2019s Amazon is nearing a \u201ctipping point,\" after which the thick jungle will cease to generate enough moisture to sustain its current form and will begin transforming into tropical savanna.</p><p>Nobre said Bolsonaro's government has yet to demonstrate any encouraging change in approach to help save the rainforest.</p><p>The federal government \u201ccontinues incentivizing organized crime in the Amazon that is responsible for the theft of timber, illegal deforestation and fires,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who practice these crimes haven't given any sign of worry that enforcement will become rigorous. They continue to feel rather empowered.\u201d ___ \u00c1lvares is based in Brasilia.

Not all of them, just those that cheer for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Toronto Blue Jays and Buffalo Bills.</p><p><br/><br/> Scientific name: Kicktus Indagutsalot.<br/><br/> While Boston gets six Super Bowls, four World Series titles and a Stanley Cup championship this millennium - and Tampa gets three Stanley Cups and a Super Bowl - fans around here consistently get the athletic equivalent of a flaming sack of dog doo left on their front porch.<br/><br/> These are folks who read \"Old Yeller\" and \"Marley And Me\" because they have happier endings than their team's seasons. They look enviously at fans of the Mudville Nine because Casey only struck out once. And when they go in for valve repair, they don't require anesthetic because they're so used to having their hearts ripped out of their chest.<br/><br/> These are a cursed people. The target of the wrath of some angry sports god. Victims of a giant cosmic joke.<br/><br/> It's not that their teams always stink. That they could deal with because with putridity comes no expectations and no optimism that this will finally be their year. Just a dull ache that can generally be ignored. See: Arizona Coyotes.<br/><br/> No, it's the opposite. All these teams do pretty well - often really well - only to wait until the key moment to concoct the most painful way possible to hurt their fans. Inflicting agony year after year. Build hope, get crushed. Build hope, get crushed. Build hope, get crushed. Build hope ...<br/><br/> For seven years the Toronto Maple Leafs have finished near the top of the NHL standings only to hit the playoffs and belly flop more often than the fat guys lined up poolside at spring break.<br/><br/> That 4-1 lead against the Bruins in Game 7 - if you're a Leafs' fan, you need no more information to know exactly what this means - was soul-sucking. Losing to the irrelevant Columbus Blue Jackets in the playoffs added to the grief. Losing to the archrival Montreal Canadiens when they had a 3-1 series lead was a firm kick in the junk. And on and on and on.<br/><br/> And we won't even mention David Ayres.<br/><br/> The Blue Jays should've won it all in 2015. They could've won in 2016. Who knows what happens last season if the decision makers don't have an analytics-based brain fart and pull their starter who was pitching brilliantly in a winner-take-all game, only to replace him with a guy who promptly blew it. <br/><br/> They've been in three playoff series in the past four years and have zero wins. Not series wins. Zero victories.<br/><br/> And we won't even mention Shohei Otani.<br/><br/> Since their last championship in 1999, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats have been in four Grey Cups and lost them all. Worse is how they fell. They were pulverized by Saskatchewan in 2013, had a game-winning touchdown called back for a penalty in 2014, and lost in overtime at home in 2021. After a receiver dropped a pass in the end zone with six seconds left in regulation time that would've won it.<br/><br/> And we won't even mention Henry Burris-to-Greg Ellingson.<br/><br/> Then there are the Buffalo Bills.<br/><br/> Yes, we know they're not located in southern Ontario, but considering how many people around here are part of BillsMafia - the name given to their supporters - they may as well be. It's a team with one of the greatest fanbases anywhere. Yet a franchise that seemingly only exists to torment and torture its supporters.<br/><br/> This is a team whose failures are so legendary they have names. Recognizable names. Wide Right, 13 Seconds, The Music City Miracle, the Three-Pass Game, the K.C. OT Coin Flip, Super Bowl XXVI, Super Bowl XXVII, Super Bowl XXVIII. We're probably forgetting a few.<br/><br/> And now Sunday night's entry. Wide Right II. Or Wide Right 2.0. Or Wide Right: The Sequel. Whatever. A long, jagged sliver shoved under their fingernail would be less painful.<br/><br/> Perhaps we should throw the Buffalo Sabres into the mix while we're at it, since there are some fans of that side here, too. Still the only team to lose a Stanley Cup on an illegal goal.<br/><br/> The worst part of all this for the folks who live and die with these outfits? Knowing it's going to happen again. And again. And again.<br/><br/> And then again and again and again and again and again and again and again and ... ah, you know.<br/><br/> There are other fan bases that haven't won recently. Folks who support the Cleveland Browns and Guardians come to mind. But none has experienced the creative ways of having despair dropped on them like they're a forest fire and the universe is a waterbomber as fans of the Sorrowful Four.<br/><br/> Which is why, from now on, every ticket purchased to any of these team's games should come with a coupon for free therapy.<br/><br/> Or just a hug. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2024012570416025</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B60-15D1-JDV5-F0MF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

It was thought poor air quality may continue into early next week.</p><p>According to Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services Northeast Fire Region, we are seeing heavy smoke conditions in the Northeast Region due to a large number of fires in the northwestern Ontario and Quebec. Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.</p><p>Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.</p><p>See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.</p><p>For more details, please consult canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html.</p><p>Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.</p><p>People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.</p><p>Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.</p><p>Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.</p><p>If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.</p><p>Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.</p><p>If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.</p><p>Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.</p><p>Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.</p><p>If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA.</p><p>Visit airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.</p><p>Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for Almaguin, and here for North Bay - West Nipissing areas.</p><p>Lead</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20230619TMAC2023061968240313</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68HB-1001-JDV5-F36G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

In concrete terms, this means a significant increase in the amounts of several deductions, tax credits and tax assistance for individuals. This indexation, which exceeds the forecast inflation rate for the same period, represents $2.0billion per year to the benefit of all Quebecers.</p><p>The indexation will correspond to an average amount of $282 per taxpayer for2024.</p><p> $1.8B to provide better access to housing</p><p>Given the current housing shortage, and in order to make housing more accessible, the government plans to invest $1.8billion over the next five years to build 8000new social and affordable housing units and help lower-income households find housing.</p><p>This sum will be used to build 7500units as part of the Qu\u00e9bec affordable housing program and the partnership with tax-advantaged funds, as well as 500units reserved for homeless people.</p><p>In addition, $107million is earmarked to help lower-income households find housing, by granting 4000new units under the Rent Supplement Program and enhancing the Shelter Allowance Program.</p><p> $145M to combat homelessness and enhance food aid</p><p>In response to the worrying rise in homelessness, the government will invest $124million over five years to increase emergency assistance, enhance support for culturally safe services for Indigenous people experiencing homelessness, and promote social reintegration to prevent people from falling into homelessness. These measures are in addition to the 500new housing units planned for homeless people.</p><p>An additional $21million is also being allocated this year to food aid organizations.</p><p> $329M to support training in specific fields</p><p>To counter the labour shortage, the government will invest an additional $329million over the next twoyears to support training in priority areas. This sum will be used to launch the Offensive formation en construction, which aims to increase the supply of workers in this important sector, and to support the attractiveness of the public health and social services network, in particular by supporting accelerated training for patient-care attendants.</p><p> $961M to sustain the climate transition and communities</p><p>The economic and financial update also makes it possible to take action to sustain the climate transition and communities through measures totalling $961million over the next five years.</p><p>Of this amount, $292million will support climate change adaptation initiatives and mitigate the risks associated with forest fire. In addition, $404million will help support communities and the forestry sector in response to forest fires in summer2023.</p><p>Lastly, an additional $265million in emergency assistance is planned in 2023-2024 to support the recovery of public transit.</p><p> $995M to foster business investment and increase economic potential</p><p>Ambitious objectives have been set for creating wealth and increasing economic potential, and the actions taken in recent years in this area are paying off. The wealth gap with Ontario has narrowed significantly, from 16.1% to 13.5% between 2018 and 2022.</p><p>The government intends to continue its efforts to eliminate this gap by 2036. Over the past few months, the Minist\u00e8re des Finances du Qu\u00e9bec has therefore consulted experts from the private sector and universities to identify levers for increasing Qu\u00e9bec's economic potential. The experts proposed a variety of investment solutions to close the gap in living standards between Qu\u00e9bec and its main trading partners. The main findings and recommendations are presented in this update.</p><p>To address some of these recommendations today, including those aimed at promoting business investment and simplifying the tax system, the government is announcing that it will enhance the investment and innovation tax credit. This measure will represent $1.3billion over the next five years.</p><p> Economic growth adjusted downward for 2024</p><p>The persistence of inflation and high interest rates will dampen economic activity this year and next in most economies, and Qu\u00e9bec will be no exception. For 2023, projected economic growth in Qu\u00e9bec (0.6%) is similar to what was forecast last March. For 2024, economic activity is adjusted downward, from 1.4% to 0.7%.</p><p> Commitment to return to a balanced budget in 2027-2028 maintained</p><p>Despite the expected economic slowdown, the government is maintaining the budget targets set out in the plan to return to fiscal balance tabled in March2023.</p><p>The adjustments related to the budgetary situation and those resulting from the implementation of targeted actions have a negative impact of about $1.0billion per year over the period covered by the financial framework. In this context, part of the contingency reserve will be used to meet the targets that have been set. As a result, the deficit will be limited to $4.0billion in 2023-2024, after deposits of dedicated revenues in the Generations Fund, and will then be gradually reduced by $1.0billion per year until a balanced budget is achieved in 2027-2028.</p><p> Objective of reducing the debt burden maintained</p><p>Reducing the debt burden continues to be a priority for the government, since it contributes positively to economic growth through the creation of a climate of confidence conducive to private investment and productivity growth, and also promotes intergenerational equity. The net debt burden will stand at 37.9% of GDP as at March31,2024, a lower level than before the pandemic. The objective of reducing the net debt burden to 30% of GDP by 2037 2038 is maintained.</p><p> Quotation:</p><p>\"Our responsible management of public finances allows us to take targeted action to meet the priorities of Quebecers and increase Qu\u00e9bec's economic potential, while maintaining our objectives of returning to a balanced budget and reducing the debt burden.\"</p><p>Eric Girard, Minister of Finance and Minister Responsible for Relations with English-Speaking Quebecers</p><p> Highlights:Investments totalling an additional $4.3 billion over the next five years to respond in a targeted way to the priorities of Quebecers.Indexation by $2 billion per year of the tax system and social assistance benefits for Quebecers.Construction of 8 000 new social and affordable housing units, including 500 for homeless people.$145 million to combat homelessness and enhance food aid.$329 million to notably implement the Offensive formation en construction and support accelerated training for patient-care attendants.$696 million to sustain climate change adaptation initiatives, mitigate the risks associated with forest fire and support the forestry sector.Additional assistance of $265 million in 2023-2024 for public transit.Wealth gap with Ontario narrowed from 16.1% to 13.5% between 2018 and 2022.Consultation with experts from the private sector and universities to identify levers for increasing Qu\u00e9bec's economic potential.Enhancement of the investment and innovation tax credit and simplification of the investment tax assistance plan.Despite a global economic slowdown from which Qu\u00e9bec is not immune, the government maintains its objectives of returning to a balanced budget in 2027-2028 and reducing the net debt burden to 30% of GDP by 2037-2038.Projected economic growth in 2023 in Qu\u00e9bec (0.6%) similar to last March's forecast.

It was thought poor air quality may continue into early next week.<br/><br/> According to Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services Northeast Fire Region, we are seeing heavy smoke conditions in the Northeast Region due to a large number of fires in the northwestern Ontario and Quebec. Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.<br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.<br/><br/> See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.<br/><br/> For more details, please consult canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html.<br/><br/> Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.<br/><br/> People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.<br/><br/> Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.<br/><br/> Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.<br/><br/> If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.<br/><br/> If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.<br/><br/> Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.<br/><br/> Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.<br/><br/> If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA.<br/><br/> Visit airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.<br/><br/> Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for Almaguin, and here for North Bay - West Nipissing areas. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023061968240313</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68H8-7361-F197-5469-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"729\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

(\"PEGA-V\") - Samples up to 4.7 g/t Au and Identifies New Gold Bearing Quartz Vein - At Punch Bowl Property</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pegasus Resources Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"Pegasus\") is pleased to announce the analytical results from its 2023 ground exploration program at the Punch Bowl Property, Golden Project in east-central British Columbia (See news release October 06, 2023). Exploration Highlights: - Abbreviated late fall reconnaissance program included 25 rock samples, with seven (7) having returned greater than 0.13 g/t Au - Three samples returned values of 4.70 g/t Au, 3.87 g/t Au and 1.61 g/t Au - The 2023 samples extended mineralization of the gold bearing quartz vein set to approximately 200 m along strike - Located previously unsampled mineralized quartz vein(s) on McGilvary Ridge A late fall exploration program was carried out at the companies Punch Bowl Property, on October 6th and 7th, 2023, with a total of 25 grab samples collected (Figure 1). Due to the unprecedented Forest Fire activity across Canada in 2023, the company was limited to an abbreviated exploration program which had been scheduled for earlier in the field season. Samples targeted pyrite-bearing quartz veins within northwest-southeast trending recessive phyllitic lenses that have historically returned elevated gold values of up to 573.7 g/t Au (Shaw, 1989). Overall, the program was successful in extending mineralization along strike of known auriferous veins, in addition to locating a previously unsampled mineralized quartz vein. </p><p>\"The Company is greatly encouraged by the results from the exploration campaign at the Punch Bowl Property,\" stated Chris Timmins, President and CEO of Pegasus. \"The assays show that the mineralization observed within the quartz veins is relatively continuous along strike, and the newly discovered quartz vein displays the potential for multiple mineralized zones on McGillivray Ridge. We look forward to continuing to advance this project during the summer of 2024.\" About the Golden Project: The Golden Project is comprised of three distinct claim groups, from south to North, Gold Mountain, Vertebrae Ridge and Punch Bowl. Punch Bowl: The Punch Bowl Property consists of three mineral claims totalling 3,079 ha and is approximately 90 km NW of the companies Gold Mountain Property and 140 km NW of Golden, BC. The property surrounds the historic Punch Bowl Showing, where discrete gold in quartz veins are hosted within quartzites and pelites of the Early Cambrian McNaughton Formation. Vertebrae Ridge: The Vertebrae Ridge property is comprised of four claims encompassing about 5,324 ha (13,156 acres) roughly 81 kilometers northwest of Golden, BC. During August 2021 ground exploration resulted in the extension of known polymetallic mineralization trends, the confirmation of significant mineralization continuity at historically sampled locations, and the discovery of the Canon Cu-Au Zone. The Company believes the newly discovered Canon Zone may be related to a large oval, alkaline intrusion located a short distance west of the mineralized area. Gold Mountain: The Gold Mountain Property is an early-stage gold/silver property located approximately 50 km NW of Golden, BC, just north of Highway 1. The property comprises two mineral claims encompassing 802 ha and covering the historic Grizzly Occurrence, which consists of gold and silver mineralization within polymetallic quartz/carbonate veins. Quality Assurance / Quality Control All samples were collected in the field using a hammer and chisel. Locations were obtained using a handheld GPS or tablet, with samples placed in pre-labelled sample bags. Metal tags with the sample numbers and flagging tape were left at each sample location. A Quality Assurance/Quality Control protocol was incorporated into the program and included the insertion of silica blanks at a rate of approximately 15%. Samples were transported to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, for standard sample preparation (code PRP89), which includes drying at 105C, crushing to 75% passing 2mm, riffle splitting 250 g, and pulverizing to 85% passing 75 microns. They were analyzed for multi-element (code GE ARM</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2023 Market News Publishing Inc.

After years of his government's uncontrolled spending, massive deficits and accumulated debt, we now have his carbon tax. While countries like China, Russia, India and others continue to burn fossil fuels unabated, Trudeau punishes Canadians financially in an effort to reduce Canada's minuscule carbon pollution. I guess he believes \"the right things\" include pushing most Canadians further toward poverty.</p><p><br/><br/> When the next federal election comes around in 2025, I think Mr. Trudeau will find out average Canadians are also thinking about what's best for them now and in the future. He will find out those thoughts don't include continuing with a self-serving, ethics challenged, corrupt, fiscally incompetent, silver-spoon-sucking Justin Trudeau. Never mind a walk in the snow, the nearest exit will do just fine.<br/><br/> Cameron Stringer, Hamilton<br/><br/> Poilievre misleading Canadians<br/><br/> Why are people against the carbon levy? One word: Poilievre. He has misled Canadians from Day 1 on this policy. He would never tell Canadians that if he was to \"axe the tax\" they would have less money in their pockets in spite of the fact that four out of five Canadians find themselves benefitting financially from the Liberals' \"cash for carbon\" rebate. This policy is all about our changing climate, which Pierre Poilievre and his Conservative peers can't seem to bring themselves to acknowledge, in spite of the fact that an early forest fire season and prairie drought are already upon us. Polling is currently against the Liberals and so premiers are licking their chops looking for votes, climate change be damned. How pathetic and cynical. Where is Poilievre on climate change, corporate profits and high interest rates when it comes to affordability? Nowhere to be found. He chooses to play politics and take money out of Canadians' pockets; money put there by the Liberals \"cash for carbon\" rebate. Not a leader for difficult times.<br/><br/> Don Courtnage, Ancaster<br/><br/> Get tough on criminals<br/><br/> Re: Rise in vehicle thefts: How well-organized thieves exploit tech to steal cars (Feb. 20)<br/><br/> The situation is out of control. These bandits are more brazen than ever before and can score vast sums of money for their efforts without serious repercussions. They get caught, get out on bail and steal more vehicles.<br/><br/> First off, our legal system has to change. No more Mr. Nice Guy. When caught, these criminals should be incarcerated (no bail, please) until the issue is settled in court. Clean up the court backlog. There is technology out there to speed things up. There will be those who strongly oppose this based on Charter rights. What about the rights of all the victims? Take it one step further. Make them pay for their lodgings and court expenses. Confiscate all their assets as collateral. Premier Doug Ford wants to build more jails. I like it.<br/><br/> A lot of stolen vehicles exit Canada via shipping container to offshore destinations. Why aren't the contents scrutinized more? With all this \"heat\" applied, sooner or later this illegal undertaking will crumble. This proposal can also be used in drug and human trafficking cases as well. Time to roll up our sleeves and get tough.<br/><br/> Sinclair Tyios, Burlington<br/><br/> The downtown is a mess<br/><br/> Re: 19-year-old dead after brazen daytime shooting in downtown Hamilton (March 6)<br/><br/> So Mayor Andrea Horwath was \"shocked\" at the deadly lunch-hour shooting a block from city hall. Perhaps Ms. Horwath should get out of her faux-marble tower more often and walk the increasingly mean streets of downtown Hamilton.<br/><br/> It's a mess down there and the increasing incidents of violence, homelessness and drug use indicate things aren't getting any better any time soon.<br/><br/> The alcoves along the facade of the Fairclough building are havens for encampments and the reek of urine and garbage is sickening. To put it bluntly, madame mayor, your city is really beginning to stink.<br/><br/> Doug Foley, Hamilton<br/><br/> We need to ditch plastic<br/><br/> If glass and metal, including aluminum, are 100 per cent recyclable and plastic can only be recycled three times, how come everything is now packaged in plastic? Even vegetable-based plastic can only be broken down by a special process, otherwise it's just the same as all other plastic polluting the environment forever.<br/><br/> Irene Hough, Hamilton<br/><br/> Workers should be able to get by<br/><br/> Re: Cyberattack preventing overtime pay to City of Hamilton workers, say unions (March 12)<br/><br/> What a selfish comment and attitude by the union representing city workers regarding overtime pay. The city is not responsible for the cyberattack to its system and is trying to resolve the situation. City workers are not paid minimum wages and should be able to survive without overtime time pay until such time as the situation is corrected. Simple solution: bank the overtime hours for now and you will be able to collect these overtime wages at a future date. The city has indicated that all payments owed will be reconciled at some point.<br/><br/> Kaz Matecki, Stoney Creek<br/><br/> Spend money on housing, not LRT<br/><br/> Re: Metrolinx applies to expropriate 28 properties for Hamilton LRT (March 11)<br/><br/> It is hard to believe that during a time when people are finding it hard to find affordable housing we are eliminating it. Until the housing crisis in this city has improved, the last thing we should be doing is spending money on a light rail system that we don't need.<br/><br/> It seems like now that city council has made living in tents acceptable and normal they have forgotten about the homeless. This council needs to stop spending money senselessly and concentrate on curing the dire issues at hand, get people out of tents and not put more into them.<br/><br/> Diana MacKenzie, Hamilton<br/><br/> An alternative to building more jails<br/><br/>Ontario's jails are overwhelmed and overcrowded. Our premier's answer is to build more, an idea as far removed from the ideal solution as was his Greenbelt fiasco.<br/><br/> The vast majority of spaces in Ontario's jails are occupied by individuals who are technically innocent, awaiting bail or trial. Another portion is made up of individuals with untreated mental health disorders whose behaviour has resulted in criminal convictions.<br/><br/> A wise premier would look, not at accommodating these ridiculous conditions, but instead at the root causes of the problem.<br/><br/> That premier would initiate significant improvements in treatment of mental health to help those who need it.

After years of his government's uncontrolled spending, massive deficits and accumulated debt, we now have his carbon tax. While countries like China, Russia, India and others continue to burn fossil fuels unabated, Trudeau punishes Canadians financially in an effort to reduce Canada's minuscule carbon pollution. I guess he believes \"the right things\" include pushing most Canadians further toward poverty.</p><p><br/><br/> When the next federal election comes around in 2025, I think Mr. Trudeau will find out average Canadians are also thinking about what's best for them now and in the future. He will find out those thoughts don't include continuing with a self-serving, ethics challenged, corrupt, fiscally incompetent, silver-spoon-sucking Justin Trudeau. Never mind a walk in the snow, the nearest exit will do just fine.<br/><br/> Cameron Stringer, Hamilton<br/><br/> Poilievre misleading Canadians<br/><br/> Why are people against the carbon levy? One word: Poilievre. He has misled Canadians from Day 1 on this policy. He would never tell Canadians that if he was to \"axe the tax\" they would have less money in their pockets in spite of the fact that four out of five Canadians find themselves benefitting financially from the Liberals' \"cash for carbon\" rebate. This policy is all about our changing climate, which Pierre Poilievre and his Conservative peers can't seem to bring themselves to acknowledge, in spite of the fact that an early forest fire season and prairie drought are already upon us. Polling is currently against the Liberals and so premiers are licking their chops looking for votes, climate change be damned. How pathetic and cynical. Where is Poilievre on climate change, corporate profits and high interest rates when it comes to affordability? Nowhere to be found. He chooses to play politics and take money out of Canadians' pockets; money put there by the Liberals \"cash for carbon\" rebate. Not a leader for difficult times.<br/><br/> Don Courtnage, Ancaster<br/><br/> Get tough on criminals<br/><br/> Re: Rise in vehicle thefts: How well-organized thieves exploit tech to steal cars (Feb. 20)<br/><br/> The situation is out of control. These bandits are more brazen than ever before and can score vast sums of money for their efforts without serious repercussions. They get caught, get out on bail and steal more vehicles.<br/><br/> First off, our legal system has to change. No more Mr. Nice Guy. When caught, these criminals should be incarcerated (no bail, please) until the issue is settled in court. Clean up the court backlog. There is technology out there to speed things up. There will be those who strongly oppose this based on Charter rights. What about the rights of all the victims? Take it one step further. Make them pay for their lodgings and court expenses. Confiscate all their assets as collateral. Premier Doug Ford wants to build more jails. I like it.<br/><br/> A lot of stolen vehicles exit Canada via shipping container to offshore destinations. Why aren't the contents scrutinized more? With all this \"heat\" applied, sooner or later this illegal undertaking will crumble. This proposal can also be used in drug and human trafficking cases as well. Time to roll up our sleeves and get tough.<br/><br/> Sinclair Tyios, Burlington<br/><br/> The downtown is a mess<br/><br/> Re: 19-year-old dead after brazen daytime shooting in downtown Hamilton (March 6)<br/><br/> So Mayor Andrea Horwath was \"shocked\" at the deadly lunch-hour shooting a block from city hall. Perhaps Ms. Horwath should get out of her faux-marble tower more often and walk the increasingly mean streets of downtown Hamilton.<br/><br/> It's a mess down there and the increasing incidents of violence, homelessness and drug use indicate things aren't getting any better any time soon.<br/><br/> The alcoves along the facade of the Fairclough building are havens for encampments and the reek of urine and garbage is sickening. To put it bluntly, madame mayor, your city is really beginning to stink.<br/><br/> Doug Foley, Hamilton<br/><br/> We need to ditch plastic<br/><br/> If glass and metal, including aluminum, are 100 per cent recyclable and plastic can only be recycled three times, how come everything is now packaged in plastic? Even vegetable-based plastic can only be broken down by a special process, otherwise it's just the same as all other plastic polluting the environment forever.<br/><br/> Irene Hough, Hamilton<br/><br/> Workers should be able to get by<br/><br/> Re: Cyberattack preventing overtime pay to City of Hamilton workers, say unions (March 12)<br/><br/> What a selfish comment and attitude by the union representing city workers regarding overtime pay. The city is not responsible for the cyberattack to its system and is trying to resolve the situation. City workers are not paid minimum wages and should be able to survive without overtime time pay until such time as the situation is corrected. Simple solution: bank the overtime hours for now and you will be able to collect these overtime wages at a future date. The city has indicated that all payments owed will be reconciled at some point.<br/><br/> Kaz Matecki, Stoney Creek<br/><br/> Spend money on housing, not LRT<br/><br/> Re: Metrolinx applies to expropriate 28 properties for Hamilton LRT (March 11)<br/><br/> It is hard to believe that during a time when people are finding it hard to find affordable housing we are eliminating it. Until the housing crisis in this city has improved, the last thing we should be doing is spending money on a light rail system that we don't need.<br/><br/> It seems like now that city council has made living in tents acceptable and normal they have forgotten about the homeless. This council needs to stop spending money senselessly and concentrate on curing the dire issues at hand, get people out of tents and not put more into them.<br/><br/> Diana MacKenzie, Hamilton<br/><br/> An alternative to building more jails<br/><br/>Ontario's jails are overwhelmed and overcrowded. Our premier's answer is to build more, an idea as far removed from the ideal solution as was his Greenbelt fiasco.<br/><br/> The vast majority of spaces in Ontario's jails are occupied by individuals who are technically innocent, awaiting bail or trial. Another portion is made up of individuals with untreated mental health disorders whose behaviour has resulted in criminal convictions.<br/><br/> A wise premier would look, not at accommodating these ridiculous conditions, but instead at the root causes of the problem.<br/><br/> That premier would initiate significant improvements in treatment of mental health to help those who need it. Preventive actions such as this would empty a number of jail spaces and would have the added benefit of opening up court time and resources to process more bail and trial hearings.<br/><br/> Appointing more judges and court staff would move many more cases through the system and reduce the strain on jails, as well as releasing more innocent people currently incarcerated.<br/><br/> Replacing archaic drug policies with safe supply processes would also help significantly in removing many individuals from the justice stream.<br/><br/> These three strategies would eliminate the need for any new jail spaces, but would also free up police from social work involvement and deploy them instead to deal with real criminals.<br/><br/> It costs more than $1 billion to build a single jail. That money would be far better spent implementing socially progressive, evidence-based and proven policies that would benefit all Ontarians.<br/><br/> Paul Marrow, Winterbourne <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2024031670941038</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BJV-BYV1-JDV5-F33H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1255\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Hornidge finished school in 1967 and joined his brother Brian at MacMillan Bloedel\u2019s Kennedy Lake logging division at Ucluelet on the west coast of Vancouver Island.</p><p>He was still working as a logger when the \"War in the Woods\u201d hit Clayoquot Sound:a series of blockades and protests against clearcutting that drew worldwide mass media attention.</p><p>In Loggerheads, published by Saskatchewan\u2019s Endless Sky Books, Hornidge writes from the unique, sometimes humorous and even irreverent point of view of one of the many loggers on the west coast whose forestry careers were cut short on the other side of the demonstrators\u2019 picket lines.</p><p>\"For a decade, the issue of forestland use in British Columbia raged like a forest fire,\u201d Hornidge writes in the opening pages of Loggerheads. \"Starting small, it generated smoke and mirrors and a world media hype that came to hang like a stalled hurricane over a tiny, beautiful corner of the world known as Clayoquot Sound\u2014and the largest act of civil disobedience in Canada to that date.\u201d</p><p>After more than two decades harvesting, Hornidge says he was \u201cloggershamed\u201d as a \"tree-killer\u201d and faced soul-searing losses of identity and livelihood, part of the human fallout of the inevitable move away from a resource-based economy.</p><p>\"My goal was a story that is truthful, personal, and encompasses many of the issues in this complex problem,\u201d Hornidge says.\u201cThree decades after The War of the Woods, we know what happened, and we\u2019ve been told why. There\u2019s a lot we were never told.\u201d</p><p>Loggerheads received a warm review from Bill Arnott, author of the Gone Viking series and A Season on Vancouver Island. \u201cPart treatise, part manual, part eco-memoir, Bruce Hornidge\u2019s Loggerheads is a timely, timeless read for lovers of trees,\u201d Arnott says. \"Richly shared in crisp prose, this book stands as a sentinel evergreen to the nature and industry our forests provide.\u201d</p><p>After losing his job as a logger in 1997, Hornidge became a security guard in Campbell River, Vancouver and Vanderhoof, British Columbia. Bruce and his wife, the Rev. Minnie Hornidge, live in Glen Williams, Ontario. There, Bruce gardens and knits. And writes.</p><p>Hornidge will be back on the west coast of Vancouver Island this week for a few reading events, starting with a stop at Electric Mermaid:Live Reads at Char\u2019s Landing in Port Alberni on Wednesday, Oct. 25. The event begins at 6 p.m. On Thursday, Oct. 26, Hornidge will be holding a meet and greet plus book signing at Mobius Books on Argyle Street, starting at 10 a.m. Hornidge will also head over to Ucluelet on Saturday, Oct. 28 for a reading and signing at the Ucluelet Community Centre from 10 a.m. to noon.</p><p>Loggerheads is available from most bookstores, online and off.

The winner will receive $6,000, a writing residency and have their work published on CBC Books.  </p><p>The shortlist will be announced on Nov. 16 and the winner will be announced on Nov. 23.  </p><p>Bombay is a Sixties Scoop survivor, second- and third-generation Indian Residential School survivor. The source of her poems\u2019 inspiration came from an important cultural moment as she moved from Southern Ontario up to the reserves, returning to the community and working through what she doesn\u2019t know or understand about rez life.  </p><p>To describe her entry in five-ish words, she says, \u201cjagged tumbling over the rocks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that the move has not been smooth,\u201d she said. \u201cHousing in Fort Frances is really tricky on the rez, and it's really tricky around Fort Frances. Finding a place to live is a big thing. So the feeling of being jagged and tumbling over the rocks is very much part of my experience right now.\u201d </p><p>The first lines of her poem are: </p><p>boozhoo ndinawe maaganok  </p><p>says the voice of the river  </p><p>that flashes over the rocks </p><p>the rapids that flash with sturgeon jumping </p><p>The piece was an \u201cimmediate piece\u201d to write, a particular moment captured and crafted, but gathered about six months worth of experiences that all centered around the river, such as the time Bombay first saw the chief burn the tall grass by the river, a method of forest fire prevention. Within about three days, new shoots began sprouting again, she says.  </p><p>In another moment, along with others who transplanted to the area, Bombay went down to the river and tapped maple trees.  </p><p>\u201cThe rapids gave me a chance to look at all the other things that I have been experiencing,\u201d she said.  </p><p>Bombay has also shared her writing in anthologies including Strong Women Stories, Indigenous Women: The State of Our Nations and the Four Winds Literary Magazine. She was also part of a special adoptee anthology called Outsiders Within. </p><p>Her work often explores homelessness, precarious housing or other layers of instability, she says.  </p><p>She is also working on a one-woman show about the Sixties Scoop. The one-woman show tracks the intergenerational connections with her birth father and grandfather, who are also both writers and artists, and the connection with her grandmother who also moved around a lot.  </p><p>\u201cThere's a lot of connections between these three generations that are two generations of residential school and one generation of the Sixties Scoop, and this notion of tumbling around and coping with that,\u201d she said.  </p><p>Frustration that comes with trying to communicate layers of colonization and stereotyping can be a minefield many writers walk through, Bombay says.  </p><p>\u201cSometimes it feels like there's nothing you can write that isn't going to be morphed by anti-Indigenous racism. So it's like a puzzle, sometimes, for me to solve.\u201d </p><p>Whereas her one-woman show explores the intergenerational theme, her poem The Voice Of The River shows that she physically sits beside the river, feeling the connection to the river that her ancestors live beside, and she is still tumbling. </p><p>\u201cI definitely see myself always sharing stories in some way or another,\u201d she said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-26dc47d51b21413297abbea78632d89d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69N7-YJ31-JBVR-33XR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"586\"/><timeReceived>02:38 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 16, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

When you fly a drone near a forest fire, you can put the lives of pilots, firefighters and other emergency personnel at risk. Be safe, stay clear of forest fires.<br/><br/> Also, if you are in a watercraft, a reminder to steer clear of waterbombers. When waterbombers approach a body of water, move close to the shore so they can perform their scoop safely. A waterbomber will not scoop from a lake or river if encroaching watercraft pose a safety hazard. <br/><br/> Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services would like to remind the public to use caution when performing any outdoor burning. In order to dispose of yard waste and woody debris, we encourage you to use methods such as composting or using your local landfill. If you must burn, follow Ontario's Outdoor Burning Regulations. <br/><br/> Fires are to be ignited no sooner than two hours before sunset and extinguished no later than two hours after sunrise. Always have tools/water adequate to contain the fire at the site. Know the rules for safe outdoor burning. Consult the full set of Outdoor Burning Regulations. <br/><br/> To report a wildland fire located north of the French and Mattawa rivers, please dial 310-FIRE. To report a forest fire located south of the French or Mattawa rivers, please dial 911. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2022071164992225</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65XB-67H1-JDV5-F2NK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.
