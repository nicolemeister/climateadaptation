Outside, they've been learning hands-on by cleaning up forest fire fuel in lands near the school where they go to play and learn.</p><p>Carlene Pires, RDKB's emergency program coordinator, recently teamed up with students and their teachers to guide them in clearing \"The Dairy,\" a nearby piece of land, for \"FireSmart Wednesday\" purposes.</p><p>This practical activity is designed to instill the importance of fire safety and proactive measures.</p><p>\"FireSmart is a shared responsibility as is fostering the next FireSmart generation,\" said Pires. \"It's heartening to see the teachers at Webster Elementary reaching out to the RDKB to ensure their students learn these essential lessons.\"</p><p>Teaching children about being FireSmart is building greater resiliency, reducing risk, and emphasizing the importance of taking accountability for keeping our homes and communities safe, Pires added.</p><p>\"Fire safety outside is just as critical as understanding fire safety inside.\"</p><p>The FireSmart BC Education Program aims to educate and empower the younger generation about fire safety, fire science, mitigation, and prevention, encouraging them to be proactive in their communities.</p><p>The regional district plans to continue this initiative by collaborating with organizers of the Beaver Valley Summer Camps and Camp Cawabunga in Trail, following successful engagement last year.</p><p>For more information about the FireSmart BC Education Program and how schools and community groups can get involved in the Kootenay Boundary, call the RDKB's headquarters in Trail at 250.368.9148.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Trail Daily Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRAILD-news20240604PTR4609443</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRAILD2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C5Y-V221-JD2C-J08S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"354\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

White </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Local Journalism Initiative Reporter </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SOUTHWEST COAST \u2014 Across the island portion of the province, May 1 marked the beginning of the 2023 forest fire season, which won't come to an end until Sept. 30. The Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture shared a set of reminders for the public for forest fire season which include: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u2022 A Permit to Burn is required to burn grass, brush and other materials during Forest Fire Season, and strict conditions must be followed. The permit can be obtained from the local Forestry and Wildlife district office. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u2022 When the fire hazard rating is high, very high, or extreme, all Permits to Burn for that region are suspended. </p><p>\u2022 When the fire hazard rating is very high or extreme, open or outdoor fires are not allowed in that region. </p><p>\u2022 A person may light an open or outdoor fire within 300 meters of forested land without a Permit to Burn during Forest Fire Season under certain conditions including: </p><p>\u2022 The fire is in a prepared site within a managed park with appropriate facilities, and equipment </p><p>\u2022 The fire is in an outdoor wood burning unit that contains the fire and is properly screened  </p><p>\u2022 The fire is contained in an incinerator unit that is on private property, is in good working order, and is properly screened. </p><p>\u2022 All open fires must be attended at all times </p><p>\u2022 Always have sufficient water and other tools on site to extinguish a fire.  </p><p>\u2022 Never leave the fire location until the fire has been completely extinguished. </p><p>\u2022 Anyone travelling through forest land on an all-terrain or motorized vehicle during forest fire season has to have a muffler and a screening or baffling device to prevent sparks and particles from escaping. </p><p>According to the Fire Hazard Map presented by the Dept. of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture, Forest Fire Region 5, which contains the Southwest Coast, is currently under a high forest fire warning level. This warning level could help explain why the Codroy Valley has seen a significant increase in grass fires already this season. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had about, I\u2019d say, 14 so far. It\u2019s an over-abundance,\u201d said Brian Osmond, Chief of the Codroy Valley Volunteer Fire Department (CVVFD). \u201cI think last year we had four. This year we\u2019re already at 14. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d </p><p>Before one weekend fire got out of control, a water bomber had to be brought in to contain the blaze. </p><p>\u201cYesterday (Apr. 30), there was a woods fire, and we don\u2019t know how it started. I call them \u2018mystery fires\u2019,\u201d said Osmond. \u201cWe had to use a water bomber yesterday because the area was inaccessible by us. The river was really high, so we couldn\u2019t get over with any of our equipment. Neither could forestry, so the water bomber was brought in. Also, when the water bomber was putting out the fire where the forestry guys brought the bomber in for, we had three mysterious fires start on the railway bed going towards Doyles, and the wind was blowing the opposite way, so we can\u2019t say it was sparks from the other fire because the wind was blowing the wrong way for that, but because we had those three fires started, they had to divert the water bomber to put those out before they got out of control. That\u2019s why I call them mystery fires, because they appear out of nowhere.\u201d </p><p>The large number of grass fires puts a strain on the entire department.  </p><p>\u201cIt makes the volunteer firefighters lives miserable. We\u2019ve probably had, in the 14 calls, over 24-30 hours of fighting fires,\u201d said Osmond. \u201cYou look at the volunteers, regardless of where you are, it takes a toll on you, continuously fighting fires. It\u2019s not just the personnel. At the end of the day, when we start our firetrucks, whether it\u2019s for two hours or twelve hours, they don\u2019t get turned off. Fighting fires is as bad as going down the highway at 80 or 90 kilometres an hour, and fuel costs alone are crazy, along with time away and personnel. It\u2019s a financial burden on every fire department, regardless of if you're funded by your municipality or not. It takes a toll on you, a toll on your equipment, just because someone or something lit something on fire and it got out of control.\u201d </p><p>The cause of some of the \u2018mystery fires\u2019 may not remain a mystery for much longer. </p><p>\u201cWe have the RCMP involved doing investigations on some fires because some things were found, which I\u2019ll keep quiet, but there is stuff that has been found at the scenes that have been turned in to the RCMP,\u201d shared Osmond. </p><p>The Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department (PABFD) had their own grass fire a few weeks ago that also resulted in the RCMP being called to the scene.  </p><p>\u201cThat fire call came in around 7:00 last Sunday (Apr. 23),\u201d said Jerry Musseau, PABFD Fire Chief. \u201cSomeone was burning garbage or whatever they were burning there, and I would assume something must\u2019ve got out of the burn drum and caught the grass on fire.\u201d </p><p>Luckily didn't take the PABFD long to get it under control. </p><p>\u201cWe had it out fairly quickly. By the time we took off the hoses, put the fire out and put the hoses back on, it was only 45 minutes or so probably,\u201d shared Musseau. \u201cIf the grass kept continually burning further away, there were other houses in the area where the grass was burning, but it didn\u2019t get up to that area because we had it out before it got to that point.\u201d </p><p>The RCMP were called to the scene by the PABFD. </p><p>\u201cIn this case we had a little issue with the person who was burning there, so we thought, for the safety of our firefighters, in the middle of a confrontation there, we decided to call the RCMP.\u201d </p><p>In response to email inquiries, the RCMP offered the following: </p><p>\u201cAt approximately 7:15 pm on April 23, 2023, Channel-Port aux Basques RCMP were called by the fire department to attend a property on Stadium Road.  Firefighters on the scene were dealing with a grass fire and an uncooperative male on the property.  When police arrived, the fire had been put out.  No one was injured.  No charges were laid as no crime was committed.\u201d </p><p>Due to the environmental conditions this time of year, an increase in grass fires is to be expected. </p><p>\u201cThis is the time of the year, because the grass is really dry, and our weather, of course, has been extremely dry this season just the same. Grass is really dry, and just like gasoline, there is a great potential there for fires to spread really quickly in dry grass. Normally we don\u2019t get a lot of grass fires in this area. It is mostly in the Codroy Valley,\u201d said Musseau. \u201cThe heat isn\u2019t extreme as of yet, but everything is dry, and if people are going to be burning fires or burning garbage and it\u2019s not covered, the risk is there for a spark or ember to fly out and catch the grass on fire, because it wouldn\u2019t take much, and of course, when you\u2019ve got dry grass around, whether someone\u2019s thrown a cigarette butt down or anything, the potential is there. On Saturday evening (Apr. 29) we had another small grass fire outside the old trail of the railway tracks and we\u2019re not sure exactly what may have caused that one, but it was contained very quickly.\u201d </p><p>Having to respond to such a high number of grass fires is difficult enough, but when emergency responders are slowed down by individuals blocking access in order to rubberneck, it creates an even bigger problem. </p><p>\u201cIt seems like whenever there\u2019s a fire truck or a police car going to a scene, people tend to follow it. It\u2019s a problem that we\u2019ve talked about before. We\u2019ve preached about it over the years, for people not to follow the fire trucks,\" said Musseau. \"That is a problem from time to time.\u201d </p><p>Rubberneckers create multiple problems during an event. </p><p>\u201cThe first thing, if there are vehicles there observing before we\u2019ve even gotten there, it may make it difficult to get our vehicles in there,\u201d said Musseau. </p><p>In one recent incident, a car accident on Regional Street in early April, proved that it's not only first responders that can be hindered from helping. A cracked power pole that was left dangling by its wires required a  NL Power crew to arrive and disconnect it. Because of the line up of cars alongside the road, the crew was obliged to park their truck and run to the pole to shut off the power so first responders could assist the driver. Luckily, in this case, the outcome was favourable. </p><p>\u201cThat night, the rest of the power lines could have come down and futher injuries could\u2019ve occurred,\u201d said Musseau. \u201cAlso, the ambulance has to get in. The people who are injured have to get back out, so the more vehicles that are in that area, the more difficult it is to do our jobs quickly and safely. We don\u2019t want those people in and around everything. When there is a house fire or an accident, whatever, stay away and let us do our job because people need help and we don\u2019t need anything else besides the incident, people or anything else, hindering our operations.\u201d </p><p>Social media also presents a problem. </p><p>\u201cPeople could probably put photos on social media, and maybe even before some of the family members know that their loved ones and relatives have been involved in an incident,\u201d said Musseau. \u201cWe have no control over that part, what people are putting on social media, but I wish they wouldn\u2019t do that. I think it\u2019s why a lot of people want to get in close to those incidents, to get those pictures and do that kind of stuff, but that\u2019s not good. No one should be hindering operations.\u201d </p><p>The RCMP also issued a statement about onlookers. </p><p>\u201cIt is not uncommon for on-lookers to be present and at times to be an interference or even a danger to those at the scene of a collision.  Motorists passing through a collision scene need to pay special attention to first responders who are often out on foot at the scene of a collision, to travel with reduced speeds and to stay off of their cell phones.  Driving while distracted puts others at risk.  Blocking off a roadway can certainly interfere with the response time of first responders to a scene which can certainly put victims at a disadvantage of receiving the care needed.\" </p><p>\u201cIt is also not uncommon for people to take pictures when passing through a crash scene and to post them to social media.  This no doubt can be painful for friends and family members and can often circulate over social media before a next of kin has been made aware of a crash involving a loved one.\u201d </p><p>Both fire chiefs want people to be mindful of the weather conditions before lighting a fire. </p><p>\u201cAt this point, there\u2019s no regulations in place for small fires into a fire pit, but you can\u2019t go out into your backyard here and burning huge amounts of garbage,\" said Musseau, who warns that could result in a hefty bill for fire services. </p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re going to burn, think before they start. Make sure they\u2019ve got something to assist, to keep control of the fire, and if it gets out of the area, they\u2019ll be responsible for it,\" agreed Osmond.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-67ef3dec29aa4e8eac16a1394490f286</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6869-BW21-DY9S-T0M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1796\"/><timeReceived>08:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 8, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Carry out any forest activities with caution.<br/><br/> WHAT DO THE RATINGS MEAN?<br/><br/> The Muskoka Fire Danger Rating is determined using the Fire Weather Index, an internationally used method for determining the risk of fires in open air. It uses factors such as the relative humidity, temperature, previous 24-hour rain amount, wind directions and wind speed in combination with the forest fuel type and loads to determine the risk of the forest to certain fire types. From this calculation the Forest Fire Danger Rating is made in consultation with the fire chiefs of the six area municipalities and the Ministry of Natural Resources.<br/><br/> Low<br/><br/> Low danger of fire. You may conduct any municipally permitted fire activities. No daytime burning. Campfires for cooking and heat only.<br/><br/> Moderate<br/><br/> Moderate danger of fire.

Only three of those are considered out of control, particularly in the area around Chibougamau, Que., about 416 kilometres northwest of Quebec City.</p><p>But while the provincewide situation has improved, Caron said the risk from the fires isn\u2019t yet over.</p><p>\u201cThere are still risks because the blazes are still huge,\u201d he said.</p><p>One fire burning near the city of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon \u2014 which was evacuated twice in June \u2014 covers more than 4,000 square kilometres, he said. That fire has been contained, but is still not controlled, he said, ex-plaining that a contained fire is not currently advancing but could in the future, while a controlled fire is definitely stopped.</p><p>\u201cSo we have to aim to control the fires, because if there is another period of drought, another period of very hot weather, the fires could rise from their ashes and cause us problems again,\u201d he said. Between 1,300 and 1,400 firefighters are on the ground, Caron said, including 150 South Korean wilderness firefighters who arrived in the province on Sunday.</p><p>While Quebec\u2019s wilderness firefighters usually work up to 24 days straight, Caron said their work usually comes to an end at points over the summer. But this year, with the work of controlling all the fires expected to take the entire season, it will be difficult to ensure firefighters get the time off they need to recuperate. While the risk of fires in much of the province has declined, dry conditions continue in the northwestern Jam\u00e9sie region where several large fires are burning. That area is in SOPFEU\u2019s northern zone, where fires are only fought if they pose a threat to communities or strategic infrastructure.</p><p>There are currently 44 fires in the northern zone, a number Caron described as high.</p><p>Even though most aren\u2019t being actively fought, \u201cthe number of fires is still concerning,\u201d he said.</p><p>Quebec\u2019s Natural Resources and Forests Department also announced it had reduced the area covered by an outdoor fire ban. As of Monday, the ban primarily applies in the province\u2019s northwest, as well as in two small parts of the Saguenay\u2013Lac-Saint-Jean region.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230704RDA0003698791</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68M7-9G41-JD2C-J1VV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"498\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Where will we find refuge? Where? How?' <br/>Miguel Angel Henriquez, a 58-year-old farmer from Santa Juana in the same region, told AFP that he saw a neighbor brave the flames to try and rescue some of his animals. 'He did not come out. I yelled at him to come out of the fire, but he didn't listen.' <br/>A woman from El Santo, in the municipality of Tome, described that 'most of the houses' in her settlement were burnt. <br/>'The people did not manage to save anything, they left with what they wore, because the fire advanced very quickly.' <br/>President Gabriel Boric attended the wake of a firefighter in the town of Coronel, telling mourners: 'The whole of Chile cries with you. I am here to tell you that you are not alone.' <br/>- 'Small window' - <br/>On Sunday morning, a drop in temperature promised some respite for the 5,300 firefighters deployed against the blazes. <br/>'There is a small window of improvement in climatic conditions on Sunday and Monday,' Monsalve told reporters, but warned temperatures could once again approach 40 C by Tuesday. <br/>Ten people have been arrested, the official added, on suspicion of arson. <br/>With some 260 active fires, the government maintained a state of emergency in the regions of Nuble, Biobio and La Araucania, allowing the deployment of additional resources, restriction of free movement of people and the use of soldiers in containment operations. <br/>'We face the emergency with unity,' Boric said on Twitter. <br/>A plane left from Spain Sunday with 50firefighting specialists, soldiers and drone pilots on board. <br/>'We have just sent a plane to Chile with a contingent of the Emergency Military Unit to help extinguish and control the fires that are plaguing the country. All our support for the Chilean people,' tweeted Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. <br/>Other countries including Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Mexico have also offered help, according to the Chilean government. <br/>On Saturday, Interior Minister Carolina Toha said Chile was becoming one of the countries most vulnerable to fires due to climate change. <br/>Fire conditions that would have seemed extreme just three years ago are becoming more common, she said. <br/>In 2017, a rash of fires in the same region left 11 people dead, injured nearly 6,000 and destroyed 1,500 homes. <br/><url

The $32-million in funding will go toward repairing one of the province's five water\u00a0bomber planes,\u00a0purchasing two \"bird dog\"\u00a0aircrafts,\u00a0other fire fighting equipment, and simulator\u00a0training.\u00a0</p><p>No timeline for the centre's completion has been announced.</p><p>\"It's fine that they want to improve access to service but in the same announcement they talked about how they are going to outsource firefighting services in Labrador West to Quebec and not replace the bomber that was cut out of this region by this government,\" Brown said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LISTEN | MHA Jordan Brown speaks with Labrador Morning about wildfire resources in Labrador West:</emphasis></emphasis>\u00a0</p><p>He said\u00a0the only way to effectively protect Labrador West is to return the water bomber to Wabush.</p><p>\"We have no actual wild firefighters stationed in Wabush anymore, we have no water bomber stationed in Wabush anymore, we have no assets.\u00a0We have to wait for someone to show up in case of a fire,\" Brown said.</p><p>\"Instead of putting the assets that were taken from us back in Labrador West, they're going to fully rely on another province to provide service to us which flies in the face of this whole idea of an Atlantic Wildfire Centre.\"</p><p/><p>Response times have just about doubled without a plane stationed in the area, he said, made worse, too, by the lack of aerial patrol and a stationed fire fighting crew. Brown says this is what put Labrador West at \"a massive disadvantage\" this past wildfire season.</p><p>Brown wants to see the province commit to strong investment in all regions of the province before centralizing their operations in Gander and outsourcing the fire fighting response to other provinces.</p><p>Firefighter recruitment is also an issue in which Brown wants to see strong investment.</p><p>\"There is going to\u00a0be more fires and there's going to\u00a0be more need for fire fighting,\" Brown said. \"But a province skirting its responsibility to a region and outsourcing it to another province, that does not help anybody.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Download our\u00a0</emphasis></emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/newsapp/\">free CBC News app</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0to sign up for push alerts for CBC Newfoundland and Labrador.

Other ministers said they were \"encouraged\" or \"motivated\" by a chance to keep making the case, as they have for months, that Canada is integral to American economic and national security.</p><p>When Trump's first administration called for a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the first Trudeau government said it welcomed the challenge and would seek progressive changes in a new deal. (Neither got exactly what it wanted out of that first renegotiation.)</p><p>On Monday, LeBlanc attempted to present a similarly rosy view of the rocky road ahead.</p><p>\"If the administration wants to study the economic and trade relationship between Canada and the United States, we think that's a positive opportunity for us to continue to tell the Americans and obviously Canadians as well, the importance of working together and how both countries are stronger and more secure when we respect and honour a comprehensive free trade agreement,\" he told reporters.</p><p>But few are under any illusion that the challenge is the same.</p><p>Trump, surrounded by a more hawkish group of advisers, returned to office with a clear blueprint that was immediately posted on a remade White House website, as the president declared a series of national emergencies to deploy soldiers to the Mexican border, ramp up oil drilling, end electric vehicle mandates, and to launch his trade review.</p><p>\"Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,\" Trump said.</p><p>Premier Doug Ford and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith warned that uncertainty remains, with Smith saying \"despite the promising news today, the threat of U.S. tariffs is still very real.\"</p><p>Smith urged Canadian federal and provincial leaders to stop talking about \"retaliatory measures including export tariffs or cutting off energy to the U.S.\" and instead allay Trump's concerns through tighter border security, more defence spending, tougher immigration policies, and the repeal of \"anti-energy\" policies.</p><p>Ford suggested he'd need a new electoral mandate to navigate the unknowns ahead.</p><p>\"I'm not saying that we won and it's over,\" said Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault.</p><p>In an official statement, Trudeau congratulated Trump on beginning his second term, and reminded him that \"Canada and the United States have the world's most successful economic partnership.\"</p><p>\"We are each other's largest trade partners, with a relationship that creates millions of jobs, attracts billions in investment into the continent, and keeps our people safe,\" he said.</p><p>Trudeau and successive cabinet ministers argued it is a \"mutually beneficial relationship,\" and reminded Trump that the government has made \"massive investments\" to bolster cross-border trade, reinforce supply chains, and \"create jobs on both sides of the border.\"</p><p>Ottawa has marshalled reams of statistics to prove the stakes are high, saying eight million jobs in the U.S. are tied to trade with Canada, with about 70 per cent of Canadian goods exported to the United States used in the production of other goods.</p><p>And it says that if Canadian energy exports to the U.S. are excluded from the equation, the U.S. has had a merchandise trade surplus since 2007, standing at US $28.6 billion in 2023.</p><p>Trade is only one of Canada's concerns. The possible influx of people fleeing deportation orders is another.</p><p>Immigration Minister Marc Miller told the Star that for now, Trump's focus is on his country's southern border \"but it would be naive not to expect an uptick here\" in border crossings as a result of Trump's deportation orders.</p><p>\"It's really cold so it's more dangerous than normal,\" Miller said, \"but be that as it may, if people turn up at the (northern) border they'll be turned away as per the Safe Third Country Agreement.\"</p><p>In Washington, Trump said he would reverse the Biden administration's \"green New Deal\" policies, which included not just EV mandates but billions of dollars in tax credits to support electric vehicle manufacturing, in order to save \"our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers.\"</p><p>Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne attended the inauguration at the U.S. Capitol Building, watching the ceremony from an overflow room among a number of Republican state governors. In an interview on CBC, he downplayed the fallout of any end to EV mandates, noting one of Trump's biggest financial supporters, Elon Musk, sells EVs and the industry will continue to attract investment as the world seeks to decarbonize.</p><p>Canada's own subsidies of EV companies have been tied to the existence of American subsidies, and if the U.S. ditches its tax credits, Ottawa has previously said it would, too.</p><p>Canadian officials first learned Trump would not impose tariffs on day one when the Wall Street Journal broke the story Monday morning, ahead of the inauguration, that Trump would instead sign a memo ordering a trade deficit review which would include a study of the North American free trade pact.</p><p>The newspaper said it singles out China, Canada and Mexico for scrutiny, directing agencies to assess Beijing's compliance with its 2020 trade deal with the U.S., as well as the status of the Canada-U.S.-Mexico-Agreement (CUSMA), the updated version of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is set for review in 2026.</p><p>One senior federal official said Trump's action could represent a serious threat down the road.</p><p>Trump also announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord on climate change, the same agreement he pulled out of during his first administration. </p><p>Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said America's withdrawal is disappointing, but individual U.S. states are engaged in the fight and that won't change.</p><p>\"The fact that the federal government in the U.S. will no longer be interested in fighting climate change doesn't mean that the United States of America, as a whole, is not interested in that, and the international community will continue moving forward, with or without President Trump,\" he said.</p><p>Guilbeault added that the president's timing is \"quite ironic ... as California is going through one of the worst forest fire seasons in its history.\"</p><p>Since November, Trump has threatened 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10 per cent tariffs on China. That was a significant escalation of his election campaign vow of 10 per cent global tariffs on all imports.</p><p>Now it's a wait-and-lobby-harder game for Canadian political and business leaders.</p><p>The Canadian government had planned a series of escalating reciprocal tariffs on American products if Trump moved ahead as early as Monday.</p><p>Ottawa is also looking at ways to support Canadian businesses and workers if an all-out trade war erupts.</p><p>It could take weeks and months for the tariff dispute to play out - if Trump does in fact move to impose them.</p><p>With files from Ryan Tumilty and Raisa Patel </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025012074264067</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DY3-9N53-RRYY-J4GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1372\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Aligned with Huawei's TECH4ALL initiative and the IUCN Green List, Tech4Nature has supported 11 flagship projects in eight countries with tailored solutions to conservation challenges.</p><p>\"Tech4Nature is a global partnership between the nature conservation sector led by IUCN and the tech sector led by Huawei. It's a crucially important partnership because technology needs to be part of the solution to the biodiversity and climate crises facing the planet. Tech4Nature is about tapping into the innovation and energy of the tech sector to help solve these issues,\" said James Hardcastle, Global Protected and Conserved Areas Director for IUCN. </p><p>Phase II of Tech4Nature kicked off in 2024 with new projects launched or scheduled in five countries, including a biodiversity monitoring and protection project in Spain's Sierra Nevada, which was launched last week.</p><p>The Greek startup PROBOTEK introduced the new forest fire prevention and response system developed under the TECH4ALL initiative. Working with the Greece government, project partners PROBOTEK, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, and Huawei selected Skiathos in October 2024 as a pilot site for Phase II of the solution. Comprising sensors, 5G, AI, and drones, the solution is expected to mitigate the potential devastation caused by forest fires by enabling an emergency response within the first 'golden 15 minutes' of detection, sending evacuation routes to residents' phones, and planning routes for fire trucks and ambulances.</p><p>In the area of education, UNESCO has partnered with Huawei TECH4ALL on the Open School initiative and UNESCO Campus. At the TECH4ALL Forum, UNESCO presented its strategies for boosting education equity and quality on a global scale.</p><p>\"UNESCO's STEM strategy aims to amplify the efforts of the UNESCO Member States in promoting STEM education by building a robust ecosystem that supports the development of critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and innovation. It emphasizes a number of actions, including increasing youth engagement in STEM fields, improving teacher capacities, and promoting gender equality and inclusion,\" said Magdalena Landry, Director of the UNESCO Regional Bureau for Science and Culture in Europe.</p><p>TECH4ALL partners Close the Gap and Konexio explored how the DigiTruck projects are driving digital inclusion through digital skills training for priority communities in France, including the elderly and unemployed youth. To date, the project has reached 6,000 people across 31 cities. At the DigiTALL event held in the evening, the two partners received an award for their contribution to digital inclusion and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>Under its TECH4ALL initiative, Huawei has worked with a range of partners, including governments, NGOs, IGOs, carriers, environmental organizations, universities, and technology companies. Given the pivotal role that technology plays in driving both inclusion and sustainability, Huawei expects to develop more projects and partnerships in Europe in the future.</p><p>About TECH4ALL</p><p>TECH4ALL is Huawei's long-term digital inclusion initiative and action plan. Enabled by innovative technologies and partnerships, TECH4ALL is designed to enable inclusion and sustainability in the digital world.</p><p>Visit the Huawei TECH4ALL website at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.huawei.com/en/tech4all\">https://www.huawei.com/en/tech4all</url></p><p>Follow us on X at <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/HUAWEI_TECH4ALL\">https://x.com/HUAWEI_TECH4ALL</url></p><p> View original content to download multimedia:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/huaweis-tech4all-initiative-expands-role-in-europes-green-and-digital-transformation-302311131.html\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/huaweis-tech4all-initiative-expands-role-in-europes-green-and-digital-transformation-302311131.html</url></p><p>SOURCE  Huawei</p><p> View original content to download multimedia: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/November2024/20/c1831.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/November2024/20/c1831.html</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNW-20241120C1831</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DFX-CGT1-JC8H-P321-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><timeReceived>3:05 AM Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CNW Group</copyright><publicationName>Canada NewsWire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 20, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agreement, which has been signed by all four defendants and the plaintiff, must still be approved by a judge in B.C. Supreme Court on Jan.15, but David Rosenberg, the lawyer for the plaintiffs Robert Kirk and James Ross, says he is confident it will go through.</p><p>The defendants in the case are Executive Flight Centre Fuel Services Ltd., Transwest Helicopters Ltd., the Province of British Columbia, and Danny LaSante.</p><p>A class action is a lawsuit started by one person on behalf of members of a group that have a similar claim against a single person or company. Before a court will take on a class action, a judge must certify that it meets the multiple rules set out in the Class Proceedings Act, as a judge did in this case.</p><p>Two separate class actions were initiated by Lemon Creek residents Kirk and Ross and then combined. Both are claiming damages on behalf of many \u2013 Kirk for environmental damage and Ross for personal injury.</p><p>According to Rosenberg, the class consists of 2,776 property owners within the zone that was evacuated after the fuel spill, plus anyone who carried on a business within that zone. These people, known as class members, are not individually named in the court action \u2013 this is always the case in class actions \u2013 and most of them did not actually put their names forward and may not know they are part of the group.</p><p>Anyone who lived in the evacuation zone at the time could benefit if they make a claim now. As in all class actions, no member will be responsible for legal fees or costs.</p><p>In the summer of 2013, Executive Flight Centre Fuel Services Ltd.was providing fuel to the provincial government to fight a forest fire in the area of Lemon Creek in the Slocan Valley. Its tanker truck, driven by Danny LaSante, overturned and spilled 35,000 litres of jet fuel into the creek, polluting the stream and causing a local evacuation of people living up to 40 kilometres downstream in the Slocan Valley.</p><p>The spill killed fish and forced residents to get alternate sources of drinking water for themselves and livestock for days.</p><p>Rosenberg said this is the first class action for environmental damage in Canada that has resulted in payment of a damage claim.</p><p>All four of the defendants have declined to comment on the agreement.</p><p>Filing a claim After the court gives final approval in Jan-uary, residents may advance a claim or may apply to be excluded from the class action. Details will be announced at the time on Rosenberg\u2019s website.</p><p>Anyone wishing to make a claim may do so, and the amount each class member gets will be decided by an administrator who will apply a point system to the claims.</p><p>A class member can get compensation simply by being a class member. If a person was physically evacuated and can provide evidence of that, they will receive more.</p><p>If a class member suffered personal injuries, such as burning eyes, nose, and rashes, they will get a larger amount, and a more severe personal injury will entitle more yet.</p><p>Documented out-of-pocket expenses such as hotels, gas, evacuation and health-care costs will be reimbursed.</p><p>If a class member can establish that they sold their property in the evacuation zone within five years following the spill and the property was devalued because of the spill, they may get compensation for that.</p><p>A maze of court actions This case has taken a slow and circuitous route through the courts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing (class actions) a long time,\u201d said Rosenberg. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a case that\u2019s been certified, gone to the Court of Appeal, been sent back, certified again, and appealed again.\u201d</p><p>The federal Crown also laid charges against three of the defendants for destruction of fish habitat under the Fisheries Act. LaSante and Executive Flight Services were found guilty and received fines, and the Province of B.C. was found not guilty.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20241128PRAA0004721530</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DHS-WN41-F0HF-83SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"689\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

The Green Party is very committed to increasing mental health care and health care capacities, which would include increasing beds and making beds available when they\u2019re needed.</p><p>Every year, temperature records are broken throughout the province and the forest fire season appears to be getting worse and longer. What does your party see as the best way for carbon reduction, and what goals will you aim to strive in helping the province and Island hit those goals? I would agree that we are seeing changes, especially in the North Island. It\u2019s very prevalent, we\u2019re having heat domes and definitely increasing fires.</p><p>To work towards reducing climate change, the party believes in working towards reducing fossil fuel consumption and that would help towards lowering emissions overall.</p><p>While areas of the North Island are growing in rental housing, there continues to be a lack of affordable housing. What detailed actions will your party take to increase affordable housing stock in the riding? The party and myself really strongly believe in having safe, affordable housing for everyone. The Green Party is working towards increasing non-market housing in the area, which would mean more people would be able to afford and have a home. I totally support that and see the housing crisis in our riding as a huge issue.</p><p>School divisions in the North Island have policies and resources that create a supportive and inclusive environment for students. Will your government do anything to change or limit school division\u2019s abilities to use these policies and resources? The Green Party is really committed to safe and comfortable school environments, inclusive where everyone feels comfortable and safe and the party will continue to promote safe and healthy education from early child education all the way to post-secondary.</p><p>Often seen at odds with the resource industry, how will the Green Party of B.C. protect jobs in the resource industry? Absolutely. In our North Island riding, the natural resource sector is very prominent and it doesn\u2019t need to be jobs or a healthy environment or healthy ecosystem. We can have both an the Green Party will work towards ensuring that there is both. When we work together with industry we can come up with a plan where we look at forests as forests and work towards protecting the most diverse ecosystems and also have forestry happening. We just need to work together to make it better for our future generations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPRIV-news20241009PPPA0004635088</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPRIV2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D52-4FK1-F0HF-80B2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

A settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agreement, which has been signed by all four defendants and the plaintiff, must still be approved by a judge in B.C. Supreme Court on Jan.15, but David Rosenberg, the lawyer for the plaintiffs Robert Kirk and James Ross, says he is confident it will go through.</p><p>The defendants in the case are Executive Flight Centre Fuel Services Ltd., Transwest Helicopters Ltd., the Province of British Columbia, and Danny LaSante.</p><p>A class action is a lawsuit started by one person on behalf of members of a group that have a similar claim against a single person or company. Before a court will take on a class action, a judge must certify that it meets the multiple rules set out in the Class Proceedings Act, as a judge did in this case.</p><p>Two separate class actions were initiated by Lemon Creek residents Kirk and Ross and then combined. Both are claiming damages on behalf of many \u2013 Kirk for environmental damage and Ross for personal injury.</p><p>According to Rosen-berg, the class consists of 2,776 property owners within the zone that was evacuated after the fuel spill, plus anyone who carried on a business within that zone. These people, known as class members, are not individually named in the court action \u2013 this is always the case in class actions \u2013 and most of them did not actually put their names forward and may not know they are part of the group.</p><p>Anyone who lived in the evacuation zone at the time could benefit if they make a claim now. As in all class actions, no member will be responsible for legal fees or costs.</p><p>In the summer of 2013, Executive Flight Centre Fuel Services Ltd.was providing fuel to the provincial government to fight a forest fire in the area of Lemon Creek in the Slocan Valley. Its tanker truck, driven by Danny LaSante, overturned and spilled 35,000 litres of jet fuel into the creek, polluting the stream and causing a local evacuation of people living up to 40 kilometres downstream in the Slocan Valley.</p><p>The spill killed fish and forced residents to get alternate sources of drinking water for themselves and livestock for days.</p><p>Rosenberg said this is the first class action for environmental damage in Canada that has resulted in payment of a damage claim.</p><p>All four of the defendants have declined to comment on the agreement.</p><p>Filing a claim After the court gives final approval in January, residents may advance a claim or may apply to be excluded from the class action. Details will be announced at the time on Rosenberg\u2019s website.</p><p>Anyone wishing to make a claim may do so, and the amount each class member gets will be decided by an administrator who will apply a point system to the claims.</p><p>A class member can get compensation simply by being a class member. If a person was physically evacuated and can provide evidence of that, they will receive more.</p><p>If a class member suffered personal injuries, such as burning eyes, nose, and rashes, they will get a larger amount, and a more severe personal injury will entitle more yet.</p><p>Documented out-ofpocket expenses such as hotels, gas, evacuation and health-care costs will be reimbursed.</p><p>If a class member can establish that they sold their property in the evacuation zone within five years following the spill and the property was devalued because of the spill, they may get compensation for that.</p><p>A maze of court actions This case has taken a slow and circuitous route through the courts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing (class actions) a long time,\u201d said Rosenberg. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a case that\u2019s been certified, gone to the Court of Appeal, been sent back, certified again, and appealed again.\u201d</p><p>The federal Crown also laid charges against three of the defendants for destruction of fish habitat under the Fisheries Act. LaSante and Executive Flight Services were found guilty and received fines, and the Province of B.C. was found not guilty.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CASNWS-news20241128PPQA0004722212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CASNWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DHS-WN41-F0HF-83FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"689\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

There were cars all over the side of the drive. There was fires on both sides of the canyon. Buildings were completely burned out. It literally looked like a war zone,\" Lindemann told the Star.</p><p>\"It's not uncommon in Southern California to have these little grass fires, but the way the winds were blowing, I've never felt it like that before.\"</p><p>Since Tuesday, fires have broken out in and around Los Angeles, killing at least five people and forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes as flames and heavy smoke engulfed neighbourhoods. Many blazes were fuelled by fierce winds gusting to more than 160 km/h.</p><p>\"I took a picture of what just appeared to be a puff of smoke and then, five minutes later, you could see the hill had blown up with fire behind the house,\" Lindemann said. \"It was at that point that I realized this was bigger than we or anybody had ever seen.\"</p><p>Beyond what he was able to grab as he left his home of 14 years, Lindemann said, \"I've got two pairs of flip flops and some dirty sneakers.\"</p><p>Lindemann and his wife were on their way to Phoenix, Ariz., but he said they planned to stay the night at the home of a well-known Canadian friend.</p><p>\"I'll be stopping in Palm Springs to see my friend Glen Sather, the hockey guru. He's a great friend from my Edmonton days. He heard about what happened, literally reached out 10 minutes ago and said, 'Anything we can do, we got an extra place.' And I said, 'OK, we'll stay with you tonight.'\"</p><p>'A really quick mad dash'</p><p>Canadian filmmaker and producer Connor Malbeuf, meanwhile, said he considers himself among the fortunate.</p><p>On Wednesday evening, he was forced to flee his home in the Runyon Canyon area of the Hollywood Hills after a nearby fire erupted.</p><p>Dubbed the Sunset Fire, the blaze broke out in the Hollywood Hills - home to the iconic Hollywood sign - and eventually spread to 43 acres, which is roughly the size of 20 soccer fields.</p><p>\"It was a really quick mad dash,\" Malbeuf said, describing how he frantically packed a bag of clothes, grabbed his passport and visa and drove off.</p><p>There was a flurry of misinformation online about what to do and where to go, and the roads were \"absolute mayhem,\" said the 28-year-old of the motorists driving on the wrong side of the road and running red lights.</p><p>When Malbeuf returned home early Thursday morning, the air quality index (AQI) in areas near the fires in Los Angeles had surpassed 400, which is considered hazardous to public health. By comparison, Toronto had an AQI of 3, which indicates a low health risk.</p><p>Even outside the evacuation zones, air quality is poor, Malbeuf said.</p><p>Those with homes that have been destroyed are devastated. Kids whose schools have burned down are being sent to new classrooms miles away. Local businesses are shut down.</p><p>For those like Malbeuf, who have watched the terror unfold across the city, there is also an immense desire to help.</p><p>\"It's this anxiety of, 'Well, I need to be safe, but I also am watching my community burn,'\" he said.</p><p>At times, Malbeuf added, it is confusing, because so much information is circulating about the fires and it's hard to know what to believe or where to donate.</p><p>\"We're just so inundated with information that there's not really a clear way of supporting and helping.\"</p><p>As of Thursday night, as the new Kenneth Fire started in the San Fernando Valley, more than 180,000 people were under evacuation orders. The fires have swallowed about 117 square kilometres - a little more than the size of the city of Vancouver.</p><p>\"You're almost in a state of shock,\" said Kam Soltanzadeh, 26, from Toronto, who watched from his L.A. office on Tuesday as a large cloud of smoke rose from the Pacific Palisades.</p><p>\"I've probably seen a scenario like this countless times watching any kind of apocalyptic movie,\" he said. \"But when you're actually in it, it's totally different.\"</p><p>The scenes have elicited worldwide concern. The Canadian and Ontario governments have pledged to send supplies and support, as well as personnel, to help battle the fires. </p><p>On Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted on X: \"Canadian water bombers are already in action. 250 firefighters are ready to deploy. The @CanadianForces are standing by to move personnel and equipment. To our American neighbours: Canada's here to help.\"</p><p>Trudeau also posted a photo of a Canadian water bomber dropping water over the flames, with the line, \"Neighbours helping neighbours.\"</p><p>\"The scenes out of California are devastating,\" wrote Ontario Premier Doug Ford on X. \"Ontario will always stand ready to serve. I've directed officials to send every available water bomber to fight these fires. We'll provide whatever personnel and equipment is needed and spare no expense to help our closest friends and allies.\"</p><p>According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, Ontario will be providing two water bombers, pilots and 165 urban firefighters with equipment such as hoses, pumps, axes and more. There is possibility to increase the numbers of firefighters, if required. There will also be an incident management team of as many as 20 additional staff with expertise in logistics, command and co-ordination, communications, response planning, safety and mapping. </p><p>\"The request is for 2 CL-415 Skimmer Airtankers with flight crew to operate in Southern California,\" said Alexandria Jones, spokesperson for the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC), in a statement. \"There are no fire crew requests at this time. The request is being actioned but the delivery timeline is currently unavailable.\" </p><p>\"We are also proactively working to identify potential resource availability, should more requests come in. We remain in close contact with our colleagues at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise as the situation continues to evolve.\"</p><p>Harjit Sajjan, minister of emergency preparedness, also tweeted that he has been in contact with the head of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency and Canadian Armed Forces were also preparing to deploy to offer assistance. </p><p>\"Team Canada, with Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta, is ready to deploy 250 firefighters, aircraft equipment, and other resources as early as tonight. The Canadian Forces are standing by to move personnel and equipment. Canada stands ready to support our American neighbours during this challenging time,\" wrote Sajjan. </p><p>With files from The Associated Press </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025011074154242</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DVS-9373-RRW9-G12N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1187\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

What does your party see as the best way for carbon reduction, and what goals will you aim to strive in helping the province and Island hit those goals?</p><p>I would agree that we are seeing changes, especially in the North Island.

In our North Island riding, the natural resource sector is very prominent and it doesn't need to be jobs or a healthy environment or healthy ecosystem. We can have both an the Green Party will work towards ensuring\u00a0that there is both. When we work together with industry we can come up with a plan where we look at forests as forests and work towards protecting the most diverse ecosystems\u00a0and also have forestry happening. We just need to work together to make it better for our future generations.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Campbell River Mirror</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPRIV-news20241007PCB4651117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPRIV2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D4M-5KS1-F0HF-820T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"443\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Anderson will be working directly with Premier David Eby.</p><p>\"I think he recognized the work that I had done as co-chair of the Rural Caucus over the last three years.\"</p><p>Anderson said her new cabinet role will formalize work she has already been doing to advance rural issues.</p><p>As an example, she pointed to\u00a0this past summer's wildfire that forced the\u00a0evacuation of Argenta.\u00a0A\u00a0local volunteer fire brigade that had been preparing and training for two decades sprung into action and stayed behind in the community to help BC Wildfire Service with the evacuation and assist firefighters in protecting the community.</p><p>\"They knew that it was going to be not if, but when, there would be a forest fire near their community,\" Anderson said. \"They got trained, they got certified, they got the equipment, they mapped their water systems.\"</p><p>She said she brought this program to the attention of Eby, and now the province intends to support other communities in creating a similar model.</p><p>She also cited the Youth Climate Corps, started in the Kootenays and now spreading to other communities due to funding she sourced. The program \"pays young people a living wage to do climate action work, whether it's retrofitting homes for nonprofits, for adults with diverse abilities, or fire smarting around the Kaslo Town Hall.\"</p><p>The Rural Caucus in the previous government, Anderson said, made a list of issues affecting rural communities.\u00a0The list turned out to be quite long, so they narrowed it down to three: health care, transportation, and transportation to health care. She said her job will be to continue with those.</p><p>She said the government's Travel Assistance Program, which now covers medical travel for eligible people by air, rail, or ferry, will now begin paying mileage for people who want to drive\u00a0for example from Nelson to Kelowna for medical treatment.</p><p>Anderson said that is the kind of gap that she hopes to fill.</p><p>She wants to see rural communities connected by bus, like BC Bus North, that was put in place in 2018 for the security of travellers along Highway 16, also known as the Highway of Tears, in northwestern B.C. That service is funded by the provincial and federal governments.</p><p>\"We have private providers right now that are covering some of those gaps, but we know that it's not a complete service model.\"</p><p>Asked if the government intends to directly provide more bus services like Rural Bus North, Anderson said the government \"is studying different service models.\"</p><p>Regarding attracting doctors and other practitioners to rural areas, Anderson said she thinks of Creston as an example of what is needed.</p><p>\"They've created a really good model where the physicians and the nurse practitioners and nurses, they feel very supported. Doctors want to work there, because they get a full scope of practice. Rural B.C. is an incredible place to live, and there are medical practitioners that want that for themselves and their families, and want to be a part of the community and serve rural British Columbians.\"</p><p>Anderson said the government's plan for the Kootenays regarding the toxic drug crisis and its attendant mental health and housing issues\u00a0includes Anderson and new Minister of Health Josie Osborne going out and listening to people.</p><p>Asked if the government has not been doing that for the past decade, Anderson said, \"We definitely have been. I mean, you look at me in my capacity of MLA in the last four years, my office and myself personally, we have been in direct contact with the organizations and the people that are impacted by the opioid crisis, if not on a daily basis, at least on a weekly basis.\"</p><p>Anderson offered no government plan to address the overdose crisis in the Kootenays.</p><p>She wants rural issues to become a new lens that will be incorporated into all government decisions, similar to the two currently established lenses, Indigenous reconciliation and gender equality.</p><p>\"Everything always goes through a reconciliation lens, and so it discusses how First Nations are impacted by this decision, what their comments are, what their feedback was on the specific decision that you're making, and there's also a gender-based analysis. So I also want the rural piece to be considered.\"</p><p>Copyright 2024 Nelson Star</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20241204PKO4671992</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DK2-P6G1-F0HF-82PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"804\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

A settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agreement, which has been signed by all four defendants and the plaintiff, must still be approved by a judge in B.C. Supreme Court on Jan.15, but David Rosenberg, the lawyer for the plaintiffs Robert Kirk and James Ross, says he is confident it will go through.</p><p>The defendants in the case are Executive Flight Centre Fuel Services Ltd., Transwest Helicopters Ltd., the Province of British Columbia, and Danny LaSante.</p><p>A class action is a lawsuit started by one person on behalf of members of a group that have a similar claim against a single person or company. Before a court will take on a class action, a judge must certify that it meets the multiple rules set out in the Class Proceedings Act, as a judge did in this case.</p><p>Two separate class actions were initiated by Lemon Creek residents Kirk and Ross and then combined. Both are claiming damages on behalf of many \u2013 Kirk for environmental damage and Ross for personal injury.</p><p>According to Rosenberg, the class consists of 2,776 property owners within the zone that was evacuated after the fuel spill, plus anyone who carried on a business within that zone. These people, known as class members, are not individually named in the court action \u2013 this is always the case in class actions \u2013 and most of them did not actually put their names forward and may not know they are part of the group.</p><p>Anyone who lived in the evacuation zone at the time could benefit if they make a claim now.\u00a0As in all class actions, no member will be responsible for legal fees or costs.</p><p>In the summer of 2013, Executive Flight Centre Fuel Services Ltd. was providing fuel to the provincial government to fight a forest fire in the area of Lemon Creek in the Slocan Valley.

The consultation intends to strengthen emergency response in the region by finding a data gap around food flows and food storage.</p><p>\u201cThere is a glaring gap across our region with respect to food flows and food storage capacity. As a region we are prone to seismic, flood, and fire events, and, being located on an island, we are especially vulnerable to emergency events that impact the flow of goods.</p><p>Understanding how food flows in our region, including local production and what storage capacity already exists, is expected to enhance our region\u2019s preparedness and resiliency when the next emergency event occurs\u201d says Maurita Prato, Executive Director of LUSH Valley.</p><p>The team will work with First Nations, municipal and provincial governments, industry organizations and the community to understand the data gap.</p><p>\u201cDuring the COVID-19 pandemic we saw how vulnerable our region\u2019s food system was to disruption. LUSH and other agencies saw an uptick in people using our emergency support services. With the Comox Valley Food Policy Council we started examining food supply and with that group, we have been advocating to the province to support more food security information gathering and support particularly to address food security in emergency situations. In the last few years we have seen increased climate events, such as forest fires in communities west of Qualicum Beach, with food flows completely stalled by the Cameron Lake forest fire in 2022. We are not immune here in the Comox Valley or North Vancouver Island to emergency events affecting transportation routes\u201d says Prato.</p><p>Funding was received by the CVRD through the Invest in Agriculture Foundation of B.C. \u2019s Food Security and Emergency Preparedness Fund. The project would not be possible without this funding.</p><p>For updates on the project, visiting the LUSH valley website:lushvalley.org/resources/projects/</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVRECO-news20240911PPXA0004586956</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVRECO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CY2-Y3S1-F0HF-809X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438259</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"373\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

A settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agreement, which has been signed by all four defendants and the plaintiff, must still be approved by a judge in B.C. Supreme Court on Jan.15, but David Rosenberg, the lawyer for the plaintiffs Robert Kirk and James Ross, says he is confident it will go through.</p><p>The defendants in the case are Executive Flight Centre Fuel Services Ltd., Transwest Helicopters Ltd., the Province of British Columbia, and Danny LaSante.</p><p>A class action is a lawsuit started by one person on behalf of members of a group that have a similar claim against a single person or company. Before a court will take on a class action, a judge must certify that it meets the multiple rules set out in the Class Proceedings Act, as a judge did in this case.</p><p>Two separate class actions were initiated by Lemon Creek residents Kirk and Ross and then combined. Both are claiming damages on behalf of many \u2013 Kirk for environmental damage and Ross for personal injury.</p><p>According to Rosenberg, the class consists of 2,776 property owners within the zone that was evacuated after the fuel spill, plus anyone who carried on a business within that zone. These people, known as class members, are not individually named in the court action \u2013 this is always the case in class actions \u2013 and most of them did not actually put their names forward and may not know they are part of the group.</p><p>Anyone who lived in the evacuation zone at the time could benefit if they make a claim now.\u00a0As in all class actions, no member will be responsible for legal fees or costs.</p><p>In the summer of 2013, Executive Flight Centre Fuel Services Ltd. was providing fuel to the provincial government to fight a forest fire in the area of Lemon Creek in the Slocan Valley. Its tanker truck, driven by Danny LaSante, overturned and spilled 35,000 litres of jet fuel into the creek, polluting the stream and causing a local evacuation of people living up to 40 kilometres downstream in the Slocan Valley.</p><p>The spill killed fish and forced residents to get alternate sources of drinking water for themselves and livestock for days.</p><p>Rosenberg said this is the first class action for environmental damage in Canada that has resulted in payment of a damage claim.</p><p>All four of the defendants have declined to comment on the agreement.</p><p>Filing a claim</p><p>After the court gives final approval in January, residents may advance a claim or may apply to be excluded from the class action.

Only three of those are considered out of control, particularly in the area around Chibougamau, Que., about 420 kilometres northwest of Quebec City. <br/><br/> But while the provincewide situation has improved, Caron said the risk from the fires isn't yet over. <br/><br/> \"There are still risks because the blazes are still huge,\" he said.<br/><br/> One fire burning near the city of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon - which was evacuated twice in June - covers more than 4,000 square kilometres, he said.<br/><br/> That fire has been contained, but is still not controlled, he said, explaining that a contained fire is not currently advancing but could in the future, while a controlled fire is definitely stopped.<br/><br/> Between 1,300 and 1,400 firefighters are on the ground, Caron said, including 150 South Korean wilderness firefighters who arrived in the province on Sunday.<br/><br/> While Quebec's wilderness firefighters usually work up to 24 days straight, Caron said their work usually comes to an end at points over the summer. But this year, with the work of controlling all the fires expected to take the entire season, it will be difficult to ensure firefighters get the time off they need to recuperate.<br/><br/> While the risk of fires in much of the province has declined, dry conditions continue in the northwestern Jam\u00e9sie region where several large fires are burning.<br/><br/> That area is in SOPFEU's northern zone, where fires are only fought if they pose a threat to communities or strategic infrastructure. <br/><br/> There are currently 44 fires in the northern zone, a number Caron described as high. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023070468372197</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68M7-TNP1-JDV5-F2WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"347\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Smoke was rising from the strip of forest beside Highway 3A, east of the Taghum Bridge. As he got closer he noticed the flames were tree height.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He called 911 to report a forest fire.</p><p>\u201cI was getting out of my truck and the 911 lady is like, \u2018Do you want police, fire, or ambulance?\u2019 And I look down there, and I see a car, and I\u2019m like, \u2018We need them all. Send them all.\u2019\u201d The car was in flames, and so was the forest behind it. The driver\u2019s door was crushed against a tree. Weinrauch broke the back driver\u2019s side window with a rock and found an unconscious man in the driver seat, leaning against the door.</p><p>\u201cThe entire front seat and the passenger seat was fully engulfed in flames\u2026Stuff started popping. I think the tires started popping and banging, right? I was just like, well, we got to go. It\u2019s getting hot here. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the back of the driver\u2019s hoodie but it tore off of his body. The only thing left to grab was his hair, which Weinrauch dragged the man out by, from the front seat through the back seat door and onto the ground beside the car.</p><p>He thought the man was dead, but then he heard him trying to breathe. At that point another passerby, John Guillemette, arrived.</p><p>\u201cMe and Colby just looked at each other,\u201d Guillemette said, \u201cand we\u2019re like, \u2018We gotta get him out of there.\u2019 And we just picked him up and we moved him six or eight feet, because me and Colby and the kid (the driver) were right beside the car. And the trees are on fire.</p><p>\u201cJust the fact that he was breathing was amazing. But it was the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. He was not in good shape. He looked pretty well dead.\u201d</p><p>Sara Cuthbert and Hannah Corfe, passing on the highway, also saw the flames and stopped.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I saw that there was a car, I was like, OK, we\u2019re going down there,\u201d Cuthbert said. \u201cWe need to help.\u201d</p><p>They helped Weinrauch and Guillemette move the driver further away from the car, onto the rail bed beside the tracks. He was unconscious and gasping for air, said Cuthbert, and it was hard to grasp him and move him because his body was so severely burned.</p><p>\u201cI know there\u2019s proper ways to lift them,\u201d Guillemette said. \u201cBut we were right beside the burning car.\u201d</p><p>Guillemette has advanced first aid training. He and the nurses got to work, holding the driver\u2019s head, supporting his neck, keeping his jaw open, checking his pulse, looking for bodily injuries.</p><p>Weinrauch estimates the time elapsed between getting the victim out of the car and the eventual arrival of paramedics was about 15-20 minutes that included flames, panic and intense focus.</p><p>\u201cOnce we got him far enough away, we were more focused on first aid,\u201d said Cuthbert. \u201cI didn\u2019t even feel the temperature. I wasn\u2019t even thinking about the car.\u201d</p><p>Guillemette said the right people had arrived at the right time.</p><p>\u201cWe just went with what we had to work with,\u201d he said. \u201cThe timing, and everyone had a role, and it worked. The kid is alive.\u201d</p><p>The next arrival was Dr. Nicholas Sparrow of KERPA, who administered oxygen with the help of Guillemette and the nursing students.</p><p>Then the Nelson Fire Department arrived, followed by an ambulance, the police and the Beasley Fire Department. The fire was being fought while first aid was being administered.</p><p>They called CPKC rail to ask them to delay any expected trains.</p><p>Guillemette said it was Weinrauch\u2019s bravery that saved the driver\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cIt takes some crazy courage just to run down that bank towards that car,\u201d he told Weinrauch as they were being interviewed by the Nelson Star. \u201cYou put your life at risk just being present at that scene\u2026My hat is so off to you, man.</p><p>\u201cThat was insane. It was the bravest shit anyone could have ever done.\u201d</p><p>When they first pulled off the road to help, nursing students Cuthbert and Corfe were on their way to the first day of their third-year practicum. They got more practical experience than they had bargained for that day.</p><p>\u201cWhen I think about it,\u201d said Cuthbert, \u201cit was definitely a traumatic experience through and through. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like that in all of my nursing. We usually are in a controlled environment with lots of help, like instructors, physicians, other nurses, equipment.\u201d</p><p>But Cuthbert said she still feels thankful that she and Corfe were able to contribute.</p><p>The rescued driver is in intensive care in a Vancouver hospital being treated for burns, smoke inhalation, and a broken nose. His mother, Kathleen Elias of Nelson, says he is doing well but has a long recovery ahead.</p><p>The story of the rescue \u201cmakes me cry every time I hear it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can repay such kindness, or show my gratitude, but all I know is that I\u2019m so very, very happy that we have my son with us.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARLNWS-news20240919HZQA0004603607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARLNWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D10-NWY1-F0HF-81WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438269</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

As a wildfire roared towards the area, they were ordered to evacuate. And all through the night, people fled from the flames, trying to find gas -- and a way out to safety. Stephanie Goertz and her family were among them. They're on vacation in Alberta. We reached them on the road to Rocky Mountain House, Alberta.</p><p><br/><br/>NK: Stephanie, when, when did you realize something was wrong?<br/><br/>STEPHANIE GOERTZ: We realized around 10:15 or so last night.<br/><br/>NK: Yeah. And what kind of lead time did you have?<br/><br/>SG: Oh, oh, we didn't really. But -- you know -- we noticed in the last two days that we've been coughing more. We're from Ontario, so we, we don't really notice all this dry heat in the impact. So, we had just assumed our coughing had been 'cause of just being in all the dry heat and all the hiking we'd been going through. But since driving through all the smoke, we've noticed our coughing has become a lot worse. But this is repercussions, and we're grateful that's the only thing.<br/><br/>NK: What, what happened to make you realize that this wasn't just the dry heat and that you were going to need to go?<br/><br/>SG: So, my husband and I, we typically sleep with our phones on silent, so we didn't actually get the alert when it went out on our phones. I actually -- for some reason -- woke up. We went to bed a bit early because we had a long day of hiking, and we have young kids. So, I actually woke up and somehow just picked up my phone for some reason and looked at it and noticed there was an alert on the phone telling everyone that they had to evacuate from Jasper and that there'd be a forest fire in about five hours. And then, I shook my husband awake and said, okay, I'm assuming we should go. We should pack up our things now. Do we pack up everything, or what do we do? We weren't sure how long the drive would be. So my husband went out to pick up some gas, not realizing -- you know -- how fast a forest fire can go and how quickly evacuations needed to happen. Well, my husband left. There was -- you know -- all the cars were there. Everything -- you know, like -- parking lots were full of cars. But within about five minutes, the hotel staff was knocking on everyone's door and -- you know -- using their master keys to make sure that everyone was awake and everyone was aware that they needed to evacuate.<br/><br/>NK: How old are your children? I think we may have heard them in the background coughing, maybe?<br/><br/>SG: Yeah, they're eight and 11.<br/><br/>NK: How are they doing?<br/><br/>SG: You know, they're, they're pretty versatile. [NK chuckles] They, it's anxious. You know, forest fires is new for us in Ontario. So, even waking them up last night and telling them -- you know -- you guys got to get up. There's a forest fire. There's a fire. Please get up. They were kind of just stunned. And -- you know -- my youngest thought I was joking. And I was like, no, there's a fire, but we need to evacuate. And it took a -- you know -- a couple of minutes for it to actually sink in.<br/><br/>NK: What do you say to them as they express that worry as you're on the road?<br/><br/>SG: Yeah. Well, it's been, it's been a long drive. So, we're constantly talking about it and we're allowing them, allowing them to open up and and talk about -- you know -- if they're worried and how they felt. And obviously, we're 3.5 hours east of Jasper now, and everything looks beautiful and fine, right? And it -- you know -- I think it'll take a day or two for it to sink in.<br/><br/>NK: Understandably. You need some time to process. If we go back to when you first were getting out on the road, what were you seeing then in terms of the fire? Could you see the smoke and the burning?<br/><br/>SG: Yeah. So, when we opened our doors, there was definitely a lot of smoke outside our windows. As well as there was ash falling from the skies. When we got into our car -- because we had limited gas -- we ended up having to keep turning off our car constantly because it wasn't a creep. It was a complete stop. But there was lots of emergency vehicles going up and down the roads. And so, we knew we weren't left there alone.<br/><br/>NK: Yeah. I wondered because you said you had that five-hour window to get out if you're worried when you're stuck at a standstill there that --<br/><br/>SG: Yeah. You know, at 4.5 hours, we're still sitting in Jasper, only gone about 10 kilometres of the road. It was definitely getting -- you know -- a bit anxious -- you know -- wondering, hey, what happens now. And then, because we were going to Canmore, we couldn't go south because there was another bigger fire there. They redirected us east up Highway 16 in an escort with other vehicles. So, that allowed us to move quicker out of Jasper. But that put us right along the pathway of seeing the, the fires that were burning on both sides of the road.<br/><br/>NK: How close was it?<br/><br/>SG: Well, it was, it was basically [laughing] right down the other side of the road.<br/><br/>NK: Wow!<br/><br/>SG: The flames had diminished. Luckily there was rain, a bit of rain that fell from the sky. But -- you know -- there was trees and fire. All the trees were gone. And we didn't realize how close it was. It was probably only about 10 minutes up the road from where we were sitting in traffic for the last 4.5 hours. So, that was pretty shocking.<br/><br/>NK: We mentioned that you're on the road to, to Rocky Mountain House, Alberta. Where will you go there. Why did you choose to go there?<br/><br/>SG: Yeah. So, we're, we just decided to continue on with our, our trip and continue doing the activities we had scheduled. We were lucky that we could just hop in our car and keep driving. You know, making the best of it with our children. Ensuring that -- you know -- they're able to see how beautiful Alberta is and that it isn't just -- you know -- wildfires. You know, make it still a memorable experience for them.<br/><br/>NK: It certainly is a beautiful, beautiful part of the country. When you think back on this trip -- though -- and Jasper and this experience, how do you think you'll reflect on it and remember it?<br/><br/>SG: Yeah. So, we didn't consider forest fires as something we needed to plan for.<br/><br/>NK: Yeah.<br/><br/>SG: But definitely have something we have to be in consideration in the future. When we actually looked at the maps of Alberta and B.C. of how many fires are actually currently in Alberta and B.C., it is shocking. Absolutely shocking. We did everything we thought we had to do when planning. We booked our hotels. We planned our trip. I even looked at the weather and planned out which -- you know -- was the top restaurants to go to, and it just never clued in that we should be considering the forest fire. And we're so grateful it was during the day and that we weren't out for -- you know -- a several hour hike without Wi-Fi reception because that's not something we would have been prepared for.<br/><br/>NK: Well -- Stephanie -- I'm really glad you and your family are doing okay. And I hope you all get some rest soon. I appreciate your time. Drive safe.<br/><br/>SG: Thank you. Bye-bye.<br/><br/>CH: That was Stephanie Goertz, who fled the wildfire in Jasper last night. She was on her way to Rocky Mountain House, Alberta.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCBCT-AIH2407232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCBCT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CJT-GPW1-F0BD-C116-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487018</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1188\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

The Green Party is working towards increasing non-market housing in the area, which would mean more people would be able to afford and have a home. I totally support that and see the housing crisis in our riding as a huge issue.\u00a0</p><p>School divisions in the North Island have policies and resources that create a supportive and inclusive environment for students.

In our North Island riding, the natural resource sector is very prominent and it doesn't need to be jobs or a healthy environment or healthy ecosystem. We can have both an the Green Party will work towards ensuring\u00a0that there is both. When we work together with industry we can come up with a plan where we look at forests as forests and work towards protecting the most diverse ecosystems\u00a0and also have forestry happening. We just need to work together to make it better for our future generations.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Campbell River Mirror</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPRIV-news20241004PCB4651117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPRIV2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D40-84N1-JD2C-J3NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"443\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

If the cabinet approves, the deal will then go to the government for final sign off before the ceasefire goes into effect. Friday\u2019s meeting comes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said earlier there were last minute snags in finalizing the agreement. However, a pre-dawn statement Friday by Israel\u2019s government, appeared to clear the way for Israeli approval for the deal. By Sam Mednick and Samy Magdy. SENT: 650 words, photos, video, audio.

The recent round of clemency gives Biden the presidential record for most individual pardons and commutations issued. By Will Weissert.

That leaves TikTok\u2019s fate in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump. Congress last year in a law signed by Biden required that TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company ByteDance divest the company by Jan. 19. Trump, who once called to ban the app, has since pledged to keep it available in the U.S., though his transition team has not said how they intend to accomplish that.

In some states, governors and lawmakers are seeking to cut millions more. The movement for more tax cuts comes after nearly all states already have enacted some sort of tax reduction or rebate in recent years. And it comes as state revenues have begun to recede or stagnate after peaking during the pandemic. Opinions are mixed about whether states can afford additional tax cuts. But more states are again proposing tax cuts rather than tax increases this year. By David A. Lieb.

Students from two elementary schools that burned down in the Palisades Fire arrived Wednesday for their first day of class at two other Los Angeles campuses where their classes are being held temporarily. Seven other Los Angeles Unified School District schools in evacuation zones that have been closed since the fire are also relocating.

His unapologetically populist and nationalistic speech installed the phrases \u201cAmerican Carnage\u201d and \u201cAmerica First\u201d into the presidential lexicon.

What does your party see as the best way for carbon reduction, and what goals will you aim to strive in helping the province and Island hit those goals?</p><p>I would agree that we are seeing changes, especially in the North Island. It's very prevalent, we're having heat domes and definitely increasing fires.\u00a0</p><p>To work towards reducing climate change, the party believes in working towards reducing fossil fuel consumption and that would help towards lowering emissions overall.\u00a0</p><p>While areas of the North Island are growing in rental housing, there continues to be a lack of affordable housing. What detailed actions will your party take to increase affordable housing stock in the riding?</p><p>The party and myself really strongly believe in having safe, affordable housing for everyone. The Green Party is working towards increasing non-market housing in the area, which would mean more people would be able to afford and have a home. I totally support that and see the housing crisis in our riding as a huge issue.\u00a0</p><p>School divisions in the North Island have policies and resources that create a supportive and inclusive environment for students. Will your government do anything to change or limit school division\u2019s abilities to use these policies and resources?</p><p>The Green Party is really committed to safe and comfortable school environments, inclusive where everyone feels comfortable and safe and the party will continue to promote safe and healthy education from early child education all the way to post-secondary.</p><p>Often seen at odds with the resource industry, how will the Green Party of B.C. protect jobs in the resource industry?</p><p>Absolutely. In our North Island riding, the natural resource sector is very prominent and it doesn't need to be jobs or a healthy environment or healthy ecosystem. We can have both an the Green Party will work towards ensuring\u00a0that there is both. When we work together with industry we can come up with a plan where we look at forests as forests and work towards protecting the most diverse ecosystems\u00a0and also have forestry happening. We just need to work together to make it better for our future generations.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Campbell River Mirror</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPRIV-news20241003PCB4651117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPRIV2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D3W-01D1-F0HF-8017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"443\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

All work will occur on public land, and at least 20 metres from private property lines.</p><p>In some cases, crews will chip the fallen trees, and in other cases fallen logs will be left in place as decomposing wood performs an integral role in the forest ecology. Per the Parks and Public Works bylaw, residents are reminded that it is prohibited to remove logs and trees from urban forests and park spaces.</p><p>This mitigation work is done to increase public safety and to lower the risk of property and infrastructure damage and is limited to trees and limbs that are dying or damaged. It is completed during winter months for easier adherence to the Migratory Bird Act and to reduce damage to the forest ecology.</p><p>The city is reminding the public to give crews room to maneuver and to follow all signage when navigating around this work.</p><p>For more information visit reddeer.ca/fire.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20240116RDA0004135738</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B41-RYP1-JD2C-J01R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"265\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

(AP) \u2014 With wildfires burning after its driest September and October ever, New Jersey will issue a drought warning, a step that could eventually lead to mandatory water restrictions if significant rain doesn't fall soon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The state Department of Environmental Protection held an online hearing Tuesday on the conditions. But they would not answer questions, including whether any part of the state is in danger of running out of drinking water or adequate water to fight fires, which are burning in nearly a half-dozen locations. The Associated Press left a message seeking comment from the department after the meeting.</p><p>About an hour after it concluded, the department announced a press briefing for Wednesday \u201cto discuss the state entering Drought Warning status as prolonged dry periods continue statewide.\u201d</p><p>The New Jersey Forest Fire Service says conditions in the state are the driest they have been in nearly 120 years.</p><p>State geologist Steven Domber said water levels are declining across New Jersey.</p><p>\u201cThey are well below long-term averages, and they're trending down,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will continue to drop over the coming weeks unless we get significant rainfall.\u201d</p><p>He said about half the public water systems in New Jersey are experiencing close to normal demand for water, but 40% are seeing higher demand than usual.</p><p>It could take 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain to meaningfully improve conditions in New Jersey, officials said. But forecasts don't call for that.</p><p>The combination of higher than normal temperatures, severely diminished rainfall and strong demand for water is stressing water supplies, said David Robinson, the state climatologist. He said New Jersey received 0.02 inches (a half-millimeter) of rain in October, when 4.19 inches (10.64 cm) is normal.</p><p>So far in November, the state has gotten a quarter to a half-inch (1.27 cm) of rain. The statewide average for the month is 4 inches (10.16 cm).</p><p>Since August, the state received 2 inches (5.08 cm) of rain when it should have gotten a foot (0.3 meters), Robinson said.</p><p>\u201cA bleak picture is only worsening,\u201d he said.</p><p>The state was under a drought watch Tuesday morning, which includes restrictions on most outdoor fires and calls for voluntary conservation. The next step, which the state is considering, a drought warning, imposes additional requirements on water systems, and asks for even more voluntary water-saving actions. The final step would be declaration of a drought emergency, under which businesses and homes would face mandatory water restrictions.</p><p>Several leaders of public water systems urged New Jersey to go straight to a drought emergency. Tim Eustace, executive director of the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission, said the Wanaque Reservoir is at about 45% of capacity.</p><p>\u201cUsing drinking water to water lawns is kind of crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI would really like to move to a drought emergency so we can stop people from watering their lawns.\u201d</p><p>New Jersey has been battling numerous wildfires in recent weeks, including at least five last week. The largest has burned nearly 5 1/2 square miles (14.24 square kilometers) on the New Jersey-New York border and led to the death of a New York parks worker. That fire was 20% contained as of Tuesday morning.</p><p>Conditions are also dry in New York, which issued a drought watch last week. Mayor Eric Adams mayor urged residents to take shorter showers, fix dripping faucets and otherwise conserve water.</p><p>Just 0.01 inches (0.02 cm) of rain fell last month on the city\u2019s Central Park, where October normally brings about 4.4 inches (11.2 cm) of precipitation, National Weather Service records show. City Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala said it was the driest October in over 150 years of records.</p><p>Jeff Tober, manager of Rancocas Creek Farm in the bone-dry New Jersey Pinelands, said his farm has gotten 0.6 inches (1.52 cm) of rain in the last 87 days.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty brutal,\u201d he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Wayne Parry on X: @WayneParryAC</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-77c8c43c65ea884608197e99573acd1b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DDF-D4P1-JBVR-34TJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"666\"/><timeReceived>01:58 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 12, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

There were four age categories:under eight, eight to 10, 11 to 12, and 13-plus.

Their unwavering commitment and readiness to face danger head-on is truly inspiring, and their courage is a true testament to the values they uphold.</p><p>On Firefighters' National Memorial Day, we honour the dedication and bravery of firefighters across Canada. This day serves as an opportunity to offer our thanks for their ongoing service, both at home and abroad. We extend our appreciation to their families, whose support is integral to their loved ones' heroism.</p><p>I would like to take this time to commemorate the fallen firefighters who have tragically lost their lives fighting fires in Canada including wildfires this season. Today, we remember and pay tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Their sacrifices exemplify the highest ideals of selflessness.</p><p>Climate change and the growing frequency of wildfires directly impacts the safety of people in Canada. Again this year, we have seen the destructive impacts of wildfires and how they have significantly affected communities in the west coast, particularly in Jasper, Alberta.The work of firefighters is crucial to Canada's initiatives to enhance climate change adaptation and bolster our resilience against the growing threat of wildfires. Additionally, I want to recognize the crucial work of the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre in coordinating the Canadian response to international requests for assistance.</p><p>I encourage you all to take a moment to reflect on the remarkable service performed by firefighters across our nation, as well as their continuous devotion to public safety.</p><p>On behalf of the Government of Canada, I express our deepest gratitude to all firefighters, past and present, for their invaluable contributions towards the safety and well-being of people in Canada.\"</p><p>SOURCE  Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada</p><p> View original content: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2024/06/c1523.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2024/06/c1523.html</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNW-20240906C1523</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CX0-4821-DYRK-D0G1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"386\"/><timeReceived>10:02 AM Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CNW Group</copyright><publicationName>Canada NewsWire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>September 6, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The consultation intends to strengthen emergency response in the region by finding a data gap around food flows and food storage.</p><p>\u201cThere is a glaring gap across our region with respect to food flows and food storage capacity. As a region we are prone to seismic, flood, and fire events, and, being located on an island, we are especially vulnerable to emergency events that impact the flow of goods. Understanding how food flows in our region, including local production and what storage capacity already exists, is expected to enhance our region\u2019s preparedness and resiliency when the next emergency event occurs\u201d says Maurita Prato, Executive Director of LUSH Valley.</p><p>The team will work with First Nations, municipal and provincial governments, industry organizations and the community to understand the data gap.</p><p>\u201cDuring the COVID-19 pandemic we saw how vulnerable our region\u2019s food system was to disruption. LUSH and other agencies saw an uptick in people using our emergency support services. With the Comox Valley Food Policy Council we started examining food supply and with that group, we have been advocating to the province to support more food security information gathering and support particularly to address food security in emergency situations. In the last few years we have seen increased climate events, such as forest fires in communities west of Qualicum Beach, with food flows completely stalled by the Cameron Lake forest fire in 2022.

(AP) \u2014 Fire crews on both coasts of the United States continued battling wildfires on Sunday, including a blaze in New York and New Jersey that killed a parks employee and another in Southern California that destroyed more than 130 structures and damaged dozens more. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Firefighters continued making progress against a wildfire northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County that broke out Wednesday and quickly exploded in size due to dry, warm and gusty Santa Ana winds. </p><p>The Mountain Fire prompted thousands of residents to flee their homes and was 26% contained as of Sunday, up from 21% the previous day. The fire\u2019s size remains around 32 square miles (about 83 square kilometers). The cause is under investigation.</p><p>\u201cThe fire continues to creep and smolder in steep rugged terrain. Threats remain to critical infrastructure, highways, and communities,\u201d according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, better known as Cal Fire. </p><p>Meanwhile, New York State Police said they were investigating the death of Dariel Vasquez, an 18-year-old state parks employee who died when a tree fell on him Saturday afternoon as he battled a major brush fire in Sterling Forest, located in New York state's Greenwood Lake near the New Jersey line.</p><p>\u201cRip brother your shift is over job well done,\u201d a New York State forestry services post said. </p><p>Jeremy Oldroyd, a forest ranger with New York state, said that Vasquez died \u201cassisting with fire line construction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWildland firefighting is a very dangerous profession, and we try to take as many precautions as we can mitigate some of the hazards that are out there in the wildland fire environment. But occasionally accidents do happen,\u201d he said. </p><p>New Jersey's state forest fire service said Sunday that the blaze \u2014 dubbed the Jennings Creek Wildfire \u2014 was threatening 25 structures, including two New Jersey homes. It had grown to 4.7 square miles (12 square kilometers) and was 10% contained as of Sunday night. </p><p>Health advisories were issued for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality due to smoke from the fires. People were urged to limit strenuous outdoor physical activity if possible; those especially sensitive included the very young and very old and people with ailments such as asthma and heart disease.</p><p>But there was progress on other fires.</p><p>New Jersey officials reported 75% containment of a 175-acre (70-hectare) fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County that was threatening 55 homes, although no evacuations had been ordered, as well as progress made on other fires burning in the state amid bone-dry conditions. </p><p>In New Jersey, Ocean County prosecutors on Saturday announced arson and firearms charges in connection with a 350-acre (142-hectare) Jackson Township fire that started Wednesday. </p><p>They said that fire was sparked by magnesium shards from a shotgun round on the berm of a shooting range. Officials said firing that kind of \u201cincendiary or tracer ammunition\u201d was barred in the state. The majority of the blaze has been contained, officials reported Friday.</p><p>In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves has burned hundreds of acres in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park extending across about 3.4 square miles (8.8 square kilometers) in the city some 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of Boston. </p><p>The Lynn Fire Department cited \"a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have had over 400 acres of the woods that have burned so far. We believe we have the fire contained using the main fire roads. We will maintain a presence to ensure the fire doesn\u2019t spread further,\" Lynn Fire Chief Dan Sullivan said in a statement late Sunday. </p><p>He said windy and dry conditions \u201ccertainly made it challenging\u201d even as he asked people to stay away from the burned-out areas. \u201cThere are far too many weakened trees, and we don\u2019t want the public to get injured,\" he added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-2ecc0fa526dc9fe71870f7e6f9b0e5be</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DD1-F4P1-DY9S-T548-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><timeReceived>05:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 11, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The consultation intends to strengthen emergency response in the region by finding a data gap around food flows and food storage.</p><p>\u201cThere is a glaring gap across our region with respect to food flows and food storage capacity. As a region we are prone to seismic, flood, and fire events, and, being located on an island, we are especially vulnerable to emergency events that impact the flow of goods. Understanding how food flows in our region, including local production and what storage capacity already exists, is expected to enhance our region\u2019s preparedness and resiliency when the next emergency event occurs\u201d says Maurita Prato, Executive Director of LUSH Valley.</p><p>The team will work with First Nations, municipal and provincial governments, industry organizations and the community to understand the data gap.</p><p>\u201cDuring the COVID-19 pandemic we saw how vulnerable our region\u2019s food system was to disruption. LUSH and other agencies saw an uptick in people using our emergency support services. With the Comox Valley Food Policy Council we started examining food supply and with that group, we have been advocating to the province to support more food security information gathering and support particularly to address food security in emergency situations. In the last few years we have seen increased climate events, such as forest fires in communities west of Qualicum Beach, with food flows completely stalled by the Cameron Lake forest fire in 2022. We are not immune here in the Comox Valley or North Vancouver Island to emergency events affecting transportation routes\u201d says Prato.</p><p>Funding was received by the CVRD through the Invest in Agriculture Foundation of B.C.\u2019s Food Security and Emergency Preparedness Fund.

Smoke was rising from the strip of forest below Highway 3A, east of the Taghum Bridge. As he got closer he noticed the flames were tree height. He called 911 to report a forest fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cI was getting out of my truck and the 911 lady is like, \u2018Do you want police, fire, or ambulance?\u2019 And I look down there, and I see a car, and I\u2019m like, \u2018We need them all. Send them all.\u2019\u201d The car was in flames, and so was the forest behind it. The driver\u2019s door was crushed against a tree. Weinrauch broke the back driver\u2019s side window with a rock and found an unconscious man in the driver seat, leaning against the door.</p><p>\u201cThe entire front seat and the passenger seat was fully engulfed in flames \u2026 Stuff started popping \u2013 I think the tires started popping and banging right? I was just like, well, we got to go. It\u2019s getting hot here. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the back of the driver\u2019s hoodie but it tore off of his body. The only thing left to grab was his hair, which Weinrauch dragged the man out by, from the front seat through the back seat door and onto the ground beside the car.</p><p>He thought the man was dead, but then he heard him trying to breathe.

Prices fell for everything from crude oil and Big Tech stocks to small companies that invest only in U.S. real estate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's the latest:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Republicans moving ahead with Trump\u2019s \u2018big\u2019 bill of tax breaks and spending cuts amid tariff uproar</p><p>After a long wait, the Senate is launching action on Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d of tax breaks and spending cuts at a risky moment for the U.S. and global economy.</p><p>More than a month after House Republicans surprised Washington by advancing their framework for Trump\u2019s tax breaks and spending cuts package, Senate Republicans voted Thursday to start working on their version.</p><p>The 52-48 vote sets the stage for back-to-back Senate all-nighters spilling into Friday and the weekend.</p><p>Work on the multitrillion-dollar package is coming as markets at home and abroad are on edge in the aftermath Trump\u2019s vast tariffs scheme, complicating an already difficult political and procedural undertaking.</p><p>\u25b6 Read more about the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d         </p><p>IMF director says tariffs \u2018represent significant risk to the global outlook\u2019</p><p>International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the announcement of U.S. tariffs \u201cclearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook\u201d at a time of sluggish global growth.</p><p>\u201cIt is important to avoid steps that could further harm the world economy,\u201d Georgieva said in a statement. \u201cWe appeal to the United States and its trading partners to work constructively to resolve trade tensions and reduce uncertainty.\u201d</p><p>The IMF and World Bank will hold meetings later this month to discuss the world economic outlook and other issues. U.S. tariffs will be a part of that discussion.</p><p>States sue to block Trump\u2019s election order</p><p>Democratic officials in 19 states are suing over Trump\u2019s attempt to reshape elections across the U.S., calling it an unconstitutional invasion of states\u2019 clear authority to run their own elections.</p><p>The lawsuit is the fourth against the executive order issued just a week ago. It seeks to block key aspects of it, including new requirements that people provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and a demand that all mail ballots be received by Election Day.</p><p>The lawsuit says forcing such changes on the states violates the broad authority the Constitution gives states to set their own election rules.</p><p>Trump has argued his order secures the vote against illegal voting by noncitizens, though multiple studies and investigations in the states have shown that it\u2019s rare.</p><p>\u25b6 Read more about the lawsuit         </p><p>Trump backs proposal that would allow proxy voting in the House for new parents</p><p>Trump backed a bipartisan proposal from a House Republican who has been pushing to allow proxy voting, rather than voting in person, in the House for new parents.</p><p>The president said he spoke with Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, of Florida, a leading proponent of the idea, about her effort and said of it: \u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s controversial.\u201d</p><p>Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, said he would defer to House Speaker Mike Johnson to make the ultimate call on those changes.</p><p>But \u201cyou\u2019re having a baby, I think you should be able to call in and vote,\u201d the president added. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of that.\u201d</p><p>\u25b6 Read more about the proxy voting proposal         </p><p>Chile\u2019s finance mi</p><p>nister says Trump\u2019s tariffs are \u2018unjustified\u2019</p><p>Chilean Finance Minister Mario Marcel said Trump\u2019s tariffs are \u201cunjustified,\u201d warning they will be \u201ca shock to the global economy.\u201d</p><p>Marcel said the 10% tariffs imposed on his South American nation will have a \u201climited\u201d impact because the taxes don\u2019t apply to Chile\u2019s most crucial exports \u2014 lumber and copper. Still, the tariffs could affect the competitiveness of Chile\u2019s agricultural production, he said.</p><p>The U.S. is Chile\u2019s second-largest trading partner after China.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a situation we must face calmly and intelligently,\u201d he told journalists.</p><p>Trump says Loomer made personnel recommendations but says she did not have role in NSC firings</p><p>\u201cLaura Loomer is a very good patriot and a very strong person,\u201d said Trump, who described the far-right activist as usually \u201cconstructive.\u201d</p><p>Trump acknowledged that Loomer \u201crecommended certain people for jobs\u201d during their Wednesday conversation at the White House</p><p>\u201cSometimes I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody,\u201d Trump said.</p><p>Asked if Loomer had anything to do with aides being ousted from their jobs at the National Security Council, Trump replied, \u201cno.\u201d</p><p>Trump acknowled</p><p>ges \u2018some\u2019 NSC staffers have been fired</p><p>\u201cAlways we\u2019re letting go of people,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he made his way to Miami. \u201cPeople that we don\u2019t like or people that we don\u2019t think can do the job or people that may have loyalties to somebody else.\u201d</p><p>Trump says Musk will probably leave \u2018in a few months\u2019</p><p>The president told reporters aboard Air Force One that his most powerful and disruptive adviser will likely be leaving in the near future.</p><p>Trump said \u201cElon is fantastic\u201d but that he has \u201ca number of companies to run.\u201d The billionaire entrepreneur owns Tesla, Space X and X, among others.</p><p>Speculation about Musk\u2019s future has been swirling in Washington, and there have been growing indications that he\u2019ll start winding down his work for the administration soon.</p><p>\u25b6 Read more about what Trump said about Musk         </p><p>Federal judge says she will temporarily block billions in health funding cuts</p><p>A federal judge plans to temporarily block Trump\u2019s administration from cutting billions in federal dollars that support COVID-19 initiatives and public health projects throughout the country.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy in Rhode Island said she will grant the temporary restraining order sought by a coalition of attorneys general and officials from the District of Columbia and 23 states.</p><p>The lawsuit said the loss of money \u2014 which was allocated by Congress during the pandemic and mostly used for COVID-19 pandemic-related initiatives, as well as for mental health and substance use efforts \u2014 will devastate U.S. public health infrastructure, putting states \u201cat greater risk for future pandemics and the spread of otherwise preventable disease and cutting off vital public health services.\u201d</p><p>The U.S. Health and Human Services Department has defended the decision, saying that the money was being wasted since the pandemic is over.</p><p>Sanders loses fight to block bomb sales to Israel</p><p>Sen. Bernie Sanders led a group of senators Thursday in a failed fight to block a new multibillionaire bomb sale to Israel. Two different attempts received only 15 votes in support, with more than 80 senators opposed.</p><p>As Israel\u2019s main source of military aid, \u201cWe are deeply complicit,\u201d Sanders told lawmakers from the Senate floor.</p><p>In February, Trump bypassed normal congressional review to approve a nearly $3 billion sale to Israel with more 2,000- and 500-pound (900- and 230-kilogram) bombs and other warheads.</p><p>Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, pointed to what he called the \u201ctwisted vision\u201d of Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to move Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million Palestinians out of the territory.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the man who pledged to bring peace to the Middle East?\u201d Van Hollen asked.</p><p>Dow drops nearly 1,680 in biggest wipeout since 2020</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell 4.8% Thursday, more than other major stock markets.

Cinnamon is harvested from trees that can\u2019t survive in the U.S., for example. Domestic production of coffee and cocoa is also limited.</p><p>\u201cWe encourage President Trump and his trade advisors to fine-tune their approach and exempt key ingredients and inputs in order to protect manufacturing jobs and prevent unnecessary inflation at the grocery store,\u201d said Tom Madrecki, the association\u2019s vice president of supply chain resiliency.</p><p>Argentina\u2019s president is off to Mar-a-Lago, defending Trump\u2019s tariffs</p><p>Javier Milei, a libertarian who frequently showers praise on the American president, posted on X a link to the Queen song \u201cFriends will be Friends\u201d as global markets slumped and trade tensions spiked.</p><p>Milei said he hopes to meet informally with Trump during Thursday night\u2019s \u201cAmerican Patriots Gala\u2019 where his office said both he and Trump will be receiving an award.</p><p>Meanwhile, his spokesperson dismissed the irony of Milei defending Trump\u2019s 10% tariffs on Argentine products, even as he staunchly opposes protectionism for Argentina\u2019s long-constricted economy.</p><p>\u201cTrump is not a protectionist,\u201d Manuel Adorni said. \u201cWe believe his approach is pro-trade, and he raises tariffs on countries that are either protectionist or have a disproportionate level of tariffs.\u201d</p><p>Trump offers first reaction to stock market drop day after tariff announcement</p><p>The president commented as he left the White House for a trip to Florida, saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s going very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom and the country is going to boom,\u201d Trump said.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,300 points as U.S. stocks lead a worldwide sell-off after Trump\u2019s announcement of tariffs against much of the world ignited a COVID-like shock.</p><p>\u25b6 Read more about what Trump said about the tariffs         </p><p>Italian premier says Trump\u2019s tariffs are not a catastrophe</p><p>Giorgia Meloni told Italian state TV on Thursday that she believes Trump\u2019s decision to impose 20% tariffs on exports from Europe is \u201cwrong,\u2019\u2019 but \u201cit is not the catastrophe that some are making it out to be.\u2019\u2019</p><p>The U.S. market represents 10% of Italy\u2019s total exports, but she argued that retaliatory tariffs could do more harm to Italy\u2019s economy.</p><p>She said that the government would meet next week with representatives of affected sectors to formulate proposals to present to Italy\u2019s European partners. \u201cWe need to open an honest discussion on the matter with the Americans, with the goal \u2014 at least from my point of view \u2014 of removing tariffs, not multiplying them,\u2019\u2019 Meloni said.</p><p>Pentagon acting inspector general announces investigation into defense secretary\u2019s use of Signal chat for Houthi attack plans</p><p>The watchdog at the Pentagon said he would review Pete Hegseth\u2019s use of the Signal messaging app to convey plans for a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen.</p><p>The review will also look at other defense officials\u2019 use of the publicly available encrypted app, which is not able to handle classified material and is not part of the Defense Department\u2019s secure communications network.</p><p>\u25b6 Read more about developments involving this probe of the Signal chat controversy         </p><p>China\u2019s economy would \u2018collapse\u2019 if US consumers turn them back, US ambassador pick says</p><p>Trump\u2019s pick as ambassador to China told lawmakers it\u2019s time to \u201cstand up\u201d against unfair trade practices by the United States\u2019 top trade rival.</p><p>David Perdue, a wealthy businessman and former U.S. senator from Georgia, acknowledged that some sacrifices are needed, because \u201cwhat we\u2019ve become seduced by are the cheap prices that we gave in to over the last 30 years coming out of China.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the American public says enough\u2019s enough, what will happen to their economy?\u201d Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida asked of China.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll collapse,\u201d Perdue answered.</p><p>Republicans react to market plunge</p><p>Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., brushed off the harsh reaction financial markets are having to Trump\u2019s new tariffs.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all emotional. I\u2019ve invested in the stock market for years. They go up and down on whether it rains or doesn\u2019t rain,\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cIt\u2019ll all turn around.\u201d</p><p>Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., said it\u2019s ok to have concerns about the tariffs, but he has confidence in Trump, and \u201cas we move along, if we need to adjust, we adjust.\u201d</p><p>Justice also said \u201cwe got to give it some time\u201d in evaluating whether the tariffs are working. \u201cIt is a major reset to what we\u2019re doing in this country, and anything that is a major reset, the markets usually act pretty severely to it.\u201d</p><p>Italian trade group predicts massive job losses without a solution to Trump\u2019s tariffs</p><p>Federvini has denounced the new U.S. tariffs as a \u201csevere blow against free trade\u201d that will impact 2 billion euros($2.2 billion) in Italian exports of wine and spirits, 40,000 producers and 450,000 workers.</p><p>\u201cWe have been through this before, and we know the cost all too well: such measures in the past have led to a drop in exports to the United States of up to 50%,\u2019\u2019 Federvini President Micaela Pallini said in a statement.</p><p>\u201cNow we risk reliving that economic trauma, with devastating consequences.\u2019\u2019 She warned of a looming production and employment crisis if a solution cannot be negotiated, underlining that U.S. companies that import and distribute wines will also be impacted.</p><p>France\u2019s president urges French industries to suspend US investments</p><p>Emmanuel Macron said it\u2019s important \u201cthat future investments be suspended for a while until we\u2019ve clarified things with the U.S. ... because what would be the message of having major European players investing billions of euros (dollars) in the American economy at a time when they\u2019re hitting us?\u201d</p><p>Macron met Thursday in Paris with representatives of wines and spirits, food, cosmetics, health, metals, aeronautics and other industries. He called Trump\u2019s announcement \u201cbrutal\u201d and \u201cunfounded because you can\u2019t correct trade imbalances by imposing tariffs.\u201d</p><p>The European Union needs to respond in \u201cthe most effective way\u201d to send \u201ca very clear message that we\u2019re determined \u2026 to defend and protect ourselves,\u201d Macron said, noting that American tech giants now profit from digital services in Europe.</p><p>Canada to match Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs by taxing US vehicles \u2014 but not auto parts</p><p>Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada will match the U.S. president\u2019s 25% auto tariffs with a tariff on vehicles imported from the United States \u2014 but not on their parts, as Trump did with his previously announced 25% tariffs on auto imports that took effect Thursday.</p><p>The prime minister said he told Trump last week in a phone call that he would be retaliating.</p><p>\u201cWe take these measures reluctantly. And we take them in ways that is intended and will cause maximum impact in the United States and minimum impact in Canada,\u201d Carney said. He said Canada won\u2019t tariff the parts because Canadians know the benefits of the integrated auto sector, where parts can cross the border multiple times as vehicles are assembled in Ontario or Michigan.</p><p>\u25b6 Read more on Canada\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s auto tariffs         </p><p>Chuck Schumer: Why penguins and not Putin?</p><p>\u201cDonald Trump is using tariffs in the dumbest way imaginable. Donald Trump slapped tariffs on penguins and not on Putin,\u201d the minority leader said on the Senate floor Thursday.</p><p>Schumer was referring to Trump\u2019s 10% sanctions on the Heard and McDonald Islands, an Australian territory in the remote Antarctic. They\u2019re mostly barren, with active volcanoes.</p><p>Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, meanwhile, was left off Trump\u2019s list, which also includes Jan Mayen, a small Norwegian island in the Arctic that possibly has more polar bears than people.</p><p>\u25b6 Read more on remote island tariff targets         </p><p>Senators introduce bipartisan bill to expand congressional authority over tariffs</p><p>The legislation pushed by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley and Washington Democrat Maria Cantwell would require presidents to justify new tariffs and secure congressional approval within 60 days, otherwise they would expire.</p><p>Grassley said he was working on this long before Trump introduced sweeping global tariffs. Whether it gains traction in the Republican-controlled Congress remains to be seen.</p><p>Congress already technically has authority over tariffs, but over the last century it has given much of that power to the president. This has effectively removed most of its check on executive power. Lawmakers have some standing to counter tariffs, such as nullifying a presidential emergency declaration, but such resolutions need to pass both chambers and then either be signed by the president, or have the votes to override a veto.</p><p>The National Endowment for the Humanities is terminating grants, recipients say</p><p>The NEH distributes hundreds of millions of dollars each year to state humanities councils, along with museums, historical sites, educational institutions and independent researchers.</p><p>Now NEH grant recipients are getting termination notices, according to the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3403.</p><p>\u201cCutting NEH funding directly harms communities in every state and contributes to the destruction of our shared cultural heritage,\u201d reads a statement from the National Humanities Alliance, a nationwide coalition of humanities advocates.</p><p>Brazil\u2019s Congress unanimously gives its president power to retaliate against Trump\u2019s tariffs</p><p>Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva says his administration will take all necessary actions, based on World Trade Organization principles and a new reciprocity bill approved by Congress on Wednesday, to protect Brazil\u2019s companies and workers after the U.S. imposed a 10% extra tariff on all Brazilian exports.</p><p>\u201cWe stand for multilateralism and free trade, and we will respond to any attempt to impose protectionism, which no longer has a place in today\u2019s world,\u201d Lula said during an official ceremony in Bras\u00edlia.</p><p>The U.S. is Brazil\u2019s top trade partner after China, importing Brazilian crude oil, aircraft, coffee, cellulose and beef. America\u2019s trade surplus reached $28.6 billion in goods and services last year.</p><p>Brazil has said it remains open to dialogue aimed at reversing the extra tariffs, while also considering taking the case to the WTO and imposing reciprocal tariffs.</p><p>Trump has moved to fire some NSC officials after Laura Loomer presentation, sources say</p><p>The president took action involving several senior White House National Security Council officials soon after he was urged by the far-right activist to purge staffers she deemed insufficiently committed to his Make America Great Again agenda, according to several people familiar with the matter Thursday.</p><p>Loomer presented her research to Trump in an Oval Office meeting, making her case for the firings, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive personnel matters. Vice President JD Vance, chief of staff Susie Wiles, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Serio Gor, the director of the Presidential Personnel Office, took part in the meeting, the people said.</p><p>NSC spokesperson Brian Hughes declined to comment on the meeting or the firings.</p><p>\u25b6 Read more on Trump and Loomer\u2019s loyalty research         </p><p>Schools must sign certification against DEI to receive federal money, Trump administration says</p><p>The Trump administration is ordering schools nationwide to certify that they are following federal civil rights laws \u2014 and eliminating DEI practices \u2014 as a condition for receiving federal money.</p><p>A notice sent Thursday by the Education Department gives the nation\u2019s states and schools 10 days to sign and return the certification. It marks another escalation in the Trump administration\u2019s attack on diversity, equity and inclusion policies.</p><p>\u201cFederal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right,\u201d Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement.</p><p>A nation Trump said \u2018nobody has ever heard of\u2019 now faces 50% tariffs on exports to US</p><p>Lesotho is one of the smallest countries in Africa with a population of 2.2 million people, yet exports $237.3 million worth of goods to the U.S. \u2014 mostly textiles and diamonds \u2014 sectors which create most of its jobs.</p><p>\u201cThere is no country immune from those tariff hikes he made. That means countries will have to renegotiate their positions with the USA and see how they will manage to trade in,\u201d government spokesperson Thabo Sekonyela said.</p><p>The U.S. is Lesotho\u2019s second biggest trade partner after South Africa. This a second blow for Lesotho after Trump withdrew foreign aid.</p><p>Democrats warn that Trump\u2019s tariffs could result in a recession</p><p>Democrats are blaming Trump for plunging financial markets and calling on him to rescind his tariffs.</p><p>Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, said the tariffs amount to the biggest tax hike on families since World War II. He spoke on the Senate floor as financial markets tanked, saying, \u201cDonald Trump has singlehandedly created a financial forest fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresident Trump should reverse course on his disastrous tariffs immediately,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cOr else, he risks plunging America into recession.\u201d</p><p>US prices for some furniture could nearly double, trade association says</p><p>The Home Furnishings Association, which represents more than 13,000 U.S. furniture stores, predicted that the tariffs will increase prices between 10% and 46%. Vietnam and China are the top furniture exporter to the U.S.</p><p>The association said manufacturers in Asia are offsetting some of the costs by discounting their products and lowering ocean freight rates. But it still expects U.S. furniture prices to rise. Even domestically made furniture often relies on imported components, the association said.</p><p>AP-NORC poll: Trump\u2019s government changes aren\u2019t a clear political winner or loser \u2014 yet</p><p>Trump\u2019s dramatic changes to the federal government haven\u2019t emerged as an obvious political winner or loser, according to a new poll that indicates some Americans may be giving him the benefit of the doubt for now on his Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p>           The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cstrongly\u201d approve of Trump\u2019s handling of Social Security and a similar share approve of the way he\u2019s managing the federal government.

Trump\u2019s tariffs could reverse that</p><p>Greece\u2019s exports of canned peaches to the U.S. in 2020 were worth 32 million euros ($35.3 million) and soared to 95 million euros ($105 million) in 2024. The new 20% tariff, on top of existing duties, could reverse those gains, according to Christos Giannakakis, vice president of Venus, one Greece\u2019s largest peach canning cooperatives.</p><p>\u201cThis creates a huge problem,\u201d Giannakakis told The Associated Press. \u201cIt means reduced exports, lower revenue and shrinking production.\u201d</p><p>Norway\u2019s foreign minister says tariffs hurt NATO allies</p><p>Norway\u2019s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said the new U.S. tariffs may violate NATO\u2019s Article 2, which stresses the importance of economic cooperation among allies to avoid conflict.</p><p>\u201cIf you want a strong NATO, you should ensure that there is as much economic growth as possible in the NATO countries. That was the insight of those who established NATO, that economic cooperation would be good for the entire alliance,\u201d Eide said during a visit to Brussels for a NATO meeting, according to the NRK broadcaster.</p><p>Eide told NRK that he will raise the tariff war with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during the meeting.</p><p>Polish prime minister says tariffs may shave off 0.4% of GDP</p><p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the new U.S. tariffs many reduce Poland\u2019s GDP by 0.4%.</p><p>He said it was \u201ca severe and unpleasant blow, because it comes from the closest ally, but we will survive it.\u201d The Polish-U.S. friendship, he added, \u201cmust also survive this test.\u201d</p><p>Spanish PM announces measures to mitigate US tariffs</p><p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said Thursday that his government will implement a $15.6 billion (14.1 billion euro) spending package to mitigate the effects of U.S. tariffs on the eurozone\u2019s fourth-largest economy.</p><p>The Spanish leader called the tariffs \u201c19th-century protectionism,\u201d against which the European Union and Spain had to act proactively and diversify their economic ties with the rest of the world.</p><p>S\u00e1nchez also called for a negotiated solution with the U.S.</p><p>Australia is puzzled by tariffs on remote islands</p><p>The local government leader of Christmas Island, one of several Australian external island territories that like Australia have been assigned a 10% U.S. tariff, said his Indian Ocean atoll exported nothing to the U.S.</p><p>The Australian outpost of fewer than 2,000 people 360 kilometers (225 miles) south of the Indonesian capital Jakarta has used U.S. heavy machinery to mine phosphate for decades, Christmas Island Shire President Gordon Thomson said.</p><p>The uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands in the remote Antarctic are another Australian territory included in the 10% tariff. The mostly barren islands include two active volcanoes and can only be reached by sea.</p><p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia imposes no tariffs on U.S. imports. The U.S. and Australia have a free trade agreement.</p><p>Hong Kong urges US to withdraw tariffs</p><p>Hong Kong strongly opposed the extra tariffs announced by Trump and urged the U.S. to withdraw them. It said Hong Kong, as a free port, always practices free trade and doesn\u2019t impose tariffs on imported goods, including those from the U.S.</p><p>It said the U.S. had a trade surplus of $271.5 billion with the semiautonomous Chinese territory over the past decade, the highest among its global trading partners.</p><p>\u201cThe U.S. imposing tariffs on Hong Kong products as so-called reciprocal tariffs defies logic,\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s government said in a statement, adding that it would take measures including filing complaints with the WTO.</p><p>Hong Kong, a former British colony returned to China in 1997, has a different economic and political system from mainland China that allows it to set its own policies most of the time.</p><p>India wants to expedite trade talks with US</p><p>India\u2019s Trade Ministry is assessing the latest U.S. tariffs announced by Trump. It said the Indian government strives to expedite the negotiations for a trade agreement with the U.S. to potentially garner some concessions and offset the impact of higher import taxes.</p><p>\u201cWe remain in touch with the Trump administration and expect to take them forward in the coming days,\u201d it said.</p><p>The U.S was New Delhi\u2019s biggest trading partner in 2024 with trade estimated at $129 billion. The countries have now set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.</p><p>US tariffs on goods from Vietnam among the highest on any country</p><p>Vietnam\u2019s Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said the country still hoped to reach its economic growth target of at least 8% despite the Trump administration imposing 46% tariffs on its exports.</p><p>Chinh chaired a Cabinet meeting Thursday to assess the impact of the tariffs, among the highest imposed on any country, and said that Vietnam hoped that U.S. policy would be \u201cconsistent with the good relations between the two countries.\u201d</p><p>The tariffs will deal a severe blow to Vietnam since the U.S. is its largest export market. Exports to the U.S., valued at $142 billion, in 2021 made up a third of the country\u2019s GDP.</p><p>Ukrainian minister says her country can get better tariff conditions from US</p><p>Ukraine is working to get better tariff conditions from the U.S., Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko posted on X.</p><p>Svyrydenko says Ukrainian tariffs on U.S. goods are \u201cquite low\u201d and that Ukraine imported more goods from the U.S. in 2024 than exported to the country. She said the 10% tariff Trump imposed on Ukrainian goods will mainly impact small producers.</p><p>\u201cUkraine has something to offer the United States as a reliable ally and partner,\" she wrote. \u201cBoth our countries will benefit from fair tariffs.\u201d</p><p>Japan PM and says he is ready to negotiate with Trump</p><p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said it was \u201cextremely regrettable\u201d that the U.S. slapped the 25% auto tariff on Japan despite its huge contribution to the U.S. economy.</p><p>Japanese companies have been the world\u2019s biggest investors in the U.S. since 2019, especially automakers, creating jobs for millions of Americans, Ishiba said.</p><p>Ishiba said Japan will continue to strongly request the U.S. to reconsider its tariffs measures and that he will directly negotiate with Trump, whenever it is considered appropriate.</p><p>Germany\u2019s Scholz says tariffs are an \u2018attack\u2019 on global trade</p><p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says the tariffs are an \u201cattack\u201d on a trading system that brought global prosperity and that America itself helped design.</p><p>Scholz said in Berlin that \u201cthis is an attack on a trading order that has created prosperity across the globe \u2014 a trading order that is also to a very significant extent the result of American efforts.\u201d</p><p>Fiji criticizes tariffs as 'disproportionate\u2019 and \u2018unfair\u2019</p><p>Among the small island nations of the South Pacific Ocean, a few were singled out for higher tariff rates than the 10% baseline. Fiji\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Biman Prasad on Thursday criticized as \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d the 32% tariffs announced on Fiji\u2019s exports to the U.S.</p><p>The U.S. is a major trading partner for the nation of 924,000 people, accounting for 10% of total imports and exports, Prasad said on social media. Fiji\u2019s biggest export to the U.S. is bottled water, with its most famous brand \u2014 Fiji Water \u2014 owned by a U.S. conglomerate.</p><p>The U.S. administration justified Fiji\u2019s higher tariffs with a claim that the Pacific nation imposes 63% tariffs on American goods arriving on its shores. Prasad rejected that figure, telling reporters that Fiji does not impose such tariff rates on any country.</p><p>\u2018There are no winners in trade wars,\u2019 China\u2019s Foreign Ministry says</p><p>A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson says \u201cthere are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, and protectionism is not a way out. What the U.S. should do is to correct its wrong practices and resolve trade disputes with all countries, including China, through consultations based on equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit.\u201d</p><p>Guo Jiakun added that the tariffs violate WTO rules, \u201charm the common interests of people of all countries, and do not help solve the problems of the U.S. itself.\"</p><p>\u201cIt is clear to everyone that more and more countries are opposing the U.S.\u2019s unilateral bullying actions, such as imposing tariffs,\u201d he said.</p><p>Israeli finance minister says his office is \u2018analyzing\u2019 tariff implications</p><p>Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich says his office is studying Trump\u2019s tariff order and \u201canalyzing its implications for the economy,\u201d in the country\u2019s first reaction to Trump\u2019s announcement of a 17% tariff on imports from Israel.</p><p>Spain's economy minister says negotiations with US are essential</p><p>Spain\u2019s Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said a negotiated solution with the U.S. was essential for the eurozone\u2019s fourth-largest economy but that Spain was prepared to take steps to protect its companies and industries.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot at stake. We have to protect the very important trade and economic relationship we have between the planet\u2019s two biggest partners,\u201d Cuerpo said in an interview Thursday with the RNE radio station after the U.S. announced 20% tariffs against the European Union.</p><p>German economy minister says this day will become US \u2018Inflation Day\u2019</p><p>\u201cThis day is not going to become Liberation Day for consumers in the U.S., but Inflation Day,\u201d said Germany\u2019s vice chancellor and economy minister, Robert Habeck. \u201cThe U.S. mania for tariffs could set off a spiral that could also pull countries into recession and cause massive damage worldwide.\u201d</p><p>Germany\u2019s main industry lobby group, the Federation of German Industries, said \u201cthe EU must now strengthen its alliances with other major trading partners and should coordinate its reaction with them. A coordinated reaction is also necessary to counter diversionary effects in international trade.\u201d</p><p>The group said the tariffs are \u201can unprecedented attack on the international trade system, free trade and global supply chains. The reasoning for this protectionist escalation is incomprehensible.\u201d</p><p>The U.S. was Germany\u2019s biggest single trading partner last year for the first time since 2015, displacing China.</p><p>UK's Starmer vows to act with \u2018cool and calm heads\u2019 to Trump\u2019s tariffs</p><p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the U.K. government would react with \u201ccool and calm heads\u201d to Trump\u2019s announcement of a 10% tariff on imports from Britain.</p><p>Starmer told business leaders gathered in 10 Downing St. that \u201cclearly there will be an economic impact,\u201d but that he still hoped to get tariffs lifted through a trade deal with Washington.</p><p>\u201cNegotiations on an economic prosperity deal \u2014 one that strengthens our existing trading relationship \u2014 they continue and we will fight for the best deal for Britain,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cNobody wins in a trade war. That is not in our national interest.\"</p><p>Honda CEO says company will take some time to determine how to respond to tariffs</p><p>Honda Chief Executive Toshihiro Mibe says the Japanese automaker will take some time to look at the market situation and other factors to determine the right way to respond to Trump\u2019s tariffs.</p><p>\u201cSudden changes like this are tough as it\u2019s hard to respond speedily,\u201d he told reporters Thursday.</p><p>Taiwan calls US tariffs \u2018strongly unreasonable\u2019</p><p>Taiwan responded to the imposition of a 32% tariff on its high-tech economy by calling it \u201cstrongly unreasonable and highly regrettable,\u201d adding it would \u201clodge solemn representations with the United States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe proposed tax rate does not reflect the actual economic and trade situation between Taiwan and the United States (and) is unfair to Taiwan,\u201d Cabinet spokesperson Lee Hui-chih said in an official statement.</p><p>Taiwan\u2019s exports to the U.S. and corresponding trade surplus have risen significantly in recent years, mainly reflecting the surge in demand from U.S. customers for semiconductors and related products, especially AI products, Lee said.</p><p>British officials say they will push to secure a free trade deal with US</p><p>The British government says it will push to secure a free trade deal with the U.S. rather than retaliate after Trump slapped a 10% tariff on U.K. goods.</p><p>Labelling the announcement a \u201cdisappointment,\u201d Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said, \u201cI\u2019m pleased the U.K. is in a better position than other countries, but I\u2019m not satisfied.\u201d</p><p>Reynolds told Sky News that the message he was hearing from businesses was \u201cremain at the

concern and stressed that Japan\u2019s contributions to the American economy are significant both in terms of investment and jobs.</p><p>He said he repeatedly made his case with the Trump administration not to move ahead with the tariffs.</p><p>\u201cThey will have a great impact not only on U.S.-Japanese economic relations but also on the global economy and various trade relations overall,\u201d Ishiba told reporters Thursday. \u201cWe as the government will work as one to decisively protect people\u2019s lives, jobs and industries.\"</p><p>Thailand says it is ready to

opportunity in supply chain realignments</p><p>Indian exporters and analysts say Trump\u2019s new tariffs are a mixed bag for the country.</p><p>Trump announced a reciprocal tariff of 26% for India, as compared to 34% for China, 46% for Vietnam, 37% for Bangladesh and 36% for Thailand.</p><p>Observers said Thursday the move will likely impact Indian industry and pressure jobs, but that there is room for new business to come in since India is in a lower band than its Asian peers.</p><p>\u201cThese tariffs do present challenges, but India\u2019s position remains comparatively favorable,\u201d said S.C Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Exports Organisations.</p><p>Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official and founder of the New Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative, said the protectionist tariff regime could be a catalyst for India to gain from global supply chain realignments.</p><p>South and Southeast Asia are targeted with some of the highest tariff rates</p><p>Vietnam, Sri Lanka and other countries across South and Southeast Asia are the targets of some of the highest tariff rates.</p><p>Trump imposed 46% \u201creciprocal\u201d duties on goods from Vietnam, 49% on products from Cambodia, 37% on Bangladesh and 44% on Sri Lanka.</p><p>The duties will affect domestic exporters to the U.S. but also Chinese, Japanese and South Korean

Smoke was rising from the strip of forest beside Highway 3A, east of the Taghum Bridge. As he got closer he noticed the flames were tree height. He called 911 to report a forest fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cI was getting out of my truck and the 911 lady is like, \u2018Do you want police, fire, or ambulance?\u2019 And I look down there, and I see a car, and I\u2019m like, \u2018We need them all. Send them all.\u2019\u201d The car was in flames, and so was the forest behind it. The driver\u2019s door was crushed against a tree. Weinrauch broke the back driver\u2019s side window with a rock and found an unconscious man in the driver seat, leaning against the door.</p><p>\u201cThe entire front seat and the passenger seat was fully engulfed in flames \u2026 Stuff started popping \u2013 I think the tires started popping and banging, right? I was just like, well, we got to go. It\u2019s getting hot here.</p><p>Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the back of the driver\u2019s hoodie but it tore off of his body. The only thing left to grab was his hair, which Weinrauch dragged the man out by, from the front seat through the back seat door and onto the ground beside the car.</p><p>He thought the man was dead, but then he heard him trying to breathe. At that point another passerby, John Guillemette, arrived.</p><p>\u201cMe and Colby just looked at each other,\u201d Guillemette said, \u201cand we\u2019re like, \u2018We gotta get him out of there.\u2019 And we just picked him up and we moved him six or eight feet, because me and Colby and the kid (the driver) were right beside the car. And the trees are on fire.</p><p>\u201cJust the fact that he was JOHN GUILLEMETTE breathing was amazing. But it was the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. He was not in good shape. He looked pretty well dead.\u201d</p><p>Sara Cuthbert and Hannah Corfe, passing on the highway, saw the flames and stopped.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I saw that there was a car, I was like, okay, we\u2019re going down there,\u201d Cuthbert said. \u201cWe need to help.\u201d</p><p>They helped Weinrauch and Guillemette move the driver further away from the car, onto the rail bed beside the tracks. He was unconscious and gasping for air, said Cuthbert, and it was hard to grasp him and move him because his body was so severely burned.</p><p>\u201cI know there\u2019s proper ways to lift them,\u201d Guillemette said. \u201cBut we were right beside the burning car.\u201d</p><p>Guillemette has advanced first aid training. He and the nurses got to work, holding the driver\u2019s head, supporting his neck, keeping his jaw open, checking his pulse, looking for bodily injuries.</p><p>Weinrauch estimates that the time elapsed between getting the victim out of the car and the eventual arrival of paramedics was about 15-20 minutes that included flames, panic and intense focus.</p><p>\u201cOnce we got him far enough away, we were more focused on first aid,\u201d said Cuthbert. \u201cI didn\u2019t even feel the temperature. I wasn\u2019t even thinking about the car.\u201d</p><p>Guillemette said the right people had arrived at the right time.</p><p>\u201cWe just went with what we had to work with,\u201d he said. \u201cThe timing, and everyone had a role, and it worked. The kid is alive.\u201d</p><p>The next arrival was Dr. Nicholas Sparrow of KERPA, who administered oxygen with the help of Guillemette and the nursing students. Then the Nelson Fire Department arrived, and after that an ambulance, the police, and the Beasley Fire Department. The fire was being fought while first aid was being administered. They called CPKC rail to ask them to delay any expected trains.</p><p>Guillemette said it was Weinrauch\u2019s bravery that saved the driver\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cIt takes some crazy courage just to run down that bank towards that car,\u201d he told Weinrauch as they were being interviewed by the Nelson Star. \u201cYou put your life at risk just being present at that scene \u2026 My hat is so off to you, man. That was insane. It was the bravest shit anyone could have ever done.\u201d</p><p>When they first pulled off the road to help, nursing students Cuthbert and Corfe were on their way to the first day of their third-year practicum. They got more practical experience than they had bargained for that day.</p><p>\u201cWhen I think about it,\u201d said Cuthbert, \u201cit was definitely a traumatic experience through and through. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like that in all of my nursing. We usually are in a controlled environment with lots of help, like instructors, physicians, other nurses, equipment.\u201d</p><p>But Cuthbert said she still feels thankful that she and Corfe were able to contribute.</p><p>The rescued driver is in intensive care in a Vancouver hospital being treated for burns, smoke inhalation, and a broken nose. His mother, Kathleen Elias of Nelson, says he is doing well but has a long recovery ahead.</p><p>The story of the rescue \u201cmakes me cry every time I hear it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can repay such kindness, or show my gratitude, but all I know is that I\u2019m so very, very happy that we have my son with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were right beside the burning car.</p><p>We just went with what we had to work with.</p><p>The timing, and everyone had a role, and it worked.</p><p>The kid is alive.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CASNWS-news20240912PPQA0004589420</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CASNWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CY8-XSD1-JD2C-J1N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"839\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.
