That was a question dominating my thoughts 20 years ago, during the wildfire season of 2003.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My first wife was quite sick that year. She had been diagnosed with cancer five years earlier and her health and strength had deteriorated since that time. By mid-August and into September, during the worst of the fire season in the Okanagan, she could no longer walk unassisted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I wondered how I could safely bring her down a flight of stairs and to the door if we had to leave on short notice. With a bit of time, it would have been possible, but if we had just minutes to leave the house, I would have needed assistance.</p><p>There was a real possibility of an evacuation that summer.</p><p>The 2003 wildfire season was one of the worst in British Columbia\u2019s recorded history. While the number of hectares burned was not nearly as great as in several subsequent years, fires that year burned close to populated areas, putting lives and homes at risk.</p><p>Evacuation centres were set up quickly in affected areas, but getting to the centre would have been difficult.</p><p>This was happening during a drought year. Conditions were dry and a spark, a cigarette butt or a hot vehicle exhaust pipe could ignite the tinder grasses.</p><p>On July 30, the Mc-Lure Forest Fire began, the result of a carelessly discarded cigarette butt. That fire was near Barriere, to the north of me, and while I watched the news reports, the danger close to me did not seem imminent.</p><p>Then, on Saturday, Aug. 16, everything changed when the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire started. We were out visiting relatives in Kelowna. This was the last time she was able to leave the house, and even for this trip, getting to and from the car took a lot of effort.</p><p>The fire was visible on our drive to Kelowna and the smell of smoke permeated the air. On the drive to Kelowna, I thought the fire would be contained and wildfire crews would soon have it under control. That did not happen. Despite the best efforts of wildfire crews, the blaze continued to spread and by evening, it lit up the sky across the lake from West Kelowna.</p><p>The fire reached a size of 25,600 hectares. More than 33,000 people were evacuated and 238 homes were lost or damaged as a result of the fire.</p><p>While fire crews were working to slow the spread of the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire, other smaller fires were also starting. With each new wildfire report, I continued to think about how to do an evacuation.</p><p>The fire season of 2003 was unlike anything I had experienced in the past. The extremely dry conditions that year meant a small wildfire could quickly become unmanageable.</p><p>The worst of the wildfire season had passed by the end of September, and my first wife died a couple of weeks later, in October.</p><p>Today, life is different. I would have a much easier, much more manageable time coping with an evacuation order in my household today as compared with 20 years ago.</p><p>However, others in the province are experiencing what I was dealing with two decades ago. This year, British Columbia is in its most destructive wildfire season on record. Evacuation orders and alerts have been issued for many parts of the province. There are families and couples where one or more people have limited mobility or are coping with significant health issues. People are considering their evacuation plans now, just as I was doing then.</p><p>The wildfire season of 2003 is in the past now. I am not coping with the conditions I was facing two decades ago.</p><p>As wildfires burn, especially in areas close to where I live, the memories of that terrible summer still linger.</p><p>John Arendt is the editor of the Summerland Review.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KEMREV-news20230817PQNA0003802870</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KEMREV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YP-BW81-F0HF-82RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438251</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

I'm sneezing nonstop\" said another.</p><p>Poor air quality, haze and even the smell of smoke could persist for days, Kimbell said. \"It's not going to be bad all the time; it's going to come and go, but it will probably persist until the weekend at least, because the wind direction is not forecast to change substantially.\"</p><p>That persistent smoke in the air can be harmful to health, particularly for small children, the elderly and vulnerable adults who have underlying heart and lung conditions such as high blood pressure and asthma, says Hind Al-Abadleh a chemistry professor at Wilfrid Laurier specializing in air quality.</p><p>\"Wildfire smoke is composed of harmful gases and fine particulate matter that are carcinogens and have been linked to respiratory and heart diseases,\" Al-Abadleh said.</p><p>In hot sunny weather, the chemicals in the smoke can form ground-level ozone, a major contributor to smog that can irritate eyes and lungs. \"Also, in hot weather, people tend to breathe harder and hence inhale larger amount of fine and ultrafine particles, which can penetrate deeper into the lungs,\" she added.</p><p>When air quality is poor, people can avoid driving and starting backyard or fireplace fires, Al-Abadleh said.

That was a question dominating my thoughts 20 years ago, during the wildfire season of 2003.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My first wife was quite sick that year. She had been diagnosed with cancer five years earlier and her health and strength had deteriorated since that time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By mid-August and into September, during the worst of the fire season in the Okanagan, she could no longer walk unassisted.</p><p>I wondered how I could safely bring her down a flight of stairs and to the door if we had to leave on short notice.</p><p>With a bit of time, it would have been possible, but if we had just minutes to leave the house, I would have needed assistance.</p><p>There was a real possibility of an evacuation that summer.</p><p>The 2003 wildfire season was one of the worst in British Columbia\u2019s recorded history.</p><p>While the number of hectares burned was not nearly as great as in several subsequent years, fires that year burned close to populated areas, putting lives and homes at risk.</p><p>Evacuation centres were set up quickly in affected areas, but getting to the centre would have been difficult.</p><p>This was happening during a drought year. Conditions were dry and a spark, a cigarette butt or a hot vehicle exhaust pipe could ignite the tinder grasses.</p><p>On July 30, the McLure Forest Fire began, the result of a carelessly discarded cigarette butt. That fire was near Barriere, to the north of me, and while I watched the news reports, the danger close to me did not seem imminent.</p><p>Then, on Saturday, Aug. 16, everything changed when the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire started. We were out visiting relatives in Kelowna. This was the last time she was able to leave the house, and even for this trip, getting to and from the car took a lot of effort.</p><p>The fire was visible on our drive to Kelowna and the smell of smoke permeated the air. On the drive to Kelowna, I thought the fire would be contained and wildfire crews would soon have it under control. That did not happen.</p><p>Despite the best efforts of wildfire crews, the blaze continued to spread and by evening, it lit up the sky across the lake from West Kelowna.</p><p>The fire reached a size of 25,600 hectares.</p><p>More than 33,000 people were evacuated and 238 homes were lost or damaged as a result of the fire. While fire crews were working to slow the spread of the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire, other smaller fires were also starting. With each new wildfire report, I continued to think about how to do an evacuation.</p><p>The fire season of 2003 was unlike anything I had experienced in the past. The extremely dry conditions that year meant a small wildfire could quickly become unmanageable.</p><p>The worst of the wildfire season had passed by the end of September, and my first wife died a couple of weeks later, in October.</p><p>Today, life is different. I would have a much easier, much more manageable time coping with an evacuation order in my household today as compared with 20 years ago.</p><p>However, others in the province are experiencing what I was dealing with two decades ago.</p><p>This year, British Columbia is in its most destructive wildfire season on record. Evacuation orders and alerts have been issued for many parts of the province. There are families and couples where one or more people have limited mobility or are coping with significant health issues. People are considering their evacuation plans now, just as I was doing then.</p><p>The wildfire season of 2003 is in the past now. I am not coping with the conditions I was facing two decades ago. As wildfires burn, especially in areas close to where I live, the memories of that terrible summer still linger.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECC-news20230817PQRA0003803254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECC2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YP-BW81-F0HF-82T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438265</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"594\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

The AGA\u2019s third day was cancelled out of respect for the family of Eastmain Chief Raymond Shanoush, whose mother had recently passed away. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While road closures forced by the wildfires delayed necessary audits for financial statements found in the Cree Nation Government\u2019s annual report and interrupted other community priorities, Grand Chief Mandy Gull-Masty found it advantageous to hold the AGA later in the year, following summer activities and the moose hunting season.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cWe did things a little differently this year,\u201d Gull-Masty told the Nation. \u201cWe provided our standard reporting on day one, presenting the annual report and financial statements. Instead of having presentations from the entities, we wanted to be more engaging with more caf\u00e9-style feedback from the participants, so we hosted four workshops.\u201d </p><p>Delegates were grouped with members of their community to brainstorm questions like sharing protocols for moose harvests, the unique qualities of Eeyou governance and ways of improving relations between local governments and the CNG. The latter questions were intended to guide potential revisions to the Cree constitution, which was enacted in 2017 despite concerns that it lacked sufficient consensus.   </p><p>While the Cree health and school boards had planned to deliver presentations on the AGA\u2019s third day, it was agreed to instead co-host a special assembly with these entities in the spring.  </p><p>Ahead of its own AGA on November 3-4, the Cree Trappers\u2019 Association discussed initiatives such as a community freezer project, its wildlife harvest database, changes to fur sales, a firearms course and medical bush kits.  </p><p>Asserting that the role of tallymen should be better understood and respected, it was explained that the term originated during the height of the fur trade when the number of beavers and lodges needed to be tallied. They should be consulted before hunting on their traplines because they\u2019re aware of where animals are located and potential hazards to watch out for.   </p><p>This summer's fires highlighted that a vast majority of hunters hadn\u2019t secured cabin insurance for their bush camps. One of the AGA\u2019s resolutions was to explore the feasibility of providing insurance coverage that responded to Eeyou Istchee\u2019s realities.  </p><p>\u201cI think it will be mandatory that you must have cabin insurance,\u201d said Gull-Masty. \u201cThis year was a wake-up call that we have to not only have insured belongings out on the land but also plan for fire resiliency, protecting cabins with a fire barrier, ensuring there\u2019s no growth near your cabin.\u201d </p><p>While it\u2019s still unclear how much insurance premiums will rise after this year, a wider assessment is underway alongside partners in regional government. Acknowledging that the extent of fires stretched SOPFEU far beyond their available firefighting resources, the Grand Chief maintained that the province\u2019s pre-existing priorities were very different from those of the Cree Nation. </p><p>\u201cWe felt SOPFEU didn\u2019t always realize the value that Crees were putting on their infrastructure out in the bush,\u201d said Gull-Masty. \u201cThis is something we\u2019re raising with Quebec. We\u2019ve asked each community to provide a report of their experiences. If those recommendations mean having a new regional forest fire service under the Crees, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d </p><p>Another resolution was proposed by Mistissini Chief Michael Petawabano, studying whether the economic leakage represented by office rentals, hotels and travel could instead be redirected towards expanding and financially supporting local conference infrastructure throughout Eeyou Istchee.  </p><p>While initially a question for the CNG, they asked communities and large entities to also participate in the study to better represent the greater Cree economy. Although interested in the potential of recirculating currency within Cree communities, Gull-Masty suggested there\u2019s sometimes a large gap in tourism facilities and other factors to consider.  </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also interested in the secondary reasons,\u201d Gull-Masty added. \u201cPeople going down south for meetings are also going for doctor\u2019s appointments or purchasing school supplies or doing Christmas shopping. When you\u2019re inviting people into the community, there has to be consistent food available, accommodations, access points to services like fuel.\u201d </p><p>Along similar lines, one resolution proposed studying the feasibility of developing an elite training institute for the Cree Nation Bears. Without a permanent home, athletes for the youth hockey team have to travel south for advanced programs. Not only is that far from their homes and culture but it\u2019s been challenging finding a host community with billet homes and the appropriate academic programming. </p><p>\u201cWhat can we do to ensure we\u2019re offering a high-level academic program that has sports incorporated into it?\u201d asked Gull-Masty. \u201cThat\u2019s a challenge because a lot of funding we receive for education doesn\u2019t have specificities for those program structures.\u201d </p><p>Other resolutions asked the CNG to consider providing compensation for travel and lodging during special meetings and gatherings like the AGA and to evaluate how programs and services can be delivered more equitably to all community governments.  </p><p>The AGA also hosted the second annual Acts of Service medal awards, which recognize Cree Nation members who distinguished themselves with their accomplishments and dedication. Although the forest fires prevented a public nomination process, the Grand Chief, Deputy Grand Chief and Youth Grand Chief reviewed many nominations to choose worthy recipients in three categories. </p><p>George and Mary-Louise Pachano were honoured for their leading role in the investigation of former residential schools on Fort George Island and their many years organizing the annual gathering for survivors. Gull-Masty said they have been instrumental in guiding people through the healing process and \u201ctaking on the pain that a lot of these people are going through.\u201d </p><p>Tammy Petawabano\u2019s 30 years of police service earned her one of the prestigious awards. Gull-Masty called her a role model who has broken many barriers and hoped her story will inspire more Cree to consider careers in policing.  </p><p>On the 10th anniversary of the journey of Nishiyuu, David Kawapit was honoured for leading that epic trek from Whapmagoostui to Ottawa at age 17 that began with seven walkers in the dead of winter before growing to hundreds. Seeking to inspire hope in Indigenous youth and bring attention to inequities, Kawapit said the idea came from a vision inspired by the hunger strike of Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence. </p><p>\u201cA wolf alone can be easily killed by [a bear], but with its brothers and sisters everywhere, it can call upon them and it can take down the bear with ease,\u201d explained Kawapit, with the bear symbolizing the federal government and the wolf symbolizing First Nations. \u201cWe all need to stand together.\u201d  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e923ee668e324beb9967ff619f756cfe</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69P9-T3F1-JBVR-31C8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1175\"/><timeReceived>03:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 21, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Interior will likely look very different in a year\u2019s time and beyond as life returns to the wildfire-ravaged landscape, ecologists predict. An eruption of low plants, grasses, and shrubs will turn the hills green. Birds and small mammals, as well as deer and bears, will return to feast on berries and other plant life. Carnivores including cougars could move in. </p><p>But the tall trees destroyed by the fires may never recover or return, said Robert Gray, a wildland fire ecologist. \u201cWhen you look at West Kelowna, it\u2019s really rocky, steep ground and trees aren\u2019t going to come back very well there. There is not a lot of moisture in the soil and it\u2019s only going to get drier with climate change,\u201d said Gray. \u201cA lot of that landscape may not see a lot of trees come back.\u201d Gray said that by next June, people should expect to see \u201can explosion of shrubs, grasses, and herbs\u201d sprouting from the ruined forest. \u201cWhat will happen on that landscape is you\u2019ll get a lot of shrubs. Grasses will come back and that\u2019s good for a while,\u201d said Gray. \u201cNature is amazing. It\u2019s resilience\u2026there are so many plants that are adapted to fire. They need fire on a regular basis, so they will reoccupy those areas,\u201d said Gray. For instance, shrub species in the wildfire zone already had seeds deeply buried in the soil, and were waiting for heat or fire to germinate them, Gray said. Tree recovery is a different matter. \u201cUnless you intentionally plant these areas, they\u2019re not likely to have a lot of trees in the future,\u201d said Gray.</p><p>Okanagan residents are no strangers to catastrophic wildfires. In 2003, the Okanagan Mountain Park fire forced the evacuation of thousands of people and destroyed hundreds of properties. It also transformed the landscape. Tara Bergeson, an urban forestry supervisor with the City of Kelowna, said the 2003 fire that scorched the park and the city was \u201cvery severe and has had a lasting impact on the landbase.\u201d \u201cLittle regeneration has occurred in much of the area, and we may not see trees return in a timely way or at all. Currently, much of the area remains as shrubs and grassland,\u201d Bergeson wrote in an email. Recently burned trees, weakened but clinging to life, can attract bark beetles and other insects, Gray said. \u201cThese little beetles, they\u2019ll burrow into the tree and they will lay their eggs, and when the young larvae grow they will basically kill the tree,\u201d said Gray. In about five to eight years, dead trees will start to break apart. Gray said situations like these will pose significant fire risks, especially with ongoing climate change making things drier and hotter. He said prescribed burns would be important in such areas to limit future wildfires. Ken Lertzman, professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University\u2019s School of resource and environmental management, said some small animals can thrive after fires, such as bluebirds, hawks, owls and woodpeckers. \u201cThey can really take advantage of that particular mix of resources that are available in those very young, open forests,\u201d said Lertzman. Gray agreed, saying recently burned, open forest ground with plenty of grasses and shrubs could be a food heaven for animals. \u201cNow it\u2019s open and there are grasses and herbs and shrubs and berries and nuts, there is so much to eat,\u201d said Gray. A diverse shrub community with berries would attract visitors including deer, elk and bears, and insects and birds would be drawn to flowers, added Gray. Lertzman said the length of forest regeneration depends on many factors, ranging from soil conditions to temperatures. Generally speaking, it took 40 to 60 years for young forests to get established and at least 100 years for mature forests to return, said Lertzman, adding that forests recovering from fire represented a natural cycle. \u201cIn the B.C. Interior and lots of forests around the world, the forest fire is part of the evolutionary history of the forest,\u201d said Lertzman. However, Gray said it would not necessarily be a bad thing if many trees did not come back. \u201cIf we get the similar forest back, then it will just burn again,\u201d he said. \u201cOn that landscape, you definitely want fewer trees because the more trees, you have more drought and then it weakens the trees and insects kill the trees. And then fire occurs, so we want fewer trees there,\u201d said Gray.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20230906PTEA0003850416</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6943-DF21-F0HF-800M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Thousands of people were evacuated from First Nation communities affected by northern wildfires last year.</p><p>Forest fires are driven by weather, Lizotte said. So far this season, Ontario has seen a cyclical pattern of warm weather followed by periods of significant and widespread precipitation, which has largely kept fires in check, he said.</p><p>Last year, drought conditions made the ground three or four times more receptive to lightning strikes that could spark fires; meanwhile, this year some regions had snow into May, he said. Even though the forest fire season started at the beginning of April, there were no fires recorded in the province until April 28, he added.</p><p>\"While we've had a lot of lightning hitting the ground this summer, we don't have drought conditions in the deeper soils that would promote those potential fires to emerge to the surface,\" Lizotte said.</p><p>It's not uncommon to see slower forest fire seasons occasionally, he said, noting that was also the case in 2014, 2008 and 2004. In 2014, there were 303 fires that burned 5,386 hectares of woodland in the province. In 2008, 342 fires burned 1,316 hectares, and 2004 saw 432 fires burn 1,617 hectares of land.</p><p>There have nonetheless been significant forest fires this season, including one in Timmins, Ont. that accounted for most of the province's burned woodland for this year, Lizotte said. That fire has been out since early June, he said.</p><p>The slower season has allowed Ontario's fire rangers to help out in other regions, he said.

Thousands of people were evacuated from First Nation communities affected by northern wildfires last year.<br/><br/> Forest fires are driven by weather, Lizotte said. So far this season, Ontario has seen a cyclical pattern of warm weather followed by periods of significant and widespread precipitation, which has largely kept fires in check, he said.<br/><br/> Last year, drought conditions made the ground three or four times more receptive to lightning strikes that could spark fires; meanwhile, this year some regions had snow into May, he said. Even though the forest fire season started at the beginning of April, there were no fires recorded in the province until April 28, he added.<br/><br/> \"While we've had a lot of lightning hitting the ground this summer, we don't have drought conditions in the deeper soils that would promote those potential fires to emerge to the surface,\" Lizotte said.<br/><br/> It's not uncommon to see slower forest fire seasons occasionally, he said, noting that was also the case in 2014, 2008 and 2004. In 2014, there were 303 fires that burned 5,386 hectares of woodland in the province. In 2008, 342 fires burned 1,316 hectares, and 2004 saw 432 fires burn 1,617 hectares of land.<br/><br/> There have nonetheless been significant forest fires this season, including one in Timmins, Ont. that accounted for most of the province's burned woodland for this year, Lizotte said. That fire has been out since early June, he said.<br/><br/> The slower season has allowed Ontario's fire rangers to help out in other regions, he said. Last month, 60 provincial fire rangers were sent to Manitoba to assist with fires in that province, and an additional team of 40 was sent to join them later, he said.<br/><br/> Lizotte said specialists were also sent to the Yukon and Alberta to help with large fires there. All have since returned to Ontario.<br/><br/> The Canadian Press <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2022081765288921</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:665T-5TY1-F197-54RG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Finding Joy consists of 36 acrylic paintings, bursting with colour and serenity \u2014 all being cohesive with a unified theme.</p><p>Finding Joy is about taking a closer look at local wildflowers, that can be found by roadsides or other various places, and glorifying those \"ugly, unwanted\" flowers and finding the beauty and joy in them. It is about persevering through hardship and blooming into something beautiful.</p><p>Amanda Hartman takes this theme quite literally and uses old painting palettes as canvases, turning something seen as unwanted into something to be appreciated. Most of the flowers in the pieces contain some form of symbolism all linking to the meaning of the show. Lupins mean admiration and happiness. Fireweed symbolizes rejuvenation, being the first plant to grow back after a forest fire, and many more examples as such. This show is a delicate dance between the realism of the wildflowers and the whimsy and beauty found within them.</p><p>The artist behind Finding Joy, Amanda Hartman, studied art at the Victoria College of Art and Design, Northwest Community College, Dordt College, and a variety of other courses throughout Canada.</p><p>Amanda Hartman has been painting professionally for over 20 years, starting out with watercolours, but has since moved to acrylic and mixed media in more recent years, as is shown in Finding Joy, which is blooming with bright nature-inspired acrylic paintings.</p><p>Most of Amanada Hartman's artwork is inspired by the nature of Terrace.</p><p>When not painting (or working), she can be finding inspiration for her art in her other activities; hiking, mountain biking, stand up paddleboarding, snowboarding and sailing. Hartman's life is filled with adventure and the love of the outdoors, which is a present theme in most of her work.</p><p>Finding Joy travels to the Quesnel Art Gallery in June, but it will be featured at the Terrace Art Gallery until the end of April. The Terrace Art Gallery is open from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays. It's located at 4610 Park Ave., Terrace, BC V8G 1V6.</p><p>(Thayna Healey is a 16-year-old student at Caledonia Secondary School and a long-standing member of the Terrace Art Gallery.)</p><p>Copyright 2023 Terrace Standard</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TERSTN-news20230421PTA4462236</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TERSTN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:682M-FHX1-F0HF-81BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438220</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"395\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

For this young athlete, who was born and raised in Rossland, it was exhilarating \u2013 until the unthinkable happened.</p><p>While competing in Europe, Brian suffered a serious injury. He recalls waking up in a hospital in the French Alps to learn that his femur had been seriously broken. His ski racing career was over.</p><p>Now, Fry had to carve out a new future. As a ski racer, he knew that being able to anticipate and adapt to changes in his environment are key to crossing any future finish line.</p><p>He used this skill to pivot, not only building an extraordinary career as an entrepreneur but also pioneering an inspiring path in technology innovation.</p><p>BCIT helps chart a new direction</p><p>In 1984, soon after his ski accident, Brian enrolled in BCIT's Marketing Management program.</p><p>\"I chose BCIT because I thought it would be a very quick way to download the information I needed to get on with my life,\" explained the BCIT alum. \"I thought BCIT was going to be much easier. It was quite the opposite. It was an incredibly intense experience but that work acumen and discipline that the school instilled in me have been foundational to my career to this day.\"</p><p>Fry also says that BCIT \u2013 through its curriculum, his instructors, and like-minded classmates \u2013 sparked the entrepreneur in him.</p><p>He had become very interested in new technology, and as he watched students painstakingly write papers with typewriters or pen and paper (which did not allow for deleting or cutting and pasting), he saw a future where tech could solve a problem.</p><p>A side gig sparks his technology career</p><p>\"Part of the motivation was that I needed to bring in more money because I was self-funding my education,\" said Fry. \"My program at BCIT inspired me to be entrepreneurial. I could see that students were struggling with preparing their assignments.</p><p>\"I thought, 'They really need personal computers', which were not at all common at the time. So my girlfriend (now my wife) helped me by setting up a booth at BCIT several days a week to sell computers to my fellow students.</p><p>\"We sold them as inexpensively as we could.\"</p><p>Fry put the computers together at home and, with the permission of BCIT, sold them on campus.</p><p>\"For me, that was really the beginning of becoming a tech entrepreneur,\" says Fry, who graduated in 1986.</p><p>A pioneer in the tech industry</p><p>Fry has been a technology entrepreneur and leader in B.C. for many years. After his first entrepreneurial pursuit selling computers to students at BCIT, he went on to help build many tech start-ups in Vancouver, Silicon Valley and the Kootenays.</p><p>While in Vancouver, Fry was instrumental to the city's early tech scene. He served as chair of Software BC and Information Technology Association of Canada \u2013 BC Chapter (ITAC BC).</p><p>He helped ITAC BC amalgamate with the Electronic Manufacturer's Association of British Columbia to become the British Columbia Technology Industry Association (now BC Tech Association), where he served as a founding board member. Since 1997, Brian has been based in his hometown of Rossland, where he started his next round of tech companies.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, he has been instrumental in building the largest ISP in the province in 1998.</p><p>In 1999, he co-founded IPWorld (Fiber Optic Network Company joint venture with Utilicorp) with partner Tim Dufour.</p><p>In 2001, Fry and Dufour also started RackForce, which became Canada's largest cloud provider and leading builder of advanced data centres.</p><p>In 2015, they sold RackForce for $33 million to TeraGo. In 2018, the partners co-founded PodTech Innovation Inc. with Brian Fehr to design, build, and operate advanced-edge data centres (the next phase of infrastructure for cloud computing, especially AI). They sold the company in 2020 to Iris Energy, where he is a strategic shareholder.</p><p>A future of possibilities</p><p>While Fry has long stopped selling computers from a booth at BCIT, he says he still leans on the same skills that got him started back in 1984: an entrepreneurial mindset from BCIT, competitive agility from ski racing, and an innate ability to see beyond the present and anticipate the future environment.</p><p>Once again with Dufour, his partner of many ventures, Fry recently launched a new company Great Plains Ecosystems, which he says will have a significant and positive impact on the planet by sequestering carbon from biodegradable waste and making it valuable. He is the chief marketing officer of the organization.</p><p>\"It's by far the most exciting work of my tech career,\" he said. \"For example, if our dream comes true, we'll be able to help the forest stakeholders manage forest waste to the point where we never see a major forest fire again and forests will once again be diverse and healthy.\"</p><p>Always looking ahead, Brian is energized about the future.</p><p>\"My wife, who often has to remind me to focus on the present sometimes, will agree: I live in the future all the time,\" he laughed.</p><p>BCIT will host the 18th annual Distinguished Awards at the Westin Bayshore in Vancouver on Nov. 2 to recognize a total of five recipients of the Distinguished Alumni Award and the Outstanding Student Leadership Award.</p><p>\u2013Article contributed by Emma Berg, BCIT News</p><p>Copyright 2023 Rossland News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ROSNWS-news20231024PTL4529683</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ROSNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69G6-BPD1-F0HF-80CF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438271</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

For this young athlete, who was born and raised in Rossland, it was exhilarating \u2013 until the unthinkable happened.</p><p>While competing in Europe, Brian suffered a serious injury. He recalls waking up in a hospital in the French Alps to learn that his femur had been seriously broken. His ski racing career was over.</p><p>Now, Fry had to carve out a new future. As a ski racer, he knew that being able to anticipate and adapt to changes in his environment are key to crossing any future finish line.</p><p>He used this skill to pivot, not only building an extraordinary career as an entrepreneur but also pioneering an inspiring path in technology innovation.</p><p>BCIT helps chart a new direction</p><p>In 1984, soon after his ski accident, Brian enrolled in BCIT's Marketing Management program.</p><p>\"I chose BCIT because I thought it would be a very quick way to download the information I needed to get on with my life,\" explained the BCIT alum. \"I thought BCIT was going to be much easier. It was quite the opposite. It was an incredibly intense experience but that work acumen and discipline that the school instilled in me have been foundational to my career to this day.\"</p><p>Fry also says that BCIT \u2013 through its curriculum, his instructors, and like-minded classmates \u2013 sparked the entrepreneur in him.</p><p>He had become very interested in new technology, and as he watched students painstakingly write papers with typewriters or pen and paper (which did not allow for deleting or cutting and pasting), he saw a future where tech could solve a problem.</p><p>A side gig sparks his technology career</p><p>\"Part of the motivation was that I needed to bring in more money because I was self-funding my education,\" said Fry. \"My program at BCIT inspired me to be entrepreneurial. I could see that students were struggling with preparing their assignments.</p><p>\"I thought, 'They really need personal computers', which were not at all common at the time. So my girlfriend (now my wife) helped me by setting up a booth at BCIT several days a week to sell computers to my fellow students.</p><p>\"We sold them as inexpensively as we could.\"</p><p>Fry put the computers together at home and, with the permission of BCIT, sold them on campus.</p><p>\"For me, that was really the beginning of becoming a tech entrepreneur,\" says Fry, who graduated in 1986.</p><p>A pioneer in the tech industry</p><p>Fry has been a technology entrepreneur and leader in B.C. for many years. After his first entrepreneurial pursuit selling computers to students at BCIT, he went on to help build many tech start-ups in Vancouver, Silicon Valley and the Kootenays.</p><p>While in Vancouver, Fry was instrumental to the city's early tech scene. He served as chair of Software BC and Information Technology Association of Canada \u2013 BC Chapter (ITAC BC).</p><p>He helped ITAC BC amalgamate with the Electronic Manufacturer's Association of British Columbia to become the British Columbia Technology Industry Association (now BC Tech Association), where he served as a founding board member. Since 1997, Brian has been based in his hometown of Rossland, where he started his next round of tech companies.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, he has been instrumental in building the largest ISP in the province in 1998.</p><p>In 1999, he co-founded IPWorld (Fiber Optic Network Company joint venture with Utilicorp) with partner Tim Dufour.</p><p>In 2001, Fry and Dufour also started RackForce, which became Canada's largest cloud provider and leading builder of advanced data centres.</p><p>In 2015, they sold RackForce for $33 million to TeraGo. In 2018, the partners co-founded PodTech Innovation Inc. with Brian Fehr to design, build, and operate advanced-edge data centres (the next phase of infrastructure for cloud computing, especially AI). They sold the company in 2020 to Iris Energy, where he is a strategic shareholder.</p><p>A future of possibilities</p><p>While Fry has long stopped selling computers from a booth at BCIT, he says he still leans on the same skills that got him started back in 1984: an entrepreneurial mindset from BCIT, competitive agility from ski racing, and an innate ability to see beyond the present and anticipate the future environment.</p><p>Once again with Dufour, his partner of many ventures, Fry recently launched a new company Great Plains Ecosystems, which he says will have a significant and positive impact on the planet by sequestering carbon from biodegradable waste and making it valuable. He is the chief marketing officer of the organization.</p><p>\"It's by far the most exciting work of my tech career,\" he said. \"For example, if our dream comes true, we'll be able to help the forest stakeholders manage forest waste to the point where we never see a major forest fire again and forests will once again be diverse and healthy.\"</p><p>Always looking ahead, Brian is energized about the future.</p><p>\"My wife, who often has to remind me to focus on the present sometimes, will agree: I live in the future all the time,\" he laughed.</p><p>BCIT will host the 18th annual Distinguished Awards at the Westin Bayshore in Vancouver on Nov. 2 to recognize a total of five recipients of the Distinguished Alumni Award and the Outstanding Student Leadership Award.</p><p>\u2013Article contributed by Emma Berg, BCIT News</p><p>Copyright 2023 Trail Daily Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRAILD-news20231024PTR4530908</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRAILD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69GM-B3Y1-JD2C-J2HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Toronto is very good at stopping things it doesn't want. Curbside cafes, home renovations, fun. It's a well-honed skill. The city must decide it wants to stop the spa plan, then pull out all of its legislative stops. They can make it harder for the province.<br/><br/> Overall, Mayor Chow is correct in saying there's not much the city can do, because, as we saw with the cut to city council during the 2018 election, the province has an incredible amount of power over city affairs. If it wanted to, it could abolish the City of Toronto as a political entity entirely. (Sorry for floating this idea, but it's been a nice run since 1834.)<br/><br/> What Mayor Chow in particular has the power to do is lead a hearts-and-minds campaign to save Ontario Place at a time when Ontario Premier Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative government is on the ropes, pummeled by multiple scandals and low in the polls. The province may have incredible power over the city, but Ford is weak and Chow, fresh off a decisive mayoral win just months ago, is strong and has ample political capital. It's time to fight.<br/><br/> Not long after her lacklustre radio comments, Chow tweeted out a much more unequivocal statement. \"Ontario Place and our waterfront are precious and should be kept public,\" read her tweet. \"I'm against the plan to build a private luxury spa for the wealthy. We'll continue to push them to make this right. I love Ontario Place and I'll work to protect it.\"<br/><br/> This was accompanied by a rather beautiful night photo of Ontario Place and its trees. Chow's love for this city is apparent, as is the fact she truly lives and breathes Toronto. Her comments were an echo of a campaign promise made just days before the June election, when her team released a video of her paddle boarding at Ontario Place with the caption: \"I've been paddling since I was 16, I love getting out on the water. I can't imagine the city without public access to the lake, and I won't accept a future without it. As your mayor, I'll stand up for Ontario Place.\"<br/><br/> That, too, was definitive. A promise to fight. A promise to keep.<br/><br/> Tree hugging is apropos right now, because on Sept. 28 a request for proposals (RFP) was issued for bids on removing upward of 800 Ontario Place trees, many mature and part of the original landscape design. <br/><br/> The provincial government is cagey on timelines, but bids were due on Friday, so their removal could be imminent. <br/><br/> Removing a dense cluster of trees in a city for a dubious project is absurd and egregious considering just a few months ago Ontario and other parts of Canada burned and forest fire smoke choked cities here and in the U.S.<br/><br/> An Ontario Place denuded of trees will also be ugly, making it easier to push through a project to \"fix\" it. However, one of the biggest tree care companies in North America, Davey Tree, issued a statement on Wednesday saying that while it appeared on a public list of companies who registered to receive the RFP, it would not be bidding. It's a lucrative contract, lots of money to be made, so this is a sign of just how toxic the spa project has become. <br/><br/> Some observers have feared Ontario Place might be used as a trade-off for an ever elusive \"new deal\" with the province sought by Chow, like mayors before her. That Ford is weak and battered, that the project is politically and publicly toxic, and that Chow made an election promise to fight, Ontario Place shouldn't be used as a bargaining chip.<br/><br/> Many are likely feeling Ontario Place fatigue, as I am, but the fight is now, and fatigue, like denuding the site of trees, plays into the hands of people who want to privatize what is now a unique public space. Yes, it needs a bit more love, a bit more purpose, but not a bulldozing, a clear-cutting or a giant spa.<br/><br/> The spa lease for Ontario Place will be 95 years, longer than most people breathing today will be alive. Relative to that, this will be a short fight. Remember how unloved other long-term leases of public goods are, like the 99-year Hwy. 407 debacle. <br/><br/> It's important Toronto fights now. With every possible legislative, planning and legal tool. With every kind of protest that gets more people tuned in. With every kind of appeal to hearts and minds, be it financial or philosophical.<br/><br/> Maybe even a good tree hugging.<br/><br/> Twitter: @shawnmicallef <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023100869345538</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69BR-1CC1-JDV5-F090-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

The organization will train 25 instructors in Kamloops, B.C. , on teaching urban firefighters how to deal with wildfires that encroach on communities.</p><p>The program will also see the association deliver 15 courses at five locations across Western Canada to train up to 325 structural firefighters on similar \u201curban interface wildfire training.\u201d</p><p>Wilkinson said the training program was an example of the federal government learning from the wildfire season, which saw major blazes this year force evacuations in the suburbs of Halifax, as well as in towns such as Lebel-sur-Quevillon in Quebec and Fort St. John and Osoyoos in British Columbia.</p><p>\u201cThe intent of the training is to enable firefighters within communities to be more effective,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also to make it safe, to ensure that they understand very clearly the risks associated with the wildland fires coming into that interface zone.\u201d</p><p>A private wildland firefighting firm had said before Wilkinson\u2019s remarks that Canada needed to create a national training standard for firefighters, rather than each province and territory having its own curriculum.</p><p>Arctic Fire Safety Services president Kris Liivam said in an interview that the U.S.had already implemented a countrywide training standard, and a similar system should be introduced for public and private firefighters in Canada.</p><p>\u201cWe recognize it\u2019s a dangerous job \u2026 that\u2019s why we need to make sure we have training and the equipment to make sure we do the job safely,\u201d Liivam said.</p><p>\u201cI think we should have one standard across Canada and we should train all the contractors to it.\u201d</p><p>Canada has already deployed 5,821 domestic firefighters and 4,990 international firefighters from 12 countries to battle wildfires across the country, said Norton.</p><p>It has been a deadly battle. Four firefighters having died this summer battling blazes in B.C. , Alberta, and the Northwest Territories.</p><p>BC Wildfire Service said they have around 4,000 personnel battling blazes across the province, including contract crews, out-of-province staff and the Canadian Armed Forces. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre said they have mobilized 703 overseas personnel in B.C. while also sending 740 Canadian firefighters to the province from other parts of the country.</p><p>About 400 of the 700 or so fires currently burning in Canada are in B.C. , where 185 fires are out of control.

It was good not to have it burned.\u201d</p><p>In all, 8,000 cubic metres of chips were generated, enough to fill approximately 200 trucks.</p><p>The Babine Lake Community Forest was able to earn money by selling sawlogs, 36,500 cubic metres worth or enough for 665 trucks to Hampton Forest Products in Burns Lake.</p><p>Tweedie said village meetings were also held to keep residents up to date on the work involved. Residents also had, and continue to have, access to firewood from logs decked at a central location.</p><p>Crews did have to burn a certain amount of waste and that created smoke, something that Tweedie said was inevitable and relayed at community meetings. He said there were three complaints made on days when burning did take place.</p><p>Plans to burn in 2020 produced mixed results that year because of high rainfall with burning then shifted to 2021.</p><p>Tweedie said the community forest worked closely with BC Wildfire Service in designing the buffer zone and overall emphasis on reducing fire risk.</p><p>Planning accelerated about five years ago when the Granisle council, realizing it didn\u2019t have the capacity to undertake a project like this all by itself, engaged the community forest. It owns half of the community forest and the other half is owned by the Lake Babine Nation.</p><p>An application was then made to the provincial government\u2019s Forest Enhancement Society of B.C. and it provided a $401,450 grant, a sum Tweedie said was crucial.</p><p>\u201cThere were a lot of aspects to this project that were unique, not typical forestry work,\u201d he added.</p><p>Granisle mayor Linda Mc-Guire also touched on the enhancement society grant, saying it would have been extremely challenging for the village to do the work otherwise.</p><p>There\u2019s even been an effect on the community forest itself because the buffer zone is within its harvest area.</p><p>\u201cSo what we effectively did was was to reduce our size,\u201d Tweedie said.</p><p>There will be a benefit, however, in the future as the community forest will be able to harvest the birch it has planted and increase the variety of species it has to sell.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMTINW-news20230622PQLA0003674037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMTINW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68HS-0M71-JD2C-J47Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438222</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"552\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Toronto is very good at stopping things it doesn't want. Curbside cafes, home renovations, fun. It's a well-honed skill. The city must decide it wants to stop the spa plan, then pull out all of its legislative stops. They can make it harder for the province.<br/><br/> Overall, Mayor Chow is correct in saying there's not much the city can do because, as we saw with the cut to city council during the 2018 election, the province has an incredible amount of power over city affairs. If they wanted to, it could abolish the City of Toronto as a political entity entirely. (Sorry for floating this idea, but it's been a nice run since 1834.)<br/><br/> What Mayor Chow in particular has the power to do is lead a hearts-and-minds campaign to save Ontario Place at a time when Ontario Premier Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative government is on the ropes, pummeled by multiple scandals and low in the polls. The province may have incredible power over the city, but Ford is weak and Chow, fresh off a decisive mayoral win just months ago, is strong and has ample political capital. It's time to fight.<br/><br/> Not long after her lacklustre radio comments, Chow tweeted out a much more unequivocal statement. \"Ontario Place and our waterfront are precious and should be kept public,\" read her tweet. \"I'm against the plan to build a private luxury spa for the wealthy. We'll continue to push them to make this right. I love Ontario Place and I'll work to protect it.\"<br/><br/> This was accompanied by a rather beautiful night photo of Ontario Place and its trees. Chow's love for this city is apparent, as is the fact she truly lives and breathes Toronto. Her comments were an echo of a campaign promise made just days before the June election, when her team released a video of her paddle boarding at Ontario Place with the caption: \"I've been paddling since I was 16, I love getting out on the water. I can't imagine the city without public access to the lake, and I won't accept a future without it. As your mayor, I'll stand up for Ontario Place.\"<br/><br/> That, too, was definitive. A promise to fight. A promise to keep.<br/><br/> Tree hugging is apropos right now because on Sept. 28 a request for proposals (RFP) was issued for bids on removing upward of 800 Ontario Place trees, many mature and part of the original landscape design. The provincial government is cagey on timelines, but bids were due on Oct. 6, so their removal could be imminent.<br/><br/> Removing a dense cluster of trees in a city for a dubious project is absurd and egregious considering just a few months ago Ontario and other parts of Canada burned and forest fire smoke choked cities here and in the U.S.<br/><br/> An Ontario Place denuded of trees will also be ugly, making it easier to push through a project to \"fix\" it. However, one of the biggest tree care companies in North America, Davey Tree, issued a statement on Wednesday saying that while they appeared on a public list of companies who registered to receive the RFP, they would not be bidding. It's a lucrative contract, lots of money to be made, so this is a sign of just how toxic the spa project has become.<br/><br/> Some observers have feared Ontario Place might be used as a trade-off for an ever elusive \"new deal\" with the province sought by Chow, like mayors before her. That Ford is weak and battered, that the project is politically and publicly toxic, and that Chow made an election promise to fight, Ontario Place shouldn't be used as a bargaining chip.<br/><br/> Many are likely feeling Ontario Place fatigue, as I am, but the fight is now, and fatigue, like denuding the site of trees, plays into the hands of people who want to privatize what is now a unique public space. Yes, it needs a bit more love, a bit more purpose, but not a bulldozing, a clearcutting or a giant spa.<br/><br/> The spa lease for Ontario Place will be 95 years, longer than most people breathing today will be alive. Relative to that, this will be a short fight. Remember how unloved other long-term leases of public goods are, like the 99-year Highway 407 debacle.<br/><br/> It's important Toronto fights now. With every possible legislative, planning and legal tool. With every kind of protest that gets more people tuned in. With every kind of appeal to hearts and minds, be it financial or philosophical.<br/><br/> Maybe even a good tree hugging.<br/><br/> Shawn Micallef is a Toronto-based writer and a freelance contributing columnist for the Star.

Toronto is very good at stopping things it doesn't want. Curbside cafes, home renovations, fun. It's a well-honed skill. The city must decide it wants to stop the spa plan, then pull out all of its legislative stops. They can make it harder for the province.<br/><br/> Overall, Mayor Chow is correct in saying there's not much the city can do because, as we saw with the cut to city council during the 2018 election, the province has an incredible amount of power over city affairs. If they wanted to, it could abolish the City of Toronto as a political entity entirely. (Sorry for floating this idea, but it's been a nice run since 1834.)<br/><br/> What Mayor Chow in particular has the power to do is lead a hearts-and-minds campaign to save Ontario Place at a time when Ontario Premier Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative government is on the ropes, pummeled by multiple scandals and low in the polls. The province may have incredible power over the city, but Ford is weak and Chow, fresh off a decisive mayoral win just months ago, is strong and has ample political capital. It's time to fight.<br/><br/> Not long after her lacklustre radio comments, Chow tweeted out a much more unequivocal statement. \"Ontario Place and our waterfront are precious and should be kept public,\" read her tweet. \"I'm against the plan to build a private luxury spa for the wealthy. We'll continue to push them to make this right. I love Ontario Place and I'll work to protect it.\"<br/><br/> This was accompanied by a rather beautiful night photo of Ontario Place and its trees. Chow's love for this city is apparent, as is the fact she truly lives and breathes Toronto. Her comments were an echo of a campaign promise made just days before the June election, when her team released a video of her paddle boarding at Ontario Place with the caption: \"I've been paddling since I was 16, I love getting out on the water. I can't imagine the city without public access to the lake, and I won't accept a future without it. As your mayor, I'll stand up for Ontario Place.\"<br/><br/> That, too, was definitive. A promise to fight. A promise to keep.<br/><br/> Tree hugging is apropos right now because on Sept. 28 a request for proposals (RFP) was issued for bids on removing upward of 800 Ontario Place trees, many mature and part of the original landscape design. The provincial government is cagey on timelines, but bids were due on Oct. 6, so their removal could be imminent.<br/><br/> Removing a dense cluster of trees in a city for a dubious project is absurd and egregious considering just a few months ago Ontario and other parts of Canada burned and forest fire smoke choked cities here and in the U.S.<br/><br/> An Ontario Place denuded of trees will also be ugly, making it easier to push through a project to \"fix\" it. However, one of the biggest tree care companies in North America, Davey Tree, issued a statement on Wednesday saying that while they appeared on a public list of companies who registered to receive the RFP, they would not be bidding. It's a lucrative contract, lots of money to be made, so this is a sign of just how toxic the spa project has become.<br/><br/> Some observers have feared Ontario Place might be used as a trade-off for an ever elusive \"new deal\" with the province sought by Chow, like mayors before her. That Ford is weak and battered, that the project is politically and publicly toxic, and that Chow made an election promise to fight, Ontario Place shouldn't be used as a bargaining chip.<br/><br/> Many are likely feeling Ontario Place fatigue, as I am, but the fight is now, and fatigue, like denuding the site of trees, plays into the hands of people who want to privatize what is now a unique public space. Yes, it needs a bit more love, a bit more purpose, but not a bulldozing, a clearcutting or a giant spa.<br/><br/> The spa lease for Ontario Place will be 95 years, longer than most people breathing today will be alive. Relative to that, this will be a short fight. Remember how unloved other long-term leases of public goods are, like the 99-year Highway 407 debacle.<br/><br/> It's important Toronto fights now. With every possible legislative, planning and legal tool. With every kind of protest that gets more people tuned in. With every kind of appeal to hearts and minds, be it financial or philosophical.<br/><br/> Maybe even a good tree hugging.<br/><br/> Shawn Micallef is a Toronto-based writer and a freelance contributing columnist for the Star.

That was a question dominating my thoughts 20 years ago, during the wildfire season of 2003.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My first wife was quite sick that year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She had been diagnosed with cancer five years earlier and her health and strength had deteriorated since that time. By mid-August and into September, during the worst of the fire season in the Okanagan, she could no longer walk unassisted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I wondered how I could safely bring her down a flight of stairs and to the door if we had to leave on short notice. With a bit of time, it would have been possible, but if we had just minutes to leave the house, I would have needed assistance.</p><p>There was a real possibility of an evacuation that summer.</p><p>The 2003 wildfire season was one of the worst in British Columbia\u2019s recorded history. While the number of hectares burned was not nearly as great as in several subsequent years, fires that year burned close to populated areas, putting lives and homes at risk.</p><p>Evacuation centres were set up quickly in affected areas, but getting to the centre would have been difficult.</p><p>This was happening during a drought year.</p><p>Conditions were dry and a spark, a cigarette butt or a hot vehicle exhaust pipe could ignite the tinder grasses.</p><p>On July 30, the McLure Forest Fire began, the result of a carelessly discarded cigarette butt. That fire was near Barriere, to the north of me, and while I watched the news reports, the danger close to me did not seem imminent.</p><p>Then, on Saturday, Aug. 16, everything changed when the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire started. We were out visiting relatives in Kelowna. This was the last time she was able to leave the house, and even for this trip, getting to and from the car took a lot of effort.</p><p>The fire was visible on our drive to Kelowna and the smell of smoke permeated the air. On the drive to Kelowna, I thought the fire would be contained and wildfire crews would soon have it under control. That did not happen. Despite the best efforts of wildfire crews, the blaze continued to spread and by evening, it lit up the sky across the lake from West Kelowna.</p><p>The fire reached a size of 25,600 hectares. More than 33,000 people were evacuated and 238 homes were lost or damaged as a result of the fire.</p><p>While fire crews were working to slow the spread of the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire, other smaller fires were also starting. With each new wildfire report, I continued to think about how to do an evacuation.</p><p>The fire season of 2003 was unlike anything I had experienced in the past.</p><p>The extremely dry conditions that year meant a small wildfire could quickly become unmanageable.</p><p>The worst of the wildfire season had passed by the end of September, and my first wife died a couple of weeks later, in October.</p><p>Today, life is different. I would have a much easier, much more manageable time coping with an evacuation order in my household today as compared with 20 years ago.</p><p>However, others in the province are experiencing what I was dealing with two decades ago. This year, British Columbia is in its most destructive wildfire season on record. Evacuation orders and alerts have been issued for many parts of the province.</p><p>There are families and couples where one or more people have limited mobility or are coping with significant health issues.</p><p>People are considering their evacuation plans now, just as I was doing then.</p><p>The wildfire season of 2003 is in the past now. I am not coping with the conditions I was facing two decades ago.</p><p>As wildfires burn, especially in areas close to where I live, the memories of that terrible summer still linger.</p><p>John Arendt is the editor of the Summerland Review.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">REVTME-news20230810PSDA0003787393</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">REVTME2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68X6-JMV1-F0HF-82TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438270</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"602\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

My meetings with him were usually held outdoors in the rear of the newspaper office so he could smoke as we chatted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was hard on him to no longer be allowed to smoke in his office, as he had for most of his career up to that point, because the new and harsh smoking regulations began taking effect in the early 2000s that prevented people from smoking in most public spaces.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But he knew he must follow the rules and be a leader in the office, so he suffered through the new workplace reality and put up with getting rained and snowed on regularly in the backyard as he tried to continue to enjoy his ongoing bad habit.</p><p>My editor recognized that he and other smokers were being villainized by society as the full impacts of the health consequences of smoking were becoming more well known, particularly to nonsmokers, and it bothered him that something he had enjoyed with few problems since was a kid was now a major issue, with many people looking down their noses at him for it.</p><p>That\u2019s why he was militant against smokers who toss cigarette butts out their car windows, especially during dry periods like we are currently experiencing on Vancouver Island.</p><p>I remember he would rant and rave every time reports came in of fires started in the dry grass and/or bushes at the side of roads that were started by careless smokers throwing still-lit cigarettes from their cars.</p><p>A video from a security camera of two men working in a backyard that I watched recently clearly illustrates the dangers of cigarettes around dry kindling.</p><p>One of the workers was smoking and when he reached the butt, he took some time rubbing it into the dirt and other materials at the base of a large hedge to make sure it was fully extinguished before leaving it.</p><p>It should be said that the smoker was trying to responsible by ensuring his cigarette was out, but a whole six hours later, the video shows a tiny flame poke up through the dirt and debris where the cigarette butt was supposedly put out in the now empty backyard, which quickly leapt up into the hedge and, within mere seconds, the whole hedge was on fire.</p><p>Luckily, the homeowner was nearby and called 911 before trying to tackle the fire with his garden hose.</p><p>The fire was eventually doused with no damage to the home, but it could have been a lot worse if the homeowner hadn\u2019t intervened.</p><p>My editor, a life-long smoker with no intention of ever quitting, took offence to these types of cigarette-caused fires and would write columns in the newspaper about the issue and condemn and mock his fellow smokers for being so stupid as to throw butts out their windows, and stating they should be issued steep fines for their carelessness.</p><p>He would even have me take pictures of his hand holding a lit cigarette out his car window to show smokers what not to do to get his point across.</p><p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m sure my editor, who died in 2005 from cancer, would have fully agreed with the decision of the Saanich police depart-ment to ticket a driver who threw a cigarette butt out his car window $575 last week to serve as a reminder of the dangers attached to improper cigarette disposal amid dry conditions and extreme provincial forest fire ratings.</p><p>My editor may have been a life-long chain smoker, starting back in a time when commercials would be on the air stating that three out of four doctors smoke Camel cigarettes, but he was also a conscientious member of the community who would not purposely harm anyone.</p><p>He stood outside in the elements to smoke his cigarettes in the back of the newspaper office not only because he had to if he wanted to smoke, but also because he didn\u2019t want to cause any adverse health and other impacts to his employees or anyone else.</p><p>He would have given a medal to the police officer who issued the $575 ticket.</p><p>Robert Barron is a reporter for the Cowichan Valley Citizen.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRAILD-news20230829PSXA0003827364</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRAILD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6928-04V1-F0HF-809N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

The continent suffered blistering heatwaves and the worst drought in centuries, as climate change drives ever longer and stronger hot spells. <br/>That created tinderbox forests, increasing the risk of devastating and sometimes deadly wildfires. <br/>'The length and intensity of the heatwaves to hit Europe during the summer, combined with the general dry conditions on the continent during 2022, contributed to record-breaking wildfire activity,' the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) said. <br/>It said the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) put the total cumulative burnt area in the 27-nation European Union from the start of the year to mid-November at over 785,000 hectares (1.9 million acres). <br/>That is more than double the average of just over 317,000 hectares in the 2006-2021period. <br/>CAMS said that result aligns with its data, estimating total wildfire emissions from the EU plus the United Kingdom from June 1 to August 31 at 6.4 megatonnes of carbon, the highest level for these months since the summer of 2007. <br/>While the global trend is a decline in emissions from wildfires because of a reduction in savanna fires in tropical regions, some parts of the world are seeing emissions rise, CAMS said. <br/>'We also continue to identify and monitor significantly increased fire emissions in different parts of the world, where hotter and drier conditions are leading to increased flammability of the vegetation,' said CAMS Senior Scientist Mark Parrington. <br/>Huge fires that raged across Spain and France meant that the countries saw the highest carbon emissions from June to August since the satellite monitor's records began in 2003. <br/>'This had a major impact on air quality in the region,' CAMS said. <br/>EFFIShas said that 2022 is likely to have seen the highest number of fires recorded in Europe since 2006. <br/>'Wildfires raging from west to east and across northern, central and southern European countries offer clear evidence of the effects of climate change,' it said in its report on 2021 wildfires, which was published in November and included details of the 2022 burned area. <br/>EFFIS said it would be necessary to prepare populations to 'live with wildfires, as they become more frequent and intense because of climate change'. <br/>In September, the United Nations' World Meteorological Organization said the interaction between pollution and climate change would impact hundreds of millions of people over the coming century, and urged action to rein in the harm. <br/><url

During three winter seasons, the cameras took 40,000 individual photos and documented 130 events considered to be avalanches. </p><p>A camera pointed at a hillside is prepared to capture images of avalanches. (Photo courtesy of Armelle Decaulne) </p><p>\u201cWhat we were doing is trying to identify weather conditions that were favourable for avalanches to happen,\u201d he said in a video call interview. \u201cI looked at the photos one by one and was able to build a database out of them.\u201d </p><p>Grenier was helped by Laval University\u2019s northern research branch, Centre d\u2019\u00c9tudes Nordiques. There, he gathered detailed weather information for Umiujaq. </p><p>What Grenier\u2019s study demonstrated was that avalanches were most likely to happen in winter after a snowfall that lasts more than three days, with more than 10 centimetres of snowfall in total. </p><p>In spring, avalanches are caused by warming weather. But as soon as the temperature climbs above 0 C, the risk starts to diminish. </p><p>To Grenier, the study of avalanches, especially in the Tasiapik Valley, could save lives. He pointed to one road near a slope as an example: he said his cameras caught footage of avalanches that were able to reach this particular road. </p><p>\u201cIt could hit someone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe probabilities exist.\u201d </p><p>Climate change is also a variable and might influence the frequency and intensity of avalanches in the future. More thawing and milder weather has an impact on the density of snowpack, and can create weaker layers that can break away and cause avalanches. </p><p>\u201cThis is where research becomes important, we are right in it,\u201d Grenier said. \u201cWe are right in the midst of climate change, and it is important to understand what might happen to avoid tragedies.\u201d </p><p>The team behind this project intends to extend its research across Nunavik. The communities researchers believe are most vulnerable to avalanches are Inukjuak, Kangirsuk, Kangiqsujuaq, Quaqtaq and Salluit. </p><p>Grenier said his team\u2019s research may lead to a prevention system similar to forest fire prevention systems that are in place now. </p><p>For instance, a sign at the entrance of a valley with an easy-to-read risk meter with options like \u201cno threat\u201d to \u201chighest chance of avalanche\u201d could help, he said. </p><p>A photo of an avalanche on one of Tasiapik Valley\u2019s slopes. (Photo courtesy of J\u00e9r\u00e9my Grenier) </p><p>The team is also looking to implement community involvement into its research. There could potentially be a platform where communities can share avalanche occurrences with a photo to add to the overall database. </p><p>\u201cI loved the collaboration we had with the people,\u201d Grenier said. </p><p>\u201cThey are always there to wave at us and encourage us in our projects. We don\u2019t come pretending to know everything, we want to speak with locals, we want to know what they know.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-b143ff3e8e884136be9043c698aa5f92</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68GV-7DG1-DY9S-T2YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><timeReceived>10:22 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 17, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001385</classCode><className>AVALANCHES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A7YO</classCode><className>GEOGRAPHY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000CET9</classCode><className>MOTION DETECTORS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

So a study that was done in 1999, may need to be re-evaluated based on what the ground looks like today,\u201d she continued. </p><p>After a landslide in Valemount in 2021 nearly cut off access to the village\u2019s only source of drinking water and a mudslide in McBride about a year earlier resulted in at least five families needing to evacuate their homes and over 30 residents being trapped on the other side of the slide having to shelter in place, Jonkman said natural disaster mitigation is a high priority for local government officials. </p><p>\u201cI think it's top of mind for all local governments right now is identifying risks, knowing what they are, and then working through that piece around mitigation and preparedness,\u201d she told Rocky Mountain Goat News. </p><p>Local real estate agent Shelly Battensby said the previous geohazard studies were also precipitated by environmental events, leading to an overarching study known as the Robson Valley Land Hazard Study. </p><p>Battensby said some landowners who\u2019ve had to rely on that old data have bought property only to find they couldn\u2019t build on it. </p><p>\u201cWhat we've seen in real estate when someone purchases a property, they're now kind of in a catchment of whatever category of hazards there are, for various reasons,\u201d Battensby said. </p><p>She explained if a buyer wants to develop their land but finds their new property is in a medium to high hazard area, they need to conduct their own individual geotechnical assessment, which she said puts a lot of onus on the landowner. </p><p>Battensby said she\u2019d like the new study to be more specific and have a narrower focus, which she believes would take some of the burden off landowners. </p><p>\u201cI would love to see more specifics within the study, but I also recognize that that's not necessarily logistical,\u201d she said. </p><p>Much like our climate, Battensby said real estate is ever-evolving.

Your efforts will never be forgotten by a grateful nation as you struggle to save lives, property and, above all else, hope for those impacted by these unprecedented wildfires. </p><p><br/><br/> Mike LoSchiavo, Stoney Creek <br/><br/> Hamilton's heartbeat<br/><br/> The hard-working city workers deserve everything they get. They are the heartbeat of this great city.<br/><br/> Michael Harrison, Hamilton<br/><br/> Column was biased<br/><br/> If omissions are as concerning as errors in journalism, the opinion piece \"Conciliatory tones a sign of the times\" needs correction. The writer states that Trudeau's \"sunny ways were disrupted by Trump, a global pandemic and a succession of Conservative leaders piling on with ever-increasing invective.\"<br/><br/> I think it's obvious that a few other clouds may have been omitted. For example, Trudeau's endless scandals; his out of control spending contributing to record inflation; his mandating of his own pet ideologies complete with lots of virtue-signalling; his name-calling and deriding Canadian citizens when they disagree with him; and discrediting his own nation as genocidal and racist, to name a few.<br/><br/> The writer goes on to join a myriad of other journalists in decrying Pierre Poilievre's criticisms of Trudeau, even though that is precisely his job as Opposition leader. All this says more about the writer's bias than anything else.<br/><br/> Steve Thorkildsen, Hamilton<br/><br/> Dieppe coverage fail<br/><br/> I am very disappointed the Spectator did not cover nor highlight this very important local recognition ceremony this year. The RHLI and its participation in the Dieppe raid are important parts of local history and to not even mention the annual event is unacceptable. It is insulting to the families and friends of those who perished and those who survived but endured horrific hardship as prisoners of war following the raid. Some family members came from Victoria, B.C., for this commemorative event! <br/><br/> My disappointment doesn't end there, however. Local federal and provincial government representatives were present, but our new mayor and Ward 5 councillor were not. Kudos to CHCH for covering the event by sending a videographer. The city and the Spectator need to do better. <br/><br/> Trish Adam, Hamilton <br/><br/> Accelerate a just transition<br/><br/> I am scared. Scared that next year's forest fire season will be worse than this year's unprecedented one, that the summers will keep getting hotter and more deadly, that floods and hurricanes will wreak more and more havoc on our communities. I am scared about the planet we are leaving behind for our children and grandchildren.<br/><br/> For decades, the fossil fuel sector has been knowingly risking our futures in exchange for obscene profits, raking in billions while communities suffer. And the government isn't doing anything to stop them. Even now, when the impacts of climate change are so evident, the feds continue to subsidize companies responsible for this crisis.<br/><br/> We have a narrow window of opportunity to turn things around. So I am calling on our government to make polluters pay and accelerate a \"just transition.\" Now, before it's too late.<br/><br/> Delia Calis, Hamilton<br/><br/> Follow the Greenbelt money<br/><br/> Carl Bernstein said follow the money and there appears to be little doubt the Ford government abdicated its fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers of Ontario and is guilty of insider trading in Greenbelt land. However, chicanery of this magnitude for campaign donations seems utterly incredulous. This level of duplicity requires a bank account in the Caymans. <br/><br/> Phil Beard, Dundas<br/><br/>Dear PC caucus members:<br/><br/> Quoted from the Ontario Progressive Conservative Constitution:<br/><br/> \"Section 2.1 The following are the aims and principles of the party:<br/><br/> \"We believe in ... the rule of law<br/><br/> \"We believe that government should serve the people ...<br/><br/> \"We believe in the ethical and accountable execution of the business of government. ... We believe in and accept our responsibilities for the preservation of ... and the conservation and renewal of our environment for present and future generations.\"<br/><br/> I ask that every Conservative caucus member uphold the aims and principles that you tell the electorate you believe in and cherish. The principles mentioned in the PC Constitution are at the heart of your party's reason d'etre.<br/><br/> It is time to advise your premier that if he does not immediately rescind his Greenbelt fiasco at no expense to the Ontario taxpayer, that as a caucus you will resign to protect the integrity of the Ontario Conservative Party.<br/><br/> Kurt Arndt, Hamilton <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2023082668860346</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691J-8MY1-JDV5-F47H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Forest fires. Decaying infrastructure. Maybe Canada has better things to spend money on than G7 and NATO</url>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aug. 1</emphasis><br/><br/> A very challenging column from David Olive. Given the latest fiasco about Chinese interference, the recent cyber attacks, and the raging forest fires across the country, it is probably time for a rethink of our defence strategy.<br/><br/> Our northern border continues to be at threat from Russia and we need to maintain Norad as our principal warning system.</p><p><br/><br/> We must develop and equip a major forest fire fighting force and the resources necessary to combat increased flooding and repair infrastructure.<br/><br/> I have no idea how the military budget is spent but my perception is that we have a small armed force who are well trained but not adequately equipped for modern warfare.<br/><br/> If this is the case and if funds are limited, it may make sense to admit we can't meet the NATO target and put the funds to better use serving our needs.<br/><br/> Different times call for different solutions.<br/><br/> Peter Bradley, Mississauga<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Global warming and cyberspace attacks are real</emphasis><br/><br/> I totally agree with David Olive's reassessment of our defence spending, and the need to focus on what truly threatens us. Global warming and cyberspace attacks are real; the U. S. A's bogeymen and attempts to shame us into spending more is their usual bullying for their commercial gain. America is not our friend or cousin, nor our moral leader.<br/><br/> Barbara Sternberg, Toronto<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number show there's no need to increase NATO spending</emphasis><br/><br/> I worked for the feds in Ottawa for 20 years, and I know how difficult it is to get accurate military spending numbers. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/cpc-pac/2022/vol2/mdn-dnd/spm-ms-eng.html\">The Public Accounts of Canada are the only source of information that isn't inaccurate</url>, and even the Public Accounts are difficult to understand, because there are so many subsidiary military operations - CSIS, CSE, NATO contributions, defence industry grants, Veterans Affairs, etc. - that are normally left out of DND spending reports. <br/><br/> So it's much appreciated that you clarify the issue by stating that military spending is now $34 billion, and is expected to rise another 46 per cent to $51 billion by 2026. I have a feeling that even these numbers are under-reported, but they're the most accurate numbers I've seen in years. <br/><br/> With this information, it's possible to see that military spending is now the number one priority for federal government spending, after removing provincial transfer payments, and national insurance plans, like CPP from the total of available federal government spending. <br/><br/> This latest information leads us to your conclusion that perhaps Canada is doing enough military spending, and does not need to increase spending commitments to NATO. You are absolutely correct in this. Thank you for this thoughtful analysis. <br/><br/> Max Moore, Toronto<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National town hall needed</emphasis><br/><br/> Thank you to David Olive for a penetrating analysis of the never-ending NATO/G7 push to spend more on weapons. A few people get very, very rich from all those billions ($77 billion on new fighter jets alone).

Decaying infrastructure. Maybe Canada has better things to spend money on than G7 and NATO, Aug. 1<br/><br/><br/><br/> A very challenging column from David Olive. Given the latest fiasco about Chinese interference, the recent cyberattacks, and the raging forest fires across the country, it is probably time for a rethink of our defence strategy. </p><p><br/><br/> Our northern border continues to be at threat from Russia and we need to maintain Norad as our principal warning system.<br/><br/> We must develop and equip a major forest fire fighting force and the resources necessary to combat increased flooding and repair infrastructure.<br/><br/> I have no idea how the military budget is spent but my perception is that we have a small armed force that is well trained but not adequately equipped for modern warfare.<br/><br/> If this is the case and if funds are limited, it may make sense to admit we can't meet the NATO target and put the funds to better use serving our needs.<br/><br/> Different times call for different solutions.<br/><br/> Peter Bradley, Mississauga<br/><br/>  Numbers show there's no need to increase spending<br/><br/> I worked for the feds in Ottawa for 20 years, and I know how difficult it is to get accurate military spending numbers.<br/><br/>  The Public Accounts of Canada are the only source of information that isn't inaccurate, and even the Public Accounts are difficult to understand, because there are so many subsidiary military operations - CSIS, CSE, NATO contributions, defence industry grants, Veterans Affairs, etc. - that are normally left out of DND spending reports. <br/><br/> So it's much appreciated that you clarify the issue by stating that military spending is now $34 billion, and is expected to rise another 46 per cent to $51 billion by 2026. I have a feeling that even these numbers are under-reported, but they're the most accurate numbers I've seen in years. <br/><br/> With this information, it's possible to see that military spending is now the number one priority for federal government spending, after removing provincial transfer payments, and national insurance plans, like CPP from the total of available federal government spending. <br/><br/> This latest information leads us to your conclusion that perhaps Canada is doing enough military spending, and does not need to increase spending commitments to NATO. You are absolutely correct in this. <br/><br/> Thank you for this thoughtful analysis. <br/><br/> Max Moore, Toronto<br/><br/><br/><br/> Opinion flawed <br/><br/> for its revisionism and basic logic <br/><br/> David Olive's uninspired bellyaching against Canada's defence spending and its participation in the G7 and NATO is flawed for its revisionism, naivety and whataboutism. But it also fails on basic logic. <br/><br/> Even if his goal is for Canada to have a greater voice and to be less dependent on the supposedly bossy Americans, he ought to support a more muscular national defence to assert Canada's sovereignty. <br/><br/> Let's not mince words about his true prescription: for Canada to be the bratty kid who enjoys their older sibling's protection, contributes little, and whines the whole time to boot.<br/><br/> Veiko Parming, Toronto<br/><br/> We need to have a national town hall on fund allocation<br/><br/> Thank you to David Olive for a penetrating analysis of the never-ending NATO/G7 push to spend more on weapons. <br/><br/> A few people get very, very rich from all those billions ($77 billion on new fighter jets alone). In the meantime, those dealing with the real threats we face - the climate crisis, cybersecurity, authoritarianism among them - could use the money to much greater effect. <br/><br/> Can we have this discussion as a nation?<br/><br/> Robin Wardlaw, Toronto<br/><br/> Global warming, cyberattacks  real<br/><br/> I totally agree with David Olive's reassessment of our defence spending, and the need to focus on what truly threatens us. Global warming and cyberspace attacks are real; the U.S.A.'s bogeymen and attempts to shame us into spending more is their usual bullying for their commercial gain. <br/><br/>America is not our friend or cousin, nor our moral leader.<br/><br/> Barbara Sternberg, Toronto <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023080568672968</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68W2-WN01-F197-52BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"656\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

And his Alberta home survived the disaster.</p><p>But on Tuesday, Osborne learned the Halifax-area wildfire that has been burning out of control since Sunday had gutted his new residence in Nova Scotia.</p><p>He was among a group from the Yankeetown subdivision northwest of Halifax who were led by RCMP to their properties to retrieve pets after the wildfire swept through.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d the 45-year-old construction worker said after he returned from seeing what was left of his home. \u201cIt is completely flattened.\u201d</p><p>Osborne recalled how when he left his house after an evacuation was ordered, he saw black, churning smoke in his rear-view mirror and felt the same \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d emotions he endured during the Alberta disaster.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just chaos, and it\u2019s happening all over the country,\u201d said the father of two, his voice flat and fatigued. \u201cThis time, I think I was a little calmer as I\u2019ve been through it before. But it was still very, very scary. It\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve pulled my camper away from a forest fire to live in it.\u201d</p><p>Fire officials said that with the return of dry, windy conditions on Tues-day, there could have been a dangerous \u201creburn\u201d caused by a change in wind direction over the evacuated subdivisions, which are spread out over 100 square kilometres.</p><p>While firefighters were kept busy putting out spot fires, Halifax Fire deputy fire Chief David Meldrum said the fire did not grow beyond the evac-uation perimeter, where 200 homes and structures have been either damaged or destroyed since the fire started.</p><p>\u201cThe fire didn\u2019t get bigger,\u201d he told a late-day news conference at a command post in Upper Tantallon. \u201cHowever, the fire is not out, and the fire can wake up and gain new energy.\u201d</p><p>In all, about 16,000 people have been ordered to leave their Halifax-area homes, most of which are within a 30-minute drive of the port city\u2019s downtown. No deaths or injuries have been reported.</p><p>Late Tuesday, officials issued an emergency alert ordering the evacuation of a neighbourhood in the Halifax suburb of Bedford \u201cdue to a wildfire and potential ammonia leak.\u201d The Halifax fire department said on Twitter that a comfort centre would be opened at a nearby Lions Club.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Premier Tim Houston announced the province would be banning all travel and activity in all wooded areas as of 4 p.m. local time.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, stop burning. Stop flicking your cigarette butts out your car windows. Just stop it,\u201d Houston said, adding that conservation officers caught six people setting illegal fires on Monday night alone.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230531RDA0003612757</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68C0-96V1-F0HF-82S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"465\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.
