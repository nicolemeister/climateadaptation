Court of Appeal upheld a decision of the B.C. Supreme Court (BCSC) that the case can proceed to a trial.</p><p>A class action is a lawsuit started by one person on behalf of members of a group that have a similar claim against a single person or company. Before a court will take on a class action, a judge must certify that it meets the multiple rules set out in the Class Proceedings Act.</p><p>In this case, according to Kirk\u2019s lawyer David Rosenberg, the class consists of 2,776 property owners within the zone that was evacuated after the fuel spill, plus anyone who rented, leased or carried on a business within that zone. These people are not individually named in the court action, and most of them have not actually put their names forward and may not know they are part of the group.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t even have to think about it if they don\u2019t want to,\u201d Rosenberg says. \u201cThey can sit back and wait.\u201d</p><p>They would each get a share of any monetary damages that may be awarded by the court. Anyone who suffered damages that they think are extraordinary, above and beyond the average, can come forward later and declare this, Rosenberg says.</p><p>In the summer of 2013, Executive Flight Centre Fuel Services Ltd.was providing fuel to the provincial government to fight a forest fire in the area of Lemon Creek in the Slocan Valley. Its tanker truck overturned and spilled 35,000 litres of jet fuel into the creek, polluting the stream and causing a local evacuation of people living up to 40 kilometres downstream in the Slocan Valley.</p><p>The spill killed fish and forced residents to get alternate sources of drinking water for themselves and livestock for days.</p><p>The trial will determine who was at fault for the spill and how much should be paid to the members of the class action group.</p><p>The delay In 2017, a judge of the BCSC certified that Kirk\u2019s class action could proceed.</p><p>The defendants \u2013 Executive Flight Centre, the Province of B.C. , Transwest Helicopters, and the fuel truck driver Danny LaSante \u2014 appealed that decision to the B.C. Court of Appeal. The appeal judges said that before the action could be certified, the BCSC judge must clarify certain complex issues related to evidence. The BCSC judge did that, and then re-certified the case as a class action.</p><p>The defendants then appealed that decision to the appeal court, whose judges have now ruled again in favour of Kirk.</p><p>David Rosenberg, Kirk\u2019s Vancouver lawyer, says he expects there will be a trial within a year, in B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver.</p><p>He added that although class actions typically take a long time, the delays in this one have been extraordinary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for over 40 years \u2014 I do a lot of class action work \u2014 and I have never before seen a certification, then a de-certification, recertification, and two appeals on a certification.\u201d</p><p>He said for a class action on an environmental issue to be certified is unusual.</p><p>\u201cThe courts have not been that amenable to environmental class actions,\u201d he says.</p><p>The issues The issues that were argued in the appeals are referred to as nuisance and aggregate damages, which are far more complex than the following two-paragraph summary.</p><p>Did the people affected by the spill suffer nuisance in common, as well as individually? If so, this is one basis for a class action. Did the group suffer monetary damages in common, as well as individually? If yes, this is another basis.</p><p>Nuisance and damages in this case refer not only to contamination of water from the spill but the inconvenience caused by the evacuation order and water-use restrictions that were imposed by the province, Rosenberg says.</p><p>The Nelson Star reached out to the Ministry of Attorney General for comment on this decision, with no response. Executive Flight Centre had not responded to a request for comment by the Nelson Star\u2019s press deadline on Jan. 24.</p><p>Charges under the Fisheries Act The defendants were also charged under the Fisheries Act with polluting a stream frequented by fish.

A lot of harvesters make their living doing this so they will go to where the fires are and do the picking.</p><p>\"It's also nice for local people because the horror of having a forest fire near you is terrible but the next day you can get a little bit to help rebuild.\"</p><p>The South Cariboo was a natural stop for the company this year, she said, following extensive wildfires last summer. On Monday evening, Janas had several bins full of \"fire morels,\" mostly the blonde and grey versions.</p><p>One fellow said he got his morels at the Flat Lake fire site, while Eirik Iverson and his wife and daughter found 112 pounds of one kind and 17 pounds at nearby burns. They split the profits three ways, with Iverson saying he will \"put it away for a rainy day.\"</p><p>Iverson, who has been picking on and off for 30 years ever since his parents saw a roadside mushroom buyer in Alaska, said it's a fun side hustle.</p><p>\"You can find some good patches and make decent money,\" he said.</p><p>Janas thanked the family for their mushrooms, saying they were \"really good quality.\" She noted they are usually up in the Yukon, but her son was also recently in Vernon.</p><p>\"We have to follow the forest fires,\" she said. \"It will go on for a couple of months the mushrooms before they die out.\"</p><p>There are several species of fire morels in British Columbia, including Morchella tomentosa (gray fire morel), Morchella sextelata (pink fire morel) and Morchella septimelata (green fire morel), according to the B.C. government's website. There are also \"morel relatives with which they might be confused: Gyromitra esculenta (false morel) and Verpa bohemica (false early morel).\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kelly.sinoski@100milefreepress.net\">kelly.sinoski@100milefreepress.net</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2022 100 Mile House Free Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLEHFP-news20220626PAA4339283</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65SS-G5P1-F0HF-818R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"385\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Hennessy has already ruled the payment,\u00a0capped at $4 per person in 1874, must increase.</p><p>She also ruled the new annuity must provide the treaty signatories with a share of the territory's natural resource wealth. While Ontario is appealing that decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, Hennessy turns to the question of liability and damages.</p><p>On that, Ontario's lawyer Tamara Barclay\u00a0told court the Crown shouldered huge expenses exploiting the resources - so huge that extraction in the region resulted in a Crown financial loss of between $7 billion and $12 billion during the relevant period.</p><p>\"Mining research, re-forestation, insect control, forest fire management, surveys, land agents, as well as expenses in connection with colonization roads and railways without which harvested resources could not be moved to market\" are some cost examples, Barclay said.</p><p>With those included, net Crown resource-based revenues, meaning\u00a0money left over after deductions,\u00a0\"have been negative since about 1960,\" Barclay said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'We will fight until\u00a0this stops'</emphasis></p><p>The plaintiffs disagree.</p><p>Ontario's argument left Chief Patricia Tangie, of Michipicoten First Nation in the Robinson Superior Treaty territory, stunned.\u00a0</p><p>\"I just don't have words to express how disappointing it is,\" said Tangie in an interview Wednesday.</p><p>\"How can the Crown claim that it lost money through resource extraction? Like $8 billion? That's absurd. It's ridiculous for them to even suggest that they lost money.\"</p><p>The Anishinaabe in the area signed treaties with a vision of fair sharing and respect, but instead generation after generation watched as truckloads of lucrative timber and minerals were, and still are, taken from their lands, Tangie said.</p><p>\"And we can't use the land any more,\" Tangie said.</p><p>\"It's disproportionate and totally unfair, and, as long as I'm alive,\u00a0and I know that many of our people feel the same way,\u00a0we will fight until this stops.\"</p><p>Michipicoten's legal team and the lawyers for the other Superior treaty signatories, represented by Red Rock Indian Band and Whitesand First Nation, denounced Ontario's argument as an affront to reconciliation.</p><p>They painted it on Monday in court as a preposterous idea that\u00a0suggests\u00a0\"the lands are worthless to the Crown (and have been worthless for 173 years), and thus entitle the Anishinaabe to nothing.\"</p><p>Ontario defended its position, calling the plaintiffs' preferred accounting models, with one topping $190 billion, \"excessive.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other plaintiffs 'optimistic' about talks</emphasis></p><p>The sprawling trial was split into three stages because of its complexity. It includes two groups of plaintiffs who, until now, proceeded with litigation together.</p><p>That changed when 21\u00a0Anishinaabe bands, all beneficiaries of the Robinson Huron Treaty, adjourned their case in favour of confidential settlement talks.</p><p>Batchewana First Nation Chief Dean Sayers, a spokesman for the Huron treaty group, is optimistic they'll reach a deal in the coming months. After trying every legal trick in the book to fight the case, Sayers\u00a0said he suspects a shift in public opinion pushed governments to the table.</p><p>\"The citizens of Canada and Ontario really have taken note of the atrocities that have been inflicted on Indigenous people across the country,\" he said.</p><p>\"There's been, I believe, a lot of mismanagement over the decades, over the century and a half.\"</p><p>And despite the two Anishinaabe groups' differing approaches, they stand in solidarity. Tangie and Sayers said the goal remains achieving a fair renewal of the treaty relationship.</p><p>\"I'm pretty optimistic,\" said Sayers of the settlement talks.</p><p>\"Senior voices from both Canada and Ontario have mandates, are participating actively, and are really quick to respond to our collective perspectives and questions.\"</p><p>Tangie added, \"Let's share the resources fairly. 'Colonization' and opening up the lands and the resources to all of Canada, we can't even consider that to be fair.\"</p><p>In addition to how much should be paid, Hennessy must decide\u00a0whether Ontario or Canada should pay.</p><p>Canada's lawyers on Tuesday said Ontario should be held liable because resource revenues flowed to the provinces after Canadian confederation. Ontario disputed that, urging the judge to hold Canada liable because upholding treaties is a federal obligation.</p><p>Canada\u00a0refused to pin an exact dollar amount on the resources' modern-day value, saying that's within Ontario's jurisdiction.</p><p>Ontario's appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada\u00a0on\u00a0Hennessy's previous decision is slated for the fall.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewsindigenousontariorobinsontreatyannuitytrial16733685</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69MK-2MC1-JCMC-W1R1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"853\"/><timeReceived>9:57 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Court of Appeal upheld a decision of the B.C. Supreme Court (BCSC) that the case can proceed to a trial.</p><p>A class action is a lawsuit started by one person on behalf of members of a group that have a similar claim against a single person or company. Before a court will take on a class action, a judge must certify that it meets the multiple rules set out in the Class Proceedings Act.</p><p>In this case, according to Kirk\u2019s lawyer David Rosenberg, the class consists of 2,776 property owners within the zone that was evacuated after the fuel spill, plus anyone who rented, leased or carried on a business within that zone. These people are not individually named in the court action, and most of them have not actually put their names forward and may not know they are part of the group.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t even have to think about it if they don\u2019t want to,\u201d Rosenberg says. \u201cThey can sit back and wait.\u201d They would each get a share of any monetary damages that may be awarded by the court. Anyone who suffered damages that they think are extraordinary, above and beyond the average, can come forward later and declare this, Rosenberg says.</p><p>In the summer of 2013, Executive Flight Centre Fuel Services Ltd.was providing fuel to the provincial government to fight a forest fire in the area of Lemon Creek in the Slocan Valley. Its tanker truck overturned and spilled 35,000 litres of jet fuel into the creek, polluting the stream and causing a local evacuation of people living up to 40 kilometres downstream in the Slocan Valley.</p><p>The spill killed fish and forced residents to get alternate sources of drinking water for themselves and livestock for days.</p><p>The trial will determine who was at fault for the spill and how much should be paid to the members of the class action group.</p><p>The delay In 2017, a judge of the BCSC certified that Kirk\u2019s class action could proceed.</p><p>The defendants \u2013 Executive Flight Centre, the Province of B.C. , Transwest Helicopters, and the fuel truck driver Danny LaSante \u2014 appealed that decision to the B.C. Court of Appeal. The appeal judges said that before the action could be certified, the BCSC judge must clarify certain complex issues related to evidence. The BCSC judge did that, and then re-certified the case as a class action.</p><p>The defendants then appealed that decision to the appeal court, whose judges have now ruled again in favour of Kirk.</p><p>David Rosenberg, Kirk\u2019s Vancouver lawyer, says he expects there will be a trial within a year, in B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver.</p><p>He added that although class actions typically take a long time, the delays in this one have been extraordinary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for over 40 years \u2014 I do a lot of class action work \u2014 and I have never before seen a certification, then a de-certification, recertification, and two appeals on a certification.\u201d</p><p>He said for a class action on an environmental issue to be certified is unusual.</p><p>\u201cThe courts have not been that amenable to environmental class actions,\u201d he says.</p><p>The issues The issues that were argued in the appeals are referred to as nuisance and aggregate damages, which are far more complex than the following two-paragraph summary.</p><p>Did the people affected by the spill suffer nuisance in common, as well as individually? If so, this is one basis for a class action. Did the group suffer monetary damages in common, as well as individually? If yes, this is another basis.</p><p>Nuisance and damages in this case refer not only to contamination of water from the spill but the inconvenience caused by the evacuation order and water-use restrictions that were imposed by the province, Rosenberg says.</p><p>The Nelson Star reached out to the Ministry of Attorney General for comment on this decision, with no response. Executive Flight Centre had not responded to a request for comment by the Nelson Star\u2019s press deadline on Jan. 24.</p><p>Charges under the Fisheries Act The defendants were also charged under the Fisheries Act with polluting a stream frequented by fish. Those charges were entirely separate from Kirk\u2019s class action lawsuit.</p><p>In February, 2020, as a result of the Fisheries Act charges, Executive Flight Centre was fined $175,000 and the fuel truck driver Danny LaSante was fined $20,000. The provincial government was acquitted.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRAILD-news20230131PSXA0003311191</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRAILD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67FJ-98D1-JD2C-J2N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

A lot of harvesters make their living doing this so they will go to where the fires are and do the picking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also nice for local people because the horror of having a forest fire near you is terrible but the next day you can get a little bit to help rebuild.\u201d</p><p>The South Cariboo was a natural stop for the company this year, she said, following extensive wildfires last summer. On Monday evening, Janas had several bins full of \u201cfire morels,\u201d mostly the blonde and grey versions.</p><p>One fellow said he got his morels at the Flat Lake fire site, while Eirik Iverson and his wife and daughter found 112 pounds of one kind and 17 pounds at nearby burns. They split the profits three ways, with Iverson saying he will \u201cput it away for a rainy day.\u201d</p><p>Iverson, who has been picking on and off for 30 years ever since his parents saw a roadside mushroom buyer in Alaska, said it\u2019s a fun side hustle.</p><p>\u201cYou can find some good patches and make decent money,\u201d he said.</p><p>Janas thanked the family for their mushrooms, saying they were \u201creally good quality.\u201d She noted they are usually up in the Yukon, but her son was also recently in Vernon.</p><p>\u201cWe have to follow the forest fires,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will go on for a couple of months the mushrooms before they die out.\u201d</p><p>There are several species of fire morels in British Columbia, including Morchella tomentosa (gray fire morel), Morchella sextelata (pink fire morel) and Morchella septimelata (green fire morel), according to the B.C. government\u2019s website. There are also \u201cmorel relatives with which they might be confused:Gyromitra esculenta (false morel) and Verpa bohemica (false early morel).\u201d</p><p>100 Mile Free Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLEHFP-news20220623UAEA0002783935</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65S4-KXB1-JD2C-J09J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"369\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

In Summerside, the temperature maxed out at 20.6 C, breaking the city\u2019s previous October record of 20 C in 1898. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SaltWire Network\u2019s weather specialist Allister Aalders said in an interview on Nov. 1 that temperatures have been well above average across Atlantic Canada. </p><p>\u201cWe know based on daily highs and lows that temperatures on P.E.I. were really three to five degrees above normal on average,\u201d said Aalders. \u201cThat is certainly significant.\u201d </p><p>The warm weather is due in large part to above-normal temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean. </p><p>Several factors have played into why the water has been warmer, the most important being upper-level wind patterns the province was under for much of October. </p><p>\u201cThere was a blocking ridge of high pressure. Often, we see these blocking highs during the summertime which keep us dry,\u201d Aalders said. </p><p>The blocking ridge was positioned in such a way that it hovered over Atlantic Canada, causing a large jet stream to pull in warm flows of wind from the south. </p><p>P.E.I. has been surrounded by this warm water throughout October, causing winds across the Northumberland Straight to increase in temperature by several degrees before making landfall. </p><p>This warm streak will likely continue into November and possibly even December, causing sea ice to form later in the winter. This is not good news for P.E.I.\u2019s northern coastline, which remains largely damaged following post-tropical storm Fiona. </p><p>\u201cLast year, the sea ice was late. Then we started having powerful winter storms that sent large crashing waves into the shoreline causing erosion when typically, the sea ice would have already formed to protect the shoreline,\u201d said Aalders. \u201cThis leaves those already delicate shorelines particularly vulnerable.\u201d </p><p>With current weather trends, it looks likely the North Atlantic region could experience another La Ni\u00f1a winter for the third year in a row. </p><p>Typically, with an La Ni\u00f1a pattern it is more difficult to predict how the season will play out, said Aalders. </p><p>\u201cThis being the third in a row is really quite a rare occurrence,\u201d he said. </p><p>The reason for this is due in large part to climate change, which continues to impact the province worse every year. It is possible these warmer trends will become the new norm for the time of year, likely affecting the autumn months the most, he added. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really just the perfect ingredients of a strong storm development, and, certainly, the warm, unseasonable temperatures will be sticking around to start the month of November.\u201d </p><p>UPEI climate lab director Adam Fenech told SaltWire Network in an interview on Nov. 1 that he is concerned with how quickly temperatures have been increasing across the province in recent years. </p><p>\u201cWhen we get things warmer, even if it may seem like a small amount of temperature amount usually means a huge change in nature,\u201d said Fenech. \u201cI\u2019m just shocked at how quickly these changes are happening. 30 years ago, I was talking about all of these sorts of things and now they are all manifesting.\u201d </p><p>The warm temperatures do bring some silver linings, he added, such as longer farming and tourism seasons. </p><p>That said, they will also likely bring more plant diseases and pests, as well as a tremendous risk of forest fires. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really worried about forest fires eventually becoming a problem here. We\u2019re kind of due for a big forest fire, especially with a lot of these trees down,\u201d said Fenech. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit scared that these things are happening because they are happening faster than we\u2019d anticipated.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-696e780728ff403690a7ac80a40b13b0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66SM-TBC1-JBVR-33FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><timeReceived>02:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 3, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000647</classCode><className>EROSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000DS67</classCode><className>COASTAL CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DESJ</classCode><className>SEVERE WINTER WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX061</classCode><className>CHARLOTTETOWN, PE, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A2L6</classCode><className>ATLANTIC OCEAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS175</classCode><className>PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

While such events are not unknown, the past season has been one of the warmest and driest in many decades. One example of a similar \"open\" winter and spring occurred 90 years ago in 1931.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The winter had been so dry that the only measurable precipitation from Christmas to the beginning of March fell on Jan. 10. Only 8 mm (1/3 inch) of snow fell that day. Weather was generally so warm that the matches for the Alberta curling championship in Red Deer on Feb. 25 that year had to be played after midnight. Otherwise it was too warm to maintain a proper sheet of ice.</p><p>A few days later, a sizable forest fire broke out in the Clearwater Forest Reserve. Forest fires in late February and early March are rare. However, things were so dry and snow cover so sparse, that once started, there was little to control the spread of the blaze.</p><p>Things go much worse on March 3 when high winds blew in. Fires broke out in many rural areas, particularly west of Eckville and near Rocky Mountain House. One at Alhambra/Horseguard caused widespread damage to farms, a sawmill and timber stands. Other fires struck at Rocky Mountain House, Kevisville, Ridgewood (west of Penhold), and Lacombe.</p><p>John \"Scotty\" Neilson was badly burnt when he unsuccessfully attempted to save his horses while in the bush northwest of Rocky Mountain House. Henry Neilson (no relation) lost his life when he and his team of horses were surrounded by fire just west of the Kevisville store. He had been attempting to head home to help protect his family and farm from the blaze.</p><p>The high winds also whipped up a huge dust storm. Conditions with the heavy dust, mixed with smoke, became so severe that people in Red Deer had to turn on their lights in the middle of the day in order to see.</p><p>A subsequent snowfall helped ease the conditions a bit. However, the skiff of snow that fell in many areas did nothing to ease the very dry conditions. The bush and forest fires were more significantly reduced towards the end of March when temperatures dropped to more than -25 C.</p><p>High winds returned in April and early May, bringing back the huge dust storms across much of central Alberta. In one storm at Ponoka, visibility was reduced to less than 10 metres due to the heavy dust.</p><p>On April 29, one pasture fire on the north side of the Red Deer River jumped to the south side, and into Balmoral district, due to the combination of high winds and low water levels in the river. The farmer, where the fire started, was later fined $15 (roughly the same amount as two weeks of an average person's wages) for failing to take sufficient fire control measures on his property.</p><p>Fortunately, enough rain and snow fell in west central Alberta and the foothills to initially prevent another outbreak of wildfires. Nevertheless, in mid-May, the Alberta Forestry Service began to restrict travelling and timber permits in the forestry reserves because of the continuing significant threat of fire.</p><p>Meanwhile, a large and serious grass fire broke out in the Village of North Red Deer. It was thought that it started with random sparks from someone's chimney. It took a concerted effort by a number of villagers and school children to keep the blaze from reaching the school and nearby buildings. Another fire broke out on the south side of the Exhibition Grounds. In this case, the fire department was able to get the blaze under control before any buildings were damaged.</p><p>The forest fire threat at Rocky Mountain House and area rose again in June. One bad fire occurred near the community of Saunders. Another broke out near Dovercourt. On one Sunday afternoon, the Forestry Service found itself struggling to manage seven new blazes.</p><p>Fortunately, heavy rains commencing at the end of June greatly reduced the numbers of forest fires in west central Alberta. However, British Columbia battled a bad forest fire situation for the rest of the summer.</p><p>Red Deer historian Michael Dawe's column appears Wednesdays.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-4143027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62FB-6BC1-JDH1-C321-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"671\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors.

The announcement followed the dismantling, over the years, of several other lookouts around B.C. which were no longer being used and could not be managed by the Fire Protection Service.</p><p>Wes Kibble, the Four Wheel Drive Association\u2019s regional director for Thompson-Nicola, organized a work bee for Sept. 11 and put out a call for volunteers.</p><p>\u201cA big thank you to everyone who came out to help at the Cornwall Fire Lookout maintenance day!\u201d he said on Facebook. \u201cWe had members from as far away as Enderby and Vancouver, as well as some Ashcroft locals who are not members but wanted to help out because it is a historic piece in their backyard.</p><p>\u201cWe also had a visit from the BC Parks Senior Ranger and he was super impressed with the amount of people and the amount of work being done. I had a good on-site meeting with him in regards to future plans.</p><p>\u201cEveryone put in a great effort:new boards were put up on the front, two new 4x4 support posts were put in, one window was replaced, and a crew scraped and painted the interior roof and walls, among other smaller projects.</p><p>\u201cOnce again, thanks to those that came out.</p><p>BC Parks, the 4WDABC and the residents of Ashcroft and Cache Creek appreciate all the hard work.\u201d</p><p>Historical records indicate that there has been a fire lookout on Cornwall Mountain since at least the 1890s, when the lookout was maintained on an informal basis. The current lookout tower is a standard cottage-roof cabin on top of a wooden tower. The base of the tower provided living accommodations for the person manning it, while the cabin\u2014surrounded by a catwalk\u2014was used for fire-spotting, with continuous windows on all four sides maximizing the surveillance capacity of a lone observer. It\u2019s one of two predominant fire lookout formats constructed by the BC Forest Services between the 1920s and the late 1950s.</p><p>The Cornwall fire lookout \u2014 which sits at an elevation of 6,600 feet \u2014 was regularly manned each summer until the early 1990s, after which it was only used if there was a fire risk in the area. By 1999 it was the only active forest service lookout tower in the Kamloops fire district, and the last time it was used was during the 2003 wildfire in the Cornwall Hills.</p><p>Fire lookout towers are popular not only with 4X4 enthusiasts, but with hikers, geocachers, snowmobilers, and history buffs, among others. Information about lookout locations, as well as lots of pictures of the lookouts and the views from them, can be found on the BC Forest Fire Lookouts Facebook page.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASHCCJ-news20220922PPIA0003001440</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASHCCJ2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66FH-YWS1-JD2C-J3FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

The emergency will exhaust current resources and the province will have to bring in more crews from other jurisdictions.</p><p>\"It's no doubt that it's going to be a challenging summer and that we will have to look at other sources for help,\" St-Onge said.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"We're hoping for some help from from the weather certainly, but it it could be a situation that we see for the rest of the summer.\"\u00a0</p><p>Tucker said at a Wednesday news conference\u00a0recent smoky conditions have made it difficult to fly over wildfires to determine their size. While there has been a short reprieve with less wind and slightly cooler temperatures, hot and dry conditions are expected to return this long weekend.\u00a0</p><p>Some 2,500 firefighters are currently fighting the fires - 1,600 from Alberta Wildfire, and 900 others from the Canadian Armed Forces, other provinces and the United States.</p><p>Another 61 firefighters arrived Tuesday from Ontario, with 21 expected to arrive from New Brunswick on Wednesday.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lifting evacuation orders\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>\u00a0As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 11,990 people remained evacuated from their homes, but some displaced residents have been allowed to return.</p><p>Officials with\u00a0Drayton Valley and Brazeau County, southwest of Edmonton, welcomed residents back during a news conference Wednesday.</p><p>Fire Services Chief Tom Thomson thanked the community for a successful re-entry.</p><p>\"I know it has been tough times for the last little while and we are so happy to see faces back and people able to be back into their homes.\"\u00a0</p><p>He said five homes across the county were destroyed by the flames.\u00a0</p><p>Multiple firefighters have also been injured while trying to save the community, according to incident commander Byron Fraser. The firefighters are expected to make a full recovery.</p><p>One firefighter was seriously injured by a falling tree in East Prairie M\u00e9tis Settlement, which Fraser pointed to as one of many risks in the wildfire response.\u00a0</p><p>\"That goes to show professionals that are getting injured out there. Stay out of the forest, stay safe,\" he said.</p><p>When asked about the gap between being able to re-open communities and lift evacuation orders, Fraser said safety was paramount.\u00a0</p><p>\"We still have crews working tirelessly and in dangerous spots and until we felt completely comfortable that the fire was not going to leave its containment area, it was still too high of a risk.\"\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>A key factor in making the decision to lift evacuation orders was changing weather and shifting winds.</p><p>Thomson said while the threat from a fire in the area has subsided, dangers in the community remain.</p><p>He said there are concerns about falling trees and ash pits in areas ravaged by fire as crews continue to battle active flames.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Challenging conditions</emphasis></p><p>Hot, dry and windy conditions are expected to continue throughout Western Canada, potentially creating more intense and unpredictable fires through the Victoria Day weekend.</p><p>Firefighters in Alberta have battled heat and tinder-dry conditions. Shifting winds this week have accelerated fire growth, driving flames closer to some communities.</p><p>Peat found in muskeg is also challenging firefighters, acting as fuel that makes some fires difficult to extinguish and could keep some of them smouldering through winter.</p><p>Marieke deRoos, a spokesperson for the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, which\u00a0helps provinces and territories share firefighting resources, said the demand on fire crews is escalating across the country.</p><p>With resources stretched increasingly thin, other countries not in the midst of their fire seasons are being asked to dispatch aid to Alberta, she said.</p><p>\"We have turned to our partners down south in the U.S. who have already deployed resources to Alberta, and we're currently investigating other options from our other partners of New Zealand, Australia, Mexico and South Africa.\"</p><p>The fire danger is extreme in northern Alberta with temperatures expected to increase again toward the end of this week.\u00a0</p><p>Smoke has spread south across the province in recent days, clouding visibility, aggravating health concerns and acting as a constant reminder of the crisis unfolding in communities. Special air quality statements are in place for much of Alberta.</p><p>A detailed assessment of the losses has not been completed but reports of burned homes, acreages and business continue to pour in from across central and northern Alberta.</p><p>As the threat subsides in some communities, evacuees are slowly returning home. On Tuesday, evacuation orders were partially lifted allowing for a staggered re-entry in Brazeau County, including Drayton Valley, which is home to around 7,000 residents.</p><p>Maj. Sean Fletcher, the officer commanding the military\u00a0domestic response company in Drayton Valley, said\u00a0about 125 reservists are on the ground in the area.</p><p>He said troops are providing relief to provincial crews, acting as backfill when firefighters\u00a0take leave of the front lines or are dispatched to more urgent fires burning elsewhere.</p><p>Soldiers are working long hours, he said. Depending on how long the deployment lasts, fresh troops will be rotated in to avoid burnout, he said.</p><p>\"We know this is a marathon, not a race,\" Fletcher said.\u00a0</p><p>In northwest Alberta, the communities of Rainbow Lake and Chateh remain under threat and hundreds of residents of the neighbouring communities have fled.\u00a0</p><p>David Morin, a firefighter who has been working in the area, echoed the call for more aid.</p><p>In terms of resources, Alberta will need \"the whole kitchen sink\" to tame the disaster, he said.</p><p>\"We're going to need more people, we're going to need more airplanes. We're going to need more everything, just more and more and more, until we can get the situation under control.</p><p>Morin expects it will be a long, difficult wildfire season.\u00a0</p><p>\"I've never seen it this dry this early and the winds have been incredible,\" he said.</p><p>\"Because it's so dry and it's so early, this is going to be a long summer for us.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadaedmontonalbertawildfirescoulddragonallsummer16846377</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69S1-5MG1-F03F-K4G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1181\"/><timeReceived>4:39 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Called Scotch Broom, it is difficult to spot and nearly invisible from the air, except for a small window of time each year when it blooms with bright yellow flowers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then Neris, who's based in Forks, Washington, became one of Rayonier's drone pilots. He flew his drone as soon as the Scotch Broom plants bloomed, collecting aerial photos so he could develop a precise map of the plant locations across miles of forestland. Once the plants were located, his team was able to develop a treatment plan to get rid of them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are countless success stories like this that show how drone flights are impacting Rayonier for the better. They're used to take a quick initial look at a stand of trees, to monitor a contractor's work, to more safely assess the devastation during and after a forest fire, and even to create 3-D images.</p><p>After a preliminary \"pilot\" team tested how the company could use drones in 2017, Rayonier saw the potential and launched the program nationwide, encouraging at least one forester in every U.S. location to get their FAA drone pilot's license. There are currently 30 pilots on our U.S. team.</p><p>In New Zealand, our first employee pilots were trained in early 2018 after a couple years of working with contractors to test the impact of drones. Now we have a drone in each of the five regions in which we operate, with 15 trained pilots. The New Zealand team typically refers to their drones as UAVs, which stands for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.</p><p>\"We have some clever, motivated people who are determined to leverage this technology-and technology in general-to do existing work better and, even more exciting, find new ways to do more than we could previously,\" says Forest Information Manager Joanna Drabsch, who's based out of Auckland, New Zealand.</p><p>A New Perspective</p><p>\"A drone allows us to see something we wouldn't have been able to see any other way. It's a tool that gives us a whole new perspective,\" says Technical Analyst Sara Bellchamber, a self-described gamer who organized the U.S. program.</p><p>Based in Wildlight, Florida, Sara says one way she uses her drone is to help Rayonier's land resources team measure the depth of fill dirt pits using a program called Drone Deploy. The software uses images taken in a grid pattern and stitches them together into a 3-D image.</p><p>Sara says she has seen drones save costs, increase safety and save time throughout Rayonier's ownership. In the South, for example, they minimize the gap in time between the harvest of a forest and the preparation of that forest for replanting during Florida's hot summers.</p><p>\"After a harvest, you'd normally have to fly a plane to estimate what it will take to prep the site [for replanting],\" she explains. \"In high summer, there's a haze in the sky and planes can't take clear photos through it. But drones can fly below the haze, getting us the imagery we need much sooner.\"</p><p>While planes are still the preferred option for imagery collection, work doesn't have to grind to a halt if a plane is not an option.</p><p>Working with Drones in the Forest</p><p>Blake McMichael and Dan Hildebrand, both Resource Land Managers based in Jesup, Georgia, use their drones when they're in the field assessing forests.</p><p>\"One of the best uses I've found is for site-specific management,\" says Blake. \"It helps me delineate where treatments are needed and where they're not. It's not replacing boots on the ground, it's giving us a birds-eye view we've never had before.\"</p><p>Eliminating Hours of Work</p><p>For Dan, who's been a Rayonier forester for more than 30 years, his drone eliminates hours of work tromping through the forest to locate pre-commercial thinning candidates, trees with flaws such as forking that should be removed to make room for the optimal trees to grow.</p><p>When he first became a forester, \"it used to be all boots on the ground,\" Dan says. \"But I've always been open to new possibilities.\"</p><p>In hazardous conditions such as difficult terrain, drones can make a task much safer. Neris, the forester in Forks, used his drone to save himself from a long, cold walk to determine whether snowy roads would be drivable or not after a heavy snowstorm (they weren't).</p><p>\"It took me 10 minutes to do with a drone what would have taken me 2 hours to do on foot,\" Neris says.</p><p>That sentiment is echoed by many drone pilots across many tasks: work can be done quickly, accurately and more safely by incorporating a drone.</p><p>\"My favorite way to use the drone is by using the Maps Made Easy software to quickly map a large area in high definition, then be able to convert that to a file which can directly be transferred to our GIS system,\" says Graduate Forester Patrick Dravitzki, who's based in Whangarei, New Zealand. \"This is great for doing harvest reconciliation mark ups as we get an accurate measurement of the area which has been harvested, then compare that with the volume recovered to get a volume recovered per-hectare.</p><p>\"This also solved a problem, as previously we had to walk the perimeter with a GPS or hand draw on a map. This method is a lot safer, faster and accurate.\"</p><p>Using Drones to Prepare for the Future</p><p>The drone pilots share files and tips with each other and come together for a regular cross-country phone call, hearing new ways fellow foresters have discovered to use their drones in the field and helping each other expand their skills. The team is continuously trying to prepare for what's next: several of the pilots are even part of a Rayonier \"super users group\" tasked with staying on top of any future technological advances that could benefit the company.</p><p>Neris gives Rayonier leadership credit for supporting the program from the start.</p><p>\"They were receptive, asked hard questions, listened thoughtfully, and let us check it out,\" he says.</p><p>The result is a program that not only benefits Rayonier now (one forester said the information gleaned in a single flight saved more money than the cost of his drone), but it's also positioning Rayonier for the future.</p><p>\"Having a team of drone pilots, the infrastructure for the program, the experience and understanding how to use the data we're collecting puts us in a very strong position for when the next development rolls along,\" Neris says. \"We'll be ready.\"</p><p>Neris's drone takes flight in Forks, Wasington.</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Rayonier on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: Rayonier<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/rayonier\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/rayonier</url><br/>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@3blmedia.com\">info@3blmedia.com</email></p><p>SOURCE: Rayonier</p><p><br/><br/>View source version on accesswire.com: <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/755666/How-Rayonier-Foresters-Use-Drones-to-Manage-Land\">https://www.accesswire.com/755666/How-Rayonier-Foresters-Use-Drones-to-Manage-Land</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FSCWRE-123712175</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6885-8H51-JDJN-64YX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411383</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1132\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 ACCESS Newswire Inc.

Not this early in the year. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The forest fire that that broke out last Thursday near the village of Villanueva de Viver surprised Rubio and fire experts by displaying an unusual ferocity for spring, when in previous years lower temperatures helped keep fires manageable. That doesn't bode well for a country that led Europe in burned land during a record-hot 2022.</p><p>\u201cI was expecting a fire like the ones we normally see in March, which can consume 100, 200 hectares, not the more than 4,300 hectares (11,600 acres) that this one has burned,\u201d Rubio, 39, told The Associated Press hours before going back into the fray. \u201cWe are dealing with weather conditions appropriate for the summer and have a fire that is behaving like a summertime fire.\u201d</p><p>The Mediterranean region is warming faster than the global average due to climate change caused by the release of greenhouse gases. The effects, European and Spanish officials agree, are already being seen in the multiple heat waves and the prolonged drought that Spain has endured over several months.</p><p>Those conditions have turned Spain\u2019s vast expanses of woods into a tinderbox just waiting for the random lightning strike, spark from a tractor or saw, negligently cast cigarette, or act of arson to ignite the landscape.</p><p>Some 267,000 hectares (666,000 acres) burned last year in Spain, making 2022 its worst year of fire destruction since 1994, government statistics say. That was three times the national average for the past decade of 94,000 hectares (232,000 acres). According to the European Union\u2019s Copernicus satellite observation service, Spain accounted for 35% of all burned land in European wildfires in 2022.</p><p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez warned of worse to come unless some desperately needed rain comes to the rescue, on his visit to the country\u2019s first major fire of the year.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, over the last few years these fires are becoming normal. What is not so normal is that we see them in March,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said on Monday. \u201cThis has a lot to do with the climate emergency that the world is facing.\u201d</p><p>The fire has forced the evacuation of nearly 1,400 people from their homes in Villanueva de Viver and other small villages in the hilly, rural area of Castellon province, which has a shrinking, and aging, population like many areas of Spain\u2019s interior. Some 4,600 hectares of forest that authorities deem of \u201chigh ecological value\u201d have gone up in huge plumes of smoke. Five hundred firefighters, supported by 20 water-dumping aircraft, battle on to protect a nearby nature reserve.</p><p>To make things tougher for Rubio and his fellow firefighters, the area is full of tiny villages that are surrounded by trees, making them difficult to protect. So far, they have been saved from the flames. A generation ago, the lands were tended to by the villagers. Now that those agricultural jobs, which included collecting firewood, have largely been abandoned by their children, the land is overgrown with dense foliage, which when dry is fuel for fires.</p><p>Rubio said that the area\u2019s vegetation, mainly made up of small pine trees typical of the Mediterranean, and brush, which is very dense, combined with abnormally high temperatures and well-under-average rainfall produced the perfect conditions for the fire. In this part of Castellon, only 20 millimeters (0.8 inches) of rain fell during the winter months, when the average is over 100 (4 inches).</p><p>France, too, saw surprisingly early forest fires this year, after having several major fires in 2022 like Spain. Amid a record-breaking stretch of winter drought across France, wildfires broke out in February near Avignon in the southeast, in the Pyrenees region in the southwest, and the Charente-Maritime region on the Atlantic coast.</p><p>Spain\u2019s weather service spokesman Rub\u00e9n del Campo warned on Wednesday that higher temperatures, reaching 5-10 degrees Celsius (9-18 degrees Fahrenheit) above average, are in store for Castellon and the rest of eastern Spain over the coming days. He said these are temperatures \u201cnormally seen in mid-to-late May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rising temperatures combined with westerly winds, which reach the Mediterranean hot and dry, cause the relative humidity to fall, and the risk of wildfires goes up dramatically,\u201d Del Campo said.</p><p>The situation north of the fire in Spain\u2019s Catalonia, which borders with France, is also incredibly delicate, and authorities are bracing for the worst. </p><p>The region home to Barcelona is suffering its worst drought on record and temperatures beat yearly averages by a full 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) last year. The director of Catalonia weather service, Sarai Sarroca, said Wednesday that their climate models hadn't expected such a huge surge in temperature until the year 2050.</p><p>Sarroca said that one cause of the drought is the collapse of strong, humid winds that usually blow over the Pyrenees Mountains and help produce snow and rain in the winter.</p><p>For Juli Pausas, a specialist in fire ecology who researches desertification for the Spanish National Research Council, this was all sadly predictable.</p><p>He said that with temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit) during the Castellon fire and a lack of rainfall, \u201cwe now have 20th century vegetation in a 21st century climate.\"</p><p>\u201cWe are in climatic conditions that favor big fires,\u201d Pausas told the AP. \u201cWe have known for a long time that the climate is changing, and we have known that this would have consequences, including more wildfires, yet we haven't done enough to stop it.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s climate and environment coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a0e59acdb49827c1d0e0478085f5be1c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67WS-HS71-JBVR-3319-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"964\"/><timeReceived>02:21 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 30, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The announcement followed the dismantling, over the years, of several other lookouts around B.C. which were no longer being used and could not be managed by the Fire Protection Service.</p><p>Wes Kibble, the Four Wheel Drive Association's regional director for Thompson-Nicola, organized a work bee for Sept. 11 and put out a call for volunteers.</p><p>\"A big thank you to everyone who came out to help at the Cornwall Fire Lookout maintenance day!\" he said on Facebook. \"We had members from as far away as Enderby and Vancouver, as well as some Ashcroft locals who are not members but wanted to help out because it is a historic piece in their backyard.</p><p>\"We also had a visit from the BC Parks Senior Ranger and he was super impressed with the amount of people and the amount of work being done. I had a good on-site meeting with him in regards to future plans.</p><p>\"Everyone put in a great effort: new boards were put up on the front, two new 4x4 support posts were put in, one window was replaced, and a crew scraped and painted the interior roof and walls, among other smaller projects.</p><p>\"Once again, thanks to those that came out. BC Parks, the 4WDABC and the residents of Ashcroft and Cache Creek appreciate all the hard work.\"</p><p>Historical records indicate that there has been a fire lookout on Cornwall Mountain since at least the 1890s, when the lookout was maintained on an informal basis. The current lookout tower is a standard cottage-roof cabin on top of a wooden tower. The base of the tower provided living accommodations for the person manning it, while the cabin\u2014surrounded by a catwalk\u2014was used for fire-spotting, with continuous windows on all four sides maximizing the surveillance capacity of a lone observer. It's one of two predominant fire lookout formats constructed by the BC Forest Services between the 1920s and the late 1950s.</p><p>The Cornwall fire lookout \u2014 which sits at an elevation of 6,600 feet \u2014 was regularly manned each summer until the early 1990s, after which it was only used if there was a fire risk in the area. By 1999 it was the only active forest service lookout tower in the Kamloops fire district, and the last time it was used was during the 2003 wildfire in the Cornwall Hills.</p><p>Fire lookout towers are popular not only with 4X4 enthusiasts, but with hikers, geocachers, snowmobilers, and history buffs, among others. Information about lookout locations, as well as lots of pictures of the lookouts and the views from them, can be found on the BC Forest Fire Lookouts Facebook page.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@accjournal.ca\">editorial@accjournal.ca</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2022 Ashcroft Cache Creek Journal</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASHCCJ-news20220921PAS4374739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASHCCJ2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66FH-YWS1-JD2C-J35W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Court of Appeal upheld a decision of the B.C. Supreme Court (BCSC) that the case can proceed to a trial.</p><p>A class action is a lawsuit started by one person on behalf of members of a group that have a similar claim against a single person or company. Before a court will take on a class action, a judge must certify that it meets the multiple rules set out in the Class Proceedings Act.</p><p>In this case, according to Kirk\u2019s lawyer David Rosenberg, the class consists of 2,776 property owners within the zone that was evacuated after the fuel spill, plus anyone who rented, leased or carried on a business within that zone. These people are not individually named in the court action, and most of them have not actually put their names forward and may not know they are part of the group.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t even have to think about it if they don\u2019t want to,\u201d Rosenberg says. \u201cThey can sit back and wait.\u201d</p><p>They would each get a share of any monetary damages that may be awarded by the court. Anyone who suffered damages that they think are extraordinary, above and beyond the average, can come forward later and declare this, Rosenberg says.</p><p>In the summer of 2013, Executive Flight Centre Fuel Services Ltd.was providing fuel to the provincial government to fight a forest fire in the area of Lemon Creek in the Slocan Valley. Its tanker truck overturned and spilled 35,000 litres of jet fuel into the creek, polluting the stream and causing a local evacuation of people living up to 40 kilometres downstream in the Slocan Valley.</p><p>The spill killed fish and forced residents to get alternate sources of drinking water for themselves and livestock for days.</p><p>The trial will determine who was at fault for the spill and how much should be paid to the members of the class action group.</p><p>The delay In 2017, a judge of the BCSC certified that Kirk\u2019s class action could proceed.</p><p>The defendants \u2013 Executive Flight Centre, the Province of B.C. , Transwest Helicopters, and the fuel truck driver Danny LaSante \u2014 appealed that decision to the B.C. Court of Appeal.</p><p>The appeal judges said that before the action could be certified, the BCSC judge must clarify certain complex issues related to evidence. The BCSC judge did that, and then re-certified the case as a class action.</p><p>The defendants then appealed that decision to the appeal court, whose judges have now ruled again in favour of Kirk.</p><p>David Rosenberg, Kirk\u2019s Vancouver lawyer, says he expects there will be a trial within a year, in B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver.</p><p>He added that although class actions typically take a long time, the delays in this one have been extraordinary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for over 40 years \u2014 I do a lot of class action work \u2014 and I have never before seen a certification, then a de-certification, recertification, and two appeals on a certification.\u201d</p><p>He said for a class action on an environmental issue to be certified is unusual.</p><p>\u201cThe courts have not been that amenable to environmental class actions,\u201d he says.</p><p>The issues The issues that were argued in the appeals are referred to as nuisance and aggregate damages, which are far more complex than the following two-paragraph summary.</p><p>Did the people affected by the spill suffer nuisance in common, as well as individually? If so, this is one basis for a class action. Did the group suffer monetary damages in common, as well as individually? If yes, this is another basis.</p><p>Nuisance and damages in this case refer not only to contamination of water from the spill but the inconvenience caused by the evacuation order and water-use restrictions that were imposed by the province, Rosenberg says.</p><p>The Nelson Star reached out to the Ministry of Attorney General for comment on this decision, with no response. Executive Flight Centre had not responded to a request for comment by the Nelson Star\u2019s press deadline on Jan. 24.</p><p>Charges under the Fisheries Act The defendants were also charged under the Fisheries Act with polluting a stream frequented by fish. Those charges were entirely separate from Kirk\u2019s class action lawsuit.</p><p>In February, 2020, as a result of the Fisheries Act charges, Executive Flight Centre was fined $175,000 and the fuel truck driver Danny LaSante was fined $20,000. The provincial government was acquitted.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20230126PRAA0003303423</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67DG-NF81-JD2C-J16C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

In the previous assembly alone, Thompson says he worked on more than 1,000 constituent issues, made 53 minister's statements and 102 member statements, and was absent for just five days of work in four years. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thompson says, if re-elected, he will focus his efforts on completing the Mackenzie Valley Highway, addressing the high cost of medical travel, and continuing to work with government bodies and residents to help solve problems. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a speech last month, Thompson set out some of the changes he hopes to see in the 20th Assembly. </p><p>Other candidates running for the seat include Sharon Allen, Josh Campbell, Mavis Cli-Michaud, Hillary Deneron and Leslie Wright. </p><p>This interview was recorded on October 18, 2023. The transcript has been lightly edited for clarity. </p><p>Simona Rosenfield: In a speech earlier this month, you spoke to some issues that you hope the next assembly will address, including budget reform, Indigenous relations, resource management, medical travel, and expanding infrastructure. Of all these changes, what would you prioritize if you were re-elected? </p><p>Shane Thompson: If you look at the infrastructure projects, to me, we need to focus on the Mackenzie Valley Highway. That needs to be done. That there would connect us from the rest of the territory, right? So, we need to get that done. But we need to make sure we go all the way up and we just don't stop in the Sahtu, so it connects all those communities, gives us another avenue for tourism, exploration, gives people employment.  </p><p>If we focus on that and get that done, I think there would be a big benefit to the whole Northwest Territories. When you look at medical travel, you look at medevacs, right now, medical travel, Indigenous Services Canada \u2013 they're only giving the Government of the Northwest Territories small portions of the total cost. If you look at medical travel and how expensive it is, the federal government is not taking responsibility for its Indigenous relationships, the territorial government is providing that service for them. But we're only getting a small part of the money, which puts a huge deficit into some of the things that we're trying to achieve. That needs to be addressed. If we don't address that, we're going to keep on seeing huge, huge deficits, and we're not going to be able to provide better service for our residents. </p><p>There's a difference between people that work for the government and for normal residents. If we can get the federal government to actually cover the costs that they're supposed to be covering, then we can then look at how we help our residents, whether it's the per diems or accommodations and that. Because right now, it's $50 a day, $18 for food. Nowhere can you find accommodations or food for that kind of dime. I know people stay in boarding homes and stuff like that, but sometimes it's not convenient for them. And so these are some of the challenges there. </p><p>You look at medevacs. You know, I've heard horror stories. I just was visiting a constituent last night \u2013 40 hours that him and his wife waited for a medevac and she was almost dying, and it was 40 hours. We need to look at the medevac services, but then also regional airlines that can get them to regional centres where we have better medical services. We need to look at additional aircraft because if you're looking at 40 hours or 14 hours \u2013 that's life and death. We need to be looking at that. What is the value of a person's life? And to me, money is not the object here. So, we need to look at that. </p><p>The other thing is we need to look at how we do our emergency management. The last three years, we've seen years of floods. Now we've seen a really bad forest fire season. We need to work with the municipal governments to come up with their emergency plans, give them the tools and give them the capacity to do these things, as well as the Government of the Northwest Territories. We need to work at those things there. </p><p>Those are three things, but there are other things that can be done. </p><p>Q: In an interview with Cabin Radio during the last territorial election, you made a commitment to fix problems by \u201cworking with the bureaucracy to streamline things.\u201d What steps did you take to streamline things within the government, to solve problems for residents in your district? </p><p>A: What we were able to do is that \u2013 I don't know if you've seen my letter saying that I was running \u2013 I had over 1,000 BFs [bring forwards, a type of internal GNWT process] that I had to deal with. But there was also the ability to work with the bureaucracy within the riding. So, sometimes it was reaching out to the bureaucracy and saying: \"Hey, is this something that you guys can deal with? Or is it something that I've got to take to the minister?\" It was, again, connecting our residents with the departments, the organizations, to see the work that can be done. So we were able to achieve that. But there were still 1,000 BFs that we had to take, that we had to bring forward to the ministers to get it done. And so it was about connecting the residents with the departments, having those conversations, meeting with the councils and leadership, bringing in the ministers, but also sometimes being able to bring in departmental staff to come in and have conversations with the leadership and with the residents. </p><p>We were able to connect those things. We still need to go a long way. But it\u2019s just work that needs to be done and it needs to be done on a consistent basis. Sometimes, I call it the up-and-over approach: if they bring it to me then I've got to bring it to the minister, the minister\u2019s got to take it to the department, the department has to take it back to \u2013 say in Fort Simpson \u2013 and it comes back all the way over. But if I can connect the constituent and the person that's making decisions, with the answers and that, that makes things quicker. But sometimes there are policies and procedures that require it to go through the political route. So, we do that. Was it perfect? No, but it was way better than the 18th Assembly. And again, if I get re-elected, it's something that I will continue to do in the 20th Assembly. </p><p>Q: What progress have you made on issues that communities in your district have brought forward?  </p><p>A: Oh, that is a loaded question. Like I mean, that there \u2013 if you look at the education system in itself, that there, basically, the education system, the way it is set up, it is actually DEAs [district education authorities] and DECs divisional education councils that make those decisions. Like, the minister doesn't have that role as in to direct them and to, you know, have the bureaucracy work towards it. We have a relationship. So, we were bringing forth issues to the minister, then meeting with the DECs to have those conversations on how to improve things. </p><p>You know, you look at the health and social services, again, NTHSSA, they report to a board, so even that there required us to go from myself to the minister to the board. So, sometimes it was working with the constituent, with the board, to reach out to the various quality control people working there. Some of the things that we were able to achieve? The maintenance on the highway, the roads there, the winter roads, getting the work done there, making sure concerns are brought to the ministers to get deals fixed. This assembly we're seeing more housing going into these communities, whether it's through Housing NWT or local Indigenous governments. Like here in Fort Liard, where I'm visiting right now, they're working on some duplexes and fourplexes. Nahanni Butte\u2019s got seven units going in, Sambaa K\u2019e has already got two. So, those are some of those things that we're able to achieve, but again, it's collaboratively working with the community, the leadership, and the governments to achieve those things.  </p><p>Q: This summer was the worst fire season in the NWT's recorded history, which prompted a territory-wide state of emergency. As minister of environment and communities, you were in charge of the department responsible for emergency management. Some members of the public have criticized the government for its poor communication at this crucial time. Can you explain your track record throughout the fire season, from the evacuations to communication with public and now in the aftermath? </p><p>A: Well, first and foremost, there are going to be people criticizing that. We get over 400 \u2013 if you look at Mike Westwick \u2013 we had over 456 communications, like daily updates. We had that, we had our websites there, we had communications to the leadership of the affected communities, we had the information to the MLAs. So, we were able to get that information out there. Could we do more? Well, for some people, yes, we could do more. But I guess my biggest challenge is that, you know, we were able to get a lot of information out there but people were saying, well, it wasn't on one page. And then when we put it on one page, people were saying: well, we needed it specifically to certain areas here. So, you know, again, it was dealing with a response to that but, at the same time, making sure the communications went out. </p><p>Yes, it was the worst fire season ever. But the thing is, we brought in retired firefighters that had 30-40 years of experience to help us go with this. We brought in people, incident commanders and support staff and wildfire type one firefighters from across Canada and internationally to help us. And everyone that I had the opportunity to talk to said how difficult the situation was, that the fires were reacting differently than they've ever seen. And so they had to come up with a different approach to do it. </p><p>The biggest thing I think is that we saw a lot of negativity, but we didn't see a lot of success stories out there, people talking about that. We were able to evacuate 19,000 people in 48 hours from the City of Yellowknife. We were able to do that as quickly and as efficiently as we could. Yeah, we had little hiccups on the first day, but we were able to evacuate 19,000. The question people ask: well, why 48 hours? Well, we were given a window of opportunity and we then looked at the window, and we were able to achieve that. There's an author out there that talked about the Fort McMurray fire, and they talk about how we responded compared to that city. And they said they're going to look at how we did it as a case study because we were able to do it more efficiently, more effectively. </p><p>And again, it came down to a team approach. When I say a team approach, it comes down to the normal citizens, to the airlines, to all that we were able to succeed. The other thing is that if I had 24 hours or 48 hours, I can guarantee you, it would have been great for Hay River because they were in a situation where we saw some very difficult situations, where 12 vehicles got burned. I heard horror stories of people phoning their parents saying: \"This might be the last time you hear my voice, I just wanted to tell you I love you.\" </p><p>These are some of the things that we look at. Critics out there, yes, we have that opportunity, and that's why we're doing a third-party review of things. The saddest part is we lost a firefighter and three other firefighters got injured. These people are putting their lives on the line to help people. With the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs, we were evacuating and working with the Alberta government with 70 percent of our population. </p><p>Health and Social Services did a great job of evacuating the Stanton hospital. Plus they also had 60 residents from long-term care from Hay River and Fort Smith that they had to look after. So, again, when you look at it, disasters, you have to respond to it as quickly and as efficiently as we can. But I had lots of people on the street send me emails saying thank you. Thank you for looking after us. Thank you for doing what was right, and to taking the high road and trying to get information to us. </p><p>And so, again, do we need to fix it? Do we need to improve on things? Yes. If I said no, then to me, I just wouldn't be doing a great job. But I come from a sports and recreation background. Every event you need to plan, and then you need to replan, and you adapt to it. And then after it\u2019s done, you've got to do a review of it, and that\u2019s what we're doing through Maca. We're doing an independent third-party review. ECC is doing the same thing. We're doing chapters for each community that was impacted, then we're going to do a global one for all the Northwest Territories. We're going to be doing the work that needs to be done. And the public is going to get the opportunity to say how they can see things be improved. </p><p>At the end of the day, I would say we were successful. There were some hiccups, there were some challenges, there were some issues in our host provinces down there, but we have to work with how they operate. Whereas we do facilities like arenas and gyms \u2013 and that's where we put most people \u2013 down there in Alberta, and Manitoba, they put them in hotels. Those are some of the things that we need to work on. How do we better prepare? But I think I answered the question previously, that's part of the work that needs to be done with the emergency management team, whether it's local, regional or territorial, to get better support to our residents. </p><p>And again, it starts down at the very person, you as an individual. I had the mayor of Hay River talk about when they evacuated the community. She just got into town. She filled up her vehicle before because she knew that she may have to leave. When she went into the meeting, she already knew that if she had to leave, she was prepared. It starts with an individual, and an individual community, and then regional, and then territorial. </p><p>Q: Last question. Can you briefly share what makes you the best candidate for this position? </p><p>A: Well, first and foremost, it's the residents. The residents decide who's the best candidate. Each one that put your name forward think they're the best candidate, because if they didn't, they wouldn't put their name forward. So, for me, personally, I've had eight years\u2019 experience. It's about the people. I\u2019ve always said that to people. It's a job. You need to realize that your phone's going to ring at 2am, 3am, 4am in the morning. You need to answer and you need to be able to work for the residents. You have to have conversations with people, you need to talk to them. </p><p>That's always been my process. That's how I lived my life, whether it was in the sport and recreation world, as a coach, as a volunteer. You need to be able to work with people and have conversations. But you also have to have a little bit thicker skin because people are going to say negativity, the press has a way of doing things, always spin some things \u2013 not Cabin Radio \u2013 but some others spin things to have negativity all the time. There's people out there on Facebook. You're going to see those things. You're going to have to have thick skin to move forward. </p><p>But at the end of the day, you\u2019ve got to realize the job is for the residents of the Northwest Territories. When I first got in, I was told: you're going learn to pick your battles. But after dealing with my first constituent issue, I realized it wasn't about me. It's about the resident. So every time residents come forward, you need to represent them as your most important issue. So every time that a constituent brings an issue forward, you bring it to either the local level, to the regional level, or to the minister's level, but you need to fight for them. You need to do it. Sometimes you're going to win, sometimes you're going to lose. Sometimes you make smart, small changes, but you need to represent the people as best you can. </p><p>So, I've done that for eight years. If you look at my attendance in 18th Assembly and my attendance in this assembly, I missed four sessions this assembly, but that was due to my ministerial role and travelling. You also see how many minister's statements I did, but also member statements. I was an anomaly. I was the one of the ministers that you actually see, you know, stand up and do statements. Yes, there were eulogies but there were celebrations, there were success stories that you had to do. As a minister, you don't get to pick the issues. That's your job as an MLA behind the scenes. So, my track record speaks for itself. I said: here it is. If you're not happy with me, you have alternatives. So I just wish people all the best \u2013 and get people to vote. </p><p>Asked to declare any outstanding lawsuits, debts or other issues that might form a conflict if elected, the candidate said there were none.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-0b2d6286bd4749fb9d2e6782ad14454d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69MD-2431-DY9S-T3JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2792\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 12, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp; ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001914</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000218</classCode><className>BUDGETS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS172</classCode><className>NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

By ensuring community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response, airports contribute to keeping Canadians safe and connected from coast to coast to coast. Canadians rely on safe and well-maintained local and regional airports to support vibrant communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at local and regional airports in Manitoba.</p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program, 15 airports in Manitoba will receive over $5.1 million from the Government of Canada for projects and equipment that will help maintain safe airport operations for passengers, crews, and airport workers. The airports receiving funding are:</p><p>Berens River to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000Bloodvein Riverto purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000Flin Flon to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000Gods Lake Narrows to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000Norway Houseto purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000Oxford Houseto purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000Pukatawaganto purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000Red Sucker Lake to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000South Indian Lake to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000St. Andrewsto purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000St. Theresa Point to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000Tadoule Lake to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000The Pas/Grace Laketo purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000Thompsonto purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000York Landingto purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>The equipment will be used in maintaining aircraft movement surfaces and the removal and control of ice and snow from airside surfaces such as runways, taxiways and the apron. For airports with a gravel runway, a compactor is used to compress the gravel on the runway, creating a stable surface for safe landing and takeoff operations. The wildlife fencing will keep large mammals away from secure airfield areas.</p><p>This funding is in addition to the more than $20.8 million provided under the Program in 2021 to support safety-related projects at the Flin Flon, Gods Lake Narrows, Lac Brochet, Red Sucker Lake, Shamattawa, and Thompson airports.</p><p> Quotes</p><p>\"Airports play a crucial role in keeping Canadians connected across our vast country, and the last two years have only underscored this. Today's investment of over $5.1 million for 15 airports across Manitoba is great news for the region's air sector and for the communities these airports serve. Investments like these will ensure that our air sector comes out strong as we enter post-pandemic recovery, and help us keep our commitment to building safer, stronger communities.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar AlghabraMinister of Transport</p><p>\"Our regional airports here in Manitoba keep communities connected and ensure vital supply chains are maintained. The new equipment being used will ensure our airports are safe for travelers, staff, air crew and residents. Our government will continue to be there to support operations at local and regional airports with these important investments, creating economic opportunity, connecting families and friends, and improving the quality of life for all Manitobans.\"</p><p>The Honourable Daniel VandalMinister of Northern Affairs, Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada and Minister responsible for the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency</p><p> Quick Factsto purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000Associated Linkto purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>Transport Canada is online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tc.gc.ca\">www.tc.gc.ca</url>.

More than half of them are out of control. Meanwhile, millions of people in North America have been advised to wear masks outdoors due to poor air quality levels from the smoke. In New York today, the city is registering the worst air quality in the world. The smoke is also expected to reach as far as Norway today. The United States in response has sent hundreds of fire fighters and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says the president has offered whatever additional help Canada needs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KARINE JEAN-PIERRE (White House Press Secretary): Our team here at the White House is in touch with the government of Canada. We have already deployed over 600 US fire fighters and personnel, as well as equipment like water bombers to help Canada battle the fires.</p><p>NAPIER: There are now nearly a thousand fire fighters from the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa helping to battle the blazes. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Twitter last night thanked President Biden for his critical support. He also blamed the historic start to wildfire season on climate change, saying, quote, \"We'll keep working here at home and with partners around the world to tackle climate change and address its impacts.\" Meanwhile, the front page of the New York Post today says to blame Canada for what it's calling the apocalypse. Joining me now from Washington is Jaelith Hall-Rivera, the US Forest Service Deputy Chief of State and Private Forestry. Jaelith, thanks so much for taking the time and for being there. This is absolutely a huge story here in Canada. There are in all a thousand fire fighters that have come from outside of our country, 600 from the United States. Is that enough from what you can see about what's going on here, would that seem to you to be enough help for what Canada is going through?</p><p>JAELITH HALL-RIVERA (US Forest Service Deputy Chief): Yeah, well, thank you for that question, and I just want to say first of all that we're happy to be there supporting you all. We are partners, we've been partners for over 50 years in the wildfire space, and Canada has helped us many, many times, so we are happy to return the favour and for it to be our turn to send resources there. We have some requests in even now for more resources to go to Quebec in particular, and we're working to fill those, but I would suspect that we are going to continue to get requests in. I think you all are going to need some more support and some more personnel there, and we're going to work through and fill those as best we can.</p><p>NAPIER: Tell us what kind of tools of planes or fire fighting tools are your fire fighters coming to Canada with?</p><p>HALL-RIVERA: We've sent mostly what I would say are ground-based forces, so people that are out there on the fire line doing that work. Those are the folks that we have sent now. We have sent some equipment as well, and I would expect that we may be seeing some additional requests for aircraft. I would expect those to be coming in as well.</p><p>NAPIER: Today your president, Joe Biden, spoke of an interagency fire response centre. So give us an idea of what is this agency, and how is it working, how is it deployed?</p><p>HALL-RIVERA: Well, as we're seeing right now, fire doesn't know any boundaries, right, and that's certainly true between Canada and the US right now, and it's true throughout the United States as well. So we have an interagency fire centre in Boise, Idaho. We have representatives from the USDA Forest Service, the Department of the Interior, our state forestry agencies, US Fire Administration and others there. They work together to prioritize all of our resources in the country, and move them around, especially when we have a very busy fire season. In a situation like now where we are providing support to Canada, that is centred out of the National Interagency fire centre in Boise, Idaho.</p><p>NAPIER: When you look at what's going on in Canada, these forest fires are unprecedented, they're historic, it's early in the season, what did you think when you first started seeing this? Were you going, oh, this may be happening in the United States eventually?</p><p>HALL-RIVERA: Yeah, we certainly have some concern that we'll see this lack of moisture and dry now, especially in parts of our western United States, and we're seeing that potential actually even in some of our eastern and upper northeastern states, which is a little unusual for us. We do have predictive services, which is also part of our interagency centre in Boise. They put out a map every month, and that just came out in June, and we're seeing those hotter drier conditions across some parts of the west, the upper Midwest and the northeast right now. So we expect we will see some of this, some of what you all are experiencing here in Canada. I don't think it will be as widespread or unprecedented as what you all are currently experiencing, though.</p><p>NAPIER: So, you know, here it's the worst fire season ever, and also probably one of the earliest, but some environmentalists are already saying it will be, this will be the new normal. Is that what you're seeing, or is that something that you fear over there?</p><p>HALL RIVERA: Yes, that is something we get concerned about. With the impacts of climate change, we are in a new normal. We're in a new normal everywhere in North America, and frankly globally when it comes to fire. We have longer fire seasons. In fact in the US, we have just started calling it a fire year. We have fires almost every month of the year here, and they are larger, more difficult to control, and stay on the landscape longer. So, yes, we are in a new normal, and we have to all work together to make sure that we can manage our forests so that we can get them to a place where this is not our new normal, where they can accept fire in a healthier way.</p><p>NAPIER: Okay, so some of the smoke has reached parts of the United States. I'm thinking of New York, you know, where the mayor of New York is actually giving people N-95 masks and, you know, Washington, DC, as well out of parts of New Jersey. When you see this, have you ever seen this before?</p><p>HALL-RIVERA: I have not ever seen this before. I personally live in Washington, DC, so I am experiencing this right now. I have not seen this level of impact on the eastern seaboard. But let me just say, we have impacts like this in our western United States and some of our larger cities like Seattle, Washington, Denver, Colorado, Salt Lake City, Utah, Missoula, Montana, they may see air quality like this for weeks at a time in the summer in the west, so it's not unheard of, it's just almost never an impact around the northeastern United States, or on the eastern seaboard like this.</p><p>NAPIER: Yeah, it's going to be quite a season. Jaelith Hall-Rivera, the US Forest Service Deputy Chief of State and Private Forestry, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to us.</p><p>HALL-RIVERA: Thank you.</p><p>NAPIER: And coming up, the feds have put up money for a national registry of physicians. We have more on that and a roundup of today's other top political stories next in the list. Don't go away. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68NP-B4V1-JCF0-K1SW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1223\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CTV Televisions, Inc.

Yes, I know they tell you not to exercise too much outside when the air is full of ozone, but in my defence, life is short, and there are only so many summer days.</p><p>But as I got away from the urban areas, and the air cleared somewhat thanks to sea breezes, it got me thinking about the future.</p><p>Hopefully, for once.</p><p>It\u2019s easy to be fairly gloomy when I compare the way things are now with the way they were when I was a kid. Climate change has ramped up sharply during my lifetime.</p><p>It used to be that anything over 30\u00b0 Celsius was a headline grabbing heatwave, but after last year\u2019s heat dome, and temperatures in the high 30s to 40s, we more or less shrug at day after day of high temperatures.</p><p>Air quality, too, can be considerably worse than when I was a kid. For one thing, we didn\u2019t have regular \u201cforest fire seasons\u201d two years out of three that periodically blotted out of the sky with a grimy orange-grey haze, and made everything smell faintly like an old campfire pit.</p><p>We\u2019ve also roughly doubled the population of Metro Vancouver since I was born.</p><p>Although cars are a lot more fuel efficient now than they were then, that\u2019s still a lot more cars and trucks and buses, belching a lot more exhaust into the air.</p><p>It\u2019s that kind of pollution that caused our air-quality warnings earlier this summer.</p><p>All that pollution turns into ozone and haze and gunk that lingers for days, especially if the air is still.</p><p>But, things are looking up. Just five or six years ago, if you saw a Tesla or a Chevy Bolt while you were out for a drive, it was worth turning your head.</p><p>They were rare birds, those humming little electric vehicles.</p><p>Now Teslas are among the most common cars on the roads, not to mention the Bolts, Kia Souls, Ioniqs and half a dozen other brands.</p><p>Soon we\u2019ll start seeing the electric pickups and TransLink and the various school districts will be pitching in with their electric buses, too.</p><p>We already have mostly clean power generation here in B.C. , and with the possibility of offshore and onshore wind power to supplement us in the future, there\u2019s not reason to think that won\u2019t continue.</p><p>So within a few years, we\u2019ll hit a tipping point here in the Lower Mainland.</p><p>The number of internal combustion engines will peak, and start to decline.</p><p>The decline will be faster than anyone thinks is possible. The transition will be weird, as gas stations close down and consolidate, and we frantically build charging stations.</p><p>But a few years into it, we\u2019ll notice that the sky looks different. Especially in the summer, there\u2019ll be less of that annoying haze. It\u2019ll be brighter on clear days, and the air will smell better.</p><p>Even in downtown areas, the roads will be quieter, and there won\u2019t be clouds of fumes coming off the streets.</p><p>I\u2019m really looking forward to the tipping point.</p><p>Matthew Claxton is a reporter with the Langley Advance Times, sister paper to the Peace Arch News.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PEANWS-news20220915PRPA0002981893</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PEANWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66D2-5HC1-F0HF-81PC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"494\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

The 2023 drill program to date has focused on the continued expansion of the Hinge Target located immediately west of the Eau Claire Deposit with the goal of updating the Eau Claire Mineral Resource Estimate at the end of the season. Drilling at the Hinge Target continues to return multiple stacked zones of gold mineralization from each drill hole including 5.0 metres (m) of 3.6 g/t Au within a broader interval of 14.0m of 2.37 g/t Au. Additional drill intercepts include 6.5m of 2.66 g/t Au, 6.0m of 2.77 g/t Au and 1.0m of 10.35 g/t Au (Table 1; Figure 1).</p><p>Drill holes 23EC-063 and 23EC-064 have expanded the Hinge Target gold mineralization 50m up-dip and 75m to the west respectively. Drill hole 23EC-064 represents the first of a series of infill drill holes designed to tighten up the spacing of the 2022 Hinge Target drilling to a nominal spacing of 60-80m. Importantly, the broad intercepts of 14.0m of 2.37 g/t Au, 6.0m of 2.77 g/t Au and 6.5m of 2.66 g/t Au continue to show the overall strength of the mineralized system within the Hinge Target.</p><p>These initial results provide confidence in the modeled sub-vertical geometry of the veining at the Hinge Target as the Company works towards a meaningful update to the currently defined Eau Claire Resource which was last estimated in 2018 at 853,000 ounces (oz) gold at an average grade of 6.18 g/t gold in the Measured and Indicated Category and 500,000 oz gold at 6.35 g/t gold in the inferred category1.</p><p>\"Fury is pleased to announce the initial drill results from our 2023 drill program at Eau Claire, as these results further confirm our thesis that the Eau Claire resource is open for significant expansion. Importantly, we have continued to extend the mineralized footprint at the Hinge Target and confirmed our geologic model,\" commented Tim Clark, CEO of Fury. \"The results of the first three 2023 drill holes at Eau Claire are also important as we prepare for our resource update at year-end. As for the impact of the forest fire, we had a four-week hold on operations, but we are now actively drilling at full capacity with a helicopter and two drills turning on the property. Investors should expect a steady flow of news through year-end from Eau Claire, Percival, and a number of strong prospective anomalies to the east. With a recent directors and management site visit behind us, the three takeaways were: the reminder of the incredible infrastructure backdrop that exists in the James Bay region, the visual size and scale of the Eau Claire project today, and the tremendous potential for discovery surrounding the 30 kilometres of the Cannard Deformation Zone.\"</p><p>Table 1: Eau Claire Drill Results //st Hole ID From To Length (m) Au g/t 23EC-062 451 452 1.00 10.35 467 469 2.00 4.89 493 507 14.00 2.37 Incl. 499 504 5.00 3.60 577.5 578 0.50 4.32 581.5 582.5 1.00 4.97 591 592 1.00 2.48 622 628 6.00 2.77 Incl. 622 623 1.00 7.61 637.5 639 1.50 1.76 667.5 669 1.50 1.47 677 680 3.00 1.90 693 695 2.00 1.11 23EC-063 417 418.5 1.50 3.63 481 482 1.00 5.44 488.5 489.5 1.00 2.65 496 497 1.00 6.67 529 531.5 2.50 2.67 603 604.5 1.50 1.97 656 658 2.00 1.45 667 668.5 1.50 2.09 684.5 691 6.50 2.66 Incl. 688 689.5 1.50 5.49 708 719 11.00 1.23 23EC-064 402 404 2.00 3.80 503.5 504.5 1.00 2.82 589.5 592.5 3.00 2.64 622.5 623.5 1.00 2.63 644.5 647.5 3.00 3.03 672 673 1.00 9.31 740 741 1.00 2.50 749.5 757 7.50 1.30 Main intervals - Au grade*thickness no less than 2 g/t*m with grade is no less than 1 g/t, maximum consecutive dilution 2m Sub-intervals - Au grade*thickness no less than 7 g/t*m with grade is no less than 3.5 g/t, maximum consecutive dilution 2m Downhole thickness was used due to the unknown zone orientations</p><p>Western Hinge Target</p><p>The 2023 exploration program at the Hinge Target is focusing on the continued expansion of the gold mineralization to the west and up-dip while tightening up the drill spacing to 70-80m to prove continuity. The reported intercepts at the Hinge Target are defined by two 100m wide corridors of mineralization each hosting multiple subvertical quartz tourmaline veins (Figure 2). A total of nineteen discrete veins have been modeled within the two corridors to date. The Hinge Target remains open in all directions.</p><p>\"The results from these first three 2023 drill holes build on the 2022 success at the Hinge Target. We have confirmed both continuity of the vein corridors as well as that the system remains open. The broad widths of mineralization, which we do not see typically within the core of the deposit, indicate the mineralization event at the Hinge Target was particularly intense. We look forward to additional results as the drill moves east towards the defined Eau Claire resource,\" stated Bryan Atkinson, SVP, Exploration of Fury. Figure 1: Eau Claire Resource Long Section Looking North showing the location of the reported drill intercepts and the overall scale potential of the Hinge Target. Figure 2: Cross Section of the Hinge Target Looking West, showing the multiple stacked sub-vertical veins.</p><p>Sampling and Assaying Disclosure</p><p>Analytical samples for the Drill Program were taken by sawing HQ diameter core into equal halves on site with one half sent to ALS Chemex in Val D'or, Quebec, Canada for preparation and analysis. All samples were assayed using a 50 g nominal weight fire assay with inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectrometry finish (Au-ICP22) and multi-element four acid digest ICP-AES/ICP-MS method (ME-MS61). Where Au-ICP22 results were greater than 0.5 ppm Au the assay was repeated with a 50 g nominal weight fire assay with atomic absorption finish (Au-AA24). Samples containing more than 10 ppm by Au-AA24 were re-assayed with 50 g nominal weight fire assay with gravimetric finish (Au-GRA22). QA/QC programs using internal standard samples, field and lab duplicates and blanks indicate good overall accuracy and precision.</p><p>1 See the technical report entitled \"Technical Report, Updated Mineral Resource Estimate and Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Eau Claire Gold Deposit, Clearwater Property, Quebec, Canada\" (the \"Eau Claire Report\") dated effective February 4, 2018, prepared by Eugene Puritch, P.Eng., FEC, CET, Antoine Yassa, P.Geo., Andrew Bradfield, P.Eng., Allan Armitage, Ph.D., P.Geo., which can be found on the Company's profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>.</p><p>David Rivard, P.Geo, Exploration Manager at Fury, is a \"qualified person\" within the meaning of Canadian mineral projects disclosure standards instrument 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical disclosures in this press release.</p><p>About Fury Gold Mines Limited</p><p>Fury Gold Mines Limited is a well-financed Canadian-focused exploration company positioned in two prolific mining regions across Canada and holds a 59.5 million common share position in Dolly Varden Silver Corp (23.4%).

In 2022, countries across the globe were hit hard with deadly natural disasters that claimed lives and caused extensive damage. The climate carnage is number 6 in our top ten stories of the year. With more, here's CTV's Atlantic bureau chief, Creeson Agecoutay.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CREESON AGECOUTAY (Reporter): 2022 was another reminder of the planet in dire distress, as climate change continues to devastate so many lives. Somalia suffered the worst drought in 40 years. Livestock are dying and now more than 4.3 million are in need of food and safe drinking water.</p><p>MOHAMED FALL (Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa): This should be a global concern because climate change is not the responsibility of one country.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: Hundreds of wildlife in Kenya have also died from the heat, including this elephant that was shot after it killed a woman while desperately looking for water. In South Africa, flash flooding killed more than 400 people, and left tens of thousands more, homeless. And in Pakistan, flooding there has created an economic crisis killing hundreds and causing $32 billion in damages.</p><p>SHEHBAZ SHARIF (Pakistan Prime Minister): And millions of people are going to into winter without shelter.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: Dangerous heatwaves caused a national emergency in Britain closing airport and train services.</p><p>PENELOPE ENDERSBY (UK Met Office CEO): This weather is absolutely unprecedented. We have never seen anything like these temperatures in our models before.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: Spain and Portugal set a new July record of 47 degrees, which sparked out of control wildfires. This man nearly lost his life while trying to protect his town. High winds were also the issue in Atlantic Canada.</p><p>DENNIS KING (PEI Premier): The devastation looks to be beyond anything that we have witnessed before.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: Hurricane Fiona threw homes into the ocean, snapped thousands of trees, and knocked out power for weeks.</p><p>TODD MARSHALL (Resident): I saw four or five buildings float past while we were trying to deal with this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It's heartbreaking this devastation.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: So far, Fiona has caused $660 million in damage, making it the most costly extreme weather event ever recorded in the region.</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): The reality is, with climate change, there are going to be more extreme weather events with a greater intensity.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: In Puerto Rico, that same storm caused $2 billion in damages and left millions without power.</p><p>JOE BIDEN (US President): I'm determined to help Puerto Rico build faster than in the past, and stronger and better prepared for the future.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: In the spring, Ontario saw winds reach up to 195 kilometres, killing 11 people. It was later confirmed an EF-2 tornado caused the damage. This massive tree came crashing down where this woman's daughter was sitting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I've never thought I was going to go through this in the life. Never.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: Manitoba saw the third highest snowfall since 1872 leaving rivers to overflow with homes looking like islands on the prairies. Forty-five municipalities and nine First Nations all declared a state of emergency.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: It's just too much rain and it's too much moisture. We don't need it.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: In the US, a 23-year drought dried out more farmlands.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Oh, no.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Wow.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: And brought more wildfires to people's doorsteps, like here in Arizona.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: This was taken at 12:25 p.m. You can see 12:28, that's three minutes later.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It happened so fast.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: To see like everything burned is just very traumatic.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: At COP15 in Montreal, countries agreed to protect 30 percent of land and water by 2030.</p><p>BASILE VAN HAVRE (CEO Open Ended Working Group Co-Chair): We would have accomplished everything that is in this agreement; it will be a very different planet. And, and it's going to be a major change.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: But leaders struggled on what protection looks like and who will pay for it. Drastic change is needed quickly as experts are predicting another dry year.</p><p>DAVID PHILLIPS (Environment Canada Senior Climatologist): That worries me because, you know, that often gives you a sense of what the forest fire season's going to be like, what growing's going to be like.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: Creeson Agecoutay, CTV News, Halifax.</p><p>MALBON: And after the break, the bear facts of one of our most visual stories of the year.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6761-2CR1-DYX2-91XJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 CTV Televisions, Inc.

VoyentAlert! is an app you can download to your phone, and once installed, will provide emergency updates to residents. </p><p>It\u2019s very similar to the Amber Alerts one receives, although these notifications will be specific to Callander. For instance, if a wild winter storm closes Main, residents with the app will receive a notification, and be able to plan a detour. If a forest fire is fast approaching, or Callander Creek floods again, notice will arrive via your cell phone. </p><p>See: Early morning flood rips down Callander Creek </p><p>VoyentAlert! is produced by Ice Soft Technologies, a Calgary based company that provides the app to many municipalities across the country. After all, as they explain on their website, \u201ccitizens rely on you to provide the most accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information about the issues and incidents that impact their daily lives,\u201d with the \u201cyou\u201d referring to the municipality. </p><p>Callander\u2019s mayor, Robb Noon, is looking forward to implementing the app. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to contact everyone who signs up on the list in case of emergencies\u201d he said, \u201cand the message will be delivered to everybody.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll also be able to use it for other announcements, like FunFest,\u201d the mayor said. Rest assured, the municipality does not plan to overuse the app, and plan to go easy on the messages. At its next meeting on July 26th, council will discuss the appropriate use of the technology and include those parameters in the town\u2019s communications policy. </p><p>Callander\u2019s senior municipal director, Ashley Bilodeau, mentioned that after launching the app, there will be options for residents to sign up for different types of announcements. For instance, you will receive the emergency responses upon installing the app, but if you want additional announcements that might concern garbage pick up delays, or that it\u2019s about time to register your float for FunFest, you can opt into those as well. </p><p>\u201cAll of the public service announcements\u201d could be at your fingers, \u201cbut we don\u2019t want to use it too much so that people opt out,\u201d Noon said. \u201cWe\u2019ll come up with the right policy to make sure that we\u2019re not bugging people\u201d who sign up. </p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s going to be a great tool for us to help get messages out there\u201d to the people, Noon explained. </p><p>David Briggs is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of BayToday, a publication of Village Media.

Let's take a listen in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DANIELLE SMITH (Alberta Premier): Joining us is Paul Winnick, the deputy minister of health. He's available to answer technical questions on the state of affected health care facilities. I want to begin by saying that I'm deeply proud of the incredible dedication and resilience of our first responders, our communities, our First Nations and Metis settlement partners, and all Albertans. There is no question that this is a challenging time. Tens of thousands of people have been forced from their homes and their jobs. </p><p>They are leaving behind all they own, wondering if they will lose everything that they've worked for. And while many Albertans are being forced to evacuate, firefighters and first responders from across the province and the country are doing their absolute best to control the destruction and protect Albertans' lives and property. Albertans cannot thank them enough for their efforts. Just yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit the evacuation centre that has been set up in Edmonton. Despite the difficult challenges that everyone was facing, there was a resounding sense of hope and optimism from both the hard-working volunteers who are helping those who are displaced, and our friends and neighbours who were forced to evacuate. I also toured some of the affected wildfire areas near Entwhistle, and received a thorough briefing from the local team on the state of the situation in that community. This is an incredibly stressful time, and we know Albertans need extra support while they are out of their homes and communities, and that's why we are announcing that additional help is on the way for wildfire evacuees. Starting tomorrow, the government will begin providing one-time emergency financial assistance to residents who have been forced to evacuate due to these wildfires. Every adult who's been evacuated and displaced for seven consecutive days will receive $1,250, along with an additional $500 for each dependent child under age 18. This means that an evacuated family of four will receive $3,500 to help get through these dark days, and to meet their immediate needs. These payments will help evacuees pay for accommodations, food, and other basic necessities. The payments will make those expenses one less thing for people to worry about so that they can concentrate on their families and their own well-being. We know that this is a tough time, so we've made the application process quick and easy. Evacuees can apply on line using a verified alberta.ca account. Payments will be provided through e-transfer once your eligibility is confirmed, and that process can take as little as 24 hours. This is the most efficient way to receive your evacuation payment, and to get it as quickly as possible. However, we do recognize that applying on line may not be an option for everyone. If you are unable to apply on line, or you can't receive the e-transfer, people can also call the wildfire resource line. You've heard this number before, we'll say it again, 310-4455, once they are eligible. I would like to just repeat that number. It's 310-4455. Staff will be able to help with applications and make alternate payment arrangements. The government of Alberta is also working to ensure residents in remote locations, including Indigenous reserves and Metis settlements, will get these payments as well. These payments are only one part of our ongoing response, but they are a critical lifeline for evacuees in their hour of need. We will ensure everyone who is eligible to receive an emergency payment will get one. And earlier today, I did have an opportunity to speak with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. After updating him on the situation we, facing Albertans, I first thanked him for the work of the Canadian inter-agency forest fire centre, which has already been activated and working with our team here. It's part of the reason why we already have crews from other provinces who have been arriving, and you will hear more about that later. But after talking with prime minister, we sent a formal request for additional assistance. Minister Mike Ellis will provide an update on that shortly. During our call, Prime Minister Trudeau confirmed that the military will be sent to assist, if necessary. We will continue to keep communication channels open with the federal government as we respond to this unprecedented situation. I'd also like to provide a brief update on evacuations and their impact on our health care system. As of this morning, almost 300 patients and long-term care residents have been safely evacuated from four Alberta Health Services sites, including Drayton Valley Hospital and Care Centre, Edson Health Care Centre, Fox Creek Health Care Centre, and High Prairie Health Complex. These evacuations have gone very well thanks to the cooperation of those having to move and the hard work of our staff, physicians, and supporting agencies. These relocations are happening through EMS, through chartered buses and flights as required depending on specific needs. Health care workers across the province are working around the clock to ensure patients and residents are safely cared for in temporary locations, and AHS is contacting the families of loved ones to share the patient and resident location information. And I want to be clear, despite these evacuations, our health care system is still well equipped, and will continue to meet the needs of Albertans from all corners of the province. I want to thank our front line staff, leaders, and physicians who have come together to support the response across Alberta Health Services, and especially to those who've been evacuated along with their families. Over the past few days, we've heard countless stories of individual Albertans stepping up to lend a hand, whether it's volunteering, making a financial contribution through the Canadian Red Cross, or another charity, or donating clothes, Albertans have demonstrated their generosity and sense of caring throughout this unprecedented situation. And any Albertan who donates a cash contribution can receive a nonrefundable charitable tax credit on their first $200 thanks to a 60 percent charitable tax credit from the province and 15 percent from the federal government. We made that recent change in budget 2023. We've also seen various companies step up and provide generous contributions in support of the current situation. I'd like to quickly acknowledge TELUS, who today made an initial commitment of $5 million in cash and in kind donations to local charities and organizations supporting relief efforts and first responders, and the Edmonton Oilers Community Foundation will be dedicating net proceeds from the oilers playoff 50-50 starting tomorrow, May 9th, until the end of round two to the Canadian Red Cross in support of the humanitarian effort to help Albertans affected by these wildfires. Additionally, during my call earlier today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed the federal government is working with the Red Cross and will match donations. On behalf the government of Alberta, I want to thank everyone, both individual Albertans and companies who have contributed to support, to the support of this emergency. Finally, before I conclude and turn over to Minister Ellis, I would like to make a call out to anyone who is trained and qualified in firefighting who would like to be, and would be willing to volunteer. If you work for a private sector company, if you are firefighting qualified, and you are willing to lend a helping hand, please e-mail <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:emergencysupportoffers@gov.ab.ca\">emergencysupportoffers@gov.ab.ca</email> That's <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:emergencysupportoffers@gov.ab.ca\">emergencysupportoffers@gov.ab.ca</email> Government officials will assess your qualifications and let you know how you can help play a role in responding to this unprecedented fire season. Thank you. and I would now like to invite Mike Ellis to share some opening remarks</p><p>MIKE ELLIS (Alberta Public Safety &amp; Emergency Services Minister): So again, thank you, thank you, Premier, and good afternoon, everyone. So I want to express my support to all Albertans who have been evacuated and, in their communities, those who are in the process of being evacuated and those who are beginning to return home. We stand closely with you during this very challenging time. Thank you again to all of our frontline, especially those firefighters and first responders who are working tirelessly to protect Albertans, their homes, their communities throughout this emergency. And a big thank you to the volunteers and those who have offered support to their fellow Albertans. The resilience and compassion of Albertans in the face of adversity represents the very best of this province. The top priority of Alberta's government and, is and will continue to be keeping Albertans safe during this state of emergency. As you've all seen over the weekend, this is a rapidly changing situation, and we continue to take steps to respond to situations as the need arises. The Alberta Emergency Management Agency is coordinating with all impacted communities to respond rapidly to the fires and their effects. I continue to have great confidence in our emergency responders and the important work that they are doing across this province. Furthermore, I have been in continuous contact with my federal counterpart as we continue to work together to utilize all possible resources in responding to this emergency. Early today, I did send, as the premier mentioned, I did send a letter to Minister Blair and Minister Mendicino outlining our request for federal assistance. We've asked the federal government to provide support in the following areas. Number one, the provision of firefighting resources, the pre-positioning of strategic air lift resources for the evacuation of isolated communities, engineering supports, along with heavy equipment resources, water purification resources, the continued assistance of additional Royal Canadian Mounted Police to support security and evacuation as required, the costs related to the RCMP operations within the province for the wildfire response, the provision of the military personnel to provide a measure of security for evacuated communities to guard against looting and disorder, an exemption from the federal requirements to extend flight hours for air support related to firefighting and required evacuations, reimbursement of costs related to expenditures for supporting First Nations communities impacted by wildfires and constructions of those communities, flexibility and exceptions where applicable for the Albertans receiving employment insurance, as well as rapid enrollment for those being evacuated, or businesses closed because of the wildfires. And I just want to say that I've certainly recently actually spoken to Minister Blair, and he is beginning to start to action the items on the list that we have provided them. So, before I continue, I would like to caution that we have been informed by, you know, the Canadian Armed Forces that we do have limited firefighting capabilities. And I let everybody know that because there's no silver bullet solution in our response to, you know, every, to this very complex situation. Every action is being taken as part of a coordinated response and a strategy to address this emergency. We have full faith and confidence in our, our firefighters with wildlife. We certainly have full, full confidence in the Alberta Emergency Management Association, and it is absolutely a coordinated effort, not just across the province, but a coordinated effort in, throughout the country to ensure that we address not just the fires that are going on in Alberta, but of course as well as British Columbia and Saskatchewan who also have fires that are currently ongoing. As premier outlined, the new emergency evacuation payments are now part of the support available to Albertans who have been evacuated over a period of more than seven days. Details are available online and will be updated in real-time. Evacuees can visit alberta.ca/emergency to apply for their payment using a verified alberta.ca account. That site again is alberta.ca/emergency, and we also have the most up to date information on the evolving emergency situation. If you're in an affected area, please register as an evacuee at your local reception centre and staff will connect you to the resources and assistance that are available. This has been a very, very difficult time for students who have been displaced due to wildfire evacuations, and I'm going to provide you a brief update on the impact on the schools. So as of 11:00 a.m. today, there have been 54 schools that have been closed as a result of the wildfire evacuations affecting approximately 10,500 students. Contingency plans are being developed in place to support the continued learning of students if any evacuation persists for longer than the, longer, for a longer period of time. Officials are going to continue to provide updates on schools and contingency plans as needed. And now, as this weekend has shown, the emergency situation is constantly changing. So I want to be very clear to all Albertans, whether you're close to an area that is currently impacted or not, again, I'm going to repeat this, it is immensely important to take the steps that are necessary to prepare yourself in the event that you have to leave your home due to emergency. You can never be too prepared. And there are great resources available at alberta.ca if you need an idea of what you may need to start with. So prepare that emergency kit with 72 hours' worth of food and water, critical documents, first aid kits, medication, or any other necessities. I understand in times like this, this is very distressing for everyone. So I want to remind everything also that help is available to any Albertan who's struggling with mental health concerns that they might be facing at this time. You can call 211. 211 is available day or night to find mental health supports, and programs to support your wellness no matter where you are in this province. Mental health services will be there when you need them. Albertans seeking counselling supports can also visit counsellingalberta.ca to access same day counselling services with low or no fees. Lastly, while I don't believe it to be a widespread issue at this time, I certainly have heard some examples of price gouging which might be occurring within the province and areas where evacuees are being sheltered. I want to be very, very crystal clear on this. Albertans are not going to accept price gouging, and we are going to offer the assistance where people most need it. I will just say these are rumours at best at this time, but I just want to say for anybody who may believe that there might be some price gouging that is going on, or they suspect any form of price gouging, please, just call service Alberta. Again call it through that number of 310-4455. Againing, that's 310-4455. And before I end, I just want to reiterate that we remain committed to ensuring that all Albertans are safe and secure, and we are going to get through this, and we're going to get through this together. So please, everyone, stay safe out there. And thank you, I'm going to now happened this over to Colin Blair to provide some technical updates on the Alberta Emergency Management Agency and their response, thank you.</p><p>COLIN BLAIR (Alberta Emergency Management Agency Executive Director): Good afternoon, everyone. Alberta continues to be under a state of provincial emergency, and response efforts are focusing still on protecting and supporting Albertans during these wildfires. The provincial emergency coordination centre continues to coordinate the response, and remains at level 4, which is the highest level. We now have 98 active wildfires burning in the province. In addition to the provincial state of emergency, there are 17 states of local emergency, as well as two band council resolutions. We strongly encourage all Albertans to download the Alberta emergency alert app.</p><p>(AUDIO AND VIDEO PROBLEMS)</p><p>KAPELOS: Unfortunately it looks like we're having a bit of, a few technical difficulties with the connection there in Alberta. And I think we actually have it back now so we can head back to there, big announcements from the government in Alberta, the premier specifically around financial aid to people who have been forced to evacuate their homes, 30,000 of them right now in Alberta. Let's listen back.</p><p>CHRISTIE TUCKER (Alberta Wildfire): We've asked for up to a thousand firefighters from the Yukon, Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and we're expecting them to arrive in the next week. At this time, all Albertans need to take extra care that they don't start a wildfire, no matter where they are. So please respect the fire bans or off highway vehicle restrictions that are in place across the forest protection area of the province, and if you see smoke or fire in the forest, please call 310-fire to report it, and help us keep everyone safe. Thank you.</p><p>ELLIS: Just before we get to questions, I just wanted to clarify a point. I apologize to everyone, I made a bit of an error on my notes there. In speaking with Minister Blair, he had indicated to me, because I always want to temper the expectations that some people have with our Canadian military. He indicated to me that the Canadian military is limited in their capabilities when it comes to firefighting. It's not us, I must say, the outstanding work that is being done by the men and women who are fighting fires, one of the things that Minister Blair reiterated to me is that we have a top-notch organization, probably one of if not the best in Canada when it comes to firefighting, and so I just wanted to make that clarification. We can go to questions now. Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Perfect. So the premier, Minister Ellis, Christie Tucker from Alberta Wildfire, Colin Blair from the Alberta Emergency Management Agency, and Health Deputy Minister Paul Winnick are available to answer questions. We'll go to in person questions first, and there is a microphone at the right of the room. One question, one follow-up, please state your name and outlet, and please keep your questions to wildfire, the topic of the wildfire only.</p><p>SMITH: And I might just say that when I was coming in, I got a chance to meet Brigadier General Graham, and he indicated that the Princess Patricia Canadian Light Infantry do have 300 people trained in some firefighting, so that will help since they are close to home, and they will also be putting out a call to their reservist who also have firefighting training, and so we may be able to have some local help faster than we expected, so that's good news to have as well.</p><p>NICOLE WEISBERG (CTV News): Hi, Nicole Weisberg with CTV News. I wanted to ask about the call-out for volunteers. Has Alberta ever done this before? And why do you feel the need to put this call out right now, especially considering you are getting so many more resources?</p><p>SMITH: I'll tell you why. We've got a new minister of Forestry, Parks, and Tourism, Todd Loewen. And one of the things that he said very early on is that we have a number of Indigenous communities that have local firefighting expertise. Indeed, when I talked to the chief up north, he had said that they have as many as 450 people who are trained in firefighting. And so he wanted to find a pathway so that people can be brought on board safely. We want to ensure that individuals who are lending a hand are going to have the sufficient training so that they can work with the teams, and so we are giving it a try. As you heard, we have a force here in our own department of just over 700, and as Christie mentioned, we're doing a call for a thousand from outside of province. We know that from what we've heard in the previous update, some of these fires may continue on for several months. And so if we can use the resources that are already here from people who are able to help, we want to be open to doing that. But we want to do it in a safe way, and make sure that those who are brought in are trained up to the same standard that will allow them to integrate effectively into the team. So we're going to give it a try.</p><p>WEISBERG: And this is for wildfire officials. I know this has been asked every day, but I'm wondering if you have a better idea of the loss of infrastructure at this point in some of the areas, including Drayton Valley Entwhistle area.</p><p>BLAIR: I will take that question. So we are continuing to gather information on this. The first thing that we need to make sure is that the wildfire threat is, has been eliminated, and it is part of the re-entry process. So while we do not have a conclusive number, because we have a number of active fires that are still threatening municipalities, we continue to work on those numbers. And they're held by the municipalities, and the intent is, is that when they move into re-entry, they're contacting people who are impacted.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: We're going to go to the phone lines. For Radio-Canada, we do have a French translator, so we just ask that you ask your question in English when we get to you. The appropriate official or cabinet minister will answer in English, and then the translator will provide a French response. So, operator, could you please put through the first caller.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Thank you, first caller is Tessa, CTV Calgary.</p><p>TESSA (CTV Calgary): Apologies here, I thought I was going to be a little later down here, but Premier, I just want to ask you, you were vaccinated in Arizona, you and your husband operated a restaurant in High River at the time that the comments that have been circulating, you were following the so-called tyrannical measures set out by your predecessor Jason Kenney called the restriction exemption program so you have to ensure guests were vaccinated before dining, and you say vaccinated Albertans are followers of Hitler. Would you include yourself as premier as a follower of Hitler? And why didn't you stand up against those measures from Jason Kenney.</p><p>SMITH: Well I've issued a statement regarding my comments. I've always remained a friend to the Jewish community, to Israel, and to our veterans, and I would ask you to reach out to my office for a copy of my statement.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Do you have an on topic follow-up question?</p><p>TESSA: I'm good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: All right. Operator, could you please put through the next caller?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (inaudible)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Good afternoon. On topic question here for, I'm not really sure who, I'm thinking Minister Mike Ellis may be best positioned to answer this, maybe the premier, I'm just wondering about the escalation to the military. Why are we not seeing military resources being deployed right this second? You know a lot of people were saying that we should have seen it last week, and now this week my understanding based off what you guys were saying is that there is still sort of escalation planning happening. When will we see those extra resources out there helping people that are being displaced?</p><p>SMITH: Well, I can tell you that I came in today, and I was delighted to see that the Brigadier General Graham was already here saying that they had already been prepared to activate their forces as needed. He introduced me to several members of his team, including the head of the Princess Patricia Canadian Light Infantry, and indicated that they had 300 firefighters that would be willing to be put, or able to be put into service. The issues that we had asked of the prime minister was to do an assessment of where our military would best be able to help, and as Minister Ellis mentioned, we talked about firefighting, so that was one issue I spoke with the Brigadier General Graham about doing engineering. One of the things that I observed when I went out to Parkland County yesterday is that there are fire guards that are created with 12-meter wide, and they have the capacity to do that kind of work as well. And the third area that I had asked about was whether military could be deployed to assist in making sure communities that were evacuated were safe, and that's an area that would require a little bit more work, but it sounds like they are ready, willing, and have the capability to do those first two items. And the fact that they met me here today says to me that the message got through. I just need to be clear on something, though, is that I spoke with the prime minister, and just pointed out that the, the inter-agency forest fire centre has worked extremely well for us. I asked him about how long it had been in operation, and we've had it in operation in our country since 1982. And that's the way in which all of the various firefighting resources have been coordinated. And he acknowledged that I think that the coordination has been even better since the Fort McMurray fire. So the agencies have been working on trying to get deployment of those resources here right from the beginning. That's part of the reason why with the requests that are out, we're already beginning to see those, those extra resources arrive today. Couple more areas that I thought that the prime minister might be able to assist with is the firefighting capability potentially within Parks Canada, maybe within CP and CN Rail which were federally regulated entities. So there's, I think the, because we are seeing that the need is so high, that it might continue on for a long period of time, we wanted to make sure that all of the resources were available. But I think that the interagency forest fire centre has done a tremendous job of making sure that we've gotten the resources that we need. I wonder if Christie might want to comment on that.</p><p>TUCKER: We worked very closely side by side with our colleagues across Canada, and certainly the calls to the inter-agency forest fire centre happen on a weekly basis even outside of wildfire season. We're always talking to our colleagues, and we're talking on an operational level. So those decisions are made in-between wildfire specialists, and when a fire breaks out somewhere that we know we realize we will need extra assistance with those calls are made right away. And I know that our colleagues across the country and abroad are always there waiting to send us some help.</p><p>ELLIS: I would just further add to this, is that we have to put in the trust, entrust our incident command teams. So all of these fires that are unfortunately all throughout this province have incident command teams that have been assigned to them, and when they request more resources, you know, we make sure that we get those resources to the folks that are on the ground. This is, you know, proactive measures that we've done, what the premier's done, what I've done, which is to reach out to the federal government to make sure that we have these resources available to them is exactly what we're doing. However, just remember, that the person in command of any critical incident is that incident commander. So we have to put trust and faith in them in what they are doing. We have fantastic people in the province that have been doing an outstanding job. We've brought in people, not only nationally, but internationally, who are incident command and incident command teams, and if they are requiring more resources, we as the government are making sure that they are having the necessary resources available to them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Do you have a follow-up question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I do, Colin, thanks. Apologies, I'm going to cheat a little here and ask two questions just to either the premier or the public safety minister, just for clarification. Will the military be deployed, when can we expect them, and then I am not sure if this is for Christie Tucker, but we're seeing a lot of areas that are still under an evacuation order but those alerts aren't showing up on the app or the website. Why is that? And, again, apologies for asking two questions, but I think is a bit of a public safety thing, so thank you.</p><p>SMITH: Yeah, when I spoke with the prime minister today, he said the Canadian Armed Forces will be deployed, and it's a matter of getting the incident command team that Mike was just talking about to determine the best way to integrate them within the teams. But I took it as a good sign that when I showed up here today, Brigadier General Graham was already on hand introducing me to his team, and saying that they were just doing that assessment right now. So I would anticipate that as soon as they are ready and as soon as the emergency command centre is willing to, or is able to integrate them, they will, and I will hand it over to Christie.</p><p>TUCKER: So the Alberta emergency alert system is working well. It's a national system. We work closely with the telecommunication companies, the national regulator, as well as several hundred users across the province. We have a few things that we're working on to try to fix it, and we are, we are bound and we're going to make this work much better. I think the information that might be missing on there, we're going to be resolving that in fairly short order.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Operator, next caller, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Smith, Globe and Mail.</p><p>SMITH (Globe and Mail): Thanks for taking my question.</p><p>KAPELOS: Alberta Premier Danielle Smith offering an update to the province and the country on wildfires which continue to rage out of control in that province. More than 25 of them actually are still out of control. One provincial state of emergency, 17 local states of emergency, as well as two band council resolutions. One of the more significant announcements from the premier there is about financial assistance for the 30,000 Albertans who have been forced to flee from their homes. She says that if you are forced to flee for seven consecutive days, so out of your home for seven consecutive days, you will be eligible for a onetime payment of $1,250, plus $500 for each of your dependents. So a familiful four, she said, would be eligible for about $3,500 to help out with what you are experiencing. Lots of conversation there and answers from the premier about what exactly the province is asking for from the federal government. We spoke to Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair a little earlier on the program. He says the military, as well as extra firefighters, pardon me, and police, are all mobilizing now to go over to Alberta. He did not have a specific timeline, nor did the premier there, about how soon the military could be in Alberta. We do know, however, based on some of the information we just heard that the forecast over the next few days, and particularly heading into the weekend, is for more hot, dry weather after a few days of reprieve over here, and so there is a lot of concern about having those resources in place to help out with so many of those wildfires which continue to burn as I said out of control. We're going to continue staying on top of that story, bringing you any updates as they happen.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68D0-SF31-DYX2-900X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5198\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CTV Televisions, Inc.

The frantic search for survivors has only brought tragedy to the Tyau family.

We offer context, suggested reporting avenues and links to statements on abortion from several major denominations.

The programs disperse millions of dollars each year, but The Associated Press found racial inequities and other barriers in how claims are denied in many states. Across the country, victims are using their stories to try to change the systems that excluded them. They have organized rallies, testified at legislatures and met with dozens of lawmakers \u2014 with much success. Legislatures in more than half of U.S. states have passed measures to improve their programs over the last three years. We offer details on these legislative changes and tips for localizing the story.

It\u2019s among the largest and most high-profile settlements of its kind, but it\u2019s far from the only one. State and local governments are figuring out how they\u2019re going to use money from opioid settlements with drugmakers, distribution companies and, in some cases, pharmacies. The settlements were designed to avoid some of the pitfalls of the big national deals between states and tobacco companies in the 1990s, which saw spending go to government priorities that had nothing to do with the direct damage inflicted by tobacco. But advocates still worry about the details of how the opioid money will be spent and who gets the power in deciding. We point you to state data and offer tips for localizing the story.

New census figures released Thursday show the share of U.S. residents age 65 or older ballooned by more than a third from 2010 through 2020, while the share of children declined, particularly those under age 5. Aging was propelled by the two largest cohorts in the U.S.: more baby boomers turning 65 and millennials moving later into their 20s and 30s. Also, fewer children were born between 2010 and 2020. The most recent census was the first since the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in 2015. The survey showed same-sex households made up 1.7% of households that included couples.

Black Americans are more likely than white people to die during childbirth, suffer from asthma, mental health troubles, high blood pressure, and Alzheimer\u2019s. The reasons are myriad: worse access to adequate medical care, neighborhoods that are polluted, lack of healthy food choices, mistrust of doctors. But the core problem is racism over centuries that afflicts Black people from cradle to grave. We direct you to state and local data and offer tips for telling this story in your community.

Boozman College of Public Health projected a daily average of 1,039 new cases over the next week. The model also predicted an average increase of 169 new cases per day in children under the age of 17.</p><p>Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The state also has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35 per cent of the population fully vaccinated.</p><p>\"COVID is no longer smouldering. It has broken out into a raging forest fire that will grow in size and strength,\" according to the UAMS forecast. \"We cannot stand still. We must act to reduce the consequences of this new surge to the extent possible.\"</p><p>The state's cases on Tuesday increased by 1,875 to 367,007 total since the pandemic began, the Department of Health said. Dr. Jose Romero, the state's health secretary, said he was concerned about the possibility of a \"surge on top of this surge\" when school begins this fall. Laws enacted this year prevent schools from mandating face masks or from requiring students and teachers to be vaccinated.</p><p>\"I expect to see this year significant outbreaks within the school system,\" Romero said during a virtual discussion on vaccine hesitancy. \"What's already telling me that's going to happen are the number of daycare closures that have occurred because of outbreaks ... camp exposures and closures occurring.\"</p><p>He said the key to combating those outbreaks will be parents stressing the importance of wearing masks.</p><p>Dr. Bechara Choucair, the White House's vaccinations co-ordinator, visited Arkansas on Tuesday to meet with Romero, hospital leaders and other health officials. Choucair said the medical community will play the key role in countering misinformation that has fuelled vaccine hesitancy in places like Arkansas.</p><p>\"To be able to counter all of this misinformation with facts, with answers to people's most commonly asked questions, the opportunity for people to talk to their doctors to make sure they have the credible, scientific information is going to be really critical to help us deal with this level of misinformation that we're seeing,\" he said.</p><p>Gov. Asa Hutchinson earlier this month began holding town halls around the state aimed at addressing people who have so far resisted getting vaccinated, and he planned more of the forums next week.</p><p>UAMS Chancellor Dr. Cam Patterson said the increase in hospitalizations is straining hospital resources. \"It's not a matter of finding beds, it's a matter of finding people to take care of patients, whether they're COVID-19 positive or not.\"</p><p>The Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20210725TTA2021072561648605</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6372-CW91-F197-51CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"485\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

These airports also support essential air services including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response.</p><p>Today, the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at the Sarnia Chris Hadfield Airport. Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program, the Government of Canada is providing the airport with $370,000 for the purchase of a sweeper, used to keep runways and taxiways clear of ice and snow.</p><p>This funding will help ensure continued safe and reliable airport operations for residents, many of whom depend on their local airport for personal and business travel, as well as for access to routine and emergency medical care in larger centres.</p><p> Quote</p><p>\"Our country's airports help keep our supply chains moving and our communities connected from coast to coast to coast. With this funding for Sarnia's Chris Hadfield Airport, communities in and around Sarnia will have better access to safe and reliable air transportation.

And while this latest incursion into the sensitive watershed might have been the most dramatic, it was by no means the first; Figueira showed trustees photos of damage found all around the area, many taken right at the edge of Maxwell Lake.</p><p>In the course of their monitoring, staff noted burned-out campfires, piles of human waste, cut down trees, even a rope swing \u2014 as well as several places where the fence had been cut and new trails created. After placing a trail camera, and noting the coming and going of numerous trespassers, Figueira said they were able to estimate how many people were using the water source and its watershed recreationally.</p><p>\"We saw over 10 people a day,\"said Figueira, \"all trespassers. Most have been swimming in the lake, some groups going in with camping gear and fishing poles. We've got significant issues.\"</p><p>Maxwell Lake provides drinking water to more than 700 Salt Spring addresses, and is private property owned by the district. Camping, picnicking, mountain biking and vehicle use is prohibited in the watershed \u2014 as are all lake activities. NSSWD has led education efforts in the past to explain to the public how many human activities around the lake shift sediment and runoff paths, impacting water quality and increasing risk of wildfire in summer months. A fire in the watershed could cause \"devastating and permanent\"damage to the district's ability to supply water, according to NSSWD analyses.</p><p>Despite security visits to the site multiple times per day, there \"simply isn't enough manpower\"right now to catch everyone, Figueira told trustees.</p><p>\"If we catch them in the act, on the property \u2014 and we have done it a few times \u2014 the RCMP has ticketed people,\"said Figueira. \"But it's hit or miss. This has been going on up there for a while.\"</p><p>Trustees discussed options for educational outreach to the schools, additional signage and the possibility of employing \"summer stewards\"trained in de-escalation to engage with the public on the watershed. Figueira said staff had purchased additional cameras and were already planning to extend security time in the area.</p><p>\"What I think will make a difference will be the live cameras up there,\"said Figueira, noting the communications infrastructure to support them would be needed for the new treatment plant anyway. \"So I'm looking at ways to get that up sooner.\"</p><p>DRIFTWOOD STAFF</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUDFWD-news20220907PGWA0002957829</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUDFWD2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:677F-XV51-JD2C-J126-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484148</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"547\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Ltd. said in a video on the reduction of the wildfire risk to Nelson (<url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/nJaNcetHrRw\">https://youtu.be/nJaNcetHrRw</url>), that a fuel management project near Selous Creek is designed to reduce the risk of wildfire adjacent to the city of Nelson. </p><p>\u201cSo here we are trying to create forest conditions that would not be conducive to an aggressive fire spread,\u201d he said during the brief but well produced video. </p><p>Many of the Kootenay forests have quite a history of wildfire and it has shaped the forest and the eco-systems in the region, Cordeiro explained.  </p><p>A lot of forests tend to burn on a cycle of 100 to 200 years, he added. Looking around the Kootenays Cordeiro said there isn\u2019t a stand that at one point or another hasn\u2019t been replaced by a fire. </p><p>\u201cAnd so we don\u2019t expect that to completely stop, but what we are trying to do is interrupt that cycle a little bit to save fire from our communities,\u201d he said. </p><p>The Regional District of Central Kootenay (RDCK) and Kalesnikoff are collaborating on the project near Selous Creek \u2014 through funding from the Forest Enhancement Society of BC \u2014 that covers an area of approximately 80 hectares (ha) directly upslope from the Great Northern Rail Trail on provincial Crown land. </p><p>The main objectives of the project are to \u201creduce wildfire risk by retaining large, healthy fire-resistant trees while removing dense understory trees and surface fuels, enhancing infrastructure protection and supporting future suppression efforts.\u201d  </p><p>Prior to this, similar projects have occurred in the West Arm Provincial Park and Harrop Procter Community Forest.  </p><p>The Selous Creek project is unique due to its scope and scale.  </p><p>A look back </p><p>The project started six years ago with three general types of treatment: mechanical harvesting; hand treatment of understory; and post-harvest treatment.  </p><p>In May of 2022 the mechanical harvesting was completed by Kalesnikoff, involving 65 ha of partial-cut cable and ground-based harvesting systems.  </p><p>\u201cThe 13 ha hand treatment phase is half completed with seven ha treated in June 2022, and the remainder scheduled for this fall,\u201d noted an RDCK release. \u201cThe post-harvest treatment phase will commence in late July to prepare the area for a prescribed burn.\u201d  </p><p>The burn will utilize a machine tied off to a cable moving across the hillside creating fuel breaks around the outer perimeter of the harvest area and around reserve patches.  </p><p>Dependent upon weather conditions and BC Wildfire Service (BCWS) availability, the burn will be completed under the direction of BCWS this fall and again next spring. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-7565d79eb3ba446bb15bdf7b2c7f76d8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65YT-X5W1-DY9S-T15R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><timeReceived>05:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 20, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Local forecasts were for levels of more than 250 parts per million in the morning, with afternoon levels around 30 to 50 ppm.</p><p>Fires surround southern Manitoba, with 130 active blazes in the province, as of Monday afternoon. A slew of fires in Northern Ontario forced that province to issue an emergency order for the region July 14; Saskatchewan recently announced it is \"fully engaged\" fighting wildfires which now number more than 160.</p><p>Manitoba announced new fire and travel restrictions across much of the province, with permanent residents in the region north of Nopiming Provincial Park and east of Lake Winnipeg asked to be ready to evacuate within an hour's notice.</p><p>Access will be cut off to the area for non-residents as of 8 a.m. Tuesday, including from those who own cottages in the region.</p><p>Each nearby fire increases the likelihood weather systems will carry smoke into southern Manitoba, said Hoffman. Monday's smoke came in from huge swaths of fires burning east of Lake Manitoba and in northwestern Ontario, she said.</p><p>Smoke was trapped under a ridge of air, which kept it low to the ground. While it's not necessary for a fire to be nearby to end up causing air quality problems (smoke can travel thousands of kilometres), Hoffman said it does make it more likely.</p><p>The \"heat dome\" Manitoba has suffered under in recent weeks may also be contributing to the settling of smoke near the surface. A heat dome is a ridge that traps hot, descending air below it.</p><p>\"That upper feature would help to stifle movement of air, and therefore forest fire smoke,\" said Hoffman.</p><p>Drought has ravaged southern Manitoba, devastating crops and drying out fuel for wildfires.</p><p>Hoffman said the region may get a much-needed thunderstorm Monday night. But the system could produce moderate to severe hail in select areas, which could further damage crops. Lightning also brings a risk of adding to Manitoba's wildfire count, she said.</p><p>Amid such conditions, Environment Canada encourages people to limit outdoor activity and to be cautious if they have any trouble breathing. They also suggest turning off air-conditioning units that draw outdoor air into the house.</p><p>People at high risk for smoke-related health problems include children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with heart or lung conditions, particularly asthma.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cody.sellar@freepress.mb.ca\">cody.sellar@freepress.mb.ca</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-news20210719TTAWwfp574869522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:635Y-4F81-F197-52WH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The newly announced report provides insight into Perimeter Solutions multi-faceted approach to enhance, advance and regularly communicate its sustainability strategy and environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. It is available to view online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Perimeter Solutions is an innovative and evolving organization. In order to remain successful, we realize the importance of embedding strong sustainability priorities within our business operations, says Edward Goldberg, CEO of Perimeter Solutions. Over the past two years, our senior management team has worked to enhance our ESG strategy to align with the broader transformation of our company. Publishing this Factsheet demonstrates our commitment to transparency and accountability in our environmental, social and governance performance.</p><p>Highlighted in the report are the three key tenets of Perimeter Solutions ESG strategy, which guide the company's sustainability efforts: //st * Environmental: Perimeter Solutions focus on environmental stewardship is integral to the work it does every day. Wildfire control products developed by Perimeter Solutions save tens of thousands of hectares of forest every year, helping these forests to continue to sequester carbon and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. Perimeter Solutions fire safety products also require dramatically less water to be effective, reducing the amount of water customers use while protecting a valuable natural resource. Internally, Perimeter Solutions has taken steps to increase recycling, made capital investments to reduce the amount of energy used in its manufacturing process, and increased the use of e-records to reduce the Companys carbon footprint. * Social Impact: Perimeter Solutions is committed to providing equal employment opportunities. All recruiting, payment, performance, and promotion decisions are based on merit, without discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, age, family status, ethnic origin, nationality, disability, or religious belief. Women represent approximately 19% of Perimeter Solutions total workforce. Members with diverse backgrounds comprise 33% of the Companys Board. At the community level, Perimeter Solutions devoted 500,000 hours of dedicated service to forest fire remediation. The Companys focused on contributing to the creation of a better world through its strategic nonprofit partnerships, volunteerism, and philanthropy. * Corporate Governance: Perimeter Solutions emphasizes a culture of accountability and conducts its business in a manner that is fair, ethical, and responsible to earn the trust of its stakeholders. Perimeter Solutions has corporate governance policies and structures in place to support its culture of accountability and transparency. The Company continues to focus on diversity and independence at the Board level and its current Board includes a majority of independent directors.</p><p>ABOUT PERIMETER SOLUTIONS</p><p>Headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, Perimeter Solutions (NYSE: PRM) is a premier global solutions provider, producing high-quality firefighting products and lubricant additives.

Climate change has ramped up sharply during my lifetime. It used to be that anything over 30\u00b0 Celsius was a headline grabbing heatwave, but after last year's heat dome, and temperatures in the high 30s to 40s, we more or less shrug at day after day of high temps.</p><p>Air quality, too, can be considerably worse than when I was a kid. For one thing, we didn't have regular \"forest fire seasons\" two years out of three that periodically blotted out of the sky with a grimy orange-grey haze, and made everything smell faintly like an old campfire pit.</p><p>READ MORE: TransLink funding plan includes SkyTrain expansion, electric buses</p><p>READ ALSO: Smoke, pollution trigger air quality advisory in Lower Mainland</p><p>We've also roughly doubled the population of Metro Vancouver since I was born.</p><p>Although cars are a lot more fuel efficient now than they were then, that's still a lot more cars and trucks and buses, belching a lot more exhaust into the air.</p><p>It's that kind of pollution that caused our air quality warnings earlier this summer. All that pollution turns into ozone and haze and gunk that lingers for days, especially if the air is still.</p><p>But, things are looking up.</p><p>Just five or six years ago, if you saw a Tesla or a Chevy Bolt while you were out for a drive, it was worth turning your head. They were rare birds, those humming little electric vehicles.</p><p>Now Teslas are among the most common cars on the roads, not to mention the Bolts, Kia Souls, Ioniqs and half a dozen other brands. Soon we'll start seeing the electric pickups and TransLink and the various school districts will be pitching in with their electric buses, too.</p><p>We already have mostly clean power generation here in B.C., and with the possibility of offshore and onshore wind power to supplement us in the future, there's not reason to think that won't continue.</p><p>So within a few years, we'll hit a tipping point here in the Lower Mainland.</p><p>The number of internal combustion engines will peak, and start to decline.</p><p>The decline will be faster than anyone thinks is possible. The transition will be weird, as gas stations close down and consolidate, and we frantically build charging stations.</p><p>But a few years into it, we'll notice that the sky looks different.

None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">___</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">           No, Georgia officials didn\u2019t err in releasing Trump indictment with grand jurors\u2019 names         </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CLAIM: Officials in Fulton County, Georgia, forgot to redact the names of the grand jurors who indicted former President Donald Trump this week in relation to his actions following the 2020 election.</p><p>THE FACTS: It is standard that indictments in Georgia include the names of the grand jurors, in part because it provides defendants the opportunity to challenge the composition of the grand jury, legal experts told the AP. But after a grand jury indicted Trump as well as 18 others on Monday for their alleged efforts to overturn the results of his 2020 election loss in the state, some quickly spread a claim that officials erred in releasing the indictment by including the jurors\u2019 names. \u201cFirst they \u2018leak\u2019 the indictment before the jury even voted, then they forget to redact juror names,\u201d reads one popular post on the platform X, formerly known as Twitter, seemingly referencing the fact that the court accidentally posted a list of criminal charges against Trump before he was actually indicted. But experts say including the jurors\u2019 names, unredacted, is standard in Georgia. \u201cIn every felony case that I have handled in Georgia both as a former prosecutor and now defense lawyer, the names of the grand jurors have appeared on the Indictment,\u201d Gabe Banks, a former Fulton County deputy district attorney, said in an email. Banks noted that indictments will usually show some names that are struck through, indicating jurors who were not present or didn\u2019t vote. Adam Hames, a former Georgia assistant attorney general, likewise said that it\u2019s \u201ccommon practice to list the names of the grand jurors on the indictment.\u201d Even though grand jury proceedings are generally secret, he said, including the grand jurors\u2019 names allows the defense to present a challenge if necessary. In fact, the Georgia Supreme Court has consistently held that an indictment without the names of grand jurors is considered \u201cdefective,\u201d said Elizabeth Taxel, an assistant clinical professor of law at the University of Georgia. Though there isn\u2019t a Georgia statute that explicitly states that the names of the grand jurors must be written in the indictment, \u201cthat requirement is both inferred from the statutes governing the grand jury process and is established through hundred years of case law,\u201d Taxel said in an email. The Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Thursday that it, along with other agencies, is investigating threats targeting members of the jury.</p><p>\u2014 Associated Press writer Angelo Fichera in New Jersey contributed this report.</p><p>___</p><p>           Conspiracy theories falsely tie Maui wildfires to \u2018smart cities\u2019 and tech conferences         </p><p>CLAIM: Maui hosted a conference about making the entire island into a \u201csmart city\u201d in January and will host another summit next month about using artificial intelligence to govern the island, proving recent wildfires were deliberately set to transform these ideas into reality.</p><p>THE FACTS: The Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences in January was not about turning Maui into a \u201csmart island.\u201d It is an annual gathering focused on emerging issues in the information technology sector globally. Next month\u2019s Hawaii Digital Government Summit, similarly, is not specifically focused on using AI on Maui, but about how governments across the state can better adapt emerging technologies. It also takes place on another Hawaiian island, not Maui. But as authorities continue to probe what sparked the wildfires in Maui this month, social media users are suggesting the conferences were indicative of a plan to raze the island in order to realize their vision for a so-called \u201csmart\u201d city. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t talk about is in January how they had in Maui a smart city conference to turn Maui into an entire smart island, changing everything to electric, renewables, solar panels and pushing everybody into electric vehicles \u2014 15-minute smart cities,\u201d a man says in one widely shared video. He also mentions an upcoming \u201cdigital government summit, utilizing AI to govern the island,\u201d before concluding, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they\u2019re resetting something to start rebuilding for this.\u201d But the posts not only misrepresent the concepts of \u201csmart cities\u201d and \u201c15-minute cities,\u201d but also make false assertions about the conferences themselves. \u201cSmart cities\u201d generally refer to communities that utilize new technologies to improve operations while \u201c15-minute cities\u201d is an urban design principle that emphasizes building more compact communities where everyday needs can be found within a 15-minute walk. They aren\u2019t designed to restrict people\u2019s movements or freedoms. The conferences in Hawaii, meanwhile, are broad in scope and not focused solely on smart cities, 15-minute cities, Maui or even the state of Hawaii. \u201cThere is no truth to the horrendous assertion that the fires were deliberately set to raze the historic town of L\u0101hain\u0101, which was the first Capitol of the Hawaiian Kingdom,\u201d Hawaii Gov. Josh Green\u2019s office wrote in an emailed statement, referring to the Maui community at the epicenter of the destruction. At the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences in January, thousands of researchers presented their work on a wide range of information technology issues, not just on smart city-type concepts, explained Tung Bui, an IT professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa who chairs the conference. Nearly 1,500 papers were submitted as part of the world\u2019s oldest and largest IT conference of its kind, he said. About a dozen were related to smart cities, and none were focused on Maui. \u201cThe idea of resorting to destructive measures, causing harm to a historic landmark and resulting in numerous fatalities, all in an attempt to transform Maui into a smart island, stretches the boundaries of my imagination,\u201d Bui wrote in an email. Philip Bertolini, a senior vice president at e.Republic, which is organizing next month\u2019s Hawaii Digital Government Summit, said the gathering isn\u2019t focused exclusively on using AI in the public sector \u2014 and the notion of turning Maui into a city run by AI isn\u2019t on the agenda, either. \u201cAI may be a topic there, but it\u2019s all about getting the public sector together so they can engage, share best practices and also bring the private sector in to share and engage in best practices around government technology,\u201d he said. Indeed the only mention of AI on the official agenda is a talk from technology expert Jack Shaw that focuses on \u201cunlocking the power of emerging technologies\u201d \u2014 of which AI is one example \u2014 in order to improve government. But Shaw said Wednesday he wouldn\u2019t be speaking at the conference after all, due to a scheduling conflict. In either case, similar presentations he\u2019s given at other events haven\u2019t touched on Maui. The upcoming summit also takes place for its 13th year in Honolulu, on the island of Oahu. </p><p>\u2014 Associated Press writer Philip Marcelo in New York contributed this report.</p><p>___</p><p>           Trees and poles standing amid Maui fire wreckage aren\u2019t unusual, contrary to conspiracy theories         </p><p>CLAIM: Scenes from the Maui wildfires show cars and buildings badly damaged near trees and poles that remain standing, suggesting a wildfire wasn\u2019t the cause.</p><p>THE FACTS: Such observations from the fires on the Hawaiian island are not unusual, experts say. Wildfires often spew fiery embers that hit larger targets like homes and cars. Trees that catch fire are typically not completely vaporized, in part because of their water content \u2014 contrary to suggestions online. \u201cThe powers that be are at work again. This was no wildfire,\u201d a voiceover on one Facebook video states, showing photos of Maui wreckage. \u201cA wildfire that demolishes buildings, leaving trees standing, leaving restaurant umbrellas and trees untouched \u2013 yet having the power to destroy a boat in the middle of the ocean \u2026 What we are seeing here is definitely no wildfire. Wildfires do not completely burn out vehicles, glass and all, yet leaving nearby trees and utility poles still standing upright.\u201d But Michael Gollner, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, who leads a fire research lab, said \u201cit\u2019s actually very common that wildfires will burn out structures and vehicles but leave surrounding trees, utility poles, and other vegetation unscathed.\" Wildfires are often spread to homes and other structures via embers \u2014 small, burning particles that break from vegetation or structures, Gollner told the AP in an email. He pointed to a 2008 federal report about a fire in Lake Arrowhead, California, that found that a wildfire initially showered a neighborhood with fiery debris, igniting several homes and vegetation. But it was the subsequent spread between houses that accounted for most of the residential damage, the report said, not the wildfire itself engulfing homes. Photos in the report show homes destroyed amid trees that remain standing. Christopher Dunn, an Oregon State University assistant professor of wildfire risk science, also said the Maui images were not unusual, providing photos from a 2020 fire in southern Oregon in which homes were destroyed while neighboring trees remained upright, despite some charring. While small pieces of wood burn easily, the sheer size of large trees, some protection from their bark and the water they contain make it so they don\u2019t simply vaporize during a fire, he said, which explains the fact that some salvage trees for lumber after a forest fire. Arnaud Trouv\u00e9, a professor of fire protection engineering at the University of Maryland, noted that fires can spread through flame contact, radiation or the flying embers, also known as \u201cfirebrands.\u201d \u201cA fire that spreads through flame contact and/or radiation will typically attack all fuel sources on its path. Under those conditions, you would not expect to find unburnt trees,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cBut fire spread in the wildland urban interface (WUI) has been shown to be often controlled by firebrands. Under those conditions, you can find patches of unburnt vegetation and structures. This has been observed in previous WUI fires on the West Coast of the US.\u201d He added that structures, decks and fences are susceptible to accumulating flying embers, making them particularly vulnerable \u2014 whereas the wind may blow such embers past trees and poles. The Maui wildfires are the deadliest in the U.S. in more than a century. </p><p>\u2014 Angelo Fichera</p><p>___</p><p>Pfizer\u2019s CEO has not been arrested by the US Marine Corps         </p><p>CLAIM: The U.S. Marine Corps arrested Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and killed his bodyguards.</p><p>THE FACTS: Bourla has not been arrested, Pfizer confirmed in a statement to the AP. The claim was made in a post by a website that says it publishes \u201chumor, parody, and satire\u201d and has previously published similar false stories. Social media users nevertheless shared the false claim this week. \u201cUnited States Marines on Monday captured Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and killed his two bodyguards during a military-sanctioned operation to apprehend the fiendish clot shot manufacturer following his return to the United States,\u201d reads the post, which was published last week on the website Real Raw News and has since been deleted. Real Raw News frequently publishes fabricated stories that use anonymous military sources. Many of its posts are about made-up arrests. The site includes a disclaimer stating that it \u201ccontains humor, parody, and satire.\u201d Neither the site nor the Marine Corps returned a request for comment. The post about Bourla\u2019s supposed capture also did not provide any credible evidence for its claim, citing only one alleged anonymous \u201csource in General Eric M. Smith\u2019s office\u201d \u2014 the same thing it has said on numerous prior false arrest claims. It falsely stated that Bourla was arrested the morning of Aug. 7, but the executive tweeted that evening about his experience mentoring a college sophomore. He tweeted again on Monday about a treatment for multiple myeloma, an aggressive blood cancer. The AP has previously debunked multiple false claims about Bourla, including that he was arrested by the FBI.</p><p>\u2014 Associated Press writer Melissa Goldin in New York contributed this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-1f4d017e161a17d7deff2366daa93e70</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6902-CM71-JBVR-30WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2083\"/><timeReceived>12:08 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 18, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(AP) \u2014 The ongoing bird flu outbreak has cost the government roughly $661 million and added to consumers' pain at the grocery store after more than 58 million birds were slaughtered to limit the spread of the virus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In addition to the cost of the government response and rising prices for eggs, chicken and turkey, farmers who raise those animals have easily lost more than $1 billion, said an agricultural economist, though no one has calculated the total cost to the industry yet.</p><p>The bad news is that with the outbreak entering its second year and the spring migratory season looming, there is no end in sight. And there is little farmers can do beyond the steps they have already taken to try to keep the virus out.</p><p>Unlike past years, the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza found a way to survive through the heat of last summer, leading to a rise in cases reported in the fall.</p><p>The outbreak is already more widespread than the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015, but it hasn't proven as costly yet partly because the government and industry applied lessons learned eight years ago.</p><p>\u201cThe past year has been devastating for the turkey industry as we experience, unequivocally, the worst HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak in the industry\u2019s history,\u201d National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Shelby Newman said.</p><p>In the current outbreak, 58.4 million birds have been slaughtered on more than 300 commercial farms in 47 states. That is because any time the virus is detected, the entire flock on that farm \u2014 which can number in the millions \u2014 must be killed to limit the spread of the disease. Only Hawaii, Louisiana and West Virginia have yet to report a case of bird flu. Iowa \u2014 the nation's biggest egg producer \u2014 leads the nation with nearly 16 million birds slaughtered.</p><p>In 2015, about 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered on more than 200 farms in 15 states.</p><p>That previous outbreak remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The federal government spent nearly $1 billion to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. It cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn\u2019t have any birds on their farms.</p><p>This bills continue to pile up this year as cases spread, and that includes the cost to consumers.</p><p>           Egg prices shot up to $4.82 a dozen in January from $1.93 a year earlier, according to the latest government figures. That spike prompted calls for a price-gouging investigation although the industry maintains that the combination of bird flu and significantly higher feed, fuel and labor costs is what\u2019s driving prices so high.</p><p>The price for a pound of chicken breast was $4.32 in January. That\u2019s down slightly from last fall when the price peaked at $4.75, but it is up significantly from the year before when chicken breasts were selling for $3.73 per pound.</p><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn\u2019t track retail turkey prices the same way as part of its inflation data, but the Agriculture Department says the wholesale price of turkey went from $1.29 per pound last January just before the bird flu outbreak began to $1.72 per pound last month.</p><p>The number of birds slaughtered peaked last spring at almost 21 million in March, leaving farmers leery of what they must face in the months ahead. University of Georgia virus researcher David Stallknecht said there is some hope that this spring might not be quite as bad because turkeys and chickens may have developed some immunity to the virus.</p><p>The key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through their droppings and nasal discharges. Despite the best efforts of farmers, it is hard to keep the virus out.</p><p>Farmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating.</p><p>\u201cWe recommend all producers redouble their efforts to protect their birds through good biosecurity practices,\u201d said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that's leading the government's response.</p><p>Farmers began following those steps after the 2015 outbreak, and this outbreak has only reinforced the need to tighten biosecurity.</p><p>\u201cAmerica\u2019s egg farmers continue to double-down on biosecurity protocols to protect our flocks and maintain a stable egg supply. We are grateful that there has been little to no farm-to-farm spread in this current outbreak,\u201d said Oscar Garrison, senior vice president of food safety and regulatory affairs at the United Egg Producers trade group.</p><p>Poultry and egg producers, partnering with the government, are parsing this outbreak for new lessons in keeping birds healthy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really the key \u2013 early detection. It\u2019s kind of like a forest fire - the earlier you detect it, the easier it is to contain and eradicate,\u201d National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said.</p><p>Officials say bird flu doesn\u2019t represent a significant threat to human health. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation\u2019s food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses.</p><p>There has only been one human case of bird flu confirmed during this outbreak and that was a man who had been helping slaughter and remove infected birds from a Colorado farm. He recovered from the illness after a few days.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-2c9ca4b3d04f3c0269a1fee233daa3a6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67KF-V951-JBVR-32KG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><timeReceived>05:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 18, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It\u2019s easy to be fairly gloomy when I compare the way things are now with the way they were when I was a kid. Climate change has ramped up sharply during my lifetime. It used to be that anything over 30\u00b0 Celsius was a headline grabbing heatwave, but after last year\u2019s heat dome, and temperatures in the high 30s to 40s, we more or less shrug at day after day of high temps.</p><p>Air quality, too, can be considerably worse than when I was a kid. For one thing, we didn\u2019t have regular \u201cforest fire seasons\u201d two out of three years \u2013 that periodically blotted out of the sky with a grimy orange-grey haze, and made everything smell faintly like an old campfire pit.</p><p>We\u2019ve also roughly doubled the population of Metro Vancouver since I was born.</p><p>Although cars are a lot more fuel efficient now than they were then, that\u2019s still a lot more cars and trucks and buses, belching a lot more exhaust into the air.</p><p>It\u2019s that kind of pollution that caused our air quality warnings earlier this summer. All that pollution turns into ozone and haze and gunk that lingers for days, especially if the air is still.</p><p>But, things are looking up.</p><p>Just five or six years ago, if you saw a Tesla or a Chevy Bolt while you were out for a drive, it was worth turning your head. They were rare birds, those humming little electric vehicles.</p><p>Now Teslas are among the most common cars on the roads, not to mention the Bolts, Kia Souls, Ioniqs, and half a dozen other brands. Soon we\u2019ll start seeing the electric pickups and TransLink and the various school districts will be pitching in with their electric buses, too.</p><p>We already have mostly clean power generation here in B.C. , and with the possibility of offshore and onshore wind power to supplement us in the future, there\u2019s no reason to think that won\u2019t continue.</p><p>So within a few years, we\u2019ll hit a tipping point here in the Lower Mainland.</p><p>The number of internal combustion engines will peak, and start to decline.</p><p>The decline will be faster than anyone thinks is possible. The transition will be weird, as gas stations close down and consolidate, and we frantically build charging stations.</p><p>But a few years into it, we\u2019ll notice that the sky looks different.

No rain fell, most of the creeks dried up, and hayfields withered in the unrelenting heat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On June 3 of that year, two small boys found a packrat's nest in an old shed near Decker Lake and decided to set it alight. The result was a conflagration that quickly spread north and east for several miles, and continued burning until the first snowfall.</p><p>The entire country threatened to go up in smoke. On June 26, a group of reluctant spark-chasers left Burns Lake to attend to another fire reportedly burning in the wilderness northwest of town. The party arrived in Palling so late in the evening that they had to wake the local hotel proprietor and Byron \"Bun\" Smith to arrange for supplies and horses. Smith and an Indigenous guide joined the expedition\u2014which now consisted of nine men\u2014and they set off in search of the elusive fire. After wandering in the wilderness for four days, they found it seven miles (11 km) from their starting point in Burns Lake.</p><p>By July, four hundred fires were burning in the Lakes District and tempers were short. Burns Lake's Dominion Day celebration that year featured a baseball game, several horse races, and a plethora of street fights. Fueled by angst and hard liquor, most of the brawls started in the town's hotels and quickly spread to the main drag, where combatants traded punches and wrestled in the dust. Everyone, it seemed, wanted to hit somebody. One local merchant got into an argument over the origin of a fire and became so incensed that he considered shooting his adversary. After giving the matter some thought, he changed his mind and shot up the downtown core instead.</p><p>Residents in the rural areas kept one eye on the forest and the other on a reliable water source. At Tchesinkut Lake, Margaret Gilgan and her children (including young Bill) watched a wildfire burn toward their home. She enlisted the aid of her neighbour, an Irish hard rock miner named Tom Kelly, and then took steps to protect the family's assets. The children were sent to the lakeshore, after which Margaret hauled water in buckets to Kelly, who stood on the cabin roof and doused sparks. At times, the heat was so intense that his clothing caught fire.</p><p>The Depression years were, for the most part, hot and dry. In June 1930, a forest fire rolled through the Uncha Lake area. At the home of Shell Robinson, an early settler who also served as game warden, flames crept up a steep gulley and destroyed his house, stables, and hayshed before anyone could respond. Fire also razed the Taylor family's barn, but volunteers saved the homes of Mr. and Mrs. C. Corliss and Mr. and Mrs. H. Melander.</p><p>Mrs. Gus Westburg saw the same fire moving toward a high bridge on the Uncha Lake road. Working alone with an axe and mattock, she managed to build a guard around the structure, then carried water to the site in a gasoline can with a handle made of haywire. She saved the bridge at the expense of her hands, which were painfully blistered. Ironically, her home burned to the ground in another fire three years later.</p><p>The year 1932 was much the same. The entire Lakes District, it seemed, was burning. By early summer, eight fires between Francois and Ootsa lakes threatened to merge into one\u2014and another conflagration that extended from Colleymount to Owen Lake was sweeping northward over the height of land toward Rose Lake.</p><p>\"Stands of valuable timber blazing in the fury of enormous forest fires that light the night with lurid glows, and all the Central Interior of British Columbia is threatened with destruction unless the dry weather conditions change,\" reported Sidney Godwin's Observer on June 16, 1932. \"To date, no crews have been put to work, and the fires are increasing in magnitude from day to day. The whole Upper Nechako watershed is a mass of fires, and not only is the timber threatened but life and property are imperilled \u2026 . Ashes have been falling on Burns Lake for over a week, and now the sun gleams dully through the pall of smoke. With present dry conditions prevailing for two more weeks, very little valuable timber may remain and many settlements may be completely wiped out.\"</p><p>The Burns Lake Board of Trade begged the government to take action. In a telegram sent to N. S. Lougheed, provincial minister of lands, the organization stated, \"Fires burning whole countryside. Ootsa Lake, Danskin, Francois Lake threatened with complete devastation. Timber, farmsteads, homes may be absolute loss and Nechako watersheds may be denuded, causing floods in Fraser Valley. Villages along the line of Canadian National Railway also threatened. Urge immediate, energetic action by your department to avert catastrophe.\"</p><p>Lougheed blamed the government's slow response on financial constraints. He may, in part, have been correct; it was the height of the Depression, tax revenue was in short supply, and wildfire suppression was expensive. But his message couldn't have been well-received.</p><p>Firefighting was also labour-intensive. In the era before machinery, manpower was the only defense against wildfire. Gin Saul was one of 150 residents hired to fight fire here in 1922. Each man was handed an axe and a shovel and told to give his all on the fire line for twenty-five cents per hour. The work was hot and dangerous, and often went on around the clock.</p><p>Because of the working conditions, finding enough men for the task wasn't always easy. For much of the past century, the BC Forest Service took a page out of the Royal Navy's playbook and pressed men into service.</p><p>\"We did conscript people, able-bodied people, above a certain age,\" said one former Forest Service employee. \"I think it was between the ages of sixteen and sixty, and usually, we cleaned out the bars. One day, two cops went in the front door of a bar (looking for people to fight fire). Everybody bailed out the back door, and there waiting for them was the paddy wagon \u2026 . It was 'a body, anybody' back then.\"</p><p>\"If you weren't working, they [members of the BC Forest Service] would give you something to do right quick,\" Decker Lake resident Bob Saul said in 2021. \"They got me three times. They'd collect all the young guys\u2014and some of the older ones, too\u2014for firefighting.\"</p><p>The sight of a BC Forest Service vehicle in downtown Burns Lake on a hot summer's day was enough to scatter a crowd. It got to the point where many of the region's young men made themselves scarce at the first sign of smoke, and those left behind went to great lengths to avoid the press gangs.</p><p>\"One time, I was at Larry's Service downtown,\" Bob continued. \"There was [sic] always two or three bystanders hanging around, and while I had a job, there was another young guy there who didn't. In the afternoon, the forestry vehicle pulled up, and this other guy who wasn't working went in and crawled up behind some oil cans (to avoid detection). People nodded toward the back room, and eventually, the forest service guy got the hint and went back there. He tugged the young guy out by his pant legs and took him off to fight fire.\"</p><p>The BC Forest Service was still using questionable recruitment tactics in August 1952 when lightning ignited what was then one of this area's largest wildfires. Smoke from the Co-op fire north of Tintagel billowed eight thousand feet into the air, and was visible as far away as Prince George. At night, people living in Fraser Lake could see the fire's glow.</p><p>Forest Service employees, assisted by police, rounded up two hundred men and seven bulldozers to build fireguards, but the bush was tinder-dry, and the blaze moved so quickly that men and equipment often found themselves facing a hundred-foot wall of flame. On several occasions, firefighters had to down tools and run for their lives.</p><p>Fred Roe of Tchesinkut Lake was operating a bulldozer on the fire line when a burning tree fell across his machine and severed its hydraulic lines. He suffered serious burns and several broken ribs, but survived.</p><p>\"We had this big fire out here at Tintagel,\" he recalled thirty years after the event. \"They sent me out there with a Cat, no canopy on, and a tree fell over, and the Cat burned up. Caved my ribs in, but I stood that.\"</p><p>Not everyone was so lucky. Harold Gordon of Burns Lake and nearly a dozen other men were building guard when a crown fire cut off their escape route. Gordon's colleagues managed to flee, but he did not.</p><p>Another conscript, a man known only as H. Hunter, also went missing during the event. His body was never recovered, which led government officials to speculate that he had simply walked away from the job.</p><p>\"There is an opinion,\" stated the Review on August 21, 1952, \"that he did not like firefighting and 'caught a rattler' [freight train] for parts unknown.\"</p><p>Many of the men might have been unwilling firefighters, but they fought like tigers. By August 19, after destroying sixty thousand acres of timber and the Stearns family sawmill, the Co-op fire was under control.</p><p>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>There have been dozens of fires in the Lakes District since 1952, many of them more destructive. Thanks to climate change, the term \"fire season\" has new meaning, and summers are no longer carefree.</p><p>\u00a9 2022 Lakes District Museum Society</p><p>Copyright 2023 Burns Lake Lakes District News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BURNSL-news20230719PLD4493343</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BURNSL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68RH-5W61-JD2C-J1FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438230</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

It got to the point where many of the region\u2019s young men made themselves scarce at the first sign of smoke, and those left behind went to great lengths to avoid the press gangs.</p><p>\u201cOne time, I was at Larry\u2019s Service downtown,\u201d Bob continued. \u201cThere was [sic] always two or three bystanders hanging around, and while I had a job, there was another young guy there who didn\u2019t. In the afternoon, the forestry vehicle pulled up, and this other guy who wasn\u2019t working went in and crawled up behind some oil cans (to avoid detection). People nodded toward the back room, and eventually, the forest service guy got the hint and went back there. He tugged the young guy out by his pant legs and took him off to fight fire.\u201d</p><p>The BC Forest Service was still using questionable recruitment tactics in August 1952 when lightning ignited what was then one of this area\u2019s largest wildfires. Smoke from the Co-op fire north of Tintagel billowed eight thousand feet into the air, and was visible as far away as Prince George. At night, people living in Fraser Lake could see the fire\u2019s glow.</p><p>Forest Service employees, assisted by police, rounded up two hundred men and seven bulldozers to build fireguards, but the bush was tinder-dry, and the blaze moved so quickly that men and equipment often found themselves facing a hundred-foot wall of flame. On several occasions, firefighters had to down tools and run for their lives.</p><p>Fred Roe of Tchesinkut Lake was operating a bulldozer on the fire line when a burning tree fell across his machine and severed its hydraulic lines. He suffered serious burns and several broken ribs, but survived.</p><p>\u201cWe had this big fire out here at Tintagel,\u201d he recalled thirty years after the event. \u201cThey sent me out there with a Cat, no canopy on, and a tree fell over, and the Cat burned up. Caved my ribs in, but I stood that.\u201d</p><p>Not everyone was so lucky. Harold Gordon of Burns Lake and nearly a dozen other men were building guard when a crown fire cut off their escape route. Gordon\u2019s colleagues managed to flee, but he did not.</p><p>Another conscript, a man known only as H. Hunter, also went missing during the event. His body was never recovered, which led government officials to speculate that he had simply walked away from the job.</p><p>\u201cThere is an opinion,\u201d stated the Review on August 21, 1952, \u201cthat he did not like firefighting and \u2018caught a rattler\u2019 [freight train] for parts unknown.\u201d</p><p>Many of the men might have been unwilling firefighters, but they fought like tigers. By August 19, after destroying sixty thousand acres of timber and the Stearns family sawmill, the Co-op fire was under control.</p><p>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. There have been dozens of fires in the Lakes District since 1952, many of them more destructive. Thanks to climate change, the term \u201cfire season\u201d has new meaning, and summers are no longer carefree.</p><p>\u00a9 2022 Lakes District Museum Society</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BURNSL-news20230719PPMA0003737856</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BURNSL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68RH-5W61-JD2C-J1HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438230</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1610\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

There's a lot to see and a lot of paths to take you there. No more so is that true than in Greater Victoria, which has its own selection of hikes well worth the time. We've taken your top picks and hiked them so you don't have to (but you still should).</p><p>\"Walk through Francis King's mysterious doorway\" \u2013 Francis King Regional Park (Elsie King Trail) - 15 minutes (1/10 difficulty)</p><p>Francis King Regional Park is 107 acres and there is a lot to see. The area is chock full of trails, with Francis King right next to Thetis Lake. One of the shortest but most interesting trails is Elsie King, which starts at the Nature House and has information signs dotted along the boardwalk to highlight some of the interesting features of this forest area. Rarely can you say you learned a lot on a hike, but on Elsie King you can with tree's knees, forest fire scarring and the mysterious doorway all highlights of this trail. The CRD describes the trail as \"universally accessible\" and the boardwalk is smooth throughout, making it a trail for all.</p><p>\"Lots to see at the lake, lots who see it\" \u2013 Thetis Lake (Lower Lake loop trail) - 45 minutes (3/10 difficulty)</p><p>Thetis Lake is a hotspot, especially on hot days. But once you trek past the beaches there's some lovely nature to take in. The park has over 40 kilometers of recreational trails to explore and lots of nature to take in (the park was established as Canada's first nature sanctuary in 1958).</p><p>The lower loop trail is a nice mixture of some short steep hills and flat sections that take you all around the lower portion of the lake (the Upper Lake trail continues on from the Lower Lake trail and doubles the journey time). The trails are definitely quieter the farther away from the beach you get, although there are the occasional paddle boarders or kayakers who cruise by. But as you continue on your walk, you leave the beach behind and become surrounded by trees and nature.</p><p>\"Mill Hill offers marvelous mountain vistas\" \u2013 Mill Hill (Summit trail) - 25 minutes there, 15 minutes back (5/10 difficulty)</p><p>The Mill Hill summit trail may make you lose your breath but you'll gain a greater appreciation for the Island on the way up. The summit is 203 metres up, according to the CRD, and the climb is reasonably steep but thankfully short.</p><p>At the top of this hill, you get views of the West Shore, Esquimalt, the Olympic Mountains and on a clear day, Mount Baker looming over everything. Glorious. Careful on your way down, the trail is rocky gravel and can be slippery, but a worthwhile jaunt nevertheless.</p><p>@moreton_bailey</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bailey.moreton@goldstreamgazette.com\">bailey.moreton@goldstreamgazette.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2022 Victoria News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VICNWS-news20220801PVI4353858</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VICNWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:662F-F441-JD2C-J39B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438261</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Court of Appeal upheld a decision of the B.C. Supreme Court (BCSC) that the case can proceed to a trial.</p><p>A class action is a lawsuit started by one person on behalf of members of a group that have a similar claim against a single person or company. Before a court will take on a class action, a judge must certify that it meets the multiple rules set out in the Class Proceedings Act.</p><p>In this case, according to Kirk's lawyer David Rosenberg, the class consists of 2,776 property owners within the zone that was evacuated after the fuel spill, plus anyone who rented, leased or carried on a business within that zone. These people are not individually named in the court action, and most of them have not actually put their names forward and may not know they are part of the group.</p><p>\"They don't even have to think about it if they don't want to,\" Rosenberg says. \"They can sit back and wait.\"</p><p>They would each get a share of any monetary damages that may be awarded by the court. Anyone who suffered damages that they think are extraordinary, above and beyond the average, can come forward later and declare this, Rosenberg says.</p><p>In the summer of 2013, Executive Flight Centre Fuel Services Ltd. was providing fuel to the provincial government to fight a forest fire in the area of Lemon Creek in the Slocan Valley. Its tanker truck overturned and spilled 35,000 litres of jet fuel into the creek, polluting the stream and causing a local evacuation of people living up to 40 kilometres downstream in the Slocan Valley.</p><p>The spill killed fish and forced residents to get alternate sources of drinking water for themselves and livestock for days.</p><p>The trial will determine who was at fault for the spill and how much should be paid to the members of the class action group.</p><p>The delay</p><p>In 2017, a judge of the BCSC certified that Kirk's class action could proceed.</p><p>The defendants \u2013 Executive Flight Centre, the Province of B.C., Transwest Helicopters, and the fuel truck driver Danny LaSante \u2014 appealed that decision to the B.C. Court of Appeal.</p><p>The appeal judges said that before the action could be certified, the BCSC judge must clarify certain complex issues related to evidence. The BCSC judge did that, and then re-certified the case as a class action.</p><p>The defendants then appealed that decision to the appeal court, whose judges have now ruled again in favour of Kirk.</p><p>David Rosenberg, Kirk's Vancouver lawyer, says he expects there will be a trial within a year, in B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver.</p><p>He added that although class actions typically take a long time, the delays in this one have been extraordinary.</p><p>\"I've been doing this for over 40 years \u2014 I do a lot of class action work \u2014 and I have never before seen a certification, then a de-certification, recertification, and two appeals on a certification.\"</p><p>He said for a class action on an environmental issue to be certified is unusual.</p><p>\"The courts have not been that amenable to environmental class actions,\" he says.</p><p>The issues</p><p>The issues that were argued in the appeals are referred to as nuisance and aggregate damages, which are far more complex than the following two-paragraph summary.</p><p>Did the people affected by the spill suffer nuisance in common, as well as individually? If so, this is one basis for a class action. Did the group suffer monetary damages in common, as well as individually? If yes, this is another basis.</p><p>Nuisance and damages in this case refer not only to contamination of water from the spill but the inconvenience caused by the evacuation order and water-use restrictions that were imposed by the province, Rosenberg says.</p><p>The Nelson Star reached out to the Ministry of Attorney General for comment on this decision, with no response. Executive Flight Centre had not responded to a request for comment by the Nelson Star's press deadline on Jan. 24.</p><p>Charges under the Fisheries Act</p><p>The defendants were also charged under the Fisheries Act with polluting a stream frequented by fish. Those charges were entirely separate from Kirk's class action lawsuit.</p><p>In February, 2020, as a result of the Fisheries Act charges, Executive Flight Centre was fined $175,000 and the fuel truck driver Danny LaSante was fined $20,000. The provincial government was acquitted.</p><p>READ MORE:</p><p>\u07e6 Lemon Creek class-action lawyer frustrated by province's tactics</p><p>\u07e6 Slocan Valley's Lemon Creek fuel spill class action suit gets second go-ahead</p><p>\u07e6 Defendants appeal Lemon Creek fuel spill class action decision</p><p>\u07e6 Trucking company fined $175K for Lemon Creek fuel spill</p><p>\u07e6 Lemon Creek spill: driver guilty, provincial government acquitted</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bill.metcalfe@nelsonstar.com\">bill.metcalfe@nelsonstar.com</email> Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2023 Golden Star</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOLDEN-news20230125PGA4424043</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GOLDEN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67DG-NF71-JD2C-J4PG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438290</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Court of Appeal upheld a decision of the B.C. Supreme Court (BCSC) that the case can proceed to a trial.</p><p>A class action is a lawsuit started by one person on behalf of members of a group that have a similar claim against a single person or company. Before a court will take on a class action, a judge must certify that it meets the multiple rules set out in the Class Proceedings Act.</p><p>In this case, according to Kirk's lawyer David Rosenberg, the class consists of 2,776 property owners within the zone that was evacuated after the fuel spill, plus anyone who rented, leased or carried on a business within that zone. These people are not individually named in the court action, and most of them have not actually put their names forward and may not know they are part of the group.</p><p>\"They don't even have to think about it if they don't want to,\" Rosenberg says. \"They can sit back and wait.\"</p><p>They would each get a share of any monetary damages that may be awarded by the court. Anyone who suffered damages that they think are extraordinary, above and beyond the average, can come forward later and declare this, Rosenberg says.</p><p>In the summer of 2013, Executive Flight Centre Fuel Services Ltd. was providing fuel to the provincial government to fight a forest fire in the area of Lemon Creek in the Slocan Valley. Its tanker truck overturned and spilled 35,000 litres of jet fuel into the creek, polluting the stream and causing a local evacuation of people living up to 40 kilometres downstream in the Slocan Valley.</p><p>The spill killed fish and forced residents to get alternate sources of drinking water for themselves and livestock for days.</p><p>The trial will determine who was at fault for the spill and how much should be paid to the members of the class action group.</p><p>The delay</p><p>In 2017, a judge of the BCSC certified that Kirk's class action could proceed.</p><p>The defendants \u2013 Executive Flight Centre, the Province of B.C., Transwest Helicopters, and the fuel truck driver Danny LaSante \u2014 appealed that decision to the B.C. Court of Appeal.</p><p>The appeal judges said that before the action could be certified, the BCSC judge must clarify certain complex issues related to evidence. The BCSC judge did that, and then re-certified the case as a class action.</p><p>The defendants then appealed that decision to the appeal court, whose judges have now ruled again in favour of Kirk.</p><p>David Rosenberg, Kirk's Vancouver lawyer, says he expects there will be a trial within a year, in B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver.</p><p>He added that although class actions typically take a long time, the delays in this one have been extraordinary.</p><p>\"I've been doing this for over 40 years \u2014 I do a lot of class action work \u2014 and I have never before seen a certification, then a de-certification, recertification, and two appeals on a certification.\"</p><p>He said for a class action on an environmental issue to be certified is unusual.</p><p>\"The courts have not been that amenable to environmental class actions,\" he says.</p><p>The issues</p><p>The issues that were argued in the appeals are referred to as nuisance and aggregate damages, which are far more complex than the following two-paragraph summary.</p><p>Did the people affected by the spill suffer nuisance in common, as well as individually? If so, this is one basis for a class action. Did the group suffer monetary damages in common, as well as individually? If yes, this is another basis.</p><p>Nuisance and damages in this case refer not only to contamination of water from the spill but the inconvenience caused by the evacuation order and water-use restrictions that were imposed by the province, Rosenberg says.</p><p>The Nelson Star reached out to the Ministry of Attorney General for comment on this decision, with no response. Executive Flight Centre had not responded to a request for comment by the Nelson Star's press deadline on Jan. 24.</p><p>Charges under the Fisheries Act</p><p>The defendants were also charged under the Fisheries Act with polluting a stream frequented by fish. Those charges were entirely separate from Kirk's class action lawsuit.</p><p>In February, 2020, as a result of the Fisheries Act charges, Executive Flight Centre was fined $175,000 and the fuel truck driver Danny LaSante was fined $20,000. The provincial government was acquitted.</p><p>READ MORE:</p><p>\u07e6 Lemon Creek class-action lawyer frustrated by province's tactics</p><p>\u07e6 Slocan Valley's Lemon Creek fuel spill class action suit gets second go-ahead</p><p>\u07e6 Defendants appeal Lemon Creek fuel spill class action decision</p><p>\u07e6 Trucking company fined $175K for Lemon Creek fuel spill</p><p>\u07e6 Lemon Creek spill: driver guilty, provincial government acquitted</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bill.metcalfe@nelsonstar.com\">bill.metcalfe@nelsonstar.com</email> Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2023 Nelson Star</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20230125PKO4424433</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67DH-3R41-F0HF-80KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.
