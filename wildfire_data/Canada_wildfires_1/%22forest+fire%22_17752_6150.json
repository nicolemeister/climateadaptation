Liberal government to provide economic diversification to communities of 15,000 population or smaller, many of them dependent on a single industry. That changed Sept. 17 when Forests Minister Doug Donaldson announced ministry funds have been reallocated for this year.</p><p>B.C. Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson hosted rural community representatives at the Union of B.C. Municipalities convention Tuesday, where they took turns blasting the decision.</p><p>Williams Lake Mayor Walt Cobb said his community was counting on funds to help upgrade its water system.</p><p>Cobb noted the city is currently on a water quality advisory due to levels of manganese found in the water which does not meet Health Canada's new water quality guidelines.</p><p>\"We can't wait two years,\" Cobb said.</p><p>Wilkinson said the current year's rural fund has 338 applications, totalling $35 million in needed assistance. The province has $300 million that was \"left on the table\" after a calm forest fire season, and that money should be available to help with rural needs whether they are related to mill closures or not, he said.</p><p>The new assistance fund is $69 million over two years, directed to four B.C. Interior communities that have seen a permanent closure or indefinite curtailment of mills: Quesnel, Chasm, Vavenby and Fort St. James.</p><p>RELATED: B.C. offers early retirement, training fund for forest workers</p><p>RELATED: Teal-Jones shuts down remaining B.C. coast logging work</p><p>Port McNeill had an application in for the earlier fund, and Mayor Gaby Wickstrom was first to speak out publicly about the decision to defer applications to next year.</p><p>Part 1 - Listening to Minister Donaldson answer questions at the @truckloggerBC's dinner. Not quite understanding why Rural Dividend Funds needed to be redirected to address the Interior Forestry crisis. Those communities need both funding pools. #bcpoli #ubcm&amp;mdash; Gaby Wickstrom (@GabyWickstrom) September 24, 2019</p><p>\"Rural communities are going to keep knocking on the minister's door until someone realizes the reallocation of the rural dividend funds has been a big mistake,\" Wickstrom tweeted from the UBCM convention.</p><p>Donaldson sent letters to applicants for the rural dividend fund on the day the sawmill relief fund was announced, advising them their grant applications are \"suspended until further notice\" to help those hardest hit by a wave of mill closures across the Interior.</p><p>\"I recognize the importance of this program and the services it supports,\" Donaldson said in the letter. \"Staff are working with colleagues across other ministries to identify options for alternative funding, with an emphasis on community economic development and diversification.\"</p><p>Donaldson said projects funded through rural dividend funds in previous years are unaffected, and \"all funded applicants are encouraged to continue to implement projects and complete the necessary reporting requirements.\"</p><p>@tomfletcherbc <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tfletcher@blackpress.caLike\">tfletcher@blackpress.caLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on</p><p>\"<url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/BlackPressMedia\">http://twitter.com/BlackPressMedia</url>\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-3873739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4D-JV91-JDH1-C1WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"536\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Williams Lake Tribune Advisor</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 24, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000518</classCode><className>DIVIDENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001331</classCode><className>PLANT CLOSINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000549</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

(CP) - Residents of a small British Columbia city were put on evacuation alert Thursday as a growing forest fire came within a few hundred metres of their homes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fire outside Penticton, population 27,000, grew overnight to between 150 and 200 hectares from 24 hectares Wednesday evening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"An evacuation plan is in place, but it's not imminent,'' Laverne Cormier, spokeswoman with the Penticton Forest District, said Thursday.</p><p>\"This is a safety precaution - we certainly don't want to alarm people.''</p><p>Casey Saliken, whose home is nestled in the woods about 400 metres across the Ellis Creek canyon from the blaze, was among dozens of onlookers watching aerial tankers dump retardant on the fire.</p><p>Although the cause of the fire wasn't known, she believes it started near a dam on the creek.</p><p>\"I hiked up there when it was still small and it was just past the dam where it started,'' she said.</p><p>\"The water bombers scouted it out and it seemed so innocuous and then half an hour later it just exploded.''</p><p>Saliken was worried because she has no direct water to her home. As she spoke, her three horses neighed apprehensively, pacing back and forth in their nearby pen.</p><p>\"If the wind kicked up now, it'd sure be scary,'' she said. \"I've hiked quite a bit in that area and it's covered with old man's beard (dead brush) which would burn easily.''</p><p>Cormier said Thursday the front of the fire to the south was starting to pick up and ground crews were trying to block it.</p><p>The northeast corner was the most active, with fire climbing up the hill and away from homes.</p><p>\"I doubt the fire will be contained today, more likely tomorrow, but it really depends on the weather,'' she said.</p><p>About 100 firefighters from forest district units in Vernon, Princeton and Kamloops were on the scene early, with more being called in.</p><p>Besides the water bombers, firefighters are using helicopters equipped with buckets and crews that can drop by rope from helicopters into inaccessible places.</p><p>Bright orange flames were visible from everywhere in the southern Okanagan city Wednesday night as people stopped to watch the water bombers attack the blaze.</p><p>Roadblocks were set up to limit traffic into threatened areas.</p><p>Dennis Gaudry, Ministry of Forests resource protection officer, said the steep, rocky terrain added to the difficulties of controlling the fire.</p><p>Winds were calm Thursday but the weather remained hot and dry.</p><p>The recent heat wave has dried up forests and sagebrush throughout the southern Interior, from Kamloops to the Canada-U.S. border.</p><p>Campfire bans were ordered for much of the region as dry lightning was predicted for the Okanagan today.</p><p>Near Kamloops, eight hectares burned in the Dew Drop area Tuesday from a human-caused fire, said Tracy Hendry, Kamloops Forest District fire control officer.</p><p>Last Saturday, 77 hectares between Valleyview and Juniper Ridge were scorched by some teens playing with matches.

KRC owns and maintains the track.</p><p>Tom McCahill, general manager for KRC, said that more than 25 metres of track across a small creek needs rebuilding. The site will be examined by an engineering firm to estimate the cost of rebuilding the bridge, but only when the firm can get to the location, McCahill said.</p><p>In the meantime, KRC will temporarily patch the track, laying lines across steel culvert and earth fill, he said. He estimated patching work will take a couple of days but can't start until work crews can get to the site.</p><p>Until the track repairs are done, the Northern Store and a local co-op in Pukatawagan have been bringing in food and supplies by plane. The co-op, the People's Store, has increased prices to cover the higher freight costs.</p><p>Pukatawagan Chief Shirley Castel said the people can't afford the increases in the price of food.</p><p>''Most of them have spent their welfare issuance already because of the high cost of food,'' Castel said.</p><p>The Northern Store hasn't increased prices but can't bring in enough to serve the community.</p><p>''We brought in dry goods and perishable foods a couple of days ago, but we've already run out,'' said Brian McKay, grocery manager at the Northern Store.</p><p>McKay said Northern executives in Winnipeg have told him not to increase prices, but he doesn't know how long that policy will remain in place if the railroad bridge isn't fixed soon.</p><p>(Winnipeg Free Press)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20080609CPCPG4750</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4SR0-3YH0-TX4V-K184-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"406\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>June 9, 2008 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The fire spared much \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the townsite, and eventually burned just over 19,000 hectares.</p><p>Read more:</p><p>A different type of beauty will emerge in Waterton park after 2017 wildfire, officials say</p><p>The rise of ecoanxiety: How smoke in Alberta might affect your mental health</p><p>Wildfire along Bow River sends smoke billowing over Cochrane</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2018082447204658</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T3R-13J1-JBTY-W4K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"344\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 24, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX429</classCode><className>CALGARY, AB, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They're frustrated. There's anger,\" Chief Alex McDougall of Wasagamack First Nation said as he waited along with hundreds of others to board one of two military transport planes bound for Winnipeg, more than 500 kilometres to the south.</p><p>\"Some of us have been sleeping in terminals. Some of us have been sleeping in gymnasiums. There is some food being provided by the local (grocery) stores.\"</p><p>All 2,000 residents of Wasagamack had to leave Tuesday as a large forest fire came within 800 metres of the community. Because there is no airstrip, people took turns piling into boats in small groups for a 20-minute journey across a section of Island Lake to St. Theresa Point.</p><p>Smoke from the blaze also forced out people with health problems from the St. Theresa Point and Garden Hill reserves. Small charter planes, that can carry between nine and 45 people, began ferrying people south to Brandon and Winnipeg on Wednesday, but a backlog persisted.</p><p>Thursday morning, two Hercules military transport planes, each capable of carrying 100 people, joined the effort. But the large aircraft could only use the airstrip at Garden Hill, McDougall said, so he and others had to take a two-hour trip by barge from St. Theresa Point to Garden Hill.</p><p>In Winnipeg, the Canadian Red Cross prepared to welcome the evacuees by turning a 4,300-square-metre hall at the city's convention centre into an emergency shelter. Volunteers, including members of the Bear Clan Patrol - a non-profit that keeps an eye on inner-city streets - were busy setting up more than 1,000 cots, dozens of eating tables and more.</p><p>\"We're going to have an area where people can get personal services like hygiene products, hygiene kits, health needs, that sort of thing,\" said Shawn Feely, the Canadian Red Cross's regional vice-president.</p><p>\"Then we have the sleep area ... and then we have the eating area and the recreation area. So for little kids, we'll have people running activities.\"</p><p>By early afternoon, there was a long lineup of evacuees to register at the convention centre. Among them was Malcolm Harper, who had spent two nights in transit with his wife and three children, aged four, 11 and 13 after leaving Wasagamack for St. Theresa Point. </p><p>\"The first night, they put us in classrooms in the school ... you could hear everybody, kids crying,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's frustrating, especially on the kids. You've got to keep them together.\"</p><p>Other evacuees, however, were being put up in hotel rooms throughout Winnipeg and Brandon.</p><p>Darlene Monias, standing in line at the convention centre, said she's grateful to be safe but wonders why she wasn't selected for the more private accommodations.</p><p>\"How am I going to handle my babies? They're six and eight, they're all running around.\"</p><p>Kevin Hart, a regional chief with the Assembly of First Nations, said having elders sleeping on cots in the croweded convention centre is simply unacceptable.</p><p>\"The respect for our elders is first and foremost,\" he said. \"I can't see that being a problem, with young able-bodies people transferring out of hotels to give up their beds for the elders.\"</p><p>The Manitoba government said the forest fire was still about one kilometre from Wasagamack, and crews were working the line closest to the community to prevent it from advancing.</p><p>McDougall said from his vantage point in Garden Hill Thursday morning - just before boarding a Hercules - the smoke seemed to be blowing away.</p><p>\"We have some relief today from the smoke but ... there's still some heavy smoke and fires burning in the area.\"</p><p>-- with files from CTV Winnipeg</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-b6ad530cb50449389726c24b5c3ea364</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PCM-0WC1-JBVR-31H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"630\"/><timeReceived>09:55 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 31, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The City will also finalize programming options for the space with plans to release more details in the coming months. Hutchins said Langford is investing $500,000 into the safety and improvements of the site.</p><p>READ ALSO: Metchosin kayaking event sells out in under an hour</p><p>\"I think the goal for the property is to provide an oceanfront location within Langford for all residents to recreate in a variety of ways at a price point that is affordable for all,\" Hutchins said.</p><p>Petrie said the Langford fire chief is also working to ensure the area is better-served in terms of forest fire safety. An additional fire rescue boat with the appropriate pumps to fight fires will be added to the area.</p><p>The City is looking at working with SD62 as well to see how the property can be used as an outdoor classroom and provide educational opportunities for youths. Petrie said the possibility of having Rowing BC there can benefit Langford youths, as well.</p><p>\"It's giving youths oceanfront access to get them on the water and build confidence, skills and educational perspectives,\" Petrie said. \"And with Rowing BC, it falls in line with high-performance sports in Langford.

When the winds were driving the fire last Monday, it was rocketing embers 10 kilometres in advance of a 100-metre wall of flame.</p><p>And late Friday, wind-driven flames jumped fireguards on the fire's southwestern boundary. Water bombers were able to beat them back, but not before the fire consumed another 100 hectares of forest, Strickland said.</p><p>There were no communities in the area where the fire broke through the fireguard, he said.</p><p>Residents of Smith and Hondo, who have been evacuated previously, remained on evacuation alert.</p><p>Although moderate winds were blowing over the fire Saturday, firefighters experienced a less anxious day on the firelines.</p><p>The fire, which began near a CN rail line May 23, has already destroyed nine homes in the hamlet of Chisholm.</p><p>The province has spent more than $7 million fighting the blaze, 150 km north of Edmonton.</p><p>Nearly 400 forest fires in the province so far this year have destroyed 20 homes and more than 1,400 square kilometres of forest.</p><p>About 1,055 firefighters were fighting a total of 22 fires in the province Saturday, including three which were burning out of control. They received reinforcements late Friday with the arrival of 80 more firefighters from Ontario and 80 from B.C., bringing the total number of out-of-province firefighters to 620.</p><p>Already, Alberta forest fires have eaten up half the province's $60 million fire budget. The fires are being blamed on tinder dry conditions stemming from one of the driest winters in 130 years.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-200106020056</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:46YX-VM80-01G6-84DV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"397\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>June 2, 2001 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>CNR (TSX)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0CNI (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS482111 LINE-HAUL RAILROADS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0SIC4011 RAILROADS, LINE-HAUL OPERATING\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00097CW</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BUDGETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>STX001319</classCode><className>PETS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00097CW</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BUDGETS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

approximately $20 million.</p><p>\"While the analysis demonstrates that an airport would be feasible, it is only feasible if an appropriate site can be found adjacent to a major road close to the new hospital, that $7 million is accessed for the start-up capital, and that the community supports the construction of the new airport,\" concluded Patricia Maloney, a project manager for Dillon Consulting, in the report that was presented to the Cowichan Valley Regional District.</p><p>\"Additionally, sufficient demand for industrial land is required as a primary revenue source to support the airport's ongoing operation.\"</p><p>RELATED STORY: AIR TRANSPORT IN THE COWICHAN VALLEY SUBJECT OF NEW STUDY</p><p>The report recommends that current and future regional planning initiatives undertaken within the CVRD consider the potential benefits of a multi-use regional air transport facility which, along with commercial uses, would also provide essential air services, including air ambulance, search and rescue, emergency evacuation, and forest fire response.</p><p>\"If the CVRD's board believes that this study has demonstrated the merit of the construction of a Cowichan Valley airport, the next step is to investigate potential locations, complete community engagement and complete the studies to determine the actual 'developability' and costs of the selected site,\" Maloney said.</p><p>The report envisions an airport with a 3,500-foot paved runway that would serve smaller commercial aircraft, such as the King Air 350 which holds up to 11 passengers, among its uses.</p><p>The CVRD commissioned the report in January to determine the current status of air transport in the region and what will be required to meet growing demands.</p><p>The only existing airstrip currently operating in the Cowichan region is on Langtry Road and is leased to the Duncan Flying Club by the gravel company Butler Brothers, but that airstrip is predicted to have a finite life span due to its location and the long-term resource needs of the gravel company.</p><p>RELATED STORY: NANAIMO AIRPORT SOARS PAST COMOX TO BECOME SECOND-BUSIEST AIRPORT ON ISLAND</p><p>The report also pointed out that while most residents will agree that an airport will provide benefit to the community as a whole, the people who live near the future airport may object to the noise, traffic, and perceived safety issues of developing a new airport close to them.</p><p>The report was received by the CVRD's regional services committee, but for information only and no action was determined at this time.</p><p>CVRD board chairman Ian Morrison said he thinks the report provided the committee with some excellent information to consider.</p><p>He said he's in favour of increasing the district's transportation infrastructure.</p><p>\"But I have no inclination at this time on whether it should be privately or publicly run, or its location,\" Morrison said.</p><p>\"Some more thinking has to be done on this issue.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:robert.barron@cowichanvalleycitizen.comLike\">robert.barron@cowichanvalleycitizen.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on

Keeping the grass and vegetation maintained will also help in the efforts to protect your home or property,\" said Dewar.</p><p>He added that those who enjoy outdoor recreation outdoor should exercise caution when off-roading in the backcountry, and using tools and handling, storing and disposing of materials and fuels can all cause a wildfire.</p><p>Reporting a wildfire or irresponsible behaviour is crucial to ensuring wildfires are responded to as soon as possible. To report a wildfire or irresponsible behaviour call 1 800 663-5555 or *5555 from a cell phone.</p><p>All calls are answered by BC Wildfire Service staff at the Provincial Forest Fire Reporting Centre. Any information you can provide is helpful. You can expect the emergency call taker to ask for details about the fire, including location, size, type of fuel or what is burning, colour of flame or smoke.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KITINS-3644990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KITINS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T2M-38X1-F105-605C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438223</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"345\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kitimat Northern Sentinel</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 17, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Cellular Services</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDBFODkzRTVGMjcxNEJEMkE5OEJERjZBMDUyQ0JBOEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODgzMzVFMEM4REFFNDc0MTg3NUU4OUEwQzE4MDBGRUY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLQ6</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE MATERIALS &amp; PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DFTB</classCode><className>STATES OF EMERGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CUY6</classCode><className>POWER TOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001728</classCode><className>TOBACCO PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

is a sufficient demand for a new airport in the Cowichan Valley, according to a study prepared by Dillon Consulting Ltd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But its success would depend on whether the airport's owners, whoever they would be, are successful in obtaining up-front capital for development, and the strength of the marketing of the airport to attract tenants and create revenue.</p><p>Based on a number of assumptions, the study demonstrated that the total cost of a new airport would be approximately $20 million.</p><p>\"While the analysis demonstrates that an airport would be feasible, it is only feasible if an appropriate site can be found adjacent to a major road close to the new hospital, that $7 million is accessed for the start-up capital, and that the community supports the construction of the new airport,\" concluded Patricia Maloney, a project manager for Dillon Consulting, in the report that was presented Oct. 23 to the Cowichan Valley Regional District.</p><p>\"Additionally, sufficient demand for industrial land is required as a primary revenue source to support the airport's ongoing operation.\"</p><p>RELATED STORY: AIR TRANSPORT IN THE COWICHAN VALLEY SUBJECT OF NEW STUDY</p><p>The report recommends that current and future regional planning initiatives undertaken within the CVRD consider the potential benefits of a multi-use regional air transport facility which, along with commercial uses, would also provide essential air services, including air ambulance, search and rescue, emergency evacuation, and forest fire response.</p><p>\"If the CVRD's board believes that this study has demonstrated the merit of the construction of a Cowichan Valley airport, the next step is to investigate potential locations, complete community engagement and complete the studies to determine the actual 'developability' and costs of the selected site,\" Maloney said.</p><p>The report envisions an airport with a 3,500-foot paved runway that would serve smaller commercial aircraft, such as the King Air 350 which holds up to 11 passengers, among its uses.</p><p>The CVRD commissioned the report in January to determine the

As well as the Spanish help, Morocco sent Portugal one of its firefighting planes.Spain's assistance came as part of the European Union's civil protection system that provides for mutual aid in emergency situations, said Christos Stylianides, the EU commissioner for civil protection.It is the second time this summer that Portugal has had to call for European help. In June, a massive forest fire killed 64 people and injured more than 200 more near Pedrogao Grande in central Portugal. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031502724075368251765700038</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P7T-RTX1-F03R-N0R4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"250\"/><timeReceived>3:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 14, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100GM</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00099QF</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC324</classCode><className>PORTUGAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>GC360</classCode><className>MOROCCO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

On Monday, July 23, a day before four area fire departments converged on a serious forest fire in tinder-dry Milford Bay, they got their scare though. </p><p>Department chief Lorne McNeice explained Monday afternoon Gravenhurst crews responded a grass and forest fire along the dead-end Conservation Road, south of Doe Lake Road. He said concerns were running high with the excessively dry conditions, but fortunately within about three and a half hours the blaze was contained, consuming 0.2 hectares of land there. Because of the particularly dry conditions, crews returned Tuesday morning briefly to re-soak and check for flare-ups, but none were reported. \"It's too hard to tell exactly what the cause may have been there, but it certainly could have been (human caused),\" he said. About two weeks ago a Muskoka district-wide, full fire ban was put in place and as of press time had not been lifted. While other regional crews have had hard times dealing with fires in the extreme, dry conditions, McNeice said his volunteers have been saved any major catastrophes. \"We have been responding to a lot of burning complaints, there's lots of burning even with the ban on,\" he said. \"We've had our fingers crossed for a few good days of rain before anything too bad happens.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2012072820761469</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5674-F8T1-F197-52Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"229\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Wildfire Service put in a request for more help as national support began to ebb. Skrepnek said other provinces were preparing to deal with their own wildfires. Ontario asked for crews from</p><p>Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan as part of the cross-border Great Lakes forest fire agreement.</p><p>\"They're certainly not new to fighting fires\" in this part of the country, Skrepnek said, as some have helped Alberta in previous years.</p><p>As of last week, there had been 840 fires across B.C. since April 1, with 138 active wildfires burning. Firefighting costs for the 460,000 hectares that had burned so far this season exceeded $200 million.</p><p>The roughly 130 international personnel joined close to 4000 crew members already working across B.C. Of those, 761 are also out of province, while 1500 are contractors. The ground crews are supported by nearly 200 aircraft.</p><p>As of last week, the biggest fire and ongoing challenge for crews was the Elephant Hill fire, near Cache Creek.

Those are the people we are most concerned about during the smoky conditions.\"</p><p>She suggests those affected by smoke should of course, seek cleaner air indoors.</p><p>Pollock added, \"You can create a clean air shelter in your home using a portable HEPA air filtration unit and you can seek cleaner air in a public building such as a library, a community centre or shopping mall.\"</p><p>Forest fire smoke is a complex mixture of gases and particles that can change rapidly in both space and time.</p><p>From a health perspective, the very small particles are concerning because they can penetrate deep into the lungs and irritate tissue because the body interprets particulate the same way it would a bacterium or virus.</p><p>The matter can snowball if the person experiences an immunological response to the particles, which can trigger whole body inflammation, thereby affecting organs beyond the lungs.</p><p>Pollock is reminding the public to contact Health Link by phoning 8-1-1 for further information about protection measures during smoky conditions, and to call 9-1-1 if someone is having a medical emergency.</p><p>Three new lightning-caused fires were sparked near Ladybird Creek, 24 kilometers (km) northwest of Castlegar, on Monday.</p><p>Kachman said ground crews assessed and ranked firefighting priorities on Tuesday.

(CP) - Hundreds of residents of this Okanagan Valley resort town were ordered to leave their homes Monday as an out-of-control forest fire licked at suburban subdivisions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The order came after a rapidly spreading inferno jumped a containment barrier in rugged hills overlooking the city of 27,000, located at the south end of Okanagan Lake about 250 kilometres east of Vancouver.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Monday afternoon, the leading edges of the fires were within a few hundred metres of the city's outer limit and less than five kilometres from the downtown core.</p><p>\"This is a real threat,'' said Forests Ministry spokesan Maurice Davidson. \"This is about as serious as it gets.''</p><p>As the fire roared through tinder-dry sagebrush, grassland and lodgepole pine at the edge of the city, officials ordered residents away from one rural and four city subdivisions. The total number of people ordered out was estimated at 500.</p><p>\"It's scary as hell,'' said David Lieskovsky, emergency response centre spokesman.</p><p>Smoky city streets were clogged with cars late Monday as anxious residents raced home to pack up precious belongings and others headed to the Penticton Community Centre for temporary shelter.</p><p>\"We're telling people to take only a few personal possessions and leave as quickly as possible,'' said Roger Venables, spokesman for the Pentiction Forest District.</p><p>Power officials said the fire threatened the city's power source.</p><p>Mike Bradshaw, spokesman for West Kootenay Power, said if the fire cuts through a feed from the nearby town of Oliver it could leave Penticton and the South Okanagan without electricity.</p><p>The fire approached Penticton last week but then changed direction. It turned again Monday, ballooning to 1,000 hectares from 500 on Sunday.</p><p>Smoke billowed up the valley. In Kelowna, 60 kilometres to the north, residents said ash was falling from the sky and forming a thin film on parked cars.</p><p>The hot, dry conditions heightened the forest fire flashpoint in British Columbia where authorities say if present weather persists it could be a costly summer.</p><p>The southern Interior was hardest hit as temperatures hit the high 30s and humidity was in the 25 per cent range.</p><p>Thunderstorms, which because of lightning strikes produce more new fires rather than dampening existing ones, swept through the area overnight along with gusting winds.</p><p>\"It was an average summer for forest fires until we got this blitz of high temperatures and low humidity,'' Sylvia Pang, spokeswoman for the B.C. Forest Service, said from Victoria.</p><p>She said there were 168 fires burning throughout the province on Monday, up from 129 Sunday and including 147 new fires in the last four days.</p><p>So far, 1,051 fires have charred more than 4,200 hectares and cost $12 million to fight. About 750 fires burned 2,650 hectares by this time last year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199407250321</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1994</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:470N-T7H0-01G6-82FS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"467\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1994 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"1994\"><dateText>July 25, 1994 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>WEST KOOTENAY POWER LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>PENTICTON COMMUNITY CENTRE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN6R</classCode><className>PUBLIC OFFICIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001645</classCode><className>SUBURBS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLYR</classCode><className>PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000218</classCode><className>BUDGETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001359</classCode><className>POWER FAILURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001794</classCode><className>VEHICLE TRAFFIC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX055</classCode><className>VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Those are the people we are most concerned about during the smoky conditions.\"</p><p>She suggests those affected by smoke should of course, seek cleaner air indoors.</p><p>Pollock added, \"You can create a clean air shelter in your home using a portable HEPA air filtration unit and you can seek cleaner air in a public building such as a library, a community centre or shopping mall.\"</p><p>Forest fire smoke is a complex mixture of gases and particles that can change rapidly in both space and time.</p><p>From a health perspective, the very small particles are concerning because they can penetrate deep into the lungs and irritate tissue because the body interprets particulate the same way it would a bacterium or virus.</p><p>The matter can snowball if the person experiences an immunological response to the particles, which can trigger whole body inflammation, thereby affecting organs beyond the lungs.</p><p>Pollock is reminding the public to contact Health Link by phoning 8-1-1 for further information about protection measures during smoky conditions, and to call 9-1-1 if someone is having a medical emergency.</p><p>Three new lightning-caused fires were sparked near Ladybird Creek, 24 kilometers (km) northwest of Castlegar, on Monday.</p><p>Kachman said ground crews assessed and ranked firefighting priorities on Tuesday. The first one was extinguished that night, and by Wednesday, another was under control and the third was being held.</p><p>She reported five new lightning-caused fires from Tuesday, all are near the south border of Granby Park, which is about 60 km northeast of Grand Forks.</p><p>On Wednesday, four of those wildfires encompassed less than one hectare each, while the largest - the Bluejoint fire - covered approximately 30 hectares.</p><p>Ground crews were fighting all five incidents with the aid of air tankers and helicopters.</p><p>In the East Kootenay, crews were working on four lightning-caused fires in the Moyie Lake area as well as two new fires discovered near White River, about 38 km northwest of Elkford.</p><p>The Southeast Fire Centre extends from the U.S. border in the south to the Mica Dam in the north and from the Okanagan Highlands and Monashee Mountains in the west to the B.C.-Alberta border in the east.

It was one of 53 wildfires burning in the province, 10 of which were out of control.</p><p>John Cottreau, a spokesperson for the Transportation Safety Board, said the fire situation could make it difficult to find a spare helicopter necessary to lift the chopper that crashed into Lesser Slave Lake on Friday out of the water.</p><p>The pilot of the chopper, which was engaged in fighting a fire at the summer village of Canyon Creek, was declared dead at the scene after being pulled from the wreckage and frigid water by rescuers.</p><p>Cottreau said the crashed helicopter must be loaded onto a truck and driven into the safety board's regional facilities in Edmonton as part of the investigation. He said divers have been contracted, and that the next step would be to find a helicopter that could be spared from the firefighting effort in order to lift the wreckage from the lake.</p><p>''It won't be out of the water until tomorrow (Sunday) at dinner time,'' Cottreau said on Saturday afternoon, noting the fire situation was ''certainly not helping.''</p><p>''Everybody's 100 per cent in the weeds right now and our guys are just quietly trying to conduct this investigation,'' Cottreau noted.</p><p>The Bell 212 craft is owned by Campbell Helicopters of Abbotsford, B.C., and was working on contract with the Alberta government to fight several wildfires in the area.</p><p>The dead pilot's name has not yet been released.</p><p>The crash came shortly after Prime Minister <person><nameText>Stephen Harper </nameText></person>and Premier Ed Stelmach toured the stricken community on Friday.</p><p>The province noted Saturday that many displaced residents of Slave lake were moving from evacuation centres into hotel rooms, thanks to a financial assistance program.</p><p>The Alberta government has announced it will help people who can't find or afford temporary housing and will cover their costs until the end of August.</p><p>A government assistance program will also provide adults with $1,250 each to spend as they see fit, while each child will get $500.</p><p>But it's still a grind for evacuees, who have no idea when they'll be allowed to go home.</p><p>Evacuee Crystal Attilon says she's sick and tired of eating donated food and wearing donated clothes while she waits in a motel room.</p><p>Although tensions are high among evacuees, some say they are grateful for the money the Alberta government has already started to pay out.</p><p>''I have prescriptions for my children to fill and we need clothing,'' said Angela Lindsey, who is staying at an evacuation centre in Edmonton. ''I came out with a pair of shorts on.''</p><p>Alberta Employment Minister Thomas Lukaszuk said the government understands the fire refugees have been through a lot. He said the assistance programs were rolled out as quickly as they could be organized.</p><p>''Hopefully to some degree this will ease some of the suffering that these individuals have gone through,'' he said. ''You are starting your life from scratch. The fact that some of them are frustrated _ I empathize with them.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20110521CPCPG2494</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:52XD-SM51-JCBG-946Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31601\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>May 21, 2011 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It pushed bears, cougars, elk, deer and other wildlife out of their natural habitat south of the Crowsnest Pass.</p><p>\"There's a big area of land that was burned back there. There was probably a lot of good berry crops in that area,'' said Clarke. \"We're going to have bears and a whole lot of other animals being displaced from other areas.''</p><p>People have encountered bears on popular hiking trails and on the slopes of the Pass Powderkeg ski hill, but the animals have not been aggressive, Clarke said.</p><p>Wildlife officers have been using rubber bullets and specially trained dogs to chase the bruins away. Officials are also encouraging residents to move bird feeders indoors, keep garbage and pet food contained, clean greasy barbecues and clear lawns of rotting crabapples until bears settle down for the winter.</p><p>There's also an increase of coyotes in town, said Terry Keshen, who works at the Twilite Confectionary on the main street of Blairmore, Alta.,</p><p>\"I see them every morning when I come to work,'' he said.</p><p>Cats and dogs have been vanishing from the neighbourhood and may have become prey for hungry coyotes, Keshen suggested.</p><p>Elk have also been sighted.</p><p>\"A five-point bull elk staying in town one day was actually half-brown and half-black.

That is why the Sicamous Fire Department, along with District of Sicamous Staff and other emergency responders, will be talking through how they plan to protect the community on April 18.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sicamous Fire Chief Brett Ogino said the idea for the community wildfire workshop came from both the success of the ammonia training exercise held in January and Ogino and other Sicamous firefighters' experience assisting with the serious wildfires last summer.</p><p>Representatives from the Office of the Fire Commissioner, the B.C. Wildfire Service (BCWF), the Shuswap Emergency Program, Royal Canadian Marine Search and Rescue , RCMP, BC Ambulance Service will attend the workshop.</p><p>Ogino said the workshop will allow the agencies to make a plan for coordinating resources and response in the event of a forest fire that is spreading towards Sicamous. He said the scenario will feature the fire spreading on strong winds from one side of town, giving the emergency responders only a few hours to begin evacuations.</p><p>Ogino and a few other Sicamous firefighters had an opportunity to work closely with the Office of the Fire Commissioner and BCWF while working on the wildfires, but he said it is important to also coordinate with groups like the marine search and rescue station who are unique to Sicamous.</p><p>He added it will be an opportunity to better prepare the local firefighters who didn't assist with the forest fire fighting effort.</p><p>\"It's quite a shocker when you're in a community one day and the very next day there is no one around, it's all of a sudden a ghost town, it's quite a surprise. That happened to us in 100 Mile House,\" Ogino said.</p><p>The Shuswap Emergency Program will be represented by Emergency Program Coordinator Tom Hansen and Emergency Social Services Director Cathy Semchuk. Neither SEP representative are strangers to wildfires and evacuations as Hansen was once in charge of Rapattack Salmon Arm and Semchuk played a major role in supporting the evacuees who made their way to Salmon Arm after escaping the serious wildfires this summer.</p><p>\"I think it's very valuable. We've already had a couple of meetings there with the local district and the fire department there, just discussing preparedness and their plans which are very important,\" Hansen said</p><p>Hansen said it is important the public is aware of potential hazards for fire and other natural disasters in their area. He said Wednesday's scenario will be a good chance for the public to see what each agency does in the event of an emergency and what their responsibilities are.</p><p>\"Hopefully more and more of the public, especially after a season like last year, are up to speed on what potentially could happen especially when things go really sideways,\" he said.</p><p>Hansen said because of the complexity of a large-scale evacuation it is important for the agencies involved to review their current plans and put them to the test in hypothetical situations whenever possible.</p><p>\"There's always challenges when you're talking large-scale evacuations,\" he said.</p><p>The Shuswap Emergency program's role in the event of an emergency evacuation is generally to coordinate it through their Emergency Operations Centre and communicate important information including evacuation alerts and orders to the public and the media.</p><p>Hansen said the Shuswap's emergency responders are also actively working together to prepare for possible flooding and landslides, which are a more present threat than wildfires in early spring.</p><p>\"We haven't forgotten about flooding, we're right in the middle of that as far as preparedness and prevention stuff. Luckily enough we're not in the same situation that the southern part of the Okanagan is at the moment and we still have a fair bit of capacity in Shuswap Lake to absorb rain and snow melt.\"</p><p>Along with responders, the public will also be welcomed to the workshop to ask questions, as well as get instruction on how to prepare themselves to evacuate if the worst should happen. Ogino said the workshop will also be used as an opportunity to educate the public on Fire Smart site preparation, which recommends people clear combustible materials away from their homes. Ogino said Fire Smart recommends clearing anything that could fuel a fire away from the exterior walls of the house, creating a clear space at least 1.5 metres wide. Ogino also recommend trimming trees so their limbs do not touch and clearing leaves, pine needles and other debris from trees.</p><p>\"It helps prevent the fire getting from the wildfire stage into the actual burning-down-your-house stage. So many people live in the bush and they have trees right up to their house,\" Ogino said.</p><p>For those interested in attending the community wildfire workshop will be held from 1 to 3 p.m. at the top floor of the Sicamous and District Rec Centre.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EAGLEV-3571629</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EAGLEV2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S4K-NVT1-JDH3-G02N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438284</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"820\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eagle Valley News (Sicamous)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 17, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N624230GM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N621910CC</classCode><className>AMBULANCE &amp; RESCUE SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX001463</classCode><className>RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N624230GM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N621910CC</classCode><className>AMBULANCE &amp; RESCUE SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Wildfires burned more than 1.3 million hectares in B.C. this year, the largest amount on record. In 2017, wildfires burned 1.2 million hectares, forced 65,000 people from their homes and were estimated to cost about $650 million.</p><p>The report by former cabinet minister George Abbott and Indigenous leader Maureen Chapman called for greater partnerships with First Nations, local, provincial and federal governments to prepare for emergencies and disasters. Abbott said as a former health minister he would have rejected prescribed burns because of the health hazard caused by smoke but now sees them as a way to protect communities from devastating fires.</p><p>The Forests Ministry's response to the report includes incorporating local and traditional Indigenous knowledge into community wildfire protection plans. Chapman and Abbott said Indigenous people have used prescribed burns to protect their communities and regenerate forest areas for centuries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-96da608d3bf94843b7c503928b4bbae2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TMF-HNH1-DY9S-T4C8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"375\"/><timeReceived>07:38 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 31, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Most of the firefighters live in that area, so they were worried about the safety of their own families and homes while on the job.</p><p>Some might have even lost their homes, since 12 houses were destroyed on the Paddle Prairie Metis Settlement.</p><p>\"It's stressful. Anytime you lose a house, firefighters take that personally,\" said McMullen, who had the importance reinforced of good co-ordination between police and fire services during his time in High Level.</p><p>While Red Deer is unlikely to be threatened by wildfire, he noted there are tree belts in the river valley that could burn. City residents could also be evacuated because of floods, hazardous spills or for many other reasons.</p><p>The fire chief, who also helped during the Fort McMurray and Slave Lake wildfires, said \"You're always learning from these experiences.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-3816319</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCR-F1S1-F103-303F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Red Deer Advocate</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

A week ago, he made a separate but similar guilty plea nearby in Ingham County, the home of his campus clinic.</p><p>\"Guilty, your honour,\" Nassar told a judge in response to charges involving a girl under 13 and two teenagers at Twistars, where gymnasts with hip and back injuries would line up to seek his help.</p><p>Nassar, 54, has dropped his claim that he was performing legitimate treatment with his ungloved hands.</p><p>In a third case, Nassar will be sentenced in federal court on Dec. 7 for possessing child pornography. He faces decades in prison. Meanwhile, more than 100 women and girls are suing him.</p><p>\"I'm so horribly sorry that this was like a match that turned into a forest fire out of control,\" Nassar told a judge last week.</p><p>The owner of Twistars, John Geddert, declined to comment Wednesday. He referred to a statement last March in which he expressed \"zero knowledge\" of the allegations against Nassar.</p><p>The criminal cases followed reports last year in The Indianapolis Star about how USA Gymnastics mishandled complaints about sexual misconduct involving the doctor and coaches. Women and girls said the stories inspired them to step forward with detailed allegations of abuse.</p><p>Olympians Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas say they were victims.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-90126676c10f4dc18127aba11bb5c599</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R2K-KFN1-DY9S-T1SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"280\"/><timeReceived>01:59 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 29, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Most of the firefighters live in that area, so they were worried about the safety of their own families and homes while on the job.</p><p>Some might have even lost their homes, since 12 houses were destroyed on the Paddle Prairie Metis Settlement.</p><p>\"It's stressful. Anytime you lose a house, firefighters take that personally,\" said McMullen, who had the importance reinforced of good co-ordination between police and fire services during his time in High Level.</p><p>While Red Deer is unlikely to be threatened by wildfire, he noted there are tree belts in the river valley that could burn. City residents could also be evacuated because of floods, hazardous spills or for many other reasons.</p><p>The fire chief, who also helped during the Fort McMurray and Slave Lake wildfires, said \"You're always learning from these experiences.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-3816319</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCR-JG91-F103-3391-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Red Deer Advocate</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;
