(\"Trican\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce its first quarter results for 2024. The following news release should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&amp;A\"), the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes of Trican for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as well as the Annual Information Form (\"AIF\") for the year ended December 31, 2023. All of these documents are available on SEDAR+ at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedarplus.ca\">www.sedarplus.ca</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS //st * Trican's results for the quarter compared to the prior year period were marginally lower based on decreased operating activity resulting from lower natural gas prices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Revenue was $271.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an 8% decrease compared to $297.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.</p><p>* Adjusted EBITDAS1 and adjusted EBITDA1 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $74.4 million and $72.8 million, compared to $82.9 million and $81.6 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.</p><p>* Free cash flow1 and free cash flow per share1 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $49.9 million, $0.24 per share basic and diluted compared to $54.9 million, $0.24 per share basic and diluted for the three months ended March 31, 2023.</p><p>* Profit and profit per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $41.2 million, $0.20 per share basic and $0.19 per share diluted compared to $46.0 million, $0.20 per share basic and diluted for the three months ended March 31, 2023. * The Company's balance sheet remains strong with positive working capital, including cash, of $174.5 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $153.2 million at December 31, 2023, providing significant financial flexibility. As at March 31, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $9.3 million (December 31, 2023 - $88.8 million). The decrease in cash is a result of working capital requirements, tax installments of $39.7 million and return on capital initiatives of $25.9 million. As at March 31, 2024, the Company had no loans and borrowings (December 31, 2023 - nil). * Trican operates the newest, most technologically advanced fleet of fracturing equipment in Canada. We developed our fleet by upgrading existing equipment with CAT Tier 4 Dynamic Gas Blending (\"DGB\") engine technology and building new fully electric ancillary equipment. The combination of Tier 4 DGB engines and fully electric ancillary equipment can displace up to 90% of the diesel used in a conventional fracturing operation with cleaner burning and less expensive natural gas resulting in lower overall fuel cost and reduced carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions. Our fracturing fleet upgrades also include industry leading continuous heavy duty pumps (3,000 HHP) and idle reduction technology packages which enable longer pumping times and improved operating efficiencies.</p><p>* During the first quarter of 2024, Trican's fifth Tier 4 DGB fleet (42,000 HHP) and second group of electrical ancillary equipment was deployed into the field bringing Trican's total Tier 4 DGB fleet to 210,000 HHP.</p><p>* Tier 4 upgrades and electric ancillary equipment are key components of Trican's Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") strategy. Our ongoing ESG initiatives, including fleet upgrades, are intended to reduce our environmental impact, improve efficiency and reduce our emissions profile thereby improving the sustainability of our operations and supporting our customers in achieving their ESG goals.</p><p>RETURN OF CAPITAL //st * The Company continues to be active in its Normal Course Issuer Bid (\"NCIB\") program as a key component of its return of capital strategy:</p><p>* During the three months ended March 31, 2024, Trican purchased and cancelled 4,045,700 common shares at a weighted average price of $4.11 per share, or approximately 2% of the Company's outstanding shares at December 31, 2023. Subsequent to March 31, 2024 the Company purchased an additional 1,597,900 common shares, bringing total purchases under the 2023-2024 NCIB program to 8,536,529 common shares.</p><p>* On October 2, 2023, the Company announced the renewal of its NCIB program, commencing October 5, 2023, to purchase up to 21,004,897 common shares for cancellation before October 4, 2024, subject to the TSX NCIB rules.</p><p>* Since the initiation of our NCIB programs in 2017, Trican has purchased 151,514,582 common shares, equating to approximately 44% of total shares outstanding at the start of the NCIB programs. All common shares purchased under the NCIB are returned to treasury for cancellation. * The Company continues to execute on its return of capital framework through the quarterly dividend program:</p><p>* During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company paid a cash dividend of $0.045 per share, or approximately $9.3 million in aggregate to shareholders.</p><p>* On May 13, 2024, the Company's board of directors approved a dividend of $0.045 per share reflecting an increase of 12.5% from the prior year quarterly dividend payments of $0.04 per share. The distribution is scheduled to be made on June 28, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 14, 2024.</p><p>* The dividends are designated as eligible dividends for Canadian income tax purposes.</p><p>FINANCIAL REVIEW //st ($ millions, except $ per share amounts.

The Company's capital budget for 2024 remains at approximately $90 million, including $15 million carry forward from the 2023 capital program, to be funded with available cash resources, free cash flow1 and our operating line.</p><p>Financial Position</p><p>We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet with significant positive working capital including cash. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow1 and financial flexibility will allow us to execute our strategic plans including ongoing investment in our industry leading fleet, continued strong participation in our NCIB program and the payment of a quarterly dividend as a part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy which includes a consistent return of capital to our shareholders.</p><p>OUTLOOK</p><p>Our overall outlook for the next few years remains very positive as Canadian market fundamentals remain attractive for fracturing, cementing and coiled tubing.</p><p>The Montney reservoir in Northeastern British Columbia and Northwest Alberta remains one of the premier resource plays in North America. We expect that the combination of attractive well economics, increasing demand from LNG export facilities and British Columbia's agreements with First Nations should lead to ongoing and growing activity in the play. Montney development requires large, high-pressure fracturing, technically challenging cementing and coiled tubing services with large volumes of product which will directly benefit Trican.</p><p>Additional Canadian export capacity is now a reality with the Trans Mountain Pipeline entering into commercial service, completion of the Coastal GasLink Pipeline and the LNG Canada project anticipated to start exports in late 2024 or early 2025. We are also encouraged by the progress being made for additional LNG export facilities on the west coast of Canada. This new export capacity for both oil and natural gas creates an increasingly positive backdrop for oil and natural gas drilling and completions activity in Western Canada and the associated oilfield services required as we move through 2024 and beyond. We expect overall annual oilfield activity in Canada to remain relatively stable allowing us to continue generating sector leading returns for our shareholders.</p><p>Q1 activity proved to be quite resilient in spite of a continued low natural gas price environment, and a period of extremely cold weather delaying the start of operations in January. We expect that Q2 2024 will be stronger than originally anticipated as some work scheduled for the first quarter was deferred into the second quarter. Additionally, certain customers are looking to accelerate portions of their previously scheduled H2 2024 work into the second quarter to mitigate potential summer water constraints given the continuing drought conditions in Western Canada. Trican continues to work closely with these customers on various solutions including alternative water storage options and utilization of produced water via chemical treatment solutions. As we move through the summer, Trican will continue to monitor potential access issues related to forest fire activity which could delay activity in our operating areas. We will work closely with our customers to minimize business interruptions.</p><p>Trican continues to build on the investments made in our equipment fleet over the last three years to ensure that we are on the forefront of pressure pumping technology and design in Canada. Demand for our Canadian market-leading low emissions Tier 4 DGB fracturing fleets continues to be robust and is expected to remain strong through the remainder of 2024. Our fifth fleet of Tier 4 DGB high pressure fracturing equipment containing continuous duty pumps was deployed in the field in early 2024 bringing Trican's total Tier 4 fleet to an industry leading 210,000 HHP.</p><p>We continue to invest and enhance our equipment offering by moving forward with the electrification of certain ancillary equipment required for on-site fracturing operations including the data van, blending, sand handling and other equipment used for fracturing. We believe these ongoing technological advancements will augment our differentiation strategy and add value for our customers by increasing reliability further reducing emissions and reducing fuel costs. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow1 and our financial flexibility allows for continued investment in our fleet and electrification program. We will continue to serve our customers with state-of-the-art equipment and generate industry-leading returns in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.</p><p>Trican remains focused on returning capital to our shareholders both through our quarterly dividend program and through our ongoing NCIB program. Trican increased its quarterly dividend per share by 12.5% effective for Q1 2024. We have made significant progress on our NCIB program to date and will look to fully utilize this program prior to its renewal.

Management utilizes adjusted EBITDA to translate historical variability in the Company's principal business activities into future financial expectations. By isolating incremental items from net income, including income / expense items related to how the Company chooses to manage financing elements of the business, taxation strategy and non-cash charges, management can better predict future financial results from our principal business activities.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDAS (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation) is a non-GAAP financial measure and has been reconciled to profit / (loss) for the applicable financial periods, being the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. Management utilizes adjusted EBITDAS as a useful measure of operating performance, cash flow to complement profit / (loss) and to provide meaningful comparisons of operating results.</p><p>The items included in this calculation of adjusted EBITDA have been specifically identified as they are non-cash in nature, subject to significant volatility between periods, and / or not relevant to our principal business activities. Items adjusted in the non-GAAP calculation of adjusted EBITDA, are as follows: //st * Non-cash expenditures, including depreciation, amortization, impairment of non-financial assets, and equity-settled share-based compensation; * Consideration as to how the Company chose to generate financial income and incur financial expenses, including foreign exchange expenses and finance costs; * Taxation in various jurisdictions; and * Other income / expense which generally results from the disposition of equipment, as these transactions generally do not reflect quarterly operational field activity.</p><p>The item adjusted in the non-GAAP calculation of adjusted EBITDAS from adjusted EBITDA, is as follows: //st * Cash-settled share-based compensation.

These measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers and should not be viewed as a substitute for measures reported under IFRS. These financial measures are reconciled to IFRS measures in the Non-GAAP disclosure section of this news release. Other non-standard measures are described in the Non-Standard Measures section of this news release. Stainless steel fluid ends were historically expensed as depreciation prior to December 2017. Not all hydraulic fracturing companies apply the accounting policy for stainless steel fluid ends consistently.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA % and Adjusted EBITDAS %</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA percentage and adjusted EBITDAS percentage are non-GAAP financial ratios that are determined by dividing adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAS, respectively, by revenue.

Management adjusts for other (income) / loss, realized (gain) / loss, current income tax, income taxes paid, maintenance capital expenditures included within purchase of property and equipment from the statement of cash flows, net changes in other liabilities and change in non-cash operating working capital.</p><p>Management reconciles free cash flow from adjusted EBITDA for the applicable financial periods by adjusting for interest paid, current income tax expense, and maintenance capital expenditures included within purchase of property and equipment from the statement of cash flows as they are considered non-discretionary.</p><p>In 2023, the Company moved into a cash taxable position due to improved operating results and utilization of its available non-capital loss pools. The Company previously elected to defer its 2023 current income tax installments which was remitted in combination with the 2024 current income tax installments in the period. The Company elected to present current income tax expense as a reduction of free cash flow in the respective period to clearly adjust for the effects of timing and show the impact of such non-discretionary items.</p><p>Free cash flow per share is calculated by dividing free cash flow by the Company's basic or diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.</p><p>Free cash flow and free cash flow per share are not standardized measures and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other entities. //st ($ thousands, unaudited) Three months ended</p><p>March 31, March 31, December 31,</p><p>2024 2023 2023 Cash flow (used in) / from operations (IFRS financial measure) (37,532) 21,779 81,909 Adjustments: Other income (1,069) (748) (892) Realized foreign exchange loss / (gain) 306 (52) (366) Current income tax expense (10,767) (14,614) (8,305) Maintenance capital expenditures (11,460) (11,174) (8,841) Net changes in other liabilities (921) 1,932 (117) Change in non-cash operating working capital 71,622 57,799 (24,658) Income taxes paid 39,672 - - Free cash flow 49,851 54,922 38,730 ($ thousands, unaudited) Three months ended</p><p>March 31, March 31, December 31,</p><p>2024 2023 2023 Adjusted EBITDA 72,801 81,631 56,398 Interest paid (723) (921) (522) Current income tax expense (10,767) (14,614) (8,305) Maintenance capital expenditures (11,460) (11,174) (8,841) Free cash flow 49,851 54,922 38,730 ($ thousands, unaudited) Three months ended</p><p>March 31, March 31, December 31,</p><p>2024 2023 2023 Purchase of property and equipment 15,260 19,489 18,296 Growth capital expenditures 3,800 8,315 9,455 Maintenance capital expenditures 11,460 11,174 8,841 ($ thousands, except $ per share amounts.

Russell had been walking with her husband, and they were worried that it was their home when they first saw the fire.</p><p>They also said that the family in the home on the south got out with all three of their pets safely \u2013 a hamster, a rabbit, and a dog.</p><p>According to neighbours, the fire is believed to have started in the back of one home, possibly in the hot tub area on the back deck, and spread from there.</p><p>One firefighter sustained minor injuries at the scene.</p><p>Jenkins said 30 to 35 firefighters were involved in the call, with about seven or eight pieces of equipment. Crews from the Walnut Grove firehall were helped by others halls in Murrayville and Fort Langley.</p><p>\"We've got our investigators on scene just this morning, so the fire investigation is underway,\" Jenkins said.</p><p>He said the units have significant damage, and neighbouring units may have been impacted by water. But the fire was contained to the two units.</p><p>\"We investigate every residential, structural, or commercial structure fire. So it's just part of our process to do the investigation and report it to the office of fire commissioner,\" he explained.</p><p>Victim Services provides help to people who have lost their homes due to fire and other emergency incidents, by providing up to 72 hours of accommodation.</p><p>The smoke was visible for miles around, and on Sunday, people took to social media to offer help to those impacted, including clothing, e-transfers, toiletries, and even free meals at a Walnut Grove restaurant.</p><p>One of the fire victims was Debbie Balfour who asked people to hold off until she can have some time to think about next moves.</p><p>\"My home was one of the homes, and the most badly burned. We are safe but lost everything. My son literally didn't get out with a shirt or shoes on,\" she wrote on a Walnut Grove Facebook page.</p><p>Karen Moraes, who ran for Township council last autumn, was also forced from her home. A friend has started a GoFundMe for her since she lost everything in the fire.</p><p>READ ALSO: Cause of fatal Aldergrove fire remains unknown, Langley fire department says</p><p>READ ALSO: Forest fire near Davis Lake Provincial Park still spreading</p><p>.</p><p>Have a story tip?

The fire that started Aug. 19 has decimated homes and vast tracts of forest in the Alexandroupolis and Evros region, near the border with Turkey. It was blamed for 20 of last week\u2019s 21 wildfire-related deaths in Greece.</p><p>Of those deaths, 18 are believed to have been migrants whose bodies were found together in an area the fire had passed through. The bodies of two more victims, also believed to have been migrants, were found on different days elsewhere in the broader area of the fire. </p><p>Several other people, including the two-member crew of a firefighting plane, have died as a result of wildfires in Greece so far this year. Lawmakers held a minute of silence at the start of a parliamentary debate on the fires and the state response Wednesday morning.</p><p>Defending his government\u2019s response to the fires, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said climate change and a protracted heat wave followed by very strong winds were largely to blame for the deaths and devastation. The political opposition criticized the government's preparations for this year's wildfire season. </p><p>\u201cYou left the country unprepared and defenseless against this danger,\u201d Sokratis Famellos of the SYRIZA main opposition party alleged. </p><p>Mitsotakis implied migrants were responsible for sparking the wildfire in northeastern Greece, though he noted an investigation was still underway. </p><p>\u201cThe causes of the fire are under investigation. It is almost certain that the causes were man-made. And it is also almost certain that this fire started on routes that are often used by illegal migrants who have entered our country,\u201d Mitsotakis said. </p><p>\u201cWe don't know if it was negligence or deliberate,\u201d he added.</p><p>The prime minister did not provide any evidence to back up the claim, noting the ongoing investigation, and said he would not make further comments \u201cat this time.\u201d </p><p>Greece is one of the preferred entry routes into the European Union for people from the Middle East, Africa and Asia fleeing conflict and poverty. Those crossing the country\u2019s land border with Turkey often use mountain and forest trails to evade authorities and head west to the main northern city of Thessaloniki. </p><p>\u201cIf there are guilty people, we will make sure to locate them,\u201d Mitsotakis said. \u201cBut, I repeat, this is the job of authorities and only of authorities. Incidents of vigilantism and self-appointed sheriffs will not be tolerated by this government.\u201d</p><p>Last week, three people \u2014 two Greeks and one Albanian national \u2014 were arrested in northeastern Greece and charged with a series of crimes for allegedly rounding up 13 migrants and forcing them into a car trailer, accusing them, without any evidence, of setting fires. </p><p>Several people, all Greeks, have been arrested in the last two weeks on suspicion of arson for allegedly deliberately attempting to start wildfires.. There have also been dozens of arrests since the start of the fire-prevention season in May for sparking fires through negligence. </p><p>Since the Alexandroupolis and Evros fire began, evacuation orders have been issued for thousands of people in villages and from the main hospital in the city of Alexandroupolis, with the vast majority allowed back once the danger had passed.</p><p>Overnight, residents of two villages near the border with Turkey and near a wildlife sanctuary were put on alert for potential evacuation as one of the fire fronts flared up.</p><p>The blaze, now burning deep in the forest in the Dadia national park, is the largest single wildfire recorded in the European Union since the European Forest Fire Information System started keeping records in 2000.</p><p>Greece has been stricken by hundreds of wildfires this summer, with dozens of new blazes breaking out each day. The vast majority are extinguished quickly. Between Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, firefighters were tackling 81 fires, including 47 that had broken out within that 24-hour period, the fire department said.</p><p>Seeing its firefighting forces stretched to the limit, Greece called on other European countries for help. Hundreds of firefighters from Romania, France, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Albania, Slovakia and Serbia have helped battle the blazes, along with 12 aircraft from Germany, Sweden, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, France and Spain.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP's coverage of global migration at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/migration\">https://apnews.com/hub/migration</url> and of climate change at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/climate-and-environment</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-77c0e818372ab86f11f2196f07237c54</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:692M-1X51-DY9S-T04D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"807\"/><timeReceived>07:33 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 31, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Firefighters always hope to get through spring. We come out of winter and the ground cover is dry, it's brown, the vegetation hasn't taken on much hydration.<br/><br/> \"We believe that climate change contributes to volatility,\" he said. \"We're seeing more severe storms than we've seen before. Winds are very important to us. We're seeing wind action that exacerbates fires, and certainly long dry spells are becoming more common in many regions.\"<br/><br/> By Monday morning, temperatures had dropped, and the wind had receded somewhat, shifting direction so the fire was moving back on itself, a small bit of good news, said Meldrum. But he characterized the fire as \"uncontrolled\" and said, with residents relocated, firefighters were prioritizing protecting homes and buildings still threatened by the fire. <br/><br/> Meldrum said there was no timeline for residents to return to their homes. Once fire crews do get the blaze contained, he said, there will still be days of mop-up work, stamping down any smoldering portions of the fire that might reignite the forest.<br/><br/> \"Traditionally, we want to get hose lines around the entire perimeter of a fire and have what's called a wet hose line around the perimeter. This is a big perimeter.\"<br/><br/> At the same time as wildfires burned outside of Halifax, Nova Scotia fire crews were also battling another, larger wildfire in Shelburne County, in the southwestern part of the province.<br/><br/> Provincial officials said the uncontrolled wildfire in the remote area around Barrington Lake had nearly tripled in size to 2,296 hectares by Monday morning, propelled by high winds and high temperatures.<br/><br/> Evacuation orders were also in place for several communities in that area along with highway closures.<br/><br/> Steve McKinley is a Halifax-based reporter for the Star.

Firefighters always hope to get through spring. We come out of winter and the ground cover is dry, it's brown, the vegetation hasn't taken on much hydration.<br/><br/> \"We believe that climate change contributes to volatility,\" he said. \"We're seeing more severe storms than we've seen before. Winds are very important to us. We're seeing wind action that exacerbates fires, and certainly long dry spells are becoming more common in many regions.\"<br/><br/> By Monday morning, temperatures had dropped, and the wind had receded somewhat, shifting direction so the fire was moving back on itself, a small bit of good news, said Meldrum. But he characterized the fire as \"uncontrolled\" and said, with residents relocated, firefighters were prioritizing protecting homes and buildings still threatened by the fire. <br/><br/> Meldrum said there was no timeline for residents to return to their homes. Once fire crews do get the blaze contained, he said, there will still be days of mop-up work, stamping down any smoldering portions of the fire that might reignite the forest.<br/><br/> \"Traditionally, we want to get hose lines around the entire perimeter of a fire and have what's called a wet hose line around the perimeter. This is a big perimeter.\"<br/><br/> At the same time as wildfires burned outside of Halifax, Nova Scotia fire crews were also battling another, larger wildfire in Shelburne County, in the southwestern part of the province.<br/><br/> Provincial officials said the uncontrolled wildfire in the remote area around Barrington Lake had nearly tripled in size to 2,296 hectares by Monday morning, propelled by high winds and high temperatures.<br/><br/> Evacuation orders were also in place for several communities in that area along with highway closures.<br/><br/> Steve McKinley is a Halifax-based reporter for the Star.

Along with the expansion of the Think Tank process, the Finnish delegation was interested in assisting the City to develop a program with the college to train people on select harvesting techniques using smaller-footprint, computer-aided harvesting equipment.</p><p>These operators will be in very high demand in the coming years as the B.C. forest sector undertakes more selective logging and commercial thinning in order to achieve the provincial g o v e r n m e n t \u2019 s emerging landscape resilience objectives.</p><p>Jeff Mycock, West Fraser\u2019s B.C. Chief Forester, was particularly interested in a presentation about a proprietary software, Arbonaut, that was developed in Finland and is being used for forest fire risk management and as a forest management decision-support system.</p><p>The provincial government\u2019s recent announcement that it will invest $38-million to use LiDAR to aerially map B.C. \u2019s forests means both the government and the forest industry will have better data to assist in the management of B.C. \u2019s forest ecosystems and tools like Arbonaut will play a key role in enhancing forestry decisions.</p><p>Matikainen plans to attend Quesnel\u2019s upcoming Think Tank session in early May and present an overview of Joensuu\u2019s Climate Smart Forestry program to the attendees.</p><p>Staff writer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20230426PSCA0003526630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:683K-MGM1-F0HF-81N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

The new initiative is an extension of our partnership with One Tree Planted, a non-profit organization that partners with businesses to plant trees all over the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       \"The devastation in Quebec should be a wake-up call for all of us to do our part,\" says CEO Rajeev Shrivastava.</p><p>Why Quebec Needs Trees</p><p>Climate change is caused in major part by an overabundance of Carbon Dioxide. Trees are the single best way to reduce CO2 because they breathe it in and convert it to oxygen. Without trees, we will see a rise in deadly heat waves, droughts, and yes, wildfires.</p><p>Canada's boreal forest is one of the world's richest ecosystems, and accounts for 9% of the world's forestation. Threaded with beautiful blue lakes and streams teeming with majestic spruces, firs and pines, and home to black bears, caribou, moose and great gray owls, this forest is as much a work of art as it is a vital driver of the country's environmental health. And in Quebec the forest has been besieged by wildfires for the last four months.</p><p>According to the Quebec Provincial Forest Fire Control Agency, 3.2 million hectares of forest have burned in Quebec since the 2023 wildfires began. To put this into perspective, the average number of hectares burned in all of Canada is 2.5 million. While Quebec needed reforestation prior to the wildfire devastation, that need has now intensified exponentially.</p><p>The Human Toll</p><p>So far, hundreds of Canadians have been forced to leave their homes. In what should be their peak season, the livelihoods of hunters and fishermen are now in jeopardy as businesses are shuttered.</p><p>Air quality issues caused by toxic smoke from the wildfires are already impacting the health and wellbeing of many residents. Inhaling toxic smoke and ash from these wildfires could damage the lungs and heart and even weaken our immune systems.</p><p>These health concerns aren't confined to Canada's borders. Air pollution from the fires is now impacting the lives of many Americans.</p><p>VisitorsCoverage's Promise to the Planet</p><p>VisitorsCoverage was founded on one simple goal: helping people. Whether we're helping immigrants settle in America, retirees live out their travel dreams, or students explore and learn about their world, helping and doing good is at the forefront of everything we do. We partnered with One Tree Planted to do just that.</p><p>\"The devastation in Quebec should be a wake-up call for all of us to do our part,\" says VisitorsCoverage CEO Rajeev Shrivastava.</p><p>A Shared Mission to Protect &amp; Conserve</p><p>On the surface, a company that sells travel insurance and an organization that plants trees don't seem to have much in common. Dig a little deeper, however, and you'll find that both VisitorsCoverage and One Tree Planted are driven by a commitment to protect and educate. One company aims to protect travelers, while the other aims to protect the world they travel. We are proud to continue our partnership to ensure that travelers and Mother Earth stay protected for generations to come.</p><p>About One Tree Planted:One Tree Planted is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit on a mission to make it simple for anyone to help the environment by planting trees. Their projects span the globe and are done in partnership with local communities and knowledgeable experts to create an impact for nature, people, and wildlife. Reforestation helps to rebuild forests after fires and floods, provide jobs for social impact, and restore biodiversity. Many projects have overlapping objectives, creating a combination of benefits that contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.

Along with the expansion of the Think Tank process, the Finnish delegation was interested in assisting the City to develop a program with the college to train people on select harvesting techniques using smaller-footprint, computer-aided harvesting equipment.</p><p>These operators will be in very high demand in the coming years as the B.C. forest sector undertakes more selective logging and commercial thinning in order to achieve the provincial government's emerging landscape resilience objectives.</p><p>Jeff Mycock, West Fraser's B.C. Chief Forester, was particularly interested in a presentation about a proprietary software, Arbonaut, that was developed in Finland and is being used for forest fire risk management and as a forest management decision-support system.</p><p>The provincial government's recent announcement that it will invest $38-million to use LiDAR to aerially map B.C.'s forests means both the government and the forest industry will have better data to assist in the management of B.C.'s forest ecosystems and tools like Arbonaut will play a key role in enhancing forestry decisions.</p><p>Matikainen plans to attend Quesnel's upcoming Think Tank session in early May and present an overview of Joensuu's Climate Smart Forestry program to the attendees.</p><p>READ MORE: Quesnel hosts Future of Forestry Think Tank</p><p>READ MORE: Canadian forestry researchers converge in Quesnel</p><p>Copyright 2023 Quesnel Cariboo Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20230426PQC4464291</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:683X-8WK1-F0HF-80FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

(\"SPOD\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that, pursuant to an amending agreement dated as of July 4, 2023, the Company has amended its mineral option agreement with Noranda Royalties Inc. (the \"Noranda\") respecting the Lithium Grande 4 Project dated July 4, 2022 (the \"Option Agreement\"). The amended Option Agreement extends the date on which the Company must make at least $350,000 in exploration expenditures on the Project from July 4, 2023, to August 13, 2023.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The purpose of the extension is recent restrictions imposed by the Quebec government, because of the regional forest fire situation.

The Company will provide further updates as information becomes available.</p><p>Spod also announces that it has fulfilled its first-year cash payment and share issuance obligations under the Option Agreement, paying $50,000 cash to Noranda and issuing 700,000 Class A common shares of the Company to Noranda, each share issued at a deemed price of $0.10 per share. The shares are subject to a four month hold period, which expires November 5, 2023. Noranda is arm's length to the Company.</p><p>About Spod Lithium Corp.</p><p>Spod Lithium Corp. is a mineral exploration company focused on the acquisition and development of mineral properties containing battery, base, and precious metals.

Now the dean of Lakeland College emergency training centre in Vermilion, Alta., McKerry previously helped battle some of Alberta\u2019s most ferocious and historic wildfires.</p><p>That included the 2011 Slave Lake wildfire that destroyed more than 400 buildings and the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire that forced nearly 90,000 people to flee Canada\u2019s oilsands region and reduced thousands of homes to ash.</p><p>After a gruelling day on the fire lines, he said most firefighters are completely exhausted and camp is their refuge.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to keep them motivated, high morale and keep them working, you\u2019ve got to try to be able to support them where (you) can,\u201d he said in an interview.</p><p>\u201cCamps aren\u2019t the most ideal experience, (but) fortunately, you\u2019ve got a lot of motivated people who want to go out and help, that are willing to sacrifice some of those comforts \u2014 or almost all of those comforts \u2014 to get out there and assist in the effort.\u201d</p><p>Those efforts continue to be test-ed as crews across Canada battle the worst season on record. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre has reported more than 131,000 square kilometres of land and forest have been scorched across the country.</p><p>B.C. is experiencing its most destructive season on record for area burned with more than 15,000 square kilometres charred, surpassing the previous record of 13,543 square kilometres set in 2018.</p><p>In a social media post last month, the BC Wildfire Service highlighted the contracted staffers it said play \u201ccritical\u201d roles in the provincial fire fight.</p><p>Such jobs include heavy equipment operators, First Nations crew members, first aid attendants and medics, camp and facility managers, kitchen staff, danger tree assessors, fallers, food service staff, forest industry experts, contract firefighters, pilots and air support staff, as well as various other trades, the service said.</p><p>Provincial fire information officer Mike McCulley said such workers are often easily overlooked by those outside the service.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really complex organization and there are many moving pieces to the puzzle,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI think folks just think that it\u2019s just firefighters on the ground fighting fire and that\u2019s so far from the truth.\u201d</p><p>McKerry said, after a day in the field, most firefighters needs are simple.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get back to camp, the best luxury you can have is clean washrooms and access to food,\u201d he said.</p><p>At the Takla camp, Callihoo said most firefighters sleep in tents, but working showers, washrooms and a workable kitchen equipped with a dining area are set up on site.</p><p>Food quantities are determined based on the number of firefighters on scene, with groceries delivered once a week, she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a juggling process because you want to make sure you have enough food for everybody,\u201d Callihoo said.</p><p>Excess is much better than not having enough, and any unused food will be sent to another camp, she said, noting that numbers at the camp change quickly as the service often rearranges how many firefighters are at each site based on needs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a day-by-day operation here,\u201d Callihoo said.</p><p>She added that most of the problematic fires are burning elsewhere in the province.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230808RDA0003778576</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68WP-91C1-F0HF-815P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

It was good not to have it burned.\"</p><p>In all, 8,000 cubic metres of chips were generated, enough to fill approximately 200 trucks.</p><p>The Babine Lake Community Forest was able to earn money by selling sawlogs, 36,500 cubic metres worth or enough for 665 trucks to Hampton Forest Products in Burns Lake.</p><p>Tweedie said village meetings were also held to keep residents up to date on the work involved.

More than 15 million hectares have been burned so far this year by almost 5,800 fires, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre Inc.</p><p>Nadja Dreff and Marcos Alvarez at DBRS Morningstar estimated in a reportthis week that total wildfire-related insured losses in Canada for the third quarter of 2023 will be between $700 million and $1.5 billion, which they called \u201cmanageable\u201d for insurers. </p><p>\u201cHowever, the wildfire season is not yet over and there is the potential for any of the fires to intensify and further pressure Q3 2023 results, especially if the fires affect densely populated regions, economic hubs, or key infrastructure. Larger and more frequent weather-related losses will continue to pressure property insurance prices higher in the near term,\u201d they said. </p><p>Historically, wildfire damage has been a lot less common than flooding, said Kathryn Bakos, director of climate finance and science at the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation. </p><p>But when it does happen, it tends to be significantly worse on average in terms of damage, she said. </p><p>\u201cWe're seeing this right now in Kelowna, with the fires in Northwest Territories. When you have a wildfire event, you have catastrophic loss of the home,\u201d she said. </p><p>The 2016 Fort McMurray fire is perhaps the best example of this \u2014 while flooding tends to account for a large chunk of losses every year, the Fort McMurray fire is the largest-ever insurance loss in the country, said Bakos, accounting for almost three quarters of total insured losses that year.</p><p>\u201cWhat climate change means in the medium and longer term is more extreme. So you're going to have more heat, dryness and less rain in the system, as well as more rain and storm surges,\" Bakos said.</p><p>Annual catastrophic insurable loss claims have risen as a result, she said.</p><p>As fire risks rise, insurers are increasingly looking at communities' fire defences and taking them \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 into consideration for premiums, said Stewart. </p><p>No single event drives insurance premiums up, but overall trends do, said Stewart. Insurers price risk, and the risk of major weather events is rising, he said. </p><p>Prices have been rising faster in the Western provinces, said Stewart: \u201cWildfires and floods are driving the premiums higher in the places where we're seeing these trends now.\u201d</p><p>In the U.S., which is seeing similar trends in extreme weather, some companies are deciding that it\u2019s just not worth the risk. Recently some major insurers stopped offering new policies in California and other states amid rising extreme weather trends. </p><p>Those U.S. insurers left markets in part because state regulations prevented them from passing on the higher costs of increased risk, noted Stewart, making such a move less likely in Canada.  </p><p>While Canadian insurers show no signs of exiting markets right now, what\u2019s happening in the U.S. should serve as a warning signal, Bakos said, and an opportunity for companies to look at how to maintain the insurability of Canadian homes. </p><p>\u201cWe know what to do. We just have to do it,\u201d she said. </p><p>Insurers incentivize consumers to decrease their risk of fire in order to save on their policy, said Stewart. They also offer incentives to consumers in communities with certain protections, helping indirectly pressure their communities to take those steps as well. </p><p>\u201cThose incentives likely now need to be re-examined and expanded so that homeowners have a greater array of incentives to protect them and to encourage them to retrofit their homes to be more resilient to fire, flood, wind and other perils,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cThe industry is actually taking a hard look at incentives right now in conversation with governments across the country.\u201d</p><p>The industry is also looking at how to elevate consumer awareness of risk, said Stewart, adding that more government support is needed for both awareness and incentivization. </p><p>\u201cThe federal government needs to play much more of a leadership role in wildfire modelling, risk modelling, in providing resources to communities to develop wildfire community action plans, and to design retrofit programs,\u201d he said. </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 25, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-6b7636a74e364cedb86b78784fba9399</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691J-5W31-DY9S-T3PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"793\"/><timeReceived>10:16 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 25, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Recently some major insurers stopped offering new policies in California and other states amid rising extreme weather trends.</p><p>Those U.S. insurers left markets in part because state regulations prevented them from passing on the higher costs of increased risk, noted Stewart, making such a move less likely in Canada.</p><p>While Canadian insurers show no signs of exiting markets right now, what's happening in the U.S. should serve as a warning signal, Bakos said, and an opportunity for companies to look at how to maintain the insurability of Canadian homes.</p><p>\"We know what to do. We just have to do it,\" she said.</p><p>Insurers incentivize consumers to decrease their risk of fire in order to save on their policy, said Stewart. They also offer incentives to consumers in communities with certain protections, helping indirectly pressure their communities to take those steps as well.</p><p>\"Those incentives likely now need to be re-examined and expanded so that homeowners have a greater array of incentives to protect them and to encourage them to retrofit their homes to be more resilient to fire, flood, wind and other perils,\" he said.</p><p>\"The industry is actually taking a hard look at incentives right now in conversation with governments across the country.\"</p><p>The industry is also looking at how to elevate consumer awareness of risk, said Stewart, adding that more government support is needed for both awareness and incentivization.</p><p>\"The federal government needs to play much more of a leadership role in wildfire modelling, risk modelling, in providing resources to communities to develop wildfire community action plans, and to design retrofit programs,\" he said.</p><p>Rosa Saba, The Canadian Press</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230825PAB4507009</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691D-3P41-JD2C-J17H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"786\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

The migrants were charged with illegal entry and attempted arson.</p><p>But a government source told Kathimerini daily that the evidence against them appeared to be the makings of a campfire.</p><p>The rhetoric has gone hand in hand with media misinformation.</p><p>An Evros news portal on Tuesday said that 20 migrants had been arrested outside Alexandroupoli after exchanging gunfire with police.</p><p>Authorities later denied this.</p><p>Similarly, national TV station Open on Wednesday issued a correction after erroneously reporting that two migrants had been caught lighting a fire in the neighbouring region of Rodopi.</p><p>Northern Greece has been engulfed in a mega fire that originally broke out Saturday and required over 14,000 evacuations, including at a local hospital. Lightning sparked the fire, according to Alexandroupoli's mayor Giannis Zamboukis.</p><p>By Thursday, the various fronts had merged into a line stretching over 15 kilometres (nine miles), burning over 60,000 hectares (148,000 acres) of agricultural land and forest.</p><p>The area is just a few kilometres from the Turkish border. Migrant crossings aided by smugglers occur on a regular basis.</p><p>In 2020, tens of thousands of migrants tried to break through this remote northeastern area, clashing for days with Greek security forces.</p><p>Work on extending a a 37.5-kilometre (23-mile) steel barrier to block the path is to be completed by the end of the year.</p><p>After the first fires broke out Saturday near Alexandroupoli, pictures and videos have been posted on social media claiming to show makeshift arson devices created by migrants crossing the border with Turkey.</p><p>\u2013 'They want to destroy us' \u2013</p><p>Anti-migrant sentiment is strong in Greek border areas, where locals accuse asylum seekers of stealing and say reckless driving by smugglers poses a serious traffic risk.</p><p>\"I am absolutely convinced that the fires were caused by migrants,\" Evros resident Christos Paschalakis told AFP.</p><p>\"They burn us, they steal from us, they kill us in road accidents,\" he said.</p><p>\"I have no doubt that the forest fire was started by migrants,\" said Vangelis Rallis, a 70-year-old retired logger from Dadia, a village near a key national park that also burned last year.</p><p>\"They burned it last year, and this year they returned to finish the job. They may have even been paid to do it. They want to destroy us,\" he said.</p><p>The issue also sparked political controversy this week after Kyriakos Velopoulos, the leader of nationalist party Greek Solution, joined the attacks on migrants and praised the man arrested for illegally detaining them.</p><p>An MP for Velopoulos, Paris Papadakis, also called on locals to \"take measures\" as migrants were allegedly \"obstructing\" fire-fighting plane pilots.</p><p>\"We are at war,\" Papadakis said in a Facebook post.</p><p>In national elections in June, Velopoulos' party and two other far-right groups posted their highest ratings in northern Greece.</p><p>In the Evros region, Greek Solution scored nearly nine percent of the vote.</p><p>\u2013 Wildfire victims \u2013</p><p>Of the 20 people killed in this week's fires, it is believed 19 were migrants.</p><p>One group of 18, including two children, was found Tuesday near a village 38 kilometres (24 miles) from the Turkish border.</p><p>Another migrant was found dead in the area of Lefkimmi near the Turkish border a day earlier.</p><p>The head of Evros' border guards, Valandis Gialamas, told AFP he expects more bodies of migrants to be found, as crossings from Turkey have increased in recent days.</p><p>A total of 140 people have been arrested for arson since the fires started on Saturday, of whom 73 are facing charges.</p><p>Sixty-two cases concern accidental arson, with the remaining 11 relating to purposeful acts.</p><p>Amnesty International on Wednesday called on Greece to \"urgently evacuate all those stranded in the Evros region and who are unable to move safely due to fires, and to ensure that refugees and migrants who have entered into Greece irregularly can seek asylum and are not illegally forcibly returned at the border.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXDJ-DIJO100903169294175104425876100111</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">100903</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6919-76N1-F03R-N0G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"799\"/><timeReceived>5:35 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 25, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>META PLATFORMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS516210 MEDIA STREAMING DIST SVCS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND OTHER MEDIA NETWORKS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC7374 COMPUTER PROCESSING &amp;

It was organized by the National Indigenous Fire Safety Council, which was created last year to support the development of safety measures and resiliency in Indigenous communities.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the conference, Cree Nation regional fire marshal Lee-Roy Blacksmith spoke with Quebec\u2019s Indigenous Affairs Minister Ian Lafreni\u00e8re about how fires impacted Eeyou Istchee. Blacksmith suggested that the initial response was hindered by poor communication, which improved after a core working group was established.  </p><p>\u201cDay one of the inland fires, the communication part wasn\u2019t really there,\u201d explained Blacksmith. \u201cWe had two or three firms having their own meetings about tactics. When we requested to have one core working group, we were all on the same page. It was good to meet them face-to-face finally.\u201d </p><p>In the coming weeks, Blacksmith will meet with fire chiefs from across the Cree Nation to begin planning for next year. Following the integration of several Cree firefighters with SOPFEU units this summer, they will discuss expanding training before next summer. </p><p>\u201cIf SOPFEU can\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll probably look into other forest fire agencies across Canada,\u201d said Blacksmith. \u201cSOPFEU used to put first response equipment on the towers along the highway or Chisasibi access road. They would notify the community you can pick up the water pump or hoses. That\u2019s a communication I\u2019ll be having with SOPFEU [to reconsider] down the road.\u201d </p><p>Conference speakers shared emerging tools for mitigating blazes, the roles of various organizations and strategic safety measures. Anthony Jumeau spoke about building sustainable capacity for prevention and protection techniques like drones and sprinkler systems.  </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get structure specialists that understand mitigation year-round,\u201d Jumeau told the Nation. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no pre-plans, you can\u2019t expect a fire department that shows up out of nowhere to understand exactly what\u2019s going on. It all starts with assessing your community\u2019s priorities to protect and how to do that.\u201d </p><p>Jumeau emphasized that the results justify the costs of loss reduction assessments. For example, analysis of Alberta\u2019s 2016 wildfire in Fort McMurray, the costliest Canadian disaster ever at nearly $10 billion, found that about three-quarters of the damages could have been avoided by having prevention methods in place.  </p><p>Existing programs can simplify this capacity building. A not-for-profit agency called Project Safe Canada offers advanced drone licensing to Indigenous communities, which can help map community surroundings to identify vulnerable areas and vegetation. Jumeau suggested that removing low brush for fire breaks can be coordinated with ecological conservation.  </p><p>\u201cIt has to be holistic, done simultaneously with the right people,\u201d asserted Jumeau. \u201cEveryone\u2019s doing their part \u2013 you\u2019ve got industry, community, emergency preparation specialists, the parks. From that point, there\u2019s a plan with realistic timelines. Maybe it\u2019s feasible that within a year we can have a risk reduction plan to help mitigate the next wildfire.\u201d </p><p>Jumeau a network of mitigation specialists who work between communities could reduce the need to call in the military or international firefighters. When thousands of recruits arrived from around the world this summer, Indigenous firefighters like Elaine (E-buzz) Trudeau wondered why they weren\u2019t called first. </p><p>\u201cWe never went out at all this year even though we\u2019re trained and ready to go,\u201d said Trudeau. \u201cI wrote a 15-page letter to the Minister of Natural Resources, then had a meeting with her, advocating for Indigenous firefighters to fight these fires in Ontario and out of province but nothing\u2019s come out of it.\u201d </p><p>As wildfire risk increases across the country, the crew leader from Wiikwemkoong First Nation on Manitoulin Island hopes to begin training sessions earlier in the season and have firefighting equipment closer at hand instead of bringing it from Thunder Bay. With particularly high interest in refresher courses this year, locals were eager for the call. </p><p>\u201cIs it because we\u2019re Indigenous?\u201d asked Trudeau. \u201cI get it, there are a lot of Indigenous people who have addictions, and some are heavy-set. Being out on the land 14 days keeps them away from their addictions, motivated to do something. I feel it gives them that sense of belonging, of being human. I\u2019m thinking of writing another letter to the ministry.\u201d </p><p>Jeremy Shanush, Eastmain\u2019s firefighting team leader, said many Cree forest firefighters were asking similar questions: \u201cWe\u2019re here, this is our backyard \u2013 why don\u2019t you ask us for help?\u201d </p><p>According to Jennifer Kamau, communications manager for the Canadian Interagency Fire Fighting Centre, \u201cthe discussion around utilizing existing Indigenous firefighting power would have to be initiated by the federal, provincial and territorial governments.\u201d </p><p>Canada\u2019s recently appointed minister of emergency preparedness, Harjit Singh Sajjan, told the Nation that he wants to leverage Indigenous knowledge and firefighting capacity to mobilize immediate emergency response. He said over 125 Indigenous fire guardians have been hired and trained, combining fire prevention with forest management. </p><p>\u201cAs this emergency season dies down, it will hopefully allow us to start identifying folks and which system to put them into,\u201d said Sajjan. \u201cWhere do they reside, how do they get called up, who will be responsible for that. When your community is not under threat and others are, you can go help one another.\u201d </p><p>Sajjan said it\u2019s crucial that these training systems are standardized so crew additions can \u201cplug and play\u201d quickly. While forest and fire management are provincially controlled, this year\u2019s extraordinary blazes prompted calls for a national firefighting service \u2013 and greater management by the First Nations who have been disproportionately impacted by wildfires.  </p><p>\u201cHopefully our leadership sits down with SOPFEU to maybe have a branch that protects people\u2019s bush camps,\u201d said Shanush. \u201cMaybe things will change after this year. Sometimes you need that scare.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-54eba53e3c0142c08089e68b32dda4f4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69CB-VM81-DY9S-T0Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1067\"/><timeReceived>10:48 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 10, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We have not experienced this level of widespread drought across the province this early in the year in recent memory.\u201d</p><p>Primary areas of concern include the northeastern corner of B.C. , as well as the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island, Ma said, noting that ministry staff are reaching out to communities to begin discussing more measures.</p><p>Half of the 34 provincial water basins are currently experiencing Level 4 drought conditions with Level 5 being the most severe, Ma said, adding that the situation is going to get worse. Since communities may not feel the full effects of drought for weeks, the provincial government is acting now, she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we are signalling today that the situation is serious,\u201d Ma said.</p><p>British Columbians should not only follow already existing water restrictions in their communities, but also do their part by using less water in their daily lives, she said. \u201cWe need people to pay attention,\u201d she said, adding that the province will offer a technical briefing later this week.</p><p>Meanwhile, today\u2019s campfire ban comes into effect with larger fires already prohibited across much of the province, against a backdrop of increased wildfire activity across the province, with more expected.</p><p>\u201cI urge everyone do their part,\u201d Ma said.</p><p>\u201cHuman-caused wildfires are completely preventable and divert critical resources away from lightning-caused fires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings have certainly escalated very drastically in a large part of the province over the weekend. The last three days saw more than 23,000 lightning strikes across much of province.

The fire suddenly flared on Monday.</p><p>While Rose said he initially felt safe from his vantage point on the eastern side of the lake, he and his partner decided to get out Tuesday, just as an evacuation order covering the more than 200 properties around the lake was issued.</p><p>The order was quickly upgraded to critical, urging the seasonal and permanent residents to leave for Lillooet or Whistler.</p><p>Evacuation alerts were also extended to areas north of Gun Lake, including Tyaughton Lake and the Tyax Resort, as the nearly 18-square-kilometre fire almost quadrupled in size since Monday.</p><p>Rose said his father\u2019s cabin has been in his family since 1945 and it is where he spent his childhood summers.</p><p>\u201cThere was always the fear of lightning (and) there was always a fear of a campfire setting off a forest fire and destroying the incredible natural beauty around that lake, so that\u2019s always been a fear in the back of our heads and now it\u2019s actually happened,\u201d he said.</p><p>He said the fire has burned family traditions and heritage to the ground.</p><p>\u201cSo, this is the first time in my 52 years that I\u2019ve ever actually seen it. And it ended up close. So, it has this sort of sense of \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019 of devastation,\u201d Rose said of watching the fire destroy the homes on the opposite side of the lake.</p><p>Rose\u2019s father, 81-year-old John Rose, said in a previous interview that he intended to stay as long as possible to keep the sprinklers running on the roof of their log house and on the heritage cabins on the neighbouring property built by his parents in the 1940s.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t heroic,\u201d said John Rose, a retired BC Parks Service ranger. \u201cI just don\u2019t think anyone else could handle this set up.\u201d</p><p>Owen Rose said his father has since reassessed the situation and left the property on Wednesday. He said their cabin was still standing and he hopes it stays that way.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s three generations and memories that are there. That would be the greatest loss. It\u2019s a massive psychological loss if they were to go,\u201d he said.</p><p>Wildfire Service director of operations Cliff Chapman told a news conference Wednesday that hot and dry conditions are likely to persist and strong winds will continue to pose a challenge on the fire lines.</p><p>\u201cThe conditions at Gun Lake specifically are quite challenging with the steep terrain, so we are utilizing our aviation assets. We have ground resources on that fire including structure protection, but also fire suppression crews,\u201d he said.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t confirm the number of homes lost to the fire.</p><p>\u201cThe plan will be to continue to try to protect the structures around Gun Lake and ideally try to steer that fire away from the structures and communities while the conditions persist and make it very challenging for us to actually suppress the fire.\u201d</p><p>The Gun Lake fire is among about 360 active wildfires across B.C. , including 14 that the B.C. Wildfire Service says were sparked since Tuesday.</p><p>The destroyed homes, evacuation orders and alerts came as most residents of the southern Okanagan town of Osoyoos were returning to their homes after a wildfire raced north from Washington state on Saturday, burning to within metres of some properties before a wind shift spared the community.</p><p>The flare up of the Downton Lake blaze happened just as the young Ontario firefighter who died last week in northeastern B.C. , was identified as 25-year-old Zak Muise.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230803RDA0003769837</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VM-DVD1-F0HF-82V0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

(GreenFirst or the Company) announced results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The Companys audited financial statements (\"Financial Statements\") and related Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&amp;A\") for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 are available on GreenFirsts website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.greenfirst.ca\">www.greenfirst.ca</url> and on SEDAR+ at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedarplus.ca\">www.sedarplus.ca</url>.</p><p>Highlights //st * Fourth quarter 2023 net loss from continuing operations was $21.6 million or $0.12 per share (diluted), compared to net earnings of $2.7 million or earnings of $0.01 per share (diluted) in the third quarter of 2023. For fiscal 2023, net loss from continuing operations was $48.8 million or $0.27 per share (diluted), compared to a net loss of $4.1 million or $0.02 per share (diluted) in 2022 on the same basis. * Average lumber prices for Q4 2023 were lower than Q3 2023, with an average selling price of $611/mfbm compared to $642/mfbm in Q3 2023. There was strong pricing momentum in the first half of Q3 2023 due to supply related concerns, which benefited results at the beginning of the third quarter. Despite lower prices, volumes in Q4 2023 were higher than Q3 2023 due to increased demand in the latter half of Q4 driven by positive trends in US housing starts and the central banks indicating a pause of further interest rate hikes. * The valuation provision for lumber and log inventory was decreased to $4.3 million from $8.7 million at the end of Q4 2022, generating a $4.4 million credit to cost of sales in fiscal 2023. * US Department of Commerces (\"US DOC\") Final Determination of its Fourth Administrative Review resulted in a final duty rate of 8.05%. The Company stands to benefit from an approximate US$6.9 million (CAD$9.2 million) recovery on duties paid in 2021, as recorded in 2023. Additionally, the ongoing lower duty rate has positively impacted the Company's earnings and free cash flow since August 1, 2023. * There continues to be downward pressure on newsprint and paper products prices. * On November 6, 2023, the company appointed Joel Fournier as its new Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Fournier is a seasoned executive with over two decades of hands-on experience in lumber mills across both Eastern and Western Canada. * A corporate reorganization was concluded to separate the assets from the lumber mills and the paper mill. This reorganization aims to provide for increased alignment of incentives, cost control measures and focus on the unique aspects of each business. On January 16, 2024, Terry Skiffington was engaged as Chief Executive Officer of the paper mill division. Mr. Skiffington is a skilled executive with a broad range of experience in the pulp and paper sector in Canada and globally.</p><p>\"Despite ongoing pricing pressures in the fourth quarter, we are starting to see some positive momentum in lumber markets at the beginning of 2024,\" said Paul Rivett, GreenFirst's Executive Chair. \"This coupled with an enhanced operational focus with Joel at the helm are factors that bode well for GreenFirst's resiliency in the current environment. On the paper side we expect productivity gains and a better cost profile with Terry's tenacious focus on operations, along with his many years of experience in this area.\"</p><p>Financial Highlights</p><p>The following selected financial information is from the Companys financial statements and MD&amp;A: //st (In thousands of CAD, except per share amounts) December 31, September 30, December 31, For the quarter ended 2023 2023 2022(2 ) Net sales from continuing operations Forest products(3) $ 70,112 $ 63,579 $ 69,628 Paper products 33,060 32,121 30,564 Total net sales from continuing operations 103,172 95,700 100,192 Operating (loss) earnings from continuing (22,496 ) 3,864 (33,747 ) operations Net (loss) earnings (21,588 ) 2,657 (43,615 ) Net (loss) earning from continuing operations (21,588 ) 2,657 (25,876 ) Basic (loss) earnings per share (0.12 ) 0.01 (0.25 ) Basic (loss) earnings per share from continuing (0.12 ) 0.01 (0.15 ) operations Diluted (loss) earnings per share (0.12 ) 0.01 (0.25 ) Diluted (loss) earnings per share from continuing operations (0.12 ) 0.01 (0.15 ) Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations(2) $ (17,999 ) $ 7,996 $ (27,385 ) (In thousands of CAD, except per share amounts) December 31, December 31, For the year ended 2023 2022(1 ) Net sales from continuing operations Forest products(3) $ 268,438 $ 398,098 Paper products 141,179 94,011 Total net sales from continuing operations 409,617 492,109 Operating (loss) earnings from continuing operations (47,595 ) 23,778 Net loss (47,019 ) (910 ) Net loss from continuing operations (48,802 ) (4,132 ) Basic loss per share (0.26 ) Basic loss per share from continuing operations (0.27 ) (0.02 ) Diluted loss per share (0.26 ) Diluted loss per share from continuing operations (0.27 ) (0.02 ) Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations(2) (30,181 ) 39,384 (In thousands of CAD) December 31, December 31, As at 2023 2022(1 ) Total assets $ 277,944 $ 371,504 Total liabilities 92,706 147,042 Total shareholders' equity $ 185,238 $ 224,462</p><p>1Certain prior period amounts have been restated as a result of a change in presentation of the Company's Financial Statements for continuing and discontinued operations under IFRS.

The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes shipped as a result of increased demand driven by positive macroeconomic indicators for housing, along with central banks being committed to holding interest rates. This was partially offset by lower lumber pricing, as prices in Q3 2023 were higher as a result of forest fire related disruptions. Paper segment sales also increased due to higher volumes but partially offset by the continued decline in paper pricing.</p><p>The Company reported cost of sales of $115.7 million during Q4 2023, an increase of $26.0 million or 29%, compared to Q3 2023. This increase reflected the impact of higher lumber and paper shipments in Q4 2023 along with higher charges related to inventory net realizable value recorded and higher maintenance costs at the Kapuskasing paper mill.</p><p>The initial duty deposit rate, totaling 20.23%, had remained in effect since the Company's acquisition of its sawmill and paper mill assets and has resulted in a higher payment in relation to our Canadian peers as at December 31, 2023, totaling US$22 million. The Company became eligible for the rate applied to all other lumber exporters from August 1, 2023 onwards, calculated by the US DOC to be 8.05%, following the results of the US DOC's Fourth Administrative Review.</p><p>The Company reported selling, general and administration expenses for continuing operations of $5.7 million during Q4 2023 which was an increase of $0.7 million compared to Q3 2023. This was primarily due to the prior quarter being impacted by credits related to recoveries on fringe benefits.</p><p>Cost Improvement at the Paper Mill and Operational Decentralization</p><p>The paper mill improved its cost profile with two operational paper machines and increased efficiencies in 2023. The paper mill continues to face many headwinds, primarily price pressures related to the secular decline of its paper products.</p><p>GreenFirsts paper mill operation has key operational and performance metrics that are very different from the lumber mill operations. As such, in 2023 the Board of Directors determined to separate the lumber mill assets from the paper mill assets. It is believed that this separation of businesses and decentralization of management will provide for more expedient decision-making, better alignment of incentives and more entrepreneurialism. This corporate decentralization was completed, with the appointment of a new paper mill CEO in January 2024.</p><p>Liquidity and Borrowings</p><p>At December 31, 2023, the Company had $28.9 million, less $5.4 million for standby letters of credit, of excess availability under the asset based lending (\"ABL\") portion of the Credit Facility and an additional $25.0 million of equipment financing under the Credit Facility. Subsequent to Q4 2023 the Company made net borrowings of $20.8 million against the Credit Facility, including $5.3 million on its equipment lending facility to finance a key strategic project. The borrowings are primarily to support the Company's seasonal harvesting activities.</p><p>New Board of Directors Slate</p><p>The Board of Directors has unanimously agreed to reduce its size to five directors at the next Annual General Meeting of our Shareholders on April 19, 2024 (The AGM). As previously disclosed, this reduction in the size of the Board of Directors is necessary to align with the reduced size and location of GreenFirsts operations. Three Board members graciously volunteered for this reduction, Barbara Anie, Sean Willy and Candice Bergen, and as such they will not be put forward on the slate for re-election at the AGM. Ms. Anie and Mr. Willy will continue to the AGM and Ms. Bergen has resigned.</p><p>On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire staff of GreenFirst, we want to thank Barbara, Sean and Candice for their dedication and service to the company, said Paul Rivett, GreenFirst's Executive Chair.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>High interest rates, macroeconomic concerns and tensions in Middle East and Europe continue to negatively impact lumber demand and pricing. The positive impact on new home builds in the US, due to lack of activity in the resale market, has also subsided as affordability continues to be negatively impacted by higher interest rates. However, there is indication from the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada for interest rate cuts in 2024, which could positively impact lumber demand.</p><p>In the longer-term, lack of available housing inventory, record levels of immigration in Canada, aging of homes in the US and demographic driven demand are expected to positively impact lumber markets.</p><p>Despite continued curtailment of lumber production in British Columbia and some other regions of North America, short-term pricing benefits have not been material. Reduced lumber demand and low inventory maintenance continue to balance out supply side pressures in the short-term. However, these curtailments may provide a positive effect in the long-term.</p><p>Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA</p><p>References to EBITDA in this document are measures of earnings (loss) before interest and finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, while references to Adjusted EBITDA reflect EBITDA plus other non-operating costs such as impact of valuation changes on the Company's investments, the impact of foreign exchange on the Companys long-term debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on sale of assets and other non-operating losses. Management believes that certain lenders, investors, and analysts use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a common valuation measurement and to measure the Companys ability to service debt and meet other payment obligations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to replace net earnings (loss), or other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP.

Interior over the past week.</p><p>A provincial state of emergency was enacted in B.C., with around 30,000 people under evacuation order as of Sunday. It\u2019s too early to provide estimates of insured damages from the fires as they are still ongoing, said IBC. </p><p>Those filing a claim don't need to have a full picture of the damage right away, said Ivans, as you can add to your claim later once you know the extent of the fire's impact on your property.</p><p>\"Once those evacuation orders are lifted, you'll have a better sense of what type of damage that your property may have incurred,\" said Rob de Pruis, IBC\u2019s national director of consumer and industry relations. </p><p>\"And then adjusters will come out and take a look at your property and meet you there to go through that process.\"</p><p>In a news release Sunday, IBC advised anyone forced to flee in the Northwest Territories and British Columbia to make a list of damaged or destroyed items and keep receipts for expenses they incurred. The more details, the better when it comes to making a claim, said IBC. </p><p>In addition to your home and personal property, your insurance may cover the contents of your freezer if it's spoiled after a power interruption, it said.</p><p>Often people have misconceptions about so-called \u201cact of God\u201d exclusions for disasters like fires, said de Pruis. As long as you didn\u2019t deliberately set fire to your own home, wildfire and smoke damage are widely covered under home insurance, and the origin of a wildfire does not affect your claim, he said. </p><p>\"There's no such thing as an 'act of God' exclusion in Canadian insurance policies,\" he said. </p><p>However, renters should be aware that without tenant insurance, their personal property isn\u2019t covered under their landlord\u2019s insurance, he said. </p><p>As well, not all car insurance covers smoke or fire damage, said de Pruis. </p><p>\"Fire damage or smoke damage to your vehicle is covered if you purchased optional comprehensive coverage,\" he said. </p><p>Once you report a loss to your insurance company, you will be assigned a claims adjuster who will investigate and help with the claims process, IBC said on its web page dedicated to the 2023 wildfire season. </p><p>There may be some short-term delays due to a high influx of calls, but insurance companies will be deploying resources from other areas to help with the volume, said de Pruis. </p><p>While starting a claim sooner may help you get reimbursed sooner, IBC said personal claims can usually be reported within two years of finding out about the damage or loss.</p><p>People trying to get new insurance policies during this time will have to wait until the imminent threat of fires is over, said de Pruis. </p><p>\"For the areas that are under imminent threat, like under an evacuation order, insurance companies temporarily restrict the sale of new insurance policies during these times,\" he said. However, renewals will continue to be processed during this time. </p><p>Before the B.C. and N.W.T. fires started rampaging, it was already a record-setting year for wildfires in Canada. More than one in four Canadians told a polling firm in June that they had been affected by fires during the spring. </p><p>Months of fires in Western Canada and the Atlantic provinces had already stretched Canada's firefighting capacity by the time summer rolled around, with international firefighters called in to help over the season and Natural Resources Canada predicting the abnormal fire season would continue.</p><p>There are more than 1,000 active fires across the country right now, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre Inc. More than 14 million hectares have been burned so far this year. </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 21, 2023.</p><p>Note to readers: This is a corrected story. The Insurance Bureau of Canada says there may be temporary delays with insurance claim calls due to high volume, but this is not related to claims in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-57ad23eae7684c349676ec38976f25a0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:690P-9621-JBVR-3092-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"747\"/><timeReceived>04:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 21, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

An accessory campground is also included in the proposal to be used mainly by participants or spectators.</p><p>RDN manager of long range planning Paul Thompson said the property is already a very busy place as it is actively used for off-road motorized vehicles such as ATVs and motorcycles. It is also located far from any residential areas.</p><p>As the property is Crown land, it is subject to local government regulations and a number of conditions will be attached to the Crown licence and will be recognized in the temporary use permit. That will include health, safety measures and the hours of operation.</p><p>Club representatives Oliver Sayah and Brad Davis made a presentation to the committee about their plans. The proposed development will include a track, obstacles and a parking area for recreational vehicle camping.</p><p>There will also be shipping containers for storage, as well as restoration of the vegetation on the site, and a groundwater storage tank to mitigate any dust from the track.Sayah pointed out there's no place on the Island where people with ATVs can go with their family and train in a closed, controlled environment.</p><p>Safety ATV instructors, Sayah added, can't find places where they can provide training and instruction to people.</p><p>\"That's where this whole process started almost four years ago with the Ministry of Forests and we followed all their different rules and requirements that they've asked for along the way. And then that leads us over to where we are today,\" said Sayah.</p><p>Sayah indicated the club has a safety plan that would require riders to strictly adhere to and also sign waivers. That includes wearing helmets, elbow and knee pads, and boots. They plan to ride two to three times a month, from 9 a.m. to 6 pm. He added when there is a high forest fire danger risk, the facility will be closed.</p><p>In order to minimize the traffic going through Melrose Place or any of the residential communities, Sayah said they're recommending accessing the training facility via Claymore Road West route.</p><p>Jim Moir, a retired RCMP member from Campbell River and a chief instructor through Canada's Safety Council for ATV and snowmobiling, endorsed the club's proposal. He spoke to the committee and told them that he conducts operator safety training courses but has found it difficulty to find places to teach and train people on Vancouver Island. He holds the courses in Vancouver and in the Interior.</p><p>Electoral Area E (Nanoose Bay) director Bob Rogers supported the club's proposal.</p><p>\"It's important to have sites like this available rather than just having people utilizing these and doing training and so on, or having the events without any potential for some safeguards,\" said Rogers. \"And I am reminded of that particularly during this fire situation.\"</p><p>The committee voted unanimously to recommended the RDN board approve the temporary use permit and to direct staff to notify residents nearby the proposed ATV facility site on the date it will be voted on by the board.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Michael.Briones@pqbnews.com\">Michael.Briones@pqbnews.com</email></p><p>Facebook</p><p>Copyright 2023 Vancouver Island Free Daily</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAIFDI-news20230616PVC4482991</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAIFDI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68GP-3S71-F0HF-80JR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

We have not experienced this level of widespread drought across the province this early in the year in recent memory.\"</p><p>Primary areas of concern include the northeastern corner of B.C., as well as the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island, Ma said, noting that ministry staff are reaching out to communities to begin discussing more measures.</p><p>Half of the 34 provincial water basins are currently experiencing Level 4 drought conditions with Level 5 being the most severe, Ma said, adding that the situation is going to get worse. Since communities may not feel the full effects of drought for weeks, the provincial government is acting now, she said.</p><p>\"That's why we are signalling today that the situation is serious,\" Ma said.</p><p>British Columbians should not only follow already existing water restrictions in their communities, but also do their part by using less water in their daily lives, she said. \"We need people to pay attention,\" she said, adding that the province will offer a technical briefing later this week.</p><p>Meanwhile, today's campfire ban comes into effect with larger fires already prohibited across much of the province, against a backdrop of increased wildfire activity across the province, with more expected.</p><p>\"I urge everyone do their part,\" Ma said. \"Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable and divert critical resources away from lightning-caused fires.\"</p><p>\"Things have certainly escalated very drastically in a large part of the province over the weekend. The last three days saw more than 23,000 lightning strikes across much of province. Since April 1, 904 wildfires have burnt more than a total of 1.15 million hectares.</p><p>Ma said drought conditions and high temperatures have compounded this lightning activity, creating a concerning combination.</p><p>\"It's the drought condition in addition to the wildfire situation that is really causing concern and causing us to pay very, very close attention,\" she said.</p><p>RELATED: 1 million hectares burned in B.C. as wildfire season just getting started</p><p>Cliff Chapman, director of provincial operations for British Columbia Wildfire Service, said B.C. currently lacks the capacity to respond to human-caused fires, including smaller fires that fall into Category 1.</p><p>\"We have not had a large concern with human-caused campfires creating wildfires, but as Minister Ma mentioned we do not have the capacity to respond to fires that we can prevent.\"</p><p>Chapman said B.C. has put in what he called a \"significant request\" to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>\"We have asked for somewhere in the neighbourhood of 400 additional resources,\" he said. \"We are also working with our partners in Montana, California (and northwestern United States) to secure additional resources, not just for the next five days but really looking at it through the lens of the next two months.\"</p><p>Chapman said 160 firefighters from the United States and Mexico are currently in B.C. Another 100 Mexican firefighters are set to join but not until July 17, he added. Overall, he predicted an increase of additional resources from abroad, while also stressing the need for people to do their part.</p><p>\"We are in a position in this province, that we cannot afford to have a preventable fire occur in this province,\" he said. \"We are asking for help from the globe\u2026to come support our response right now. If we have just one campfire, it gets away and starts a very impactful fire, that's going to draw resources away from wherever they currently are.\"</p><p>@<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:wolfgangdepnerwolfgang.depner@blackpress.caLike\">wolfgangdepnerwolfgang.depner@blackpress.caLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230710PAB4490293</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68NK-DWT1-JD2C-J0VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"715\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

An accessory campground is also included in the proposal to be used mainly by participants or spectators.</p><p>RDN manager of long range planning Paul Thompson said the property is already a very busy place as it is actively used for off-road motorized vehicles such as ATVs and motorcycles. It is also located far from any residential areas.</p><p>As the property is Crown land, it is subject to local government regulations and a number of conditions will be attached to the Crown licence and will be recognized in the temporary use permit. That will include health, safety measures and the hours of operation.</p><p>Club representatives Oliver Sayah and Brad Davis made a presentation to the committee about their plans. The proposed development will in-clude a track, obstacles and a parking area for recreational vehicle camping.</p><p>There will also be shipping containers for storage, as well as restoration of the vegetation on the site, and a groundwater storage tank to mitigate any dust from the track.Sayah pointed out there\u2019s no place on the Island where people with ATVs can go with their family and train in a closed, controlled environment.</p><p>Safety ATV instructors, Sayah added, can\u2019t find places where they can provide training and instruction to people.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where this whole process started almost four years ago with the Ministry of Forests and we followed all their different rules and requirements that they\u2019ve asked for along the way. And then that leads us over to where we are today,\u201d said Sayah.</p><p>Sayah indicated the club has a safety plan that would require riders to strictly adhere to and also sign waivers. That includes wearing helmets, elbow and knee pads, and boots. They plan to ride two to three times a month, from 9 a.m. to 6 pm. He added when there is a high forest fire danger risk, the facility will be closed.</p><p>In order to minimize the traffic going through Melrose Place or any of the residential communities, Sayah said they\u2019re recommending accessing the training facility via Claymore Road West route.</p><p>Jim Moir, a retired RCMP member from Campbell River and a chief instructor through Canada\u2019s Safety Council for ATV and snowmobiling, endorsed the club\u2019s proposal. He spoke to the committee and told them that he conducts operator safe-ty training courses but has found it difficulty to find places to teach and train people on Vancouver Island.

Officers en-route immediately advised Coastal Fire Centre to request assistance and started to make their way to the fire site.</p><p>The RCMP received further updates en route that the forest nearby was in flames.</p><p>The first RCMP member on scene used fire extinguishers to knock down some of the flames and begin to create a fire line. When the second officer arrived, he helped expand those lines and prevent further spread \u2014 and were aided by two volunteers with a fire blanket.</p><p>\"Help arrived by way of a water truck from a forest company,\" says a release from the RCMP. \"The driver from the truck that was on fire had gone to get the water truck the moment he realized his vehicle was on fire. The two Campbell River RCMP officers, tended the hose along with some nearby campers in order to help battle the blaze and put out most of the fire.\"</p><p>The vehicle that caught fire had suffered a mechanical failure causing the truck to flip on its side. The passenger in the vehicle suffered injuries which were serious enough that she was transported by police to an ambulance on Highway 28 which took her to Campbell River Hospital for treatment. The injuries were non life threatening.</p><p>Coastal Fire Centre helped with the remnants of the fire after the water from the water truck had been expended. Coastline Towing arrived to haul away the smouldering hulk of a truck away. This was the third incident of a vehicle fire on Forest Service Roads in as many weeks in the area.</p><p>The Campbell River RCMP would like to thank everyone who chipped in to keep the event from turning into a fire disaster.</p><p>RELATED: Fire department prevents spread of fire on vessel at Freshwater Marina</p><p>Copyright 2021 Campbell River Mirror</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPRIV-news20210730PCB4192739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPRIV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6386-4Y11-JD2C-J38V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"332\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

But this year, from July 4 to July 6, the maximum temperatures recorded at the Niagara District Airport were 31.1 C, 31.6 C and 32.1 C, respectively. </p><p><br/><br/> \"Those are not record-breaking temperatures. This time of year, the records are into the 34 C range, thankfully, not broken. That's a relief for me at least,\" said Kidd. \"Maximum high temperatures fluctuate here and there. Three days usually though, that can be longer for a heat spell. Sometimes we see one day or two days ... a little more unusual.\"<br/><br/> Over the next week, temperatures are predicted to be on the lower side of average, staying between 23 and 26 C, with overnight lows about 17 to 20 C. <br/><br/> But in the next few months, Environment Canada's prediction model says Niagara may see a return to extreme heat. At the very least, it is expecting above-average temperatures in July and a \"chance of being above normal\" into August and September. Very similar to what is expected across the province. <br/><br/> \"There's a higher certainty in the far north but where we are in southern Ontario, it's a medium confidence,\" Kidd said of the temperature predictions. \"Which is basically saying it's better than low confidence, but (the seasonal model) is not high confidence so you can take it or leave it.\"<br/><br/> Heat patterns are more reliable, particularly short-term forecasts but precipitation numbers - whether expecting above or below normal levels and helping to inform Niagara's agricultural sector - is another matter, and \"so hard to determine.\" <br/><br/> Especially during summer when the storms are a bit smaller, don't last as long and are \"very finicky.\"<br/><br/> \"All it takes is one really heavy rain or a line of thunderstorms that just keep pummelling the same area,\" said Kidd. \"Our models aren't showing a clear trend one way or the other.\"<br/><br/> With summer underway, there are numerous weather patterns and events people should have their eye on. The first is UV rays, which Kidd said can be surprisingly strong, especially after a few days of cloudiness, and thunderstorms. <br/><br/> People also need to understand the difference between a watch and a warning. A severe thunderstorm watch means people should prepare, as the ingredients are there for a severe weather incident. A warning means take action immediately. <br/><br/> \"When thunder roars, go indoors,\" Kidd added, and stay indoors until the thunder has passed, at least 30 minutes. <br/><br/> \"Most lightning injuries and deaths actually occur, not at the peak of the thunderstorm, but after,\" she explained. \"It's really tough. If you've got your kids and they want to play their soccer, got to keep them off the field for 30 minutes. Because thunder, lightning can come out from a cloud and travel quite a distance and then reach the ground.<br/><br/> \"That's where people get into trouble.\"<br/><br/> If you can't get indoors or to a vehicle, Kidd said don't take shelter under a large tree - which is more likely to get hit by lightning and fall - but find smaller trees and bushes, in low lying areas. And stay out of the water, reminding people \"water is a good conductor of electricity.\"<br/><br/> \"There's a reason we say these things - it's not to be party poopers,\" she said. <br/><br/> The forest fire smoke is expected to remain an issue until the wildfires in northeastern Ontario and Quebec are extinguished. The resulting air quality can deteriorate quickly, not only from the smoke but also from general pollution, sunlight, and heat. <br/><br/> Keep an eye on the air quality index, especially vulnerable populations, said Kidd. <br/><br/> \"There's a slew of things to pay attention to. I think its important when there's not a whole lot going on in your area, that's the time when you're asking yourself, 'am I prepared?\" she said, such as a long-term power outage with no air conditioning. <br/><br/> \"Enjoy your summer and be prepared.\"<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2023070768407866</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68MY-HWM1-JDV5-F0NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"671\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

This interspecies song-cycle is told with song and narration through the perspective of animals.</p><p>A group of animals flee from a vicious forest fire and seek refuge in Bear's cave. Waiting out the inferno, they reflect on their lives, their lost garden, and their impending doom. These unlikely and singed bedfellows share their stories and take comfort in their newfound community while the fire encroaches.</p><p>Sung in English and Cree, this 75-minute sung-through story cabaret combines live music and immersive visuals with wry humour and poignant storytelling. Intimate and entertaining, The Cave is a timely parable about the folly of our actions and the impact on friends and foes alike of the climate crisis that rages around us.</p><p>This show is filled with beautiful songs, brilliant acting and dancing, and insightful learnings about our surroundings!

But this year, from July 4 to July 6, the maximum temperatures recorded at the Niagara District Airport were 31.1 C, 31.6 C and 32.1 C, respectively. </p><p><br/><br/> \"Those are not record-breaking temperatures. This time of year, the records are into the 34 C range, thankfully, not broken. That's a relief for me at least,\" said Kidd. \"Maximum high temperatures fluctuate here and there. Three days usually though, that can be longer for a heat spell. Sometimes we see one day or two days ... a little more unusual.\"<br/><br/> Over the next week, temperatures are predicted to be on the lower side of average, staying between 23 and 26 C, with overnight lows about 17 to 20 C. <br/><br/> But in the next few months, Environment Canada's prediction model says Niagara may see a return to extreme heat. At the very least, it is expecting above-average temperatures in July and a \"chance of being above normal\" into August and September. Very similar to what is expected across the province. <br/><br/> \"There's a higher certainty in the far north but where we are in southern Ontario, it's a medium confidence,\" Kidd said of the temperature predictions. \"Which is basically saying it's better than low confidence, but (the seasonal model) is not high confidence so you can take it or leave it.\"<br/><br/> Heat patterns are more reliable, particularly short-term forecasts but precipitation numbers - whether expecting above or below normal levels and helping to inform Niagara's agricultural sector - is another matter, and \"so hard to determine.\" <br/><br/> Especially during summer when the storms are a bit smaller, don't last as long and are \"very finicky.\"<br/><br/> \"All it takes is one really heavy rain or a line of thunderstorms that just keep pummelling the same area,\" said Kidd. \"Our models aren't showing a clear trend one way or the other.\"<br/><br/> With summer underway, there are numerous weather patterns and events people should have their eye on. The first is UV rays, which Kidd said can be surprisingly strong, especially after a few days of cloudiness, and thunderstorms. <br/><br/> People also need to understand the difference between a watch and a warning. A severe thunderstorm watch means people should prepare, as the ingredients are there for a severe weather incident. A warning means take action immediately. <br/><br/> \"When thunder roars, go indoors,\" Kidd added, and stay indoors until the thunder has passed, at least 30 minutes. <br/><br/> \"Most lightning injuries and deaths actually occur, not at the peak of the thunderstorm, but after,\" she explained. \"It's really tough. If you've got your kids and they want to play their soccer, got to keep them off the field for 30 minutes. Because thunder, lightning can come out from a cloud and travel quite a distance and then reach the ground.<br/><br/> \"That's where people get into trouble.\"<br/><br/> If you can't get indoors or to a vehicle, Kidd said don't take shelter under a large tree - which is more likely to get hit by lightning and fall - but find smaller trees and bushes, in low lying areas. And stay out of the water, reminding people \"water is a good conductor of electricity.\"<br/><br/> \"There's a reason we say these things - it's not to be party poopers,\" she said. <br/><br/> The forest fire smoke is expected to remain an issue until the wildfires in northeastern Ontario and Quebec are extinguished. The resulting air quality can deteriorate quickly, not only from the smoke but also from general pollution, sunlight, and heat. <br/><br/> Keep an eye on the air quality index, especially vulnerable populations, said Kidd. <br/><br/> \"There's a slew of things to pay attention to. I think its important when there's not a whole lot going on in your area, that's the time when you're asking yourself, 'am I prepared?\" she said, such as a long-term power outage with no air conditioning. <br/><br/> \"Enjoy your summer and be prepared.\"<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WELTRI-2023070768407861</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WELTRI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68MY-HWM1-JDV5-F0RP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433814</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"671\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Welland Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Welland Tribune (Ontario) Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 7, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOA4</classCode><className>WEATHER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N110000CC</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING &amp; HUNTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000049</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Tuesday, Feb. 27, 18 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> TICKETS<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.<br/><br/> PAST LOCATIONS<br/><br/> \\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8<br/><br/> \\x95 Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and

But this year, from July 4 to July 6, the maximum temperatures recorded at the Niagara District Airport were 31.1 C, 31.6 C and 32.1 C, respectively. </p><p><br/><br/> \"Those are not record-breaking temperatures. This time of year, the records are into the 34 C range, thankfully, not broken. That's a relief for me at least,\" said Kidd. \"Maximum high temperatures fluctuate here and there. Three days usually though, that can be longer for a heat spell. Sometimes we see one day or two days ... a little more unusual.\"<br/><br/> Over the next week, temperatures are predicted to be on the lower side of average, staying between 23 and 26 C, with overnight lows about 17 to 20 C. <br/><br/> But in the next few months, Environment Canada's prediction model says Niagara may see a return to extreme heat. At the very least, it is expecting above-average temperatures in July and a \"chance of being above normal\" into August and September. Very similar to what is expected across the province. <br/><br/> \"There's a higher certainty in the far north but where we are in southern Ontario, it's a medium confidence,\" Kidd said of the temperature predictions. \"Which is basically saying it's better than low confidence, but (the seasonal model) is not high confidence so you can take it or leave it.\"<br/><br/> Heat patterns are more reliable, particularly short-term forecasts but precipitation numbers - whether expecting above or below normal levels and helping to inform Niagara's agricultural sector - is another matter, and \"so hard to determine.\" <br/><br/> Especially during summer when the storms are a bit smaller, don't last as long and are \"very finicky.\"<br/><br/> \"All it takes is one really heavy rain or a line of thunderstorms that just keep pummelling the same area,\" said Kidd. \"Our models aren't showing a clear trend one way or the other.\"<br/><br/> With summer underway, there are numerous weather patterns and events people should have their eye on. The first is UV rays, which Kidd said can be surprisingly strong, especially after a few days of cloudiness, and thunderstorms. <br/><br/> People also need to understand the difference between a watch and a warning. A severe thunderstorm watch means people should prepare, as the ingredients are there for a severe weather incident. A warning means take action immediately. <br/><br/> \"When thunder roars, go indoors,\" Kidd added, and stay indoors until the thunder has passed, at least 30 minutes. <br/><br/> \"Most lightning injuries and deaths actually occur, not at the peak of the thunderstorm, but after,\" she explained. \"It's really tough. If you've got your kids and they want to play their soccer, got to keep them off the field for 30 minutes. Because thunder, lightning can come out from a cloud and travel quite a distance and then reach the ground.<br/><br/> \"That's where people get into trouble.\"<br/><br/> If you can't get indoors or to a vehicle, Kidd said don't take shelter under a large tree - which is more likely to get hit by lightning and fall - but find smaller trees and bushes, in low lying areas. And stay out of the water, reminding people \"water is a good conductor of electricity.\"<br/><br/> \"There's a reason we say these things - it's not to be party poopers,\" she said. <br/><br/> The forest fire smoke is expected to remain an issue until the wildfires in northeastern Ontario and Quebec are extinguished. The resulting air quality can deteriorate quickly, not only from the smoke but also from general pollution, sunlight, and heat. <br/><br/> Keep an eye on the air quality index, especially vulnerable populations, said Kidd. <br/><br/> \"There's a slew of things to pay attention to. I think its important when there's not a whole lot going on in your area, that's the time when you're asking yourself, 'am I prepared?\" she said, such as a long-term power outage with no air conditioning. <br/><br/> \"Enjoy your summer and be prepared.\"<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CATHIE-2023070768407860</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CATHIE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68MY-HWM1-JDV5-F0PC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"671\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 St. Catharine's Standard All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Standard (St. Catharines, Ontario) Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 7, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOA4</classCode><className>WEATHER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N110000CC</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING &amp; HUNTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000049</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Bouchie Lake resident was moved by the outpouring of effort by all the frontline wildfire fighters, this summer, and the emergency workers who respond to our times of greatest need.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cHey B.C\u2026.yeah, we\u2019re B.C. strong\u2026working together\u2026and we\u2019re standing tall,\u201d Strang\u2019s naturally bluesy voice growls. \u201cNeighbour helping neighbour\u2026just the B.C. way.\u201d</p><p>Strang is a prolific songwriter, and he frequently releases albums at a much faster clip than the big-label acts who take up all the commercial radio airspace. He\u2019s a DIY musician and loves his craft to the tune of four albums in the past three years, two of them in 2023 alone. But he admitted that his most recent two, Acoustic Crossroads and Digital Dust, took a lot out of him.</p><p>\u201cWhen Digital Dust was done, my cup was pretty much empty. It has taken awhile for that creative cup to fill again,\u201d he said. But he felt those sparks when the climax of the forest fire season was upon us, a few weeks ago. He grabbed his banjo and started rolling over the strings, he added some gritty elec-tric guitar, he brushed on a little underlay of piano, and spattered it with a snappy snare drum. He called up his frequent vocal collaborator Laura Kelsey, with a chorus by Deb Strang, Gage Landrud, Shannah Yager and Sarah Eberle.</p><p>Whipping up a home-based song is what he wishes other musicians would do more of, to share the creative voice and sending out those vibes that music isn\u2019t held inside some unattainable elite production system. He\u2019s not even in a band, although he loves and appreciates his many collaborators. He has a part-time group of like-minded friends who call themselves Easy Act To Follow, but otherwise, Strang creates for the sake of his own fun and to share.</p><p>\u201cThe whole gist of my music is positive songs that uplift people or give someone something to ponder on,\u201d he told The Observer. \u201cGlobal unity is important. As we travel together around the sun, let\u2019s be kind together and work together.\u201d</p><p>Some of his songs are sober examinations of the human condition. A track called Nothing came to him when he saw some graffiti on a cement wall where a mattress on the ground was clearly the sleeping spot for a homeless person. The graffiti drew a picture of what a room might look like, were that mattress indoors. Gone from Strang\u2019s lyrics were the pomp and sizzle of celebrating fire-fighters. Gone from the melody were the dancing bounces of joy. Nothing could stand as the national anthem for understanding those less fortunate, and an ode to appreciating the simple things in life. Dry eyes are a challenge, on first listening, with the picture of that graffiti staring back at you and the vibration of his lone cello across your heart.</p><p>But in the spirit of the great allaround entertainers of the world-Robin Williams, Charlie Chaplin, Sammy Davis, Carol Burnett-Strang plays all the notes of the human emotional instrument. In true pull-my-finger fashion, he loves to make the listener laugh, as well. While many songwriters turn their nose up at the comedy tune or the novelty song, in their pursuit of the serious hit, Strang channels his mirth for life into music. He loves Pick Your Nose and Crazy Ole Fart as much as Dark November Skies or Different Shade of Grey on his spectrum of songs.</p><p>He might be under the influence of instrument addiction. His home studio walls are hanging with a variety of string and wood, every corner touched by cables or keys.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how accomplished I am on any of them,\u201d he says, modestly. His latest addition is a National Tricone guitar, for its distinctive metallic jangle. It\u2019s one of only two in Canada, of that model.</p><p>He found it at Rufus Guitar Shop in Vancouver where he also bought his beloved Martin J40 acoustic that he\u2019s played so often the surface has a thin spot where his hand has rubbed it down.</p><p>\u201cAny sound and style will take you one way. It will transcend you into a feeling or a mood where the song will sort of emerge out of the fog,\u201d he said.</p><p>He found his trusty electric guitar in the garbage bin after the fire at B&amp;B Music in Prince George in 2006, and only now does he think it might be finished its playing days.</p><p>And if you can\u2019t find what you\u2019re listening for, you make it. He turned himself into a luthier for one particular project, when his hunt for the rare banjola-a banjo-ukulele hybrid-came up empty. Fine. He built his own. Don\u2019t tell the elitists, but those sweet sounds he gets come out of a door skin and leftover pallet wood.</p><p>Strang releases most of his music to online radio and streaming services, and he gets updates on the many places around the world that play it for their listening audiences. He even gets some small royalty cheques, every so often.</p><p>But Strang is well aware that money is not the true musician\u2019s motivation. He simply says, \u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>You can find him on YouTube and share the gifts yourself.</p><p>Staff writer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20230920PSCA0003884336</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:696Y-BN01-JD2C-J0MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"833\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

More than half of SMBs (51percent) experienced asignificant rise in their overall costs, while 44percent cited a direct loss in revenue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Our survey reveals that climate-driven disasters are having a devastating impact on lives, livelihoods, and the economy,\" says Doron Telem, National ESG Leader at KPMG in Canada. \"An alarming number of companies- nearly six in 10- were impacted because of extreme weather events, and the year is not over. A changing climate means businesses need to make climate risk a priority to manage the costly reality of being caught unprepared in the future.\"</p><p> Key poll findings:59 per cent of Canadian SMBs say they were \"directly impacted\" by extreme weather events51 per cent experienced disruptions in their supply chain or broken supply chains45 per cent say their facilities were damaged, for example, a store or factory, etc.41 per cent had to relocate their operations or move to other facilities54 per cent say their costs rose significantly44 per cent suffered a direct loss in revenue44 per cent say their employees were also directly impacted</p><p>The survey shows just how much various regions of the country were impacted by extreme weather. For example, in Ontario outside of the Greater Toronto Area, nearly 80percent (79percent) of SMBs   significantly higher than the national average - were directly impacted,72percent say their costs rose significantly, 61percent suffered supply chain disruptions and more than half (56percent) suffered damaged facilities. Similarly, SMBs in B.C. (outside of the Greater Vancouver Area), Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Atlantic Canada were hit hard by extreme weather.</p><p>Canada's largest companies are also feeling the heat. As many as three-quarters (75percent) of Canadian CEOs believe that natural disasters and extreme weather events are trends that will negatively impact their organization's prosperity over the next three years, according to KPMG International's 2023 CEO Outlook survey.

Whitehorse Council has made this one of their top priority issues. A detailed study was made in 2020 to more clearly understand the risk of a \u2018wildland/urban interface fire \u2013WUI\u2019 to Whitehorse. To reduce the risk, the city and territorial government have started to reduce the fire fuel in the area south of the city. To improve the ability to communicate with Whitehorse residents in the event of a WUI, the City has offered the Whitehorse Alert service to those who sign up. These are all good moves but, for this fire season at least, the public has received very little information on evacuation in case of fire. Our group, the Citizens for a Firesmart Whitehorse wants to help fill this important gap. We urge Whitehorse residents to take the following steps: Before the end of May Sign up for the City of Whitehorse \u201cWhitehorse Alert\u201d at Whitehorse.ca/emergency. It\u2019s free! By doing this, emergency information about things like fires, evacuation orders, earthquakes can be communicated to you quickly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Review your 72hour kit to make sure its ready (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.getprepared.ca\">www.getprepared.ca</url>)</p><p>Make a plan for your evacuation if and when it is ordered. Where will you go if heading north or south (authorities will advise details in the event)? How will you communicate with friends and other family members? Clean the area around your house for potential fire starters (dead leaves, lumber or firewood close to your house, pine needles in your eavestroughs, etc.)</p><p>For rural residents, if you have one, test your home sprinkler system.</p><p>During Fire Season Abide by any \u201cno burn\u201d announcements. Remember all open fires are prohibited within the City of Whitehorse, with the exception of a personal fire pit on your personal property or registered campsite with an appropriate fire pit for the purposes of cooking food. Exceptions may be made through the issuance of a permit; generally, these permits do not allow burning May through October.</p><p>Keep your vehicle\u2019s fuel tank full in case you have to evacuate.</p><p>Be prepared to camp or be self sufficient for several days.</p><p>Monitor the \u2018fire weather index\u2019 (as shown on the fire risk signs along the highway) and adjust your activities accordingly with respect to potential sources of fire such as cooking fires, smoking, and sparks from combustion engine exhaust.</p><p>Post your evacuation planning on your refrigerator or near the door so all residents know about it.</p><p>In hot dry weather be aware that the fire risk can quickly become extreme. Watch for lightning strikes and smoke in the sky from any nearby fires. Report them! If you are instructed to evacuate Listen for any instructions from city or territorial officials. If you are signed up to Whitehorse Alert, you will receive instructions right on your phone and/or email.</p><p>Move any gas BBQs or other propane, diesel and/or gas appliances and equipment away from the house.</p><p>Remove window shades and curtains \u2013 they can catch fire from heat outside.</p><p>Move furniture to the centre of the room, away from windows and doors.</p><p>Shut all windows and doors and lock the door when you leave.</p><p>Keep calm and respectful to others.</p><p>In rural sub-divisions, consider starting your sprinkler systems before you leave.</p><p>You are responsible for your own safety \u2013 stay alert during fire season.

An accessory campground is also included in the proposal to be used mainly by participants or spectators.</p><p>RDN manager of long range planning Paul Thompson said the property is already a very busy place as it is actively used for off-road motorized vehicles such as ATVs and motorcycles. It is also located far from any residential areas.</p><p>As the property is Crown land, it is subject to local government regulations and a number of conditions will be attached to the Crown licence and will be recognized in the temporary use permit. That will include health, safety measures and the hours of operation.</p><p>Club representatives Oliver Sayah and Brad Davis made a presentation to the committee about their plans. The proposed development will include a track, obstacles and a parking area for recreational vehicle camping.</p><p>There will also be shipping containers for storage, as well as restoration of the vegetation on the site, and a groundwater storage tank to mitigate any dust from the track.Sayah pointed out there's no place on the Island where people with ATVs can go with their family and train in a closed, controlled environment.</p><p>Safety ATV instructors, Sayah added, can't find places where they can provide training and instruction to people.</p><p>\"That's where this whole process started almost four years ago with the Ministry of Forests and we followed all their different rules and requirements that they've asked for along the way. And then that leads us over to where we are today,\" said Sayah.</p><p>Sayah indicated the club has a safety plan that would require riders to strictly adhere to and also sign waivers. That includes wearing helmets, elbow and knee pads, and boots. They plan to ride two to three times a month, from 9 a.m. to 6 pm. He added when there is a high forest fire danger risk, the facility will be closed.</p><p>In order to minimize the traffic going through Melrose Place or any of the residential communities, Sayah said they're recommending accessing the training facility via Claymore Road West route.</p><p>Jim Moir, a retired RCMP member from Campbell River and a chief instructor through Canada's Safety Council for ATV and snowmobiling, endorsed the club's proposal. He spoke to the committee and told them that he conducts operator safety training courses but has found it difficulty to find places to teach and train people on Vancouver Island. He holds the courses in Vancouver and in the Interior.</p><p>Electoral Area E (Nanoose Bay) director Bob Rogers supported the club's proposal.</p><p>\"It's important to have sites like this available rather than just having people utilizing these and doing training and so on, or having the events without any potential for some safeguards,\" said Rogers. \"And I am reminded of that particularly during this fire situation.\"</p><p>The committee voted unanimously to recommended the RDN board approve the temporary use permit and to direct staff to notify residents nearby the proposed ATV facility site on the date it will be voted on by the board.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Michael.Briones@pqbnews.com\">Michael.Briones@pqbnews.com</email></p><p>Facebook</p><p>Copyright 2023 Parksville Qualicum Beach News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PARKQB-news20230611PNE4482009</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PARKQB2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68G4-WHR1-JD2C-J382-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438316</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.
