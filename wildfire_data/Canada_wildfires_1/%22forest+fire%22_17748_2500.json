He purchased Drefke's Insurance and Sporting Goods store and renamed it Four Seasons Sports. He built the business from nothing into something better from 1977-1986 before selling to Norm and Elsie Zadow. </p><p>Along the way, he obtained his commercial pilot's licence after a long period of training and writing exams and that spawned an immense enthusiasm for flying. </p><p>\"I bought a Piper PA-11 in 1985 and I'd fly my plane around the Ottawa Valley. It needed a lot of work and I met a guy, Jerry Losee. I agreed to give him one-third ownership in exchange for rebuilding the plane,'' Mr. Dalzell explained in an interview from his home in Ottawa. \"To make a long story short, we came up with the idea of putting the plane into a corporation called the Eganville Eagles Flying Club. We eventually had six to seven members and four planes. I took a lot of aerial photos from the planes.'' </p><p>In 2018, Mr. Dalzell went in another direction of aerial photography by acquiring drones, mostly from online sites, including a special model Mavic 3 produced by the Chinese company DJI, which he said controls 70 percent of the world\u2019s drone market.  </p><p>Mr. Dalzell flies his unmanned vehicles around the Valley to capture images for his FARMER DRONE YouTube channel, where he has placed 150 videos, including ones of Jennifer Doelman\u2019s Farmer\u2019s Daughter Honey operation and Kevin Dick of Barclay Dick Farm Supply. </p><p>Mr. Dalzell likes to let the non-farmer community know how much work it takes to run a farm operation and the sacrifices that are made. Mr. Dick\u2019s daughter Jennifer does farm work for her dad as a separate company and gave Mr. Dalzell permission to fly the drones along with Mr. Dick. </p><p>\"Mr. Dick was very pleased with what I did. I did four videos of his place, his equipment, his sunflowers,'' Mr. Dalzell said. \"I took a few photos on the ground and what I've done is put up a good musical soundtrack to compliment the video.'' </p><p>Based on the popularity of his railway-themed photos, Mr. Dalzell plans to start a playlist soon on his channel called Railroads of Renfrew County, which will include stories and historical facts. You will see other images of Douglas, Deacon, Calabogie, Lochwinnoch, Foresters Falls, Arnprior and more. </p><p>\"When I posted a photo about the old CN line near Stone Road and Gallagher Road, holy geez, there were about 200 likes and comments -- about a country-road intersection,'' Mr. Dalzell said, stunned at the reaction his stuff has garnered. \"The frigging thing has gone crazy.\u2019\u2019 </p><p>It\u2019s all about nostalgia. People are gobbling up what Mr. Dalzell provides them. Who doesn\u2019t love history? Who doesn\u2019t remember going into a train station, buying tickets and talking to the station master, and then walking up the steps of the train and travelling from one community to another? </p><p>Hey, we all cherished the toots of the locomotive, the horns and the beauty of the countryside, prompting Mr. Dalzell to impart from a famous ballad, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got til it\u2019s gone.\u2019\u2019 Joni Mitchell\u2019s song was called Big Yellow Taxi but it could have been Big Yellow Train. </p><p>Several images below the dam in Douglas near the old grist mill had long-time natives in a tizzy of delight and wanting more. One image in particular showed this-narrow section of the Bonnechere River where you could not jump across but you need a pole, he said. He thinks that some day that area he is referring to will become an island of its own. </p><p>Mr. Dalzell owns nine drones, which cost up to $5,000 each, including cameras in each one. </p><p>He has a friend, Bob Campbell, who also lived in Foymount when it was part of the Canadian Forces and he accompanies him on occasion to capture beauty or \u2013 destruction, in the case of the Centennial Lake forest fire in Griffith this past June. Mr. Campbell drives and Mr. Dalzell flies. </p><p>When he arrives at a particular site, Mr. Dalzell turns on the drone, operating it as if it's a kid's joystick, but it\u2019s a much larger and more sophisticated device, like a helicopter lifting off the ground. </p><p>\"You can use any shutter speed, any F stop,\u2019\u2019 he said. </p><p>One of his next projects will be a weekly series of videos called Koe the Dairy Cow. The series will follow the life of the animal, which will actually be born this month, through its life from a calf to a producing dairy cow and all the things a farmer has to do for her along the way. </p><p>Mr. Dalzell has done some commercial work in the form of a one-minute advertising video to promote Leeann Abruzzi\u2019s Glamping on the Madawaska enterprise near Burnstown where you can enjoy glorified camping on the waterfront in a custom-made tent. </p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, what I\u2019m doing is only the tip of the iceberg,\u2019\u2019 he said. </p><p>\u201cThanks to Les and so glad he is sharing his beautiful pictures of Douglas from the air that we have never seen,\u2019\u2019 said Doreen Behm-Bruce, the administrator of the Growing Up in Douglas page on Facebook. \u201cHe gave me the okay to share them on our site. </p><p>\u201cI have had a few comments from people who have left Douglas and they are sure enjoying the photos and makes them homesick.\u2019\u2019 </p><p>Danny Gallagher is a freelance writer, author and Montreal Expos historian.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-d8d5bdb7ec204b3d87631ef95e35e958</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69S7-HS41-JBVR-302S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"983\"/><timeReceived>10:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 30, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

People need to take a level of personal responsibility. The rules apply to them, they need to make sure they're following them to ensure that we do not have any unintentionally set man-made fires.\"<br/><br/> A smoky haze has descended on Ottawa, Toronto and other cities and towns as wind patterns shift, leading to air quality warnings advising people to take precautions to avoid respiratory distress, such as staying indoors and avoiding outdoor exercise.<br/><br/> \"The severity of forest fires increased because of the dry, hot weather,\" said Green Leader Mike Schreiner, who called on the government to hire more firefighting crews in addition to reducing Ontario's carbon footprint.<br/><br/> \"As a society, we have to confront the challenge we're facing.\"<br/><br/> Liberal MPP Stephen Blais (Orleans) said the Ford government's 2018 decision to cancel 758 green energy projects and build new highways - such as the 413 and Bradford Bypass - is \"going to make climate change worse.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023060868125566</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DP-K201-JDV5-F0XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"468\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

He purchased Drefke's Insurance and Sporting Goods store and renamed it Four Seasons Sports. He built the business from nothing into something better from 1977-1986 before selling to Norm and Elsie Zadow. </p><p>Along the way, he obtained his commercial pilot's licence after a long period of training and writing exams and that spawned an immense enthusiasm for flying. </p><p>\"I bought a Piper PA-11 in 1985 and I'd fly my plane around the Ottawa Valley. It needed a lot of work and I met a guy, Jerry Losee. I agreed to give him one-third ownership in exchange for rebuilding the plane,'' Mr. Dalzell explained in an interview from his home in Ottawa. \"To make a long story short, we came up with the idea of putting the plane into a corporation called the Eganville Eagles Flying Club. We eventually had six to seven members and four planes. I took a lot of aerial photos from the planes.'' </p><p>In 2018, Mr. Dalzell went in another direction of aerial photography by acquiring drones, mostly from online sites, including a special model Mavic 3 produced by the Chinese company DJI, which he said controls 70 percent of the world\u2019s drone market.  </p><p>Mr. Dalzell flies his unmanned vehicles around the Valley to capture images for his FARMER DRONE YouTube channel, where he has placed 150 videos, including ones of Jennifer Doelman\u2019s Farmer\u2019s Daughter Honey operation and Kevin Dick of Barclay Dick Farm Supply. </p><p>Mr. Dalzell likes to let the non-farmer community know how much work it takes to run a farm operation and the sacrifices that are made. Mr. Dick\u2019s daughter Jennifer does farm work for her dad as a separate company and gave Mr. Dalzell permission to fly the drones along with Mr. Dick. </p><p>\"Mr. Dick was very pleased with what I did. I did four videos of his place, his equipment, his sunflowers,'' Mr. Dalzell said. \"I took a few photos on the ground and what I've done is put up a good musical soundtrack to compliment the video.'' </p><p>Based on the popularity of his railway-themed photos, Mr. Dalzell plans to start a playlist soon on his channel called Railroads of Renfrew County, which will include stories and historical facts. You will see other images of Douglas, Deacon, Calabogie, Lochwinnoch, Foresters Falls, Arnprior and more. </p><p>\"When I posted a photo about the old CN line near Stone Road and Gallagher Road, holy geez, there were about 200 likes and comments -- about a country-road intersection,'' Mr. Dalzell said, stunned at the reaction his stuff has garnered. \"The frigging thing has gone crazy.\u2019\u2019 </p><p>It\u2019s all about nostalgia. People are gobbling up what Mr. Dalzell provides them. Who doesn\u2019t love history? Who doesn\u2019t remember going into a train station, buying tickets and talking to the station master, and then walking up the steps of the train and travelling from one community to another? </p><p>Hey, we all cherished the toots of the locomotive, the horns and the beauty of the countryside, prompting Mr. Dalzell to impart from a famous ballad, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got til it\u2019s gone.\u2019\u2019 Joni Mitchell\u2019s song was called Big Yellow Taxi but it could have been Big Yellow Train. </p><p>Several images below the dam in Douglas near the old grist mill had long-time natives in a tizzy of delight and wanting more. One image in particular showed this-narrow section of the Bonnechere River where you could not jump across but you need a pole, he said. He thinks that some day that area he is referring to will become an island of its own. </p><p>Mr. Dalzell owns nine drones, which cost up to $5,000 each, including cameras in each one. </p><p>He has a friend, Bob Campbell, who also lived in Foymount when it was part of the Canadian Forces and he accompanies him on occasion to capture beauty or \u2013 destruction, in the case of the Centennial Lake forest fire in Griffith this past June. Mr. Campbell drives and Mr. Dalzell flies. </p><p>When he arrives at a particular site, Mr. Dalzell turns on the drone, operating it as if it's a kid's joystick, but it\u2019s a much larger and more sophisticated device, like a helicopter lifting off the ground. </p><p>\"You can use any shutter speed, any F stop,\u2019\u2019 he said. </p><p>One of his next projects will be a weekly series of videos called Koe the Dairy Cow. The series will follow the life of the animal, which will actually be born this month, through its life from a calf to a producing dairy cow and all the things a farmer has to do for her along the way. </p><p>Mr. Dalzell has done some commercial work in the form of a one-minute advertising video to promote Leeann Abruzzi\u2019s Glamping on the Madawaska enterprise near Burnstown where you can enjoy glorified camping on the waterfront in a custom-made tent. </p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, what I\u2019m doing is only the tip of the iceberg,\u2019\u2019 he said. </p><p>\u201cThanks to Les and so glad he is sharing his beautiful pictures of Douglas from the air that we have never seen,\u2019\u2019 said Doreen Behm-Bruce, the administrator of the Growing Up in Douglas page on Facebook. \u201cHe gave me the okay to share them on our site. </p><p>\u201cI have had a few comments from people who have left Douglas and they are sure enjoying the photos and makes them homesick.\u2019\u2019 </p><p>Danny Gallagher is a freelance writer, author and Montreal Expos historian.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-0583fd50c1914e088808d1e65f2431d7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69S7-HS41-JBVR-3034-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"983\"/><timeReceived>10:26 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 30, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But this year, from Tuesday to Thursday, the maximum temperatures recorded at the Niagara District Airport were 31.1 C, 31.6 C and 32.1 C, respectively. </p><p><br/><br/> \"Those are not record-breaking temperatures. This time of year, the records are into the 34 C range, thankfully, not broken. That's a relief for me at least,\" said Kidd. \"Maximum high temperatures fluctuate here and there. Three days usually though, that can be longer for a heat spell. Sometimes we see one day or two days ... a little more unusual.\"<br/><br/> Over the next week, temperatures are predicted to be on the lower side of average, staying between 23 and 26 C, with overnight lows about 17 to 20 C. <br/><br/> But in the next few months, Environment Canada's prediction model says Niagara may see a return to extreme heat. At the very least, it is expecting above-average temperatures in July and a \"chance of being above normal\" into August and September. Very similar to what is expected across the province. <br/><br/> With summer underway, there are numerous weather patterns and events people should have their eye on. The first is UV rays, which Kidd said can be surprisingly strong, especially after a few days of cloudiness, and thunderstorms. <br/><br/> People also need to understand the difference between a watch and a warning. A severe thunderstorm watch means people should prepare, as the ingredients are there for a severe weather incident. A warning means take action immediately.<br/><br/> \"When thunder roars, go indoors,\" Kidd added, and stay indoors until the thunder has passed, at least 30 minutes. <br/><br/> \"Most lightning injuries and deaths actually occur, not at the peak of the thunderstorm, but after,\" she explained. \"It's really tough. If you've got your kids and they want to play their soccer, got to keep them off the field for 30 minutes. Because thunder, lightning can come out from a cloud and travel quite a distance and then reach the ground.<br/><br/> \"That's where people get into trouble.\"<br/><br/> If you can't get indoors or to a vehicle, Kidd said don't take shelter under a large tree - which is more likely to get hit by lightning and fall - but find smaller trees and bushes, in low lying areas. Stay out of the water, she said, reminding people \"water is a good conductor of electricity.\"<br/><br/> \"There's a reason we say these things - it's not to be party poopers,\" she said. <br/><br/> The forest fire smoke is expected to remain an issue until the wildfires in northeastern Ontario and Quebec are extinguished. <br/><br/> The resulting air quality can deteriorate quickly, not only from the smoke but also from general pollution, sunlight, and heat. <br/><br/> Keep an eye on the air quality index, especially vulnerable populations, said Kidd. <br/><br/> \"Enjoy your summer and be prepared.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CATHIE-2023070868409441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CATHIE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68N3-PM91-F197-53PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"493\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 St. Catharine's Standard All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Standard (St. Catharines, Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 8, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOA4</classCode><className>WEATHER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But this year, from Tuesday to Thursday, the maximum temperatures recorded at the Niagara District Airport were 31.1 C, 31.6 C and 32.1 C, respectively. </p><p><br/><br/> \"Those are not record-breaking temperatures. This time of year, the records are into the 34 C range, thankfully, not broken. That's a relief for me at least,\" said Kidd. \"Maximum high temperatures fluctuate here and there. Three days usually though, that can be longer for a heat spell. Sometimes we see one day or two days ... a little more unusual.\"<br/><br/> Over the next week, temperatures are predicted to be on the lower side of average, staying between 23 and 26 C, with overnight lows about 17 to 20 C. <br/><br/> But in the next few months, Environment Canada's prediction model says Niagara may see a return to extreme heat. At the very least, it is expecting above-average temperatures in July and a \"chance of being above normal\" into August and September. Very similar to what is expected across the province. <br/><br/> With summer underway, there are numerous weather patterns and events people should have their eye on. The first is UV rays, which Kidd said can be surprisingly strong, especially after a few days of cloudiness, and thunderstorms. <br/><br/> People also need to understand the difference between a watch and a warning. A severe thunderstorm watch means people should prepare, as the ingredients are there for a severe weather incident. A warning means take action immediately.<br/><br/> \"When thunder roars, go indoors,\" Kidd added, and stay indoors until the thunder has passed, at least 30 minutes. <br/><br/> \"Most lightning injuries and deaths actually occur, not at the peak of the thunderstorm, but after,\" she explained. \"It's really tough. If you've got your kids and they want to play their soccer, got to keep them off the field for 30 minutes. Because thunder, lightning can come out from a cloud and travel quite a distance and then reach the ground.<br/><br/> \"That's where people get into trouble.\"<br/><br/> If you can't get indoors or to a vehicle, Kidd said don't take shelter under a large tree - which is more likely to get hit by lightning and fall - but find smaller trees and bushes, in low lying areas. Stay out of the water, she said, reminding people \"water is a good conductor of electricity.\"<br/><br/> \"There's a reason we say these things - it's not to be party poopers,\" she said. <br/><br/> The forest fire smoke is expected to remain an issue until the wildfires in northeastern Ontario and Quebec are extinguished. <br/><br/> The resulting air quality can deteriorate quickly, not only from the smoke but also from general pollution, sunlight, and heat. <br/><br/> Keep an eye on the air quality index, especially vulnerable populations, said Kidd. <br/><br/> \"Enjoy your summer and be prepared.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2023070868409312</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68N3-PM91-F197-53K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"493\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Portugal had pine forests burning for a seventh day Friday while Britain sweated through another day of unusually warm weather. </p><p>The firefighters\u2019 brigade from the French Gironde region said the spread of the forest fire was limited overnight due to little wind but conditions for containing the blaze remained \u201cunfavorable\u201d due to hot, dry weather.</p><p>The fire in the Gironde region and neighboring Landes has burned more than 74 square kilometers (29 square miles) since Tuesday and led to the evacuation of at least 10,000 people. </p><p>More than 360 firefighters and 100 specialized land vehicles were sent from Germany, Romania, Poland and Austria. They are joining over 1,000 French firefighters already on site. Greece sent two specialized Canadair aircraft.</p><p>Sweden deployed two two firefighting Air Tractor planes to to help battle separate wildfires in the Brittany region, in western France. </p><p>More than than 600 square kilometers (232 square miles) of forest land has burned since the start of the year in France, more than any other year in the past decade, according to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).</p><p>In Portugal, more than 1,600 firefighters, 500 vehicles and 17 aircraft fought the week-old wildfire that has charred around 10 square kilometers (4 square miles). Much of the burned land is the Serra da Estrela National Park, a protected nature area and UNESCO World Heritage Site that is thinly populated.</p><p>The burning areas are hard for firefighters on the ground to reach due to high peaks and deep ravines, but two of the country\u2019s three Canadair water-dumping aircraft have been unavailable on some recent days for mechanical reasons.</p><p>Britain's weather service extended an extreme heat warning through the weekend for most of England and parts of Wales. Temperatures were forecast for above 30 degrees Celsius (86 F) and to reach up to 36 degrees Celsius (96.8 F) in some places before more typical cooler weather and rain arrive next week. </p><p>The Met Office said many people were expected to experience health effects from the hot weather, especially individuals who are sensitive to the heat. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-b2c395c50c2a6b1b6cd7a523c7c82da4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664R-7M71-DY9S-T2MW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"404\"/><timeReceived>07:55 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 12, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

fundraiser has been launched to honour the memory of a firefighter killed while fighting British Columbia's largest wildfire last week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 25-year-old firefighter who died Friday has been identified as Zak Muise in an online obituary and tribute by the firefighting contractor he worked for.</p><p>Money is being raised in honour of Muise for the Canadian Critical Incident Stress Foundation which provides support, education and training for first responders, veterans and their families and runs a camp for families and children coping with loss.</p><p>Vulnerable residents evacuate from Saskatchewan First Nation due to wildfire smoke</p><p>A First Nation in northern Saskatchewan says it has moved about 300 members out of the community to safety in response to health threats arising from forest fire smoke.</p><p>The Fond du Lac Denesuline Nation, which is on Lake Athabasca and about 60 kilometres from the Northwest Territories boundary, says the evacuation focused on people with compromised cardiorespiratory conditions and other health issues.</p><p>Indigenous Services Canada says 253 vulnerable members were sent by air last Friday to Saskatoon, due to the poor air quality caused by heavy smoke.</p><p>Here's what else we're watching ...</p><p>Rejected agreements show workers are fighting to catch up: experts</p><p>Experts say a recent string of rejected tentative agreements across the country is a sign that workers are expecting more from both their employers and their unions. </p><p>This was on display in the Greater Toronto Area over the weekend as employees at 27 Metro grocery stores rejected a tentative agreement and went on strike. </p><p>Port workers in B.C. also recently rejected a mediated tentative agreement, only for their union to quickly reach another one that will again be voted on by Friday. </p><p>Alberta no longer pursuing plan to dump RCMP for provincial police force</p><p>Alberta's government is no longer formally pursuing its plan to dump the RCMP in favour of a new provincial police force.</p><p>However, Justice Minister Mickey Amery says the idea is not dead, and his department will continue to consult with Albertans on where they want to go with policing.</p><p>The Alberta police force option has been studied and touted by the United Conservative Party government for years, but it has faced opposition -- including from municipalities -- over concerns on cost, implementation and staffing.</p><p>Toronto's alcohol in parks pilot launches today</p><p>Starting today, Toronto residents are allowed to consume alcohol in some parks, as the city kicks off a time-limited pilot project.</p><p>The pilot project runs until Oct. 9 and allows those 19 and older to drink alcohol at 27 selected parks across Toronto, including Queen's Park, Corktown Common and Earlscourt Park, where officials will formally launch the initiative later this morning.</p><p>City officials have said drinking in parks is not a major issue, most residents do so respectfully and responsibly, and no tickets have been issued for it in 2023.</p><p>Feds say 6.6 million 'unsafe vehicles' on the road</p><p>The federal government says some 6.6 million unsafe vehicles are likely on the road despite having unresolved safety recalls.</p><p>Transport Canada estimated in an analysis from June that one in five of the 33.3 million vehicles registered as of 2019 have outstanding recalls but continue to ply the streets and highways, potentially endangering occupants and other road users.</p><p>The department is proposing new rules that would require companies that issue a safety recall to quickly post related information on their website in order to boost awareness and fix the defect.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published August 2, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

(\"SPOD\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has amended its mineral option agreement with Visible Gold Mines Inc. (\"Visible\") respecting the Megali exploration property (the \"Property\") dated August 3, 2022 (the \"Agreement\") (see SPOD's press release dated August 4, 2022).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pursuant to the amended Agreement, SPOD is required to conduct at least $350,000 in exploration expenditures on the Property on or before September 18, 2023, to meet its first-year option obligations under the Agreement. SPOD has already met the other first year option obligations, issuing 700,000 Class A common shares of the Company to Visible at a deemed price of $0.09 per share and by making a cash payment of $50,000 to Visible. The shares are subject to a statutory four-month hold period.</p><p>The purpose of the extension is due to the restrictions imposed by the Quebec government earlier in the summer because of the regional forest fire situation. These restrictions directly impacted exploration operations, and, therefore, the Company was delayed in kicking off its current and ongoing surface exploration field activities. As previously announced by SPOD on August 10th, exploration activities have begun, and the exploration team is making excellent progress executing on the exploration plan. The Company is eager to report exploration results as they become available. About Spod Lithium Corp.</p><p>Spod Lithium Corp. is a mineral exploration company focused on the acquisition and development of mineral properties containing battery, base, and precious metals. The Company's flagship assets are its Lithium properties located in the James Bay region of Quebec and the Nipigon and Niemi region of Ontario, Canada.

The waters surrounding the Florida Keys (islands) are at 100-degree F (38C). The region's beautiful coral formations have been bleaching white. In the nearby Gulf of Mexico, warmer waters may result in new storms whipping up this week and heading toward the southern states of the U.S. - threatening movement of oil and gas shipments out of Texas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fact: On the Pacific coastline, Hurricane Hilary has passed over Mexico's Baja Peninsula, and is moving through highly populated Southern California and toward inland Nevada. Hilary is the first such storm to hit this region in almost a century. Think about how many people have moved into California since the 1920s -- and now are in the path of the storm.</p><p>Fact: A large \"heat dome\" sits over much of the U.S., from the northern Plains states (the Dakotas) extending south into Missouri. Many days the midday temperature tops 100F.</p><p>Fact: In Washington and Oregon the skies are clouded over with smoke from regional fires. A few times this summer literally hundreds of forest fires blazing in Canada - thanks to drought conditions there - resulted in giant smoke formations moving hundreds of miles south into the U.S. New York City sat enveloped in a giant yellow cloud for a few days.</p><p>Fact: France has issued \"heat alerts\" for southern parts of that country as much of southern Europe experiences a heat wave. People are told to stay indoors. French wine-growing regions may be affected as the grapes reach maturity. Spain has wildfires blazing at its Canary Islands tourist destinations. Tourists in southern EU nations are experiencing high heat conditions.</p><p>Fact: A Pacific Ocean cyclone (they're called a hurricane in the Atlantic) passed near to the Hawaiian Islands, and dry conditions and high winds whipped forest fire flames, scorching, and destroying 2,000 buildings in the historic Hawai'ian Kingdom capital and former whaling city of Lahaina on the island of Maui. This is a tourist attraction drawing two million visitors each year. Almost 1,000 persons remain missing since this tragic event and U.S. President Biden visits the island this week. This is the worst U.S. wildfire in more than a century.</p><p>Taken together, these facts tell a clear story: the \"future\" of the climate change crisis is here. The United States administration took early steps to meet climate change challenges in the form of the \"whole of government\" approach originating in an Executive Order issued by Biden just one week after taking office. We outlined the sweeping measures of the EO in a G&amp;A Institute Resource Paper.</p><p>Counterpoint: It's another \"fact\" now that the U.S. conservative movement led by the Heritage Foundation think tank has developed a comprehensive plan (almost 1,000 pages) for the next Republican president (presumably in 2024) to counter (and dismantle) the current \"whole of government\" plan to address climate change. This is the battle plan for the first months of a future Republican presidency.</p><p>We bring you the details in two top stories this week. We suggest readers consider the effects of the \"facts\" of climate events of recent days in the context of the \"battle plan\" to reverse U.S. government, industry, and community actions to address the increasing threats of the climate crisis challenges.</p><p>This is just the introduction of G&amp;A's Sustainability Highlights newsletter this week.

The heat, coming amid what has already been a particularly hot summer, has turned Greece's forests, including large areas of easily flammable pine trees, into bone-dry tinderboxes.</p><p>Other big fires have been burning forests and farmland in the southern Greek region of the Peloponnese, while a major blaze that burned into the northern suburbs of Athens and Mount Parnitha national park on the fringes of the capital was on the wane. Firefighting efforts continued in Parnitha, where French, Israeli and Cypriot firefighters were helping their Greek colleagues.</p><p>The wildfires have stretched Greece's firefighting capabilities to the limit, and the government has appealed for help from abroad. More than 20 countries in Europe and the Middle East have responded, sending planes, helicopters, vehicles and manpower.</p><p>Greece's foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, tweeted Monday he had spoken to his Russian counterpart and asked whether Russia could send a second Beriev Be-200 firefighting plane to Greece. So far Greece has leased one such aircraft, the largest operating in the Greek fires.</p><p>Despite the help, many residents and local officials have complained of a lack of firefighters, and some have taken to calling in to Greek television networks to appeal for help, particularly from water-dropping planes and helicopters.</p><p>\"We were completely forsaken. There were no fire brigades, there were no vehicles, nothing!\" David Angelou, who had been on Evia in the seaside village of Pefki, said Sunday night after leaving the island by ferry to the mainland harbor of Arkitsa.</p><p>\"You could feel the enormous heat, there was also a lot of smoke. You could see the sun, a red ball, and then, nothing else around,\" he said.</p><p>Greek authorities, scarred by a deadly wildfire in 2018 near Athens that killed more than 100 people, have put the emphasis on saving lives, sending dozens of evacuation orders for inhabited areas in the path of the flames and organizing flotillas of coast guard and navy vessels, ferries and other boats to evacuate people from coastal areas when necessary. Some of those who died in the 2018 fire in Mati drowned trying to escape by sea after they became trapped on the beach.</p><p>But some, including local officials in affected areas, have argued the evacuation orders have come too soon, saying residents could provide valuable help to stretched firefighting resources in saving villages.</p><p>On Monday, the flames continued across northern Evia, threatening yet more villages. Satellite imagery from the European Union's Earth Observation Program showed vast tracts of the island charred, with the fire having cut across it from coast to coast.</p><p>Greece's Civil Protection chief, Nikos Hardalias, has stressed that firefighters have been doing everything they can. Firefighters from the Ukraine, Romania and Serbia had been sent as reinforcements to Evia, where more than 600 firefighters were operating, along with five helicopters and five water-dropping planes, the fire department said Monday.</p><p>On Sunday, a small firefighting plane crashed on the western Greek island of Zakinthos while fighting a smaller fire there.</p><p>One volunteer firefighter died last week after being hit by a falling electricity pole at the site of the fire north of Athens, while four more volunteer firefighters are hospitalized in the Greek capital.</p><p>All were injured on Aug. 5. Two suffered burns to their arms and their condition was not life-threatening, while the other two suffered extensive burns and were hospitalized in critical condition in the intensive care unit of Athens' main trauma hospital, the hospital said Monday.</p><p>Health authorities said Monday that an Israeli firefighter suffered an eyelid injury and received first aid before returning to the area north of Athens where the 16-member Israeli contingent of firefighters sent as reinforcements were operating.</p><p>In southern Greece, a 38-year-old civilian who had been helping fight a wildfire was hospitalized with an eye injury, officials said.</p><p>Massive fires have also raged for more than 10 days in neighboring Turkey, where firefighters were still trying to extinguish blazes in five locations in the coastal province of Mugla, in the country's southwest.</p><p>\"The situation is improving,\" Agriculture and Forestry Minister Bekir Pakdemirli said late on Sunday. \"It is too soon to say the fires are under control, but we are reaching that point.\"</p><p>Wildfires were also burning in southern Italy and in Montenegro in the Balkans, where a large fire in the Malo Brdo district of the capital Podgorica came close to houses.</p><p>On Evia overnight, residents and firefighters managed to save most of the village of Pefki, on the island's northern tip, where fast-moving flames entered the outskirts Saturday evening and destroyed at least one home.</p><p>A ferry that had been sent to Pefki to potentially evacuate people by sea turned into a temporary shelter for those residents of that and other nearby villages who didn't have the means to flee toward north Evia's main harbor of Aidipsos, or who wanted to remain near their homes so they could return and check on them whenever it was safe to do so.</p><p>Monday morning found dozens of local residents, many with their pets, sleeping on chairs on the ferry, or on the lounge chairs of Pefki's pebble beach. Most of the surrounding villages had been left without power and running water due to the fire.</p><p>&amp; -Elena Becatoros, The Associated Press</p><p>RELATED: Wildfires rampage in Greek forests, cut large island in half</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-4196686</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63H3-W5S1-F103-34T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1038\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Group Ltd. or it's licensors All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Abbotsford News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 9, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Athens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the last two days nineteen people believed to be migrants - including two children - have been killed in forest fires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A fire fanned by strong winds ripped through the foothills of Mount Parnitha, the largest forest adjoining the capital, burning near the outskirts of a national park and threatening a casino in the area.</p><p>Evacuations were ordered on Wednesday morning for several settlements in the area, including three nursing homes.</p><p>The blaze damaged homes in the northwestern Athens district of Menidi, which is also close to a military camp.</p><p>\"Many people don't want to leave their homes,\" Nikos Kountromichalis, a Hellenic Red Cross organiser, told state TV ERT in Menidi.</p><p>\u2013 'Fainted in their yards' \u2013</p><p>\"We found some elderly people who had fainted in their own yards,\" he said, adding that his team had treated several residents for burns and respiratory problems.</p><p>Fires have already destroyed homes and properties in the nearby suburbs of Hasia and Fyli.</p><p>A migrants detention centre in Amygdaleza, north of Athens, was also evacuated.</p><p>Greek firefighters have battled over 350 fires over the last five days, including over 200 in the last 48 hours, Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias told an emergency news conference.</p><p>\"In 32 years of service I've never seen such extreme conditions,\" Greek fire department chief Yiorgos Pournaras told reporters, noting that even during the night winds remained high.</p><p>The Parnitha fire had spread even though water bombers were on-site in minutes, Pournaras said.</p><p>The Greek capital woke up Wednesday to the smell of scorched earth and thick black smoke covering the sky.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, the wind does not help at all,\" Stathis Topalidis, deputy mayor of Menidi, told state TV ERT.</p><p>On Tuesday, authorities ordered the evacuation of Ano Liosia in northwest Athens - a district of over 25,000 people - although several stayed at their houses to try and protect their properties.</p><p>\"Conditions remain difficult and in many cases extreme,\" fire department spokesman Yiannis Artopios said in a televised address.</p><p>Another big blaze was still raging at a landfill in the industrial zone of Aspropyrgos, west of Athens.</p><p>Flames continued to spread unchecked for a fifth day in the northeastern region of Evros, close to the Turkish border in Alexandroupolis and the Dadia forest, and home to rare birds of prey.</p><p>More evacuations were ordered in the region overnight.</p><p>\u2013 Online rumours \u2013</p><p>Unfounded rumours and allegations have also been spreading rapidly on social media that blame migrants for responsibility for the outbreak of the fires.</p><p>Greece's Supreme Court Prosecutor on Wednesday ordered local officials to investigate both the causes of the catastrophic fire and alleged claims of racism towards migrants.</p><p>Greek authorities on Tuesday arrested three people in northern Greece who had forced undocumented migrants into a cargo trailer, blaming them for being responsible for the fires.</p><p>The detainees posted a video on social media urging more people to do the same.</p><p>Eighteen people including two children were found dead Tuesday in a forest fire near the Turkish border, north of Alexandroupolis.</p><p>As no local residents had been reported missing \"the possibility that they are people who entered our country illegally is under investigation,\" fire department spokesman Yiannis Artopios said in a televised address.</p><p>Another person believed to be a migrant was found dead on Monday.</p><p>Fires were also raging on the islands of Evia and Kythnos, the region of Boeotia, north of Athens and in western Greece.</p><p>Another fire that broke out on Tuesday on the island of Samothraki was contained overnight, but the island remains without electricity.</p><p>Over 40,000 hectares (nearly 99,000 acres) were destroyed in wildfires in just three days from August 19 to 21, according to a report by the National Observatory of Athens.</p><p>The very hot and dry conditions which increase the fire risk will persist until Friday, according to meteorologists.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The heat, coming amid what has already been a particularly hot summer, has turned Greece's forests, including large areas of easily flammable pine trees, into bone-dry tinderboxes.</p><p>Other big fires have been burning forests and farmland in the southern Greek region of the Peloponnese, while a major blaze that burned into the northern suburbs of Athens and Mount Parnitha national park on the fringes of the capital was on the wane. Firefighting efforts continued in Parnitha, where French, Israeli and Cypriot firefighters were helping their Greek colleagues.</p><p>The wildfires have stretched Greece's firefighting capabilities to the limit, and the government has appealed for help from abroad. More than 20 countries in Europe and the Middle East have responded, sending planes, helicopters, vehicles and manpower.</p><p>Greece's foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, tweeted Monday he had spoken to his Russian counterpart and asked whether Russia could send a second Beriev Be-200 firefighting plane to Greece. So far Greece has leased one such aircraft, the largest operating in the Greek fires.</p><p>Despite the help, many residents and local officials have complained of a lack of firefighters, and some have taken to calling in to Greek television networks to appeal for help, particularly from water-dropping planes and helicopters.</p><p>\"We were completely forsaken. There were no fire brigades, there were no vehicles, nothing!\" David Angelou, who had been on Evia in the seaside village of Pefki, said Sunday night after leaving the island by ferry to the mainland harbor of Arkitsa.</p><p>\"You could feel the enormous heat, there was also a lot of smoke. You could see the sun, a red ball, and then, nothing else around,\" he said.</p><p>Greek authorities, scarred by a deadly wildfire in 2018 near Athens that killed more than 100 people, have put the emphasis on saving lives, sending dozens of evacuation orders for inhabited areas in the path of the flames and organizing flotillas of coast guard and navy vessels, ferries and other boats to evacuate people from coastal areas when necessary. Some of those who died in the 2018 fire in Mati drowned trying to escape by sea after they became trapped on the beach.</p><p>But some, including local officials in affected areas, have argued the evacuation orders have come too soon, saying residents could provide valuable help to stretched firefighting resources in saving villages.</p><p>On Monday, the flames continued across northern Evia, threatening yet more villages. Satellite imagery from the European Union's Earth Observation Program showed vast tracts of the island charred, with the fire having cut across it from coast to coast.</p><p>Greece's Civil Protection chief, Nikos Hardalias, has stressed that firefighters have been doing everything they can. Firefighters from the Ukraine, Romania and Serbia had been sent as reinforcements to Evia, where more than 600 firefighters were operating, along with five helicopters and five water-dropping planes, the fire department said Monday.</p><p>On Sunday, a small firefighting plane crashed on the western Greek island of Zakinthos while fighting a smaller fire there.</p><p>One volunteer firefighter died last week after being hit by a falling electricity pole at the site of the fire north of Athens, while four more volunteer firefighters are hospitalized in the Greek capital.</p><p>All were injured on Aug. 5. Two suffered burns to their arms and their condition was not life-threatening, while the other two suffered extensive burns and were hospitalized in critical condition in the intensive care unit of Athens' main trauma hospital, the hospital said Monday.</p><p>Health authorities said Monday that an Israeli firefighter suffered an eyelid injury and received first aid before returning to the area north of Athens where the 16-member Israeli contingent of firefighters sent as reinforcements were operating.</p><p>In southern Greece, a 38-year-old civilian who had been helping fight a wildfire was hospitalized with an eye injury, officials said.</p><p>Massive fires have also raged for more than 10 days in neighboring Turkey, where firefighters were still trying to extinguish blazes in five locations in the coastal province of Mugla, in the country's southwest.</p><p>\"The situation is improving,\" Agriculture and Forestry Minister Bekir Pakdemirli said late on Sunday. \"It is too soon to say the fires are under control, but we are reaching that point.\"</p><p>Wildfires were also burning in southern Italy and in Montenegro in the Balkans, where a large fire in the Malo Brdo district of the capital Podgorica came close to houses.</p><p>On Evia overnight, residents and firefighters managed to save most of the village of Pefki, on the island's northern tip, where fast-moving flames entered the outskirts Saturday evening and destroyed at least one home.</p><p>A ferry that had been sent to Pefki to potentially evacuate people by sea turned into a temporary shelter for those residents of that and other nearby villages who didn't have the means to flee toward north Evia's main harbor of Aidipsos, or who wanted to remain near their homes so they could return and check on them whenever it was safe to do so.</p><p>Monday morning found dozens of local residents, many with their pets, sleeping on chairs on the ferry, or on the lounge chairs of Pefki's pebble beach. Most of the surrounding villages had been left without power and running water due to the fire.</p><p>\u2014Elena Becatoros, The Associated Press</p><p>RELATED: Wildfires rampage in Greek forests, cut large island in half</p><p>Copyright 2021 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20210809PAB4196686</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63B9-VFH1-F0HF-820C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1042\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Group Ltd.

All of these documents are available on SEDAR+ at <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/gOwZnTxQw8\">www.sedarplus.ca</url> .</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trican's results for the quarter compared to the prior year period were marginally lower based on decreased operating activity resulting from lower natural gas prices.</p><p>Revenue was $271.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an 8% decrease compared to $297.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDAS 1 and adjusted EBITDA 1 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $74.4 million and $72.8 million, compared to $82.9 million and $81.6 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.</p><p>Free cash flow 1 and free cash flow per share 1 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $49.9 million, $0.24 per share basic and diluted compared to $54.9 million, $0.24 per share basic and diluted for the three months ended March 31, 2023.</p><p>Profit and profit per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $41.2 million, $0.20 per share basic and $0.19 per share diluted compared to $46.0 million, $0.20 per share basic and diluted for the three months ended March 31, 2023.</p><p>The Company's balance sheet remains strong with positive working capital, including cash, of $174.5 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $153.2 million at December 31, 2023, providing significant financial flexibility. As at March 31, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $9.3 million (December 31, 2023 - $88.8 million). The decrease in cash is a result of working capital requirements, tax installments of $39.7 million and return on capital initiatives of $25.9 million. As at March 31, 2024, the Company had no loans and borrowings (December 31, 2023 - nil).</p><p>Trican operates the newest, most technologically advanced fleet of fracturing equipment in Canada. We developed our fleet by upgrading existing equipment with CAT Tier 4 Dynamic Gas Blending (\"DGB\") engine technology and building new fully electric ancillary equipment. The combination of Tier 4 DGB engines and fully electric ancillary equipment can displace up to 90% of the diesel used in a conventional fracturing operation with cleaner burning and less expensive natural gas resulting in lower overall fuel cost and reduced carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions. Our fracturing fleet upgrades also include industry leading continuous heavy duty pumps (3,000 HHP) and idle reduction technology packages which enable longer pumping times and improved operating efficiencies.</p><p>During the first quarter of 2024, Trican's fifth Tier 4 DGB fleet (42,000 HHP) and second group of electrical ancillary equipment was deployed into the field bringing Trican's total Tier 4 DGB fleet to 210,000 HHP.</p><p>Tier 4 upgrades and electric ancillary equipment are key components of Trican's Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") strategy. Our ongoing ESG initiatives, including fleet upgrades, are intended to reduce our environmental impact, improve efficiency and reduce our emissions profile thereby improving the sustainability of our operations and supporting our customers in achieving their ESG goals.</p><p>RETURN OF CAPITAL</p><p>The Company continues to be active in its Normal Course Issuer Bid (\"NCIB\") program as a key component of its return of capital strategy:</p><p>During the three months ended March 31, 2024, Trican purchased and cancelled 4,045,700 common shares at a weighted average price of $4.11 per share, or approximately 2% of the Company's outstanding shares at December 31, 2023. Subsequent to March 31, 2024 the Company purchased an additional 1,597,900 common shares, bringing total purchases under the 2023-2024 NCIB program to 8,536,529 common shares.</p><p>On October 2, 2023, the Company announced the renewal of its NCIB program, commencing October 5, 2023, to purchase up to 21,004,897 common shares for cancellation before October 4, 2024, subject to the TSX NCIB rules.</p><p>Since the initiation of our NCIB programs in 2017, Trican has purchased 151,514,582 common shares, equating to approximately 44% of total shares outstanding at the start of the NCIB programs. All common shares purchased under the NCIB are returned to treasury for cancellation.</p><p>The Company continues to execute on its return of capital framework through the quarterly dividend program:</p><p>During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company paid a cash dividend of $0.045 per share, or approximately $9.3 million in aggregate to shareholders.</p><p>On May 13, 2024, the Company's board of directors approved a dividend of $0.045 per share reflecting an increase of 12.5% from the prior year quarterly dividend payments of $0.04 per share. The distribution is scheduled to be made on June 28, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 14, 2024.</p><p>The dividends are designated as eligible dividends for Canadian income tax purposes.</p><p>FINANCIAL REVIEW</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS</p><p>Capital Expenditures</p><p>Capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2024 totaled $15.3 million ($19.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023) related primarily to maintenance capital and additional electric ancillary equipment. The Company's capital budget for 2024 remains at approximately $90 million, including $15 million carry forward from the 2023 capital program, to be funded with available cash resources, free cash flow 1 and our operating line.</p><p>Financial Position</p><p>We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet with significant positive working capital including cash. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow 1 and financial flexibility will allow us to execute our strategic plans including ongoing investment in our industry leading fleet, continued strong participation in our NCIB program and the payment of a quarterly dividend as a part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy which includes a consistent return of capital to our shareholders.</p><p>OUTLOOK</p><p>Our overall outlook for the next few years remains very positive as Canadian market fundamentals remain attractive for fracturing, cementing and coiled tubing.</p><p>The Montney reservoir in Northeastern British Columbia and Northwest Alberta remains one of the premier resource plays in North America. We expect that the combination of attractive well economics, increasing demand from LNG export facilities and British Columbia's agreements with First Nations should lead to ongoing and growing activity in the play. Montney development requires large, high-pressure fracturing, technically challenging cementing and coiled tubing services with large volumes of product which will directly benefit Trican.</p><p>Additional Canadian export capacity is now a reality with the Trans Mountain Pipeline entering into commercial service, completion of the Coastal GasLink Pipeline and the LNG Canada project anticipated to start exports in late 2024 or early 2025. We are also encouraged by the progress being made for additional LNG export facilities on the west coast of Canada. This new export capacity for both oil and natural gas creates an increasingly positive backdrop for oil and natural gas drilling and completions activity in Western Canada and the associated oilfield services required as we move through 2024 and beyond. We expect overall annual oilfield activity in Canada to remain relatively stable allowing us to continue generating sector leading returns for our shareholders.</p><p>Q1 activity proved to be quite resilient in spite of a continued low natural gas price environment, and a period of extremely cold weather delaying the start of operations in January. We expect that Q2 2024 will be stronger than originally anticipated as some work scheduled for the first quarter was deferred into the second quarter. Additionally, certain customers are looking to accelerate portions of their previously scheduled H2 2024 work into the second quarter to mitigate potential summer water constraints given the continuing drought conditions in Western Canada. Trican continues to work closely with these customers on various solutions including alternative water storage options and utilization of produced water via chemical treatment solutions. As we move through the summer, Trican will continue to monitor potential access issues related to forest fire activity which could delay activity in our operating areas. We will work closely with our customers to minimize business interruptions.</p><p>Trican continues to build on the investments made in our equipment fleet over the last three years to ensure that we are on the forefront of pressure pumping technology and design in Canada. Demand for our Canadian market-leading low emissions Tier 4 DGB fracturing fleets continues to be robust and is expected to remain strong through the remainder of 2024. Our fifth fleet of Tier 4 DGB high pressure fracturing equipment containing continuous duty pumps was deployed in the field in early 2024 bringing Trican's total Tier 4 fleet to an industry leading 210,000 HHP.</p><p>We continue to invest and enhance our equipment offering by moving forward with the electrification of certain ancillary equipment required for on-site fracturing operations including the data van, blending, sand handling and other equipment used for fracturing. We believe these ongoing technological advancements will augment our differentiation strategy and add value for our customers by increasing reliability further reducing emissions and reducing fuel costs. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow 1 and our financial flexibility allows for continued investment in our fleet and electrification program. We will continue to serve our customers with state-of-the-art equipment and generate industry-leading returns in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.</p><p>Trican remains focused on returning capital to our shareholders both through our quarterly dividend program and through our ongoing NCIB program. Trican increased its quarterly dividend per share by 12.5% effective for Q1 2024. We have made significant progress on our NCIB program to date and will look to fully utilize this program prior to its renewal. We believe our ability to deliver a multi-layered return of capital strategy while maintaining a strong balance sheet will lead to long-term value creation for our shareholders.</p><p>COMPARATIVE QUARTERLY INCOME STATEMENTS</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sales Mix - % of Total Revenue</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>NON-GAAP MEASURES</p><p>Certain terms in this News Release, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDAS, adjusted EBITDA percentage, adjusted EBITDAS percentage, free cash flow and bank EBITDA, do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS and therefore, are considered non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAS</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a non-GAAP financial measure and has been reconciled to profit / (loss) for the applicable financial periods, being the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. Management utilizes adjusted EBITDA to translate historical variability in the Company's principal business activities into future financial expectations. By isolating incremental items from net income, including income / expense items related to how the Company chooses to manage financing elements of the business, taxation strategy and non-cash charges, management can better predict future financial results from our principal business activities.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDAS (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation) is a non-GAAP financial measure and has been reconciled to profit / (loss) for the applicable financial periods, being the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. Management utilizes adjusted EBITDAS as a useful measure of operating performance, cash flow to complement profit / (loss) and to provide meaningful comparisons of operating results.</p><p>The items included in this calculation of adjusted EBITDA have been specifically identified as they are non-cash in nature, subject to significant volatility between periods, and / or not relevant to our principal business activities. Items adjusted in the non-GAAP calculation of adjusted EBITDA, are as follows:</p><p>Non-cash expenditures, including depreciation, amortization, impairment of non-financial assets, and equity-settled share-based compensation;</p><p>Consideration as to how the Company chose to generate financial income and incur financial expenses, including foreign exchange expenses and finance costs;</p><p>Taxation in various jurisdictions; and</p><p>Other income / expense which generally results from the disposition of equipment, as these transactions generally do not reflect quarterly operational field activity.</p><p>The item adjusted in the non-GAAP calculation of adjusted EBITDAS from adjusted EBITDA, is as follows:</p><p>Cash-settled share-based compensation.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA % and Adjusted EBITDAS %</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA percentage and adjusted EBITDAS percentage are non-GAAP financial ratios that are determined by dividing adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAS, respectively, by revenue. The components of the calculations are presented below:</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow per Share</p><p>Free cash flow and free cash flow per share are non-GAAP financial measures which Management believes to be key measures of capital management as they demonstrate the Company's ability to generate monies available to fund future growth through capital investments and return capital to our shareholders.</p><p>Free cash flow has been reconciled to cash flow from operations for the applicable financial periods, being the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Management adjusts for other (income) / loss, realized (gain) / loss, current income tax, income taxes paid, maintenance capital expenditures included within purchase of property and equipment from the statement of cash flows, net changes in other liabilities and change in non-cash operating working capital.</p><p>Management reconciles free cash flow from adjusted EBITDA for the applicable financial periods by adjusting for interest paid, current income tax expense, and maintenance capital expenditures included within purchase of property and equipment from the statement of cash flows as they are considered non-discretionary.</p><p>In 2023, the Company moved into a cash taxable position due to improved operating results and utilization of its available non-capital loss pools. The Company previously elected to defer its 2023 current income tax installments which was remitted in combination with the 2024 current income tax installments in the period. The Company elected to present current income tax expense as a reduction of free cash flow in the respective period to clearly adjust for the effects of timing and show the impact of such non-discretionary items.</p><p>Free cash flow per share is calculated by dividing free cash flow by the Company's basic or diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.</p><p>Free cash flow and free cash flow per share are not standardized measures and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other entities.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>OTHER NON-STANDARD FINANCIAL TERMS</p><p>In addition to the above non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, this News Release makes reference to the following non-standard financial terms. These terms may differ and may not be comparable to similar terms used by other companies.</p><p>Revenue Per Job</p><p>Calculation is determined based on total revenue divided by total job count. This calculation is significantly impacted by factors such as the relative revenue contribution by service line, changes in pricing and the magnitude of customer supplied consumables and inputs.</p><p>Maintenance and Growth Capital</p><p>Term that refers to capital additions as maintenance or growth capital. Maintenance capital are expenditures in respect of capital additions, replacements or improvements required to maintain ongoing business operations. Growth capital refers to expenditures primarily for new items and/or equipment that will expand our revenue and/or reduce our expenditures through operating efficiencies. The determination of what constitutes maintenance capital expenditures versus growth capital involves judgement by management.</p><p>FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</p><p>Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking information and statements (collectively \"forward-looking statements\").

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Friday, March. 8, 18 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> TICKETS<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.<br/><br/> As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.<br/><br/> PAST LOCATIONS<br/><br/>

Nobody is talking about the Canada Carbon Rebate that puts more money in the pockets of 8 out of 10 families across the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: So what are you going to say to Mr. Furey, though, specifically? Do you think he's a short-term thinker.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TRUDEAU: I think Mr. Furey is continuing to bow to political pressure.</p><p>LE COUTEUR: Well, that was Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today in Montreal pushing back on premiers who have called the federal government, called on the federal government to pause a planned increase to the carbon tax for April 1st. Now, in a statement, Minister, Premier Furey responded saying he believes in the importance of mitigating climate change but says a tax isn't the right instrument to do so. So is the prime minister right about Premier Furey? Or will he have to back down before April 1st? Let's bring in the Front Bench. Sabrina Grover was a federal Liberal candidate in the 2021 election. She's now principal at Shakti Strategies. Melanie Paradis is a former communications director to Erin O'Toole. She's now the president of Texture Communications. Former Ontario NDP MPP Gurratan Singh, he's now Vice President of Crestview Strategies. He's also the brother of federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh. And joining me in studio is CTV News' senior digital parliamentarian, parliamentary reporter...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LE COUTEUR: Rachel Aiello. Happy Friday, all. I almost got through that without one mistake. But hey, it's Friday. Sabrina, let's start with you. The Prime Minister didn't really mince words today when he was asked what he thought of Premier Furey. Is this going to cause a real rift between the two Liberal leaders?</p><p>SABRINA GROVER (Shakti Strategies): I think at the end of the day, the prime minister is looking out for himself and for Canadians, and I think that the message that he's presenting is the message that we need to be hearing on the carbon tax and on climate change, right? It's, the Conservatives have really weaponized this narrative on the carbon tax. They've tied it to inflation. They're saying it's an affordability issue, and I think that that has like played really well in the provinces and that's what they're, what they're tying their horses to. But at the end of the day, it's been proven time and time again that carbon tax hasn't been a major contributor to inflation. It hasn't been a major contributor to the affordability tax, and I think the prime minister is right to say that when you think about all of the impacts of climate change, all I see is money going up in flames or, you know, in a flood. Like the price that we have to pay to mitigate climate change is important, and I think that that's where the prime minister's taking his cues from, and that's the ones he's providing to Canadians.</p><p>LE COUTEUR: Melanie, it's interesting because even in the last election, your former boss, Erin O'Toole had a price on carbon in his platform. So we know there is an affordability crisis right now, but how did the Conservatives abandon that idea seemingly in droves?</p><p>MELANIE PARADIS (Texture Communications): Well, the reality is the affordability crisis is, is immense and the Liberals acknowledged this just last fall when they put an exemption for the carbon tax in Atlantic Canada on home heating. They recognized then that they couldn't increase the cost of home heating going into the winter for the Atlantic provinces. They didn't grant that exemption to anybody else even though homes across the rest of the country are also heated on, on natural gas in many places. And so they know that they, that they couldn't afford to increase it then, politically. They couldn't take the political heat for it in order to help people keep getting their homes. And they really shouldn't this time either, but they, they're, they're really latching on to it. I think, I think in turn because they took so much heat in the fall for pausing the carbon tax increase in Atlantic Canada and for that acknowledgement that this is impacting affordability. That's really at the crux of what the Liberals are trying to argue is that this isn't about affordability. This is about the environment. But ultimately this is what Canadians are feeling in their pocketbooks, and they're, and they're really worried about how this is going to keep increasing the cost of food and everything that we do in this country.</p><p>LE COUTEUR: Now Gurratan, in November the NDP backed the Conservatives on a motion to pause the carbon tax on home heating fuels. So does Trudeau have any kind of political cover to walk this back, even just a little?</p><p>GURRATAN SINGH (Crestview Strategy): So let's, let's kind of lay it out, lay it all out there right now. We know that the climate crisis is real. We are seeing right now, already, the forest fire season is starting in Alberta, up north. In areas that we've never seen these kinds of forest fires occur, they're happening already, and we know that there's a devastating economic impact to this climate crisis. So we do need a price on pollution. What we have here, though, is once again the Liberals failing to either communicate and to properly put out a policy that doesn't have these exemptions that pokes these huge holes in the armor, like what they did in eastern Canada. So this is once again, I would say, it's a failure of the Liberals and it's also the Conservatives really trying to capitalize off of something that is, has the fate of all humanity within it. The Conservatives have no plan on pollution. They have no plan to fight the climate crisis. So you have these two voices, one that is discrediting climate crisis, discrediting a price on pollution, and then we have the Liberals who are mismanaging the process that has a price on pollution in it right now, currently. So it's an important factor. We need action on it but the Liberals are just, once again, they're mismanaging something that is vitally important to all of our survival.</p><p>LE COUTEUR: Yeah, and Rachel, MPs are back on the hill. The house is back next week. So how do you think this plays out when they reconvene?</p><p>RACHEL AIELLO (CTV News): So we've already heard from the Conservatives that they're going to be making this an issue. There's two opposition days next week. The Conservatives are going to be dominating the agenda, forcing the NDP and the Bloc to vote on motions. One specifically is going to reference the 70 percent of premiers who want the April 1st hike axed. And so it'll be interesting to watch if the other parties line up behind the Conservatives on that. The Conservatives are now threatening, depending on the outcome of that vote on Wednesday, what would happen Thursday, Friday? Could we see more votes? One extremely nerdy procedural point - the government has recently moved to change the rules, so we wouldn't see another marathon overnight filibuster.</p><p>LE COUTEUR: Right.</p><p>AIELLO: They have these health breaks now so you wouldn't see them in burning that midnight oil. But certainly they're coming back invigorated by more and more premiers getting onside with the Conservatives on wanting that April 1st hike gone. So I think it's definitely going to be a dominating issue next week.</p><p>LE COUTEUR: Yeah, Sabrina one of the things that I thought was interesting is how the Prime Minister said that if they pause the price on carbon, it will mean less money in the pockets of Canadians. Now, it's math that most people can't really get their heads around. So have they been doing a bad job of actually explaining this kind of math to Canadians, because I don't think a lot of people understand the economics of it, that I'll pay into this but I'll actually get more out of it, and it's better for the environment.</p><p>GROVER: I think that there's certainly some better communications that could be around how the carbon tax does actually benefit Canadians, not only in the short-term when we talk about the rebate but also in the long-term when we talk about the actual mitigation of the effects of climate change and the long-term prices you're going to pay. You know, there's a video on TikTok right now, some might say Tic-Tac-Toe, but I think like that's the best PR that the Liberals have on this right now is somebody explaining to people exactly what the price breakdown is, right? And I think the idea that this the carbon pricing is overwhelmingly causing the affordability crises in your life needs to be debunked. And if it is so big, and like all of these things are causing, you know, these massive affordability crises in people's lives, then you look at Alberta and you look at, you know, Pierre Poilievre's co-conspirator, Danielle Smith, why is she also increasing the fuel tax? Like why are these things happening at the provincial level, while at the same time Conservators are trying to say, well it shouldn't be happening at the at the, at the federal level. So I think there's a lot of different moving pieces here in terms of like debunking the myths to Canadians about what exactly is costing them, this affordability crisis, which I think is incumbent on the Liberals to maybe show that in the budget.</p><p>LE COUTEUR: I've got about 90 seconds left. I'm going to try and get the other three in on this. Melanie, what about that communications strategy? Does it need to be better?</p><p>PARADIS: The math isn't mathing, as they say. Like the communications are really difficult on this because Canadians are feeling it in their pocketbooks. I encourage Canadians who, especially those who have natural gas for home heating like I do, take a look at your energy bill for the past month, or whichever one you've got handy, and you'll notice that you're also being charged GST or HST, depending on your province, on top of the carbon tax. So the government is double dipping on the carbon tax and you're paying twice for it. So the Canadians know like this just isn't adding up and it's not doing anything to fix the climate.</p><p>LE COUTEUR: Do we need a flowchart or something, Gurratan, or you know, something simple that everybody can digest so we can understand how it works?</p><p>SINGH: Well keep in mind that the way that this legislation came out was that the federal government gave provinces the option to create their own price on pollution. And provinces, many of them, like in Ontario, refused to and then they had one imposed upon them. Let's look at Manitoba right now with Premier Wab Kinew recognizing there's a climate crisis, recognizing there should be a price on pollution but wanting to have a system that is more specific to Manitoba. So this is the issue. A lot of these Conservative premiers are complaining because they didn't actually act to put in the best policy for their province when given the option.</p><p>LE COUTEUR: Rachel last word to you. Who's to blame for the communication snafu here?</p><p>AIELLO: Oh, that is a great question. I feel like there's a bit of a logic mix, miss here. You know, we're talking about the prime minister saying today, everyone's talking about the tax. No one's talking about the rebate. Well, I think the logic a lot of Canadians are considering is, well, if you didn't tax me in the first place, you wouldn't need to rebate me.</p><p>LE COUTEUR: Yeah.</p><p>AIELLO: Why don't you just like call it square, put that money into something else.</p><p>LE COUTEUR: We'll call it even, right? Yeah.</p><p>AIELLO: Right? So I think that's a bit curious about it because I'm sure Canadians are doing that amount of calculation themselves. So I think there is probably some finessing there in terms of like, don't worry, we're going to give you back the money we took, maybe a bit more. It's all good. Maybe just don't take it in the first place. I think a lot of Canadians are probably asking that question.</p><p>LE COUTEUR: Yeah. And I think a lot of Canadians are wondering why we're doing math on this show. Well, we have to sometimes. For that, we'll take a break for just a second. Everybody can put down the calculators because when we come back we're going to tackle the ongoing controversy around the ArriveCan app. The company at the heart of the story was back before a parliamentary committee this week and what's the political fallout of it, and what should be done to fix the procurement process? We'll dig into that, right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BX6-3YS1-JCF0-K01T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2063\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CTV Televisions, Inc.

Finding Joy consists of 36 acrylic paintings, bursting with colour and serenity \u2014 all being cohesive with a unified theme.</p><p>Finding Joy is about taking a closer look at local wildflowers, that can be found by roadsides or other various places, and glorifying those \u201cugly, unwanted\u201d flowers and finding the beauty and joy in them. It is about persevering through hardship and blooming into something beautiful.</p><p>Amanda Hartman takes this theme quite literally and uses old painting palettes as canvases, turning something seen as unwanted into something to be appreciated. Most of the flowers in the pieces contain some form of symbolism all linking to the meaning of the show. Lupins mean admiration and happiness. Fireweed symbolizes rejuvenation, being the first plant to grow back after a forest fire, and many more examples as such. This show is a delicate dance between the realism of the wildflowers and the whimsy and beauty found within them.</p><p>The artist behind Finding Joy, Amanda Hartman, studied art at the Victoria College of Art and De-sign, Northwest Community College, Dordt College, and a variety of other courses throughout Canada.</p><p>Amanda Hartman has been painting professionally for over 20 years, starting out with watercolours, but has since moved to acrylic and mixed media in more recent years, as is shown in Finding Joy, which is blooming with bright nature-inspired acrylic paintings.</p><p>Most of Amanada Hartman\u2019s artwork is inspired by the nature of Terrace.</p><p>When not painting (or working), she can be finding inspiration for her art in her other activities; hiking, mountain biking, stand up paddleboarding, snowboarding and sailing. Hartman\u2019s life is filled with adventure and the love of the outdoors, which is a present theme in most of her work.</p><p>Finding Joy travels to the Quesnel Art Gallery in June, but it will be featured at the Terrace Art Gallery until the end of April. The Terrace Art Gallery is open from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays. It\u2019s located at 4610 Park Ave., Terrace, BC V8G 1V6.</p><p>(Thayna Healey is a 16-year-old student at Caledonia Secondary School and a long-standing member of the Terrace Art Gallery.)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TERSTN-news20230427PSWA0003530911</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TERSTN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:683T-MWF1-JD2C-J1D0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438220</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Friday, March. 8, 18 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> TICKETS<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.<br/><br/> As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.<br/><br/> PAST LOCATIONS<br/><br/>

Flooding triggered by severe rainstorms also hit neighboring Bulgaria and Turkey, with rescue teams in Turkey on Thursday recovering the body of a 53-year-old man who had been missing since floods gushed through a campsite near the border with Bulgaria, sweeping away bungalows. The recovery brought the death toll in Turkey to eight, and to a total of 18 in all three countries since the rains began Tuesday. In Greece, authorities deployed divers and swift water rescue specialists as residents in some villages took refuge on the roofs of their homes to escape floodwaters that rose to more than 2 meters (6 feet). Around 60 people were airlifted to safety, the fire department said, including some who told local media they had spent the night and most of Thursday on roofs without food or water. </p><p>The helicopters, which were continuing with rescue operations in the wider Karditsa area, had been unable to fly earlier due to frequent lightning, authorities said. At least three villages in central Greece were completely cut off by floodwaters, with residents dialing in to radio stations to report homes collapsing and to appeal for rescue. The body of one man missing for a day was recovered from a stream on Thursday, and hours later the fire service said it discovered the bodies of two women in the Karditsa area. The three deaths brought the country\u2019s overall toll from the floods to six since Tuesday. Vassilis Kikilias, Greece\u2019s minister for climate crisis and civil protection, said more than 885 people had been rescued so far and six were reported missing. The military said it had deployed more than 25 boats to rescue people trapped by floodwaters, while seven helicopters and a military transport plane were on standby. \u201cOur country finds itself, for the third day, dealing with a phenomenon the likes of which we have not seen in the past,\u201d Greek government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said, noting that some areas received more than twice the average annual rainfall of Athens in the space of 12 hours. \u201cThe state\u2019s absolute priority at the moment is the rescue \u2026 of people from the areas hit by the bad weather and the protection of critical infrastructure,\u201d Marinakis said. Fire department spokesperson Vasilis Vathrakogiannis said swift water rescue specialists and divers from the department\u2019s disaster response units, as well as the army, were participating in rescue efforts and trying to reach remote areas despite roads having been washed away. The flooding followed on the heels of devastating wildfires that destroyed vast tracts of forest and farmland, burned homes and left more than 20 people dead. While much of central Greece was inundated, the fire department said a new forest fire had broken out Thursday afternoon in the northeastern region of Evros. It was in an area where just last week the largest wildfire recorded in the European Union burned through a nature reserve. It said 36 firefighters backed by two helicopters and four planes were battling the blaze in the Soufli area of Evros. In central Greece, tracked vehicles and boats were being used to help evacuate people from the floods, but the boats were unable to reach some areas due to the large volume of debris and the strength of the torrents of floodwaters, authorities said. Defense Minister Nikos Dendias announced he was cutting short a trip to Dubai to return to Greece so he could \u201coversee the greatest contribution of the Armed Forces in dealing with the consequences of the severe weather.\u201d Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis postponed his annual state of the economy speech and a news conference scheduled for the weekend in the northern city of Thessaloniki in order to visit the flooded areas. Police have banned traffic from three regions, including on the island of Skiathos, and have sent numerous emergency phone alerts to people in several parts of the country to avoid venturing outdoors and to move away from basement and ground floor areas of buildings. The storm, dubbed Daniel, was forecast to begin easing gradually Thursday evening. On Wednesday, repeated rainstorms also hit the Greek capital, flooding streets and turning part of a major avenue in central Athens into a river of mud that swept people off their feet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20230908PTEA0003857907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:694K-N3N1-JD2C-J1S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"751\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Trudeau told reporters in Saguenay, Que., that Canada will count on other countries to send help, just as other countries depend on Canadian firefighters.</p><p>\u201cIn terms of international firefighters, it\u2019s something that we count on during our fire seasons, but the same way our international friends and partners count on Canadian firefighters during their fire seasons,\u201d he told reporters after meeting with Armed Forces members at Canadian Forces Base Bagotville.</p><p>\u201cFrom Northern Hemisphere to Southern Hemisphere, from one region of the world to another, the fire seasons aren\u2019t always aligned and that allows for a travelling of resources that is part of how we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re protecting communities all around the world.\u201d</p><p>Trudeau said extreme weather events are expected to become more frequent in the coming years due to climate change. When asked if Canada needs to augment its fleet of water bombers used to fight fires, he said it\u2019s clear the country will need to increase resources at many levels.</p><p>\u201cThere will be more climate emergencies, there will be more major challenges and so we will have to prepare,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yes, we are talking about planes, but we are also talking about more training for the population, for firefighters, for the military.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, more firefighters from abroad arrived on Wednesday to help battle Canada\u2019s worst wildfire season of the 21st century, as some parts of the country were left waiting for hoped-for rain to quell some of the most dangerous fires.</p><p>Quebec officials had said about 100 Portuguese and 140 Spanish firefighters were landing in Quebec City to join the contingents of French and American reinforcements that were already helping battle 130 forest fires raging across the province as of Wednesday morning.</p><p>About 5,000 firefighting personnel from multiple countries have been deployed across Canada to help battle the flames, and more are expected to arrive from Chile and Costa Rica in the coming days.</p><p>There were 459 fires across Canada on Wednesday morning, with 234 list-ed as out of control.</p><p>There was hope in Quebec that rainy weather this week would help douse the blazes, but officials said Wednesday morning not enough rain had fallen yet. The province\u2019s forest fire prevention agency \u2014 SOPFEU \u2014 said a wildfire continued to threaten the community of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, Que., located 620 kilometres northwest of Montreal, where roughly 2,000 people remained displaced.</p><p>Civil security official Jean Savard said 2,800 Quebecers remained under evacuation across the province, down from more than 13,500 late last week.</p><p>Rain was also in the forecast for a large portion of Western Canada, but officials said little water from recent storms reached a massive wildfire racing through woodlands south of Fort Nelson, B.C. , that threatens access to a key highway.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230615RDA0003653671</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68G5-VWK1-JD2C-J3W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

That was a question dominating my thoughts 20 years ago, during the wildfire season of 2003.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My first wife was quite sick that year. She had been diagnosed with cancer five years earlier and her health and strength had deteriorated since that time. By mid-August and into September, during the worst of the fire season in the Okanagan, she could no longer walk unassisted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I wondered how I could safely bring her down a flight of stairs and to the door if we had to leave on short notice. With a bit of time, it would have been possible, but if we had just minutes to leave the house, I would have needed assistance.</p><p>There was a real possibility of an evacuation that summer.</p><p>The 2003 wildfire season was one of the worst in British Columbia\u2019s recorded history. While the number of hectares burned was not nearly as great as in several subsequent years, fires that year burned close to populated areas, putting lives and homes at risk.</p><p>Evacuation centres were set up quickly in affected areas, but getting to the centre would have been difficult.</p><p>This was happening during a drought year. Conditions were dry and a spark, a cigarette butt or a hot vehicle exhaust pipe could ignite the tinder grasses.</p><p>On July 30, the McLure Forest Fire began, the result of a carelessly discarded cigarette butt. That fire was near Barriere, to the north of me, and while I watched the news reports, the danger close to me did not seem imminent.</p><p>Then, on Saturday, Aug. 16, everything changed when the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire started. We were out visiting relatives in Kelowna. This was the last time she was able to leave the house, and even for this trip, getting to and from the car took a lot of effort.</p><p>The fire was visible on our drive to Kelowna and the smell of smoke permeated the air. On the drive to Kelowna, I thought the fire would be contained and wildfire crews would soon have it under control. That did not happen. Despite the best efforts of wildfire crews, the blaze continued to spread and by evening, it lit up the sky across the lake from West Kelowna.</p><p>The fire reached a size of 25,600 hectares. More than 33,000 people were evacuated and 238 homes were lost or damaged as a result of the fire.</p><p>While fire crews were working to slow the spread of the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire, other smaller fires were also starting.</p><p>With each new wildfire report, I continued to think about how to do an evacuation.</p><p>The fire season of 2003 was unlike anything I had experienced in the past. The extremely dry conditions that year meant a small wildfire could quickly become unmanageable.</p><p>The worst of the wildfire season had passed by the end of September, and my first wife died a couple of weeks later, in October.</p><p>Today, life is different. I would have a much easier, much more manageable time coping with an evacuation order in my household today as compared with 20 years ago.</p><p>However, others in the province are experiencing what I was dealing with two decades ago. This year, British Columbia is in its most destructive wildfire season on record. Evacuation orders and alerts have been issued for many parts of the province. There are families and couples where one or more people have limited mobility or are coping with significant health issues. People are considering their evacuation plans now, just as I was doing then.</p><p>The wildfire season of 2003 is in the past now. I am not coping with the conditions I was facing two decades ago.</p><p>As wildfires burn, especially in areas close to where I live, the memories of that terrible summer still linger.</p><p>John Arendt is the editor of the Summerland Review.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CALCOU-news20230817PPOA0003802665</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CALCOU2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YP-BW81-F0HF-82CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

flights, as convoys snaked south to safety on the only open highway.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The order late Wednesday to evacuate Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories marked the latest chapter of a terrible summer for wildfires in Canada, with tens of thousands of people forced to leave their homes and vast swathes of land scorched.</p><p>Tiffany Champagne was one of many awaiting flights at the airport in Yellowknife.</p><p>\"I have asthma and the wildfire smoke was making it increasingly difficult to do anything,\" Champagne, wearing a face mask, told the CBC. \"I'm just kind of mentally checked out at this point.\"</p><p>As of early Thursday, more than 1,000 wildfires were burning, including about 230 in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>More than 20,000 residents of Yellowknife, the regional capital, have been given until noon Friday to leave by road or on commercial and military flights.</p><p>\"We're all tired of the word unprecedented, yet there is no other way to describe this situation in the Northwest Territories,\" regional premier Caroline Cochrane said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty warned drivers that the flames were skirting the edges of highways and they would encounter limited visibility as thick smoke turned the sky orange.</p><p>Flights to nearby Alberta province were scheduled to depart Yellowknife starting at 1:00 pm (1900 GMT) Thursday.</p><p>\"Kilometers of vehicles started leaving yesterday, and there were folks flying out yesterday and today,\" she told public broadcaster CBC.</p><p>A wildfire was within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of Yellowknife on Thursday.</p><p>Yellowknife declared an emergency earlier this week, and that was soon expanded across the huge northern territory as firefighters were forced to pull back in some areas.</p><p>Strong winds stoked the flames, and several towns and Indigenous communities were already under evacuation orders.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, our wildfire situation has taken another turn for the worse with a fire burning west of Yellowknife now representing a real threat to the city,\" NW Territories environment minister Shane Thompson told reporters late Wednesday.</p><p>\"Without rain, it is possible (the fire) will reach the city outskirts by the weekend.\"</p><p>\u2013 Drive out 'slow going' \u2013</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would \"assist however we can.\"</p><p>Several military aircraft were dispatched along with more than 120 soldiers to help beat back the flames.</p><p>In what had already been declared the Northwest Territories' largest-ever evacuation, the emptying of Yellowknife now means half the population of the near-Arctic territory will soon be displaced.</p><p>On Monday, the Canadian military started airlifting residents of smaller communities in the region to safety after roads were engulfed in flames.</p><p>For many, it was the second time in recent months that residents were forced to leave their homes.</p><p>Separated by several hundreds of kilometers, most of the villages in the territory are difficult to evacuate by land, officials said.</p><p>Images shared on social media and on Canadian television showed large swaths of blackened forests.</p><p>On those cars and trucks that made it out before roads became impassable, headlights were melted and paint peeled off the vehicles.</p><p>On social media, Maggie Noble said the escape from Yellowknife was \"slow going\" in the darkness, taking her sister five hours to drive just 100 kilometers.</p><p>According to wildfire official Mike Westwick, the situation \"continues to be critical, with thick smoke hampering efforts to bring the blazes under control.</p><p>The evacuation of Yellowknife is the second time a Canadian city has been cleared due to wildfires since 100,000 residents of Fort McMurray in Alberta's oil and gas producing heartland were forced out in 2016.</p><p>More than 2,000 homes and businesses were destroyed in that blaze.</p><p>Earlier this year, suburbs of Halifax on the Atlantic coast were evacuated.</p><p>Fires this season have spread across Canada with remarkable intensity, scorching 13.5 million hectares (33.4 million acres), according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Four people have died so far.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXDJ-DIJO100903169228387644025876100036</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">100903</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YN-0WF1-F03R-N073-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"715\"/><timeReceived>2:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 17, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Global</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fire</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy issued an air quality alert for the entire state. Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources also issued an air quality advisory for the state.<br/><br/> In Chicago, officials urged young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors. <br/><br/> \"Just driving into the zoo ... you could just see around the buildings, kind of just haze,\" said Shelly Woinowski, who was visiting the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.<br/><br/> Some daycare centres in the Chicago area have told parents that their children will remain indoors Tuesday due to the poor air quality, while one youth sports club says it adjusted its activities to add more time indoors.<br/><br/> \"As these unsafe conditions continue, the city will continue to provide updates and take swift action to ensure that vulnerable individuals have the resources they need to protect themselves and their families,\" Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a release.<br/><br/> In the Milwaukee area, Flight for Life Wisconsin was unable to respond to a motorcycle-van crash because the Federal Aviation Administration requires 3.2 kilometres visibility, and the visibility was reduced to 1.2 to 2.4 kilometres because of the hazy skies, executive director Leif Erickson said.<br/><br/> Fires in northern Quebec and low pressure over the eastern Great Lakes are sending smoke through northern Michigan, and across southern Wisconsin and Chicago, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.<br/><br/> Jackson added that a north wind would push the smoke further south, moving into Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky later Tuesday and overnight.<br/><br/> The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported Monday that 76,129 square kilometres of land including forests has burned across Canada since Jan. 1. That exceeds the previous record set in 1989 of 75,596 square kilometres, according to the National Forestry Database.<br/><br/> Nationally, there are currently 490 fires burning, with 255 of them considered to be out of control.<br/><br/> Even recent rainfall in Quebec likely won't be enough to extinguish the wildfires ravaging the northern part of that province, but the wet weather could give firefighters a chance to get ahead of the flames, officials said Tuesday.<br/><br/> Nearly a quarter of the fires burning in Canada are in Quebec. Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said he expects rain to stop falling by Wednesday morning in the regions most affected by forest fires. <br/><br/> Earlier this month, massive fires burning stretches of Canadian forests blanketed the northeastern United States and the Great Lakes region, turning the air yellowish grey, and prompting warnings for people to stay inside and keep windows closed.<br/><br/> In early June, U.S. President Joe Biden said hundreds of American firefighters and support personnel have been in Canada since May.<br/><br/> The Associated Press <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023062868319302</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K0-0KK1-F197-51K9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"586\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

The issue hasn\u2019t generated a lot of controversy for some directors, while others like Area H\u2019s Walter Popoff said he was going to request up to six meetings for the public to discuss the action plan.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20230511PRAA0003567133</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:686T-6RJ1-JD2C-J40G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

The original equipment purchases had an approximate original value of $254,000 in 2021.</p><p>Wolf said if a 35 per cent depreciation of the equipment was factored in the remaining value would be around $165,000.</p><p>As well, the service contains a reserve of $112,000, which is unspent money from the original equipment loan.</p><p>\"Therefore, a dissolving of the service at this point has to assume a deficit of approximately $35,000, plus any administrative costs expended in 2023,\" said Wolf.</p><p>A report will be brought back the board on how to distribute the deficit once all final costs are known.</p><p>The next steps would be to tender the completion of the Fauquier project and initiate the sale of the equipment purchased for the pilot.</p><p>Without the internal utilities construction crew in place some of the projects in the capital plan have to be tendered and delivered through external forces, Wolf explained.</p><p>Keeping it together</p><p>Three people formed the first construction crew in the spring of 2021 \u2014 a permanent site superintendent, a seasonal equipment operator and one labourer.</p><p>The location for the pilot was chosen with the Fauquier water system, in an area where the regional district had difficulty obtaining bids from private industry.</p><p>Wolf said the first pilot year was \"plagued by several setbacks through external circumstances (COVID-19, record heat in July and August, nearby forest fire with evacuation of the community and shut down of the project, etc.).\"</p><p>The next construction season was greeted with the resignation of the site superintendent, followed by the utilities operations manager (managed the crew and the project).</p><p>\"Recruitment efforts over the late spring and early summer period of 2022 did not provide the intended results to be able to put a new construction crew together on short notice and to be effective for the 2022 construction season,\" wrote Wolf.</p><p>The department was re-structured for 2023 and the pilot was included with the senior project manager position.</p><p>\"Additional efforts were made to make the positions more attractive in order to increase chance of success in the hiring,\" said Wolf. \"In spite of these additional efforts and extended periods of advertising the RDCK was not able to attract sufficient interest from applicants to put together a full crew with the required industry skills to feel comfortable to continue that pilot project in 2023.\"</p><p>Copyright 2023 Nelson Star</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20230628PKO4486163</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K1-T7K1-JD2C-J30P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"577\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

She is a long-time resident of the West Kelowna Estates neighbourhood and offers her insights into the experience of being evacuated from her home as the McDougall Contributor Creek firestorm burned right up to her doorstep.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The skyline was a red glow with eruptions of brilliant yellow and orange licks of flame and our neighbourhood was lit with an eerie light.</p><p>We knew we wouldn\u2019t be spending the night in our own bed.</p><p>As we rushed around our home snatching a few paintings from the walls, and packing some food and vital papers into the RV, we mentally tried not to imagine losing all that we had gathered over many decades, in the wildfire that had pulsed to life on our doorstep.</p><p>Driving away from home, we continually had a clearer view of the forest fire that was engulfing the forest and everything in its path, as it was pummelled by gusty, strong winds that sent burning branches ahead willy-nilly.</p><p>As we crossed the bridge, flames appeared ahead of us as a new wildfire sparked in Kelowna.</p><p>We learned later this was started by embers crossing the lake from the McDougall Creek wildfire we were fleeing from.</p><p>In the dark, we made our way to our friends and parked our vehicles among the trees before heading down to the lakeshore with them to see the catastrophic spectacle spread before us.</p><p>Smoke was roiling into the sky and flames were leaping up Westside Road before the wind, sending sparks ahead and starting trees that ignited in a flash, candling like torches.</p><p>Then we realized some of those spot fires were in the shape of squares, and with a sinking feeling, we realized homes were being torched between the water and the road, all the way up the lake and around the bend that is downtown Kelowna.</p><p>It was the stuff nightmares are made of. It flowed fast, like a river, and it overtook everything in whatever path it chose to take, leaving a home here and a garden there \u2013 capriciously.</p><p>The next day, those winds shifted from north to south, and the homes that escaped the blaze on Thursday night, Aug. 17, and in the early hours of Friday morning, got the full force of a ferocious wildfire that bore down on them Friday afternoon.</p><p>That\u2019s when the West Kelowna Estates neighbourhood felt its fury.</p><p>Former West Kelowna fire chief Bill Bredin always warned me these heavily forested lands interspersed with flammable homes and cedar shake roofs were \u201can urban-interface fire waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>He was proven right that night. Although we are not yet sleeping in our own bed, we are home now, after 17 nights camping in Kelowna.</p><p>The RV continues to be an essential part of our lives, but thanks to the clearly herculean efforts of firefighters, our home is still standing, and eventually, we\u2019ll be able to move back in with all the \u2018treasures\u2019 we\u2019ve collected over the years.</p><p>The view from our big cracked windows is entirely different, with just chimneys instead of our neighbours\u2019 homes, and we hardly know how to greet them to acknowledge what they must be going through.</p><p>Personally, the loss of all our majestic evergreens is also heartbreaking and we know that treasure will never return in our lifetimes.</p><p>We hope the birds we\u2019ve so enjoyed watching flit from branch to branch amongst their swaying limbs, will find new homes nearby.</p><p>The deer seem bewildered that they\u2019re now able to enter the yard they\u2019ve been barred from grazing in, but they\u2019re finding nothing but a bit of water in the remaining cement birdbath.</p><p>However, other than doors and windows where the fire knocked and the firefighters refused to let it in, our home is safe.</p><p>Flame chewed on the patio chairs and the patio itself but firefighters stood firm there and did not let it eat the whole meal.</p><p>Mature landscaping, fences, sawhorses, birdhouses and wine barrels full of geraniums are in the ashes, while plastic pots, composters, hoses and irrigation have melted to nearly nothing.</p><p>Those firefighters saved our home.</p><p>They took a stand here and they told the flames with their streams of water and their sweat and possibly even their tears \u2013 that it was not taking this house.</p><p>Thank-you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KLOWNA-news20230907PQMA0003853430</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KLOWNA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6945-RKY1-F0HF-80JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"688\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

That was a question dominating my thoughts 20 years ago, during the wildfire season of 2003.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My first wife was quite sick that year. She had been diagnosed with cancer five years earlier and her health and strength had deteriorated since that time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By mid-August and into September, during the worst of the fire season in the Okanagan, she could no longer walk unassisted.</p><p>I wondered how I could safely bring her down a flight of stairs and to the door if we had to leave on short notice.</p><p>With a bit of time, it would have been possible, but if we had just minutes to leave the house, I would have needed assistance.</p><p>There was a real possibility of an evacuation that summer.</p><p>The 2003 wildfire season was one of the worst in British Columbia\u2019s recorded history.</p><p>While the number of hectares burned was not nearly as great as in several subsequent years, fires that year burned close to populated areas, putting lives and homes at risk.</p><p>Evacuation centres were set up quickly in affected areas, but getting to the centre would have been difficult.</p><p>This was happening during a drought year. Conditions were dry and a spark, a cigarette butt or a hot vehicle exhaust pipe could ignite the tinder grasses.</p><p>On July 30, the McLure Forest Fire began, the result of a carelessly discarded cigarette butt. That fire was near Barriere, to the north of me, and while I watched the news reports, the danger close to me did not seem imminent.</p><p>Then, on Saturday, Aug. 16, everything changed when the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire started. We were out visiting relatives in Kelowna. This was the last time she was able to leave the house, and even for this trip, getting to and from the car took a lot of effort.</p><p>The fire was visible on our drive to Kelowna and the smell of smoke permeated the air. On the drive to Kelowna, I thought the fire would be contained and wildfire crews would soon have it under control. That did not happen.</p><p>Despite the best efforts of wildfire crews, the blaze continued to spread and by evening, it lit up the sky across the lake from West Kelowna.</p><p>The fire reached a size of 25,600 hectares.</p><p>More than 33,000 people were evacuated and 238 homes were lost or damaged as a result of the fire. While fire crews were working to slow the spread of the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire, other smaller fires were also starting. With each new wildfire report, I continued to think about how to do an evacuation.</p><p>The fire season of 2003 was unlike anything I had experienced in the past. The extremely dry conditions that year meant a small wildfire could quickly become unmanageable.</p><p>The worst of the wildfire season had passed by the end of September, and my first wife died a couple of weeks later, in October.</p><p>Today, life is different. I would have a much easier, much more manageable time coping with an evacuation order in my household today as compared with 20 years ago.</p><p>However, others in the province are experiencing what I was dealing with two decades ago.</p><p>This year, British Columbia is in its most destructive wildfire season on record. Evacuation orders and alerts have been issued for many parts of the province. There are families and couples where one or more people have limited mobility or are coping with significant health issues. People are considering their evacuation plans now, just as I was doing then.</p><p>The wildfire season of 2003 is in the past now. I am not coping with the conditions I was facing two decades ago. As wildfires burn, especially in areas close to where I live, the memories of that terrible summer still linger.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KLOWNA-news20230817PQMA0003803323</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KLOWNA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YP-BW81-F0HF-82PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"594\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.
