Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational in April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Friday, Feb. 3 all 22 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> (NEW: JAN. 28, 2023) Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8<br/><br/> Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

They also carry five of their own craft brews consisting of a lager, pale ale, amber, stout, and an IPA.</p><p>\"We have something for every taste - if you like beer, we want to have a beer for you,\" added Dan. \"We have classic styles as well as some fun, more adventurous stuff.\"</p><p>While there were challenges to opening a business - especially a restaurant and brewery - during the pandemic, Sherry said it was actually quite enjoyable.</p><p>\"It takes your mind off everything else because you're concentrating on something fun that's going to be happening someday soon,\" she said.</p><p>Larry noted getting to connect with the community again has been one of the best parts.</p><p>\"I see a lot of people I haven't seen in a long time stop in and have a beer and some food,\" he shared. \"It's been nice to actually be here and see how all the hard work has come together.\"</p><p>As for the inspiration behind the name?</p><p>\"When we went to pick up our dog as a puppy, he was this little ball running around and bouncing just like a bear, so we named him Bear,\" said Larry. \"He's got a lot of extra skin, and one day he was just coming down the stairs looking at us, and we thought he looked like a big, wrinkly bear.\"</p><p>\"He also growls like a bear,\" added Sherry.</p><p>A full menu and information about event facilities can be found at wrinklybearbrewing.ca.</p><p>Sidebar:</p><p>WRINKLY BEAR BREWING COMPANY</p><p>Type of Business: Brewery, Restaurant</p><p>Services offered: Food and Drink</p><p>Address: 27 Main St N, Grand Valley, ON L0N 1G0</p><p>Hours: Monday, Closed</p><p>Tuesday - Thursday, 12 p.m. to 9 p.m.</p><p>Friday and Saturday, 12 p.m. to 10 p.m.</p><p>Sunday, 12 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p><p>Telephone: 519-928-2229</p><p>Website: wrinklybearbrewing.ca</p><p>Lead</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20211006TMOB2021100662444082</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63TB-2FS1-F197-51RY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

If the trees are confirmed to be &gt;150 years old, the forest is considered oldgrowth. Meeting old-growth criteria indicates the stand would qualify for an old-growth logging deferral\u2026.The understory is comprised predominantly of a deep moss layer with very little understory or mid-canopy shrubs or trees.</p><p>\u201cThe lack of understory, north aspect and presence of multiple ephemeral streams together indicate the site is at low risk of fire.\u201d</p><p>These two factors alone should be enough to halt any plans by Nacfor for logging in any capacity \u2013 even under the guise of fire risk prevention.</p><p>As well, during the Open House Zoom of May 26, 2021, with Nacfor, Hugh Watt reiterated there would be no plans to go ahead with logging if residents of the Crescent Bay and Box Mountain area were not in favour.</p><p>Many residents of the areas of Box Mountain have voiced they are indeed strongly not in favour.</p><p>Box Mountain is a watershed.Any logging would disturb the mature forest and cause compounding problems, compromising an already scarce water supply to more than 300 residents.</p><p>In the past, Box Mountain has been at risk of being logged.</p><p>It was saved 20 years ago by the efforts of concerned residents, including Jack Gould.</p><p>Protectors of Box Mountain are generally sceptical and mistrusting of any logging of the mature forest, given the clear-cutting and enormous destruction being done to other forests around Nakusp and throughout B.C. which were also slotted for \u201cfire risk prevention.\u201d</p><p>Ideally, Nacfor will honour their word and dismantle any plans in response to the residents not being in favour, coupled with the evidence put forth by Dr. Susanne Simard.</p><p>Nancy Gould, Nakusp</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARLNWS-news20210624HZQA0001962366</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARLNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:630H-7451-JD2C-J222-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438269</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"417\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

The first of 15 murals by 14 artists was completed in mid-June, and painting will continue through August to prepare for the Meet the Street arts and culture festival in early September to kickoff the month-long celebration of Alberta Culture Days in Red Deer.</p><p>On Wednesday, Montreal artist Caitlin McDonagh was in the process of painting a serene and lush green forest in 50.5 Alley, north of Ross Street.</p><p>She said it\u2019s ironic considering the forest fires in British Columbia.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s been an interesting process to be painting this forest while there is forest fire smoke in the air. I\u2019m just hoping it will be a colourful surprise for people when they\u2019re walking around, hopefully checking out the businesses now that things are starting to normalize,\u201d said Mc-Donagh who is originally from Victoria, B.C. \u201cMurals and public art really makes art accessible to everybody no matter who they are. To me it\u2019s really special. Not only are more people actually seeing my work, but it\u2019s making it something that\u2019s a shared experience for everybody.\u201d</p><p>Red Deer Indigenous artist Ryan Jason Allen Willert completed a mural in 49.5 Alley, south of Ross Street, depicting the magpie.</p><p>\u201cWith this mural, I found it really important to incorporate the magpie because the magpie is really significant for our people. It\u2019s an animal of luck, but at the same time it\u2019s an animal that is, how can I say, it\u2019s not respected the way it should be. And I think a lot of people can resonate with that. They just don\u2019t feel like they fit in,\u201d Willert said.</p><p>He said at times both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people can feel like they are not adequate, but everyone has a place in life.</p><p>The downtown mural project was developed through a collaboration with the city, and downtown businesses and agencies.</p><p>The city has contributed $200,000 for the murals, as well as lights and speakers to enhance the experience.

If the trees are confirmed to be &gt;150 years old, the forest is considered old-growth. Meeting old-growth criteria indicates the stand would qualify for an old-growth logging deferral\u2026. The understory is comprised predominantly of a deep moss layer with very little understory or mid-canopy shrubs or trees. The lack of understory, north aspect and presence of multiple ephemeral streams together indicate the site is at low risk of fire.\"</p><p>These two factors alone should be enough to halt any plans by Nacfor for logging in any capacity \u2014 even under the guise of fire risk prevention.</p><p>Additionally, during the Open House Zoom of May 26, 2021 with Nacfor, Hugh Watt reiterated that there would be no plans to go ahead with logging if residents of the Crescent Bay and Box Mountain area were not in favor. Many residents of the areas of Box Mountain have voiced that they are indeed strongly NOT in favour. Box Mountain is a watershed and any logging would disturb the mature forest and would cause compounding problems, compromising an already scarce water supply to over 300 residents.</p><p>In the past Box Mountain has been at risk of being logged and was saved 20 years ago by the efforts of concerned residents, including Jack Gould.</p><p>Protectors of Box Mountain are generally sceptical and mistrusting of any logging of the mature forest, given the clear-cutting and enormous destruction being done to other forests around Nakusp and throughout BC which were also slotted for \"fire risk prevention.\"</p><p>Ideally, Nacfor will honour their word and dismantle any plans in response to the residents not being in favour, coupled with the evidence put forth by Dr. Susanne Simard.</p><p>Nancy Gould,</p><p>Nakusp</p><p>Copyright 2021 Arrow Lakes News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARLNWS-news20210621PAR4174428</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARLNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62YW-8RD1-JD2C-J1MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438269</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"432\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

That helped push down the nationwide total, along with a sharp drop in the amount of fires in the Pantanal wetlands. Fires in September retreated to the lowest number for the month since 2018, several months before President Jair Bolsonaro took office.</p><p>Since taking office, Bolsonaro has encouraged development within the Amazon and dismissed global complaints about its destruction as a plot to hold back the nation\u2019s agribusiness. His administration also weakened environmental authorities and backed legislative measures to loosen land protections, emboldening land grabbers.</p><p>More recently, he has sought to demonstrate heightened environmental commitment in the face of criticism from the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden and troubled institutional investors. At the United Nations this month, he credited his administration's redoubled efforts  for the plunge of Amazon deforestation alerts in August, which followed a year-on-year decline in July. September results will be released in the coming week. </p><p>Environmentalists roundly dismiss his shift as disingenuous and say his deployment of the military to the Amazon is ineffective for preservation;  an Associated Press investigation last year found the same results. </p><p>M\u00e1rcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental nonprofit groups, welcomed September fire data, but said he would need to see lower figures through at least year-end before declaring it a trend, particularly given still-elevated deforestation levels and limited enforcement.</p><p>\u201cAs government action in the Amazon is very weak, even with these variations, it's hard to say it will be maintained. Why would it be maintained?\" Astrini said. \"The government isn\u2019t there, there's no repression. So it depends on the will of the people who are deforesting, setting fires.\u2033</p><p>Severe drought and early data at the start of the forest fire season had raised widespread concern that this year's blazes would reach the same destruction recorded in the past two years.</p><p>But rainfall in the Amazon during August was significantly above average. That was the main inhibitor keeping ranchers from setting fire to felled trees in September, which seemed \u201calmost divine intervention,\u201d said Ane Alencar, science director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute. </p><p>By contrast in the Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetlands, there has been a shift in behavior from last year leading to far fewer fires, despite the ongoing drought that has rendered the area a powder keg, Alencar added. Fires are down by more than two-thirds in the first nine months of 2020 after last year's explosion brought ruin to the local tourism industry.</p><p>\u201cThe disaster of last year served to help people better organize firefighting and prevention this year,\u201d Alencar said. \u201cThe economic losses last year had an important impact in making people think more about their actions and, with peer enforcement, reduce the use of fire.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-00f2707c6d738db63ef871d78908ea4d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63RS-GT91-JBVR-32CP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"577\"/><timeReceived>11:46 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 1, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

While many have treated the long holiday weekend as a reason for a party, others urged quiet reflection on America\u2019s violent and oppressive treatment of its Black citizens. And still others have remarked at the strangeness of celebrating a federal holiday marking the end of slavery in the nation while many Americans are trying to stop parts of that history from being taught in public schools.

GOP lawmakers are pushing deep tax cuts for companies and the affluent as the primary driver for sustaining economic growth, while President Joe Biden and fellow Democrats seek more targeted tax cuts to achieve social goals such as reducing child poverty and shifting to renewable energy that can help the economy in the long run.

What the hell \u2014 and I would probably use a different four-letter word \u2014 what the hell are they doing?\u201d Airpura donated the UV air purifiers, which range in price from $900 to $1,150, to Cloverdale Traditional Elementary School after it won a contest in September. There were 10 runner-up schools that received one HEPA air purifier each, with George Greenaway Elementary in Surrey also being selected.</p><p>However, the Surrey school district confirmed to the Now-Leader that all the air purifiers were shipped to Cloverdale Traditional and are being stored there.</p><p>The district claims that \u201cmost spaces\u201d in the district do not warrant additional filters for ventilation, but that doesn\u2019t sit well with Cloverdale Traditional School\u2019s Parents Advisory Council.</p><p>\u201cParents are very frustrated that the 20 air purifiers are still in storage, and just waiting to be plugged in. Our hands are tied because of the Surrey school district\u2019s decision to not allow them for use,\u201d reads an emailed statement from the PAC.</p><p>\u201cWe feel the district is making a blanket policy district-wide, and not on a case by case basis. We really just want better indoor air quality for our children.\u201d</p><p>In an emailed statement, district spokesperson Ritinder Matthew said the filters the PAC won \u201cwere not approved for use at that school by our health and safety department.</p><p>\u201cWe considered this request carefully \u2013taking into account all of the controls in place within the space, including ventilation, how the space is utilized, time spent in proximity to others, etc. The physical layout of the space was also an important consideration as these units must be sized, placed correctly and maintained according to manufacturer\u2019s directions.\u201d</p><p>Matthew added \u201canother important factor to consider with any UV units is the potential for by-products (like ozone and possible respiratory irritants).\u201d</p><p>The district previously said that in \u201cmost spaces,\u201d portable HEPA air filtration is \u201cnot indicated because we have layers of controls in place to prevent transmission. These in- clude optimized ventilation, maximizing use of available space, wearing masks, limiting mixing of people, and limiting time spent in close proximity to others.\u201d</p><p>Last fall, the Surrey school district released an online ventilation database that lists what ventilation systems are used in different areas of each school site.</p><p>Out of 20 areas listed for Cloverdale Traditional, 18 spaces used MERV-11. The two remaining locations, the hall and the gym, use a pad filter and MERV-13, respectively.</p><p>Pedro said the HEPA filters he provided in the contest is MERV-14, and \u201cin essence it\u2019s way better than the standards it is at the district.\u201d</p><p>The district said that where the equipment can accommodate, it had upgraded filters in HVAC equipment to MERV-13s. However, in cases where the manufacturer specifications do not accommodate MERV-13s, the district has installed the next highest filters that can be accommodated \u2013 either MERV-11s or MERV-8s.</p><p>MERV stands for minimum efficiency reporting values. According to the Government of Canada\u2019s guidance on indoor ventilation during the pandemic, filters with higher MERV ratings \u201care more efficient at removing particles.\u201d</p><p>The school\u2019s PAC says the air purifiers are \u201cthe added layer of protection for the children,\u201d especially as masks are no longer mandatory in schools.</p><p>\u201cThis is not just for filtering out COVID-19, but also other viruses/bacteria, allergens, and smoke during forest fire season. The school building itself is 100 years old and all classrooms are using MERV-11 filtration system, so any additional filtration would assist in cleaning the air.\u201d</p><p>Pedro agrees. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s not just a one-off investment,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you improve the air quality across the 75,000 students in the district, generally speaking, you\u2019re not just improving the protection against COVID, you\u2019re also improving the long-term aspects.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s part of the reason why Pedro says he\u2019s working with the PAC to hopefully convince the district and the school to use the donated HEPA filters.</p><p>For now, Pedro said he\u2019s working toward a solution.</p><p>\u201cLook, originally we gave 30 days but since we\u2019re working with them, I\u2019m obviously going to give them a lot more than 30 days,\u201d he acknowledged, but the intended purpose of the contest was for the air purifiers to be used in schools, which they\u2019re not.</p><p>\u201cAt the end of the day, if they warehouse some place, we\u2019d like to give it to the second-prize winner.\u201d</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:lauren.collins@surreynowleader.com\">lauren.collins@surreynowleader.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLEAD-news20220331PSUA0002559020</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLEAD2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6547-2M61-F0HF-8531-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Images of flames racing toward a French beach and Britons sweltering \u2014 even at the seaside \u2014 have driven home concerns about climate change.</p><p>The U.K. Met Office weather agency registered a provisional reading of 40.3 degrees Celsius (104.5 degrees Fahrenheit) at Coningsby in eastern England \u2014 breaking the record set just hours earlier. Before Tuesday, the highest temperature recorded in Britain was 38.7 C (101.7 F), set in 2019. By later afternoon, 29 places in the UK had broken the record.</p><p>As the nation watched with a combination of horror and fascination, Met Office chief scientist Stephen Belcher said such temperatures in Britain were \"virtually impossible\" without human-driven climate change.</p><p>He warned that \"we could see temperatures like this every three years\" without serious action on carbon emissions.</p><p>The sweltering weather has disrupted travel, health care and schools. Many homes, small businesses and even public buildings, including hospitals, in Britain don't have air conditioning, a reflection of how unusual such heat is in the country better known for rain and mild temperatures.</p><p>The intense heat since Monday has damaged the runway at London's Luton airport, forcing it to shut for several hours, and warped a main road in eastern England, leaving it looking like a \"skatepark,\" police said. Major train stations were shut or near-empty Tuesday, as trains were canceled or ran at low speeds out of concern rails could buckle.</p><p>London faced what Mayor Sadiq Khan called a \"huge surge\" in fires because of the heat. The London Fire Brigade listed 10 major blazes it was fighting across the city Tuesday, half of them grass fires. Images showed several houses engulfed in flames as smoke billowed from burning fields in Wennington, a village on the eastern outskirts of London.</p><p>Sales of fans at one retailer, Asda, increased by 1,300%. Electric fans cooled the traditional mounted troops of the Household Cavalry as they stood guard in central London in heavy ceremonial uniforms. The length of the changing of the guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace was shortened. The capital's Hyde Park, normally busy with walkers, was eerily quiet \u2014 except for the long lines to take a dip in the Serpentine lake.</p><p>\"I'm going to my office because it is nice and cool,'' said geologist Tom Elliott, 31, after taking a swim. \"I'm cycling around instead of taking the Tube.''</p><p>Ever the stalwart, Queen Elizabeth II carried on working. The 96-year-old monarch held a virtual audience with new U.S. ambassador Jane Hartley from the safety of Windsor Castle.</p><p>A huge chunk of England, from London in the south to Manchester and Leeds in the north, remained under the country's first \"red\" warning for extreme heat Tuesday, meaning there is danger of death even for healthy people.</p><p>Such dangers could be seen in Britain and across Europe. At least six people were reported to have drowned while trying to cool off in rivers, lakes and reservoirs across the U.K. In Spain and neighboring Portugal, hundreds of heat-related deaths have been reported in the heat wave.</p><p>Climate experts warn that global warming has increased the frequency of extreme weather events, with studies showing that the likelihood of temperatures in the U.K. reaching 40 C (104 F) is now 10 times higher than in the pre-industrial era.</p><p>The head of the U.N. weather agency expressed hope that the heat gripping Europe would serve as a \"wake-up call\" for governments to do more on climate change. Other scientists used the milestone moment to underscore that it was time to act.</p><p>\"While still rare, 40C is now a reality of British summers,\" said Friederike Otto, Senior Lecturer in Climate Science at Imperial College London's Grantham Institute for Climate Change. \"Whether it will become a very common occurrence or remains relatively infrequent is in our hands and is determined by when and at what global mean temperature we reach net zero.\"</p><p>Extreme heat broiled other parts of Europe, too. In Paris, the thermometer in the French capital's oldest weather station \u2013 opened in 1873 \u2013 topped 40 C (104 F) for just the third time. The 40.5 C (104.9 F) measured there by weather service Meteo-France on Tuesday was the station's second-highest reading ever, topped only by a blistering 42.6 C (108.7 F) in July 2019.</p><p>Drought and heat waves tied to climate change have also made wildfires more common and harder to fight.</p><p>In the Gironde region of southwestern France, ferocious wildfires continued to spread through tinder-dry pines forests, frustrating firefighting efforts by more than 2,000 firefighters and water-bombing planes.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from homes and summer vacation spots since the fires broke out July 12, Gironde authorities said.</p><p>A smaller third fire broke out late Monday in the Medoc wine region north of Bordeaux, further taxing resources. Five camping sites went up in flames in the Atlantic coast beach zone where blazes raged around the Arcachon maritime basin famous for its oysters and resorts.</p><p>In Greece, a large forest fire broke out northeast of Athens, fanned by high winds. Fire Service officials said nine firefighting aircraft and four helicopters were deployed to try to stop the flames from reaching inhabited areas on the slopes of Mount Penteli, some 25 kilometers (16 miles) northeast of the capital. Smoke from the fire blanketed part of the city's skyline.</p><p>But weather forecasts offered some consolation, with temperatures expected to ease along the Atlantic seaboard Tuesday and the possibility of rains rolling in late in the day.</p><p>\u2014Danica Kirka And Jill Lawless, The Associated Press</p><p>RELATED: Western heat shifts in some areas of B.C., territories, but still blazing elsewhere</p><p>Copyright 2022 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20220719PAB4348365</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65YN-TVJ1-JD2C-J0C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Group Ltd.

I had no choice but to venture up there to see if it might be a concern and would require that we move the cattle out of the area.</p><p>As it turned out, it appeared that the fire was somewhat contained and probably the result of a lightning strike a few days ago. A chopper was bucketing water to the fires and the fuel was being managed somehow with chainsaws.</p><p>Nevertheless, the forest licensees operating in the area were ready to dispatch heavy machinery to build a guard if needed.</p><p>I checked around but there were no cattle to be seen in the immediate area. I asked that we be contacted if the situation changed.</p><p>Returning home, I would spend the rest of the day ensuring water was available for the livestock at home, the garden and as a source of pumping for protecting the farmstead.</p><p>When running out to the range, riding cattle to where they should be, and rotating pastures for the home livestock to keep them gaining weight until the right time to market are all tasks in which I am engaging the grandchildren. I counsel them to keep track of the skills they learn and have them ready for prospective employers.</p><p>My goal is to have some activity each day that they can report on to parents with some pride and excitement. Patience, which has not been my long suit, is slowly coming to me. I harken back to times when some older person took the time to teach me a thing or two.</p><p>Hard physical work in the heat is most difficult. I remember coming home from university in Vancouver\u2014a moderate climate\u2014and being posted by the telephone company construction boss to hand dig post holes in the blazing heat near the Fraser River.</p><p>I had experienced my introduction to \u201cwork\u201d as a clerk in my dad\u2019s general store which was a cool place to be in the summer heat what with refrigeration running full blast. Needless to say, I was a soft worker and physical activity in the heat took some getting used to.</p><p>I am sorry to say that the rising temperature of the world will challenge the next generations in a way only those living in desert environments (often of their own making) have experienced.</p><p>Plant trees if you don\u2019t have enough to shade your place. Learn to conserve water. But above all consume less CO2 producing goods. Vote with your feet as they say.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-news20210722PTDA0002023936</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:636G-D5W1-F0HF-840G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"420\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Another problem is people who just aren\u2019t prepared with the right tools or who haven\u2019t checked the weather forecast before burning.</p><p>Fire departments in Pass Creek, Robson, Crescent Valley, Castlegar, Beasley and Ootischenia have all been called to wild-land fires in recent weeks.</p><p>The Castlegar department was called to a fire that illustrates that burning slash piles on your property isn\u2019t as simple as it sounds.</p><p>The fire was at an industrial site on the edge of town. The property owners had burned a slash pile there and extin-guished it (or so they thought) a month prior. Strong winds stirred up embers that had been smoldering underground that whole time and the fire quickly spread to almost one hectare in size.</p><p>Castlegar called in the Ootischenia Fire Department to help with hauling water since there were no fire hydrants nearby.</p><p>BC Wildfire crews also responded.</p><p>Chief Sam Lattanzio said it took 4000 gallons of water to extinguish the blaze.</p><p>The Crescent Valley Fire Department (CVFD) recently responded to a fire in Krestova that was a close call.</p><p>\u201cWe were very lucky that the fire was near the only road in the area we could get our fire engine down, and we were able to get water on it just as the strong wind pushed it down a rock outcrop to the edge of a large forested area,\u201d said a CVFD spokesperson on social media.</p><p>\u201cA few minutes later and it could have resulted in a significant forest fire.\u201d</p><p>The fire was likely caused by a small campfire that was started earlier in the day and not properly extinguished.</p><p>The Southeast Fire Centre (SEFC) issued a public notice on April 20 encouraging everyone to use caution when burning.</p><p>As the temperature increases, the grass cures and dries, making it extremely flammable, especially in windy conditions, warned SEFC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20210506PRAA0001832692</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62M2-N8T1-JD2C-J4MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"392\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

But that number was likely to change as teams go street by street surveying the destruction in the Mountain Gate area. It wasn't immediately known when the damage assessment would be completed.</p><p>At least 9,000 structures still were threatened, Ross said.</p><p>Authorities have arrested a 30-year-old woman on suspicion of starting the blaze that erupted Wednesday and grew explosively in hot and gusty weather in the region about 322 kilometres northeast of San Francisco.</p><p>Alexandra Souverneva was charged Friday with felony arson to wildland with an enhancement because of a declared state of emergency in California, Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said. The Palo Alto woman also is being investigated to see if she's started other fires in Shasta County and throughout the state, Bridgett said. It wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf.</p><p>The Fawn Fire has charred nearly 31 square kilometres of heavy timber and was 10 per cent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</p><p>Nearly 2,000 residents were under mandatory evacuation orders and an additional 7,400 were warned to be ready to leave if necessary, the California Highway Patrol said.</p><p>It's the latest destructive blaze to send Californians fleeing this year. Fires have burned more than 9,324 sq. km so far in 2021, destroying more than 3,200 homes, commercial properties and other structures.</p><p>Those fires include a pair of big forest blazes that have been burning for more than two weeks in the heart of giant sequoia country on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. More than 1,700 firefighters battled the KNP Complex Fires, which covered nearly 171 sq. km by Saturday.</p><p>Nearby, the Windy Fire grew significantly Friday, prompting new evacuations for rural communities. The blaze ignited by lightning on Sept. 9 has scorched 287 sq. km of trees and brush on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Sequoia National Forest. It was just five per cent contained Saturday.</p><p>A historic drought in the American West tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. It has killed millions of trees in California alone.</p><p>Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20210926TTA2021092662324831</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63PG-JJT1-JDV5-F3BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"507\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

This is the latest method of patrol; with patrols continued with the aid of horses, canoes, launches and railway velocipedes, and on foot. Hundreds of miles of telephone lines have been erected in Dominion forests to give quick communications between lookout stations and forest</p><p>headquarters. Lookout men stationed on mountain peaks or high towers scan the horizon throughout the danger season and send in warnings at the first sign of smoke; that fire-fighters may be sent at once to the spot. Where there are no telephone lines, a system of flashlight signaling, using heliographs by day and lanterns by night, has been worked out. So far as the funds available permit, the most modem methods and devices are employed to protect the great resources in our</p><p>Dominion forests.\u201d</p><p>&gt; Liquor Prices \u201cLiquor prices in British Columbia were announced on June 15. Varieties of Scotch whiskey are not detailed in the price list passed by the government. All grades are included in a list under a general price of $4 to $5 for a reputed quart bottle (equal to 26 fl. ounces).

This can cause burning eyes, a runny nose, coughing, trouble breathing or illnesses like bronchitis.</p><p>These particles can make conditions such as heart and lung problems more pronounced. Smoke can also be harmful to our furry friends, so keeping pets inside as much as possible and ensuring they have lots of water is recommended when confronted with a lot of smoke in the area.</p><p>If you are outside it is recommended that you don't do any heavy activities or exercise in the smoke. It is also important to drink lots of water and stay hydrated, this will keep your nose and mouth moist which makes it easier to breathe. When there is a lot of haze in the air, don't let your children play outside for a long time.</p><p>Alberta Health Services have provided a list of options to help keep your health risk low from smoke and your indoor air in your home as clean as possible:</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; Keep windows and doors closed.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; Close fresh air intakes from furnaces, fireplaces, or stoves.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; Turn on your air conditioning if you have it, and set it to recirculate. Keep it running to help filter the air and keep your family cool. (Just remember that some air conditioning systems don't filter the air or improve indoor air quality.)</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; If you have room air cleaners with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, turn them on. Don't use air cleaners that may produce ozone. For portable air cleaners, follow all the manufacturer's instructions for changing the filter, where to place the device, and the size of room it's meant to be used in.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; Use humidifiers, which might help remove some of the smoke. The humid air can also help keep your nose and mouth moist.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; Don't use wood stoves, gas stoves, or candles because they make the indoor air quality worse. If you can, prepare foods that you don't have to cook. Cooking (especially frying and broiling) can affect the air quality in your home.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; Don't use spray air fresheners or electric fragrance dispensers because they can affect air quality.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; Don't vacuum because it stirs up particles that are already inside your home.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; Don't let anyone smoke, vape, or use e-cigarettes in your home.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:shaela.dansereau@pipestoneflyer.caLike\">shaela.dansereau@pipestoneflyer.caLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PIPFLY-4187352</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PIPFLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6361-CFY1-F103-33G1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459605</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"438\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors.

(CREST) is the primary provider for communication tools, from radios to cell towers, for 50 first responder agencies across the CRD.</p><p>The \"very specialized\" equipment required to monitor and repair their infrastructure is currently housed in a modest Langford warehouse, said CREST general manager Gord Horth. That equipment includes a reserve of satellite radios and the software to remotely monitor more than 30 P25 transmission towers, which were installed across the region last year to fully lift CREST's clients to digital over analog communication.</p><p>RELATED STORY: New system aims to increase coverage, cut costs for Greater Victoria first responders</p><p>In the fall strategic plan, the potential loss of specialized equipment and personnel housed in Langford was identified as their greatest risk, Horth said. Engineering firm Stantec conducted an independent review confirming as much. As a result, a task force of CREST board members has been created to look at options for a post-seismic facility.</p><p>One option is sharing space within an emergency service building, such as either of the new fire halls being built in Esquimalt and Victoria, or the slated expansion for the West Shore RCMP headquarters. Another is raising a new purpose-built facility to \"meet our projected and future needs,\" Horth said.</p><p>Either option will suit after considering price and location, he added.</p><p>The special nature of CREST's equipment and the likelihood of natural disasters spell the company's need for a protected facility. Two years ago, the telecoms company operationally recovered from a facility flood in two days, thanks to spare equipment which would otherwise take three to six months to order and replace.</p><p>\"A number of components come from Japan \u2026 our microwave spares come from Israel,\" Horth said. \"There's a pretty diverse supply chain on emergency equipment throughout the world.

These restrictions are put in place in order to reduce the number of preventable human-caused fires and lower the risk of wildfires impacting the public.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before starting an outdoor fire, residents are advised to check with their municipality to see if a local fire ban is still in effect or if a permit is required.</p><p>Horton Township is one of several municipalities that addressed the news on social media.</p><p>\"Good news from Fire Chief Cole,\" reads a May 15 Facebook post. \"As of MIDNIGHT tonight, MNRF has lifted the Level 2/Fire Restricted Zone for Horton. We are still at a Level 1 Fire Ban, which only allows for campfires. Please make sure you follow our open-air burning bylaw!\"</p><p>Bonnechere Valley Fire also reached out on Facebook: \"We've just heard from the MNRF that as of midnight tonight the Restricted Fire Zone will be removed allowing campfires. We'll then go to a Level 1 Fire Ban allowing the same. Permits for burning brush will not be available under Level 1. Thanks for your co-operation.\"</p><p>The release continues on to say the Ontario government has taken additional steps to protect people and property during the wildland fire season, including an increase in base funding for emergency forest firefighting by $30.2 million, and ensuring safety measures are in place to protect Ontario's highly trained fire rangers from COVID-19.</p><p>To help stop the spread of COVID-19 fire rangers will be required to follow the health and safety guidelines recommended by the Chief Medical Officer of Health, such as physical distancing, frequent hand washing, and daily self-assessments by staff.</p><p>\"This is an extraordinary period. As we put measures in place to protect our staff and the public from the pandemic, we have been taking additional steps to prepare for the wildland fire season,\" said John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. \"Nothing is more important than protecting the safety of people and communities across the province. Although we want people to enjoy themselves, lifting the Restricted Fire Zone designation does not mean we can let our guard down when it comes to preventing human-caused forest fires.\"</p><p>The province has also implemented a more aggressive approach to fighting wildland fires this season with a focus on detecting fires early, combating them with full force and keeping them as small as possible.</p><p>\"Despite the challenges of these unprecedented times, Ontario's emergency management personnel have been proactively working with partners to prepare for potential evacuations due to the wildland fire season,\" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. \"Public safety remains our top priority and our Provincial Emergency Operations Centre will continue to monitor forest fire situations with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, and be ready to coordinate a response if called upon for evacuation assistance.\"</p><p>QUICK FACTS</p><p>Human-caused fires represent approximately 50 per cent of wildland fires that occur in Ontario each year.</p><p>So far this year, Ontario has had 37 wildland fires burning 93 hectares. This is below the 10-year average of 114 wildland fires and 8,260 hectares burned to date.</p><p>Find more information here.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2020051557957312</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXH-2P41-JDH1-C3MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"588\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

(CREST) is the primary provider for communication tools, from radios to cell towers, for 50 first responder agencies across the CRD.</p><p>The \"very specialized\" equipment required to monitor and repair their infrastructure is currently housed in a modest Langford warehouse, said CREST general manager Gord Horth. That equipment includes a reserve of satellite radios and the software to remotely monitor more than 30 P25 transmission towers, which were installed across the region last year to fully lift CREST's clients to digital over analog communication.</p><p>RELATED STORY: New system aims to increase coverage, cut costs for Greater Victoria first responders</p><p>In the fall strategic plan, the potential loss of specialized equipment and personnel housed in Langford was identified as their greatest risk, Horth said. Engineering firm Stantec conducted an independent review confirming as much. As a result, a task force of CREST board members has been created to look at options for a post-seismic facility.</p><p>One option is sharing space within an emergency service building, such as either of the new fire halls being built in Esquimalt and Victoria, or the slated expansion for the West Shore RCMP headquarters. Another is raising a new purpose-built facility to \"meet our projected and future needs,\" Horth said.</p><p>Either option will suit after considering price and location, he added.</p><p>The special nature of CREST's equipment and the likelihood of natural disasters spell the company's need for a protected facility. Two years ago, the telecoms company operationally recovered from a facility flood in two days, thanks to spare equipment which would otherwise take three to six months to order and replace.</p><p>\"A number of components come from Japan &amp;#x26;#8230; our microwave spares come from Israel,\" Horth said. \"There's a pretty diverse supply chain on emergency equipment throughout the world.

One of those hardest hit by the flood was the Fraserglen Golf Course and Training Centre. The golf course, part of the floodplain, saw a torrent of water pass through after an atmospheric river caused the Nooksack River in Washington State to overflow its banks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fraserglen owners Dave and Corrine Allan remember watching footage from cameras on the property as events unfolded.</p><p>\u201cThere was no warning,\u201d Corrine said.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t on site but we were watching on camera and we just didn\u2019t know what was happening. We saw the water rushing. It came like a wall.\u201d</p><p>The next morning, the Allans surveyed the damage from kayaks they paddled around the property. Water, several feet high, invaded all seven of the buildings on the property.</p><p>More than $77,000 worth of merchandise was destroyed in the pro shop. The adjacent restaurant and bar was ruined. An Airbnb rental home on the property sustained extensive damage. Repairs to the home have just been completed, and the Allans have guests booked once again.</p><p>Anything that wasn\u2019t nailed down was greatly affected by the rushing waters. Pull carts and tables were found across the highway at Castle Fun Park. More than 40 power carts were submerged and damaged by water. Anything electric was pretty much lost to the flood, while gas-operated machines stood a slightly better chance of recovery.</p><p>It was a disaster that the Allans, owners of Fraserglen since 1992, could scarcely believe.</p><p>\u201cIt changed my life,\u201d Corrine said. \u201cIt changed my family\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>Course fared better than expected And yet, while flood waters devastated buildings and equipment, the course itself managed to escape complete annihilation, due in large part to the nature of the flood itself Because of the property\u2019s location in the floodplain, most of the water came quickly and didn\u2019t deposit a lot of sediment because of a steady current. It also left quicker than other parts of the Sumas Prairie.</p><p>While the floodwaters washed a lot of things off the property, they also left a lot of new stuff behind. Some of it just plain weird and inexplicable.</p><p>\u201cCheese-so much cheese. I don\u2019t know where the cheese came from,\u201d Corrine said with a laugh. \u201cWe found so much stuff, like zucchinis and pumpkins, because it was that time of year, and beer kegs. We found those giant marshmallow hay bales.\u201d</p><p>And while the community rallied around those affected by the flood, Corrine is forever grateful to friends, family and the golf industry itself for coming to their aid.</p><p>\u201cThey took a lot of our equipment to fix,\u201d she said. \u201cThe golf industry stepped up to the plate.\u201d</p><p>Redwoods and Northview golf clubs brought volunteer crews to help in the clean up.</p><p>Not their first disaster This isn\u2019t the first time Fraserglen has had to deal with adversity as two ice storms-on Feb. 9 and Dec. 19 in 2017-destroyed the netting that enclosed the driving range. Climate change is a very real thing if you ask Corrine, who said \u201cextreme weather\u201d is happening more frequently and with greater devastating effect.</p><p>Corrine\u2019s sister lost her home to the White Rock Lake forest fire near Vernon last summer.</p><p>\u201cWe are at the mercy of the Nooksack and America,\u201d Corrine said of future flooding potential. \u201cIf they don\u2019t do anything, it will happen again.\u201d</p><p>The golf course and driving range officially reopened March 5. All 18 holes of the par-62, 3,748-yard track are playable. Corrine expects the clubhouse will be fully functional soon, with the restaurant reopening in late May or June.</p><p>Disaster relief funds The Abbotsford Disaster Relief Fund has generated more than $4.3 million to date, with Fraserglen an early recipient of an emergency cheque.</p><p>But the amount -$5,000-doesn\u2019t come nearly close enough to covering their losses. Because the business is on the floodplain, insurance was a non-starter. Likewise, while farmers were eligible for up to $300,000 through the provincial disaster relief fund, no such thing exists for private businesses.</p><p>\u201cI call this place the Bermuda Triangle,\u201d said Corrine, tongue in cheek. \u201cThere\u2019s never a dull day at Fraserglen.\u201d</p><p>Katerina Anastasiadis, CEO of the Abbotsford Chamber of Commerce, said the disaster relief funds are broken into various funding streams. For farms and small businesses, that meant around $1.1 million was granted.</p><p>And while Anastasiadis is pleased at how quickly they disbursed the initial funds, she says more is hopefully coming.</p><p>\u201cWe were trying to preserve some funds for medium and long-term requests,\u201d she said. \u201cWe review the applications every two weeks and are hoping there will be additional opportunities to give more funding in the future.\u201d</p><p>Visit abbotsfordcf.orgfor more information about the Abbotsford Disaster Relief Fund.</p><p>Floods par for the course Last November's historic weather event wasn't the first time Fraserglen Golf Course has been underwater A3 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20220428PPCA0002628519</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65B6-7TC1-JD2C-J0CF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"827\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Group Ltd.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational in April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Thursday, Jan. 26, there were 21 active speed cameras according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Timeline</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational in April 2022.</p><p>As of Thursday, Jan. 26, there were 21 active speed cameras according to the city.</p><p>Tickets</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>Where are the cameras?</p><p>Active Speed Cameras</p><p>Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

The golf course, part of the floodplain, saw a torrent of water pass through after an atmospheric river caused the Nooksack River in Washington State to overflow its banks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fraserglen owners Dave and Corrine Allan remember watching footage from cameras on the property as events unfolded.</p><p>\"There was no warning,\" Corrine said. \"We weren't on site but we were watching on camera and we just didn't know what was happening. We saw the water rushing. It came like a wall.\"</p><p>RELATED: VIDEO &amp; PHOTOS: Aerial tour of flood damage to Abbotsford</p><p>The next morning, the Allans surveyed the damage from kayaks they paddled around the property. Water, several feet high, invaded all seven of the buildings on the property.</p><p>More than $77,000 worth of merchandise was destroyed in the pro shop. The adjacent restaurant and bar was ruined. An Airbnb rental home on the property sustained extensive damage. Repairs to the home have just been completed, and the Allans have guests booked once again.</p><p>Anything that wasn't nailed down was greatly affected by the rushing waters. Pull carts and tables were found across the highway at Castle Fun Park. More than 40 power carts were submerged and damaged by water. Anything electric was pretty much lost to the flood, while gas-operated machines stood a slightly better chance of recovery.</p><p>It was a disaster that the Allans, owners of Fraserglen since 1992, could scarcely believe.</p><p>\"It changed my life,\" Corrine said. \"It changed my family's life.\"</p><p>Course fared better than expected</p><p>And yet, while flood waters devastated buildings and equipment, the course itself managed to escape complete annihilation, due in large part to the nature of the flood itself. Because of the property's location in the floodplain, most of the water came quickly and didn't deposit a lot of sediment because of a steady current. It also left quicker than other parts of the Sumas Prairie.</p><p>While the floodwaters washed a lot of things off the property, they also left a lot of new stuff behind. Some of it just plain weird and inexplicable.</p><p>RELATED: B.C. declares state of emergency amid devastating floods, landslides</p><p>\"Cheese \u2013 so much cheese. I don't know where the cheese came from,\" Corrine said with a laugh. \"We found so much stuff, like zucchinis and pumpkins, because it was that time of year, and beer kegs. We found those giant marshmallow hay bales.\"</p><p>And while the community rallied around those affected by the flood, Corrine is forever grateful to friends, family and the golf industry itself for coming to their aid.</p><p>\"They took a lot of our equipment to fix,\" she said. \"The golf industry stepped up to the plate.\"</p><p>Redwoods and Northview golf clubs brought volunteer crews to help in the clean up.</p><p>Not their first disaster</p><p>This isn't the first time Fraserglen has had to deal with adversity as two ice storms \u2013 on Feb. 9 and Dec. 19 in 2017 \u2013 destroyed the netting that enclosed the driving range. Climate change is a very real thing if you ask Corrine, who said \"extreme weather\" is happening more frequently and with greater devastating effect.</p><p>Corrine's sister lost her home to the White Rock Lake forest fire near Vernon last summer.</p><p>\"We are at the mercy of the Nooksack and America,\" Corrine said of future flooding potential. \"If they don't do anything, it will happen again.\"</p><p>The golf course and driving range officially reopened March 5. All 18 holes of the par-62, 3,748-yard track are playable. Corrine expects the clubhouse will be fully functional soon, with the restaurant reopening in late May or June.</p><p>Disaster relief funds</p><p>The Abbotsford Disaster Relief Fund has generated more than $4.2 million to date, with Fraserglen an early recipient of an emergency cheque.</p><p>But the amount \u2013 $5,000 \u2013 doesn't come nearly close enough to covering their losses. Because the business is on the floodplain, insurance was a non-starter. Likewise, while farmers were eligible for up to $300,000 through the provincial disaster relief fund, no such thing exists for private businesses.</p><p>\"I call this place the Bermuda Triangle,\" said Corrine, tongue in cheek. \"There's never a dull day at Fraserglen.\"</p><p>Katerina Anastasiadis, CEO of the Abbotsford Chamber of Commerce, said the disaster relief funds are broken into various funding streams. For farms and small businesses, that meant around $400,000 was available.</p><p>And while Anastasiadis is pleased at how quickly they disbursed the initial funds, which eventually totalled $600,000, she says more is hopefully coming.</p><p>\"We were trying to preserve some funds for medium and long-term requests,\" she said. \"We review the applications every two weeks and are hoping there will be additional opportunities to give more funding in the future.\"</p><p>Visit abbotsfordcf.org for more information about the Abbotsford Disaster Relief Fund.</p><p>Copyright 2022 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20220428PAB4314171</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65B6-7TC1-JD2C-J053-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Group Ltd.

It's at once obvious and, this year, sadly pertinent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The issue is fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the moment, we associate it with calamity. But in world literature it has a host of other connotations.</p><p>In Samuel Beckett's \"Krapp's Last Tape,\" the sole character looks back on his life and declares<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">,</emphasis> \"Perhaps my best years are gone ... But I wouldn't want them back. Not with the fire in me now.\"</p><p>The titular character in W.B. Yeats' \"The Song of Wandering Aengus\" begins his quest for a beautiful woman with the words, \"I went out to the hazel wood / Because a fire was in my head.\"</p><p>And Rainer Maria Rilke's poem \"Spanish Dancer\" tells us the performer's \"wheeling dance\" is \"made of pure fire.\"</p><p>For these writers, flames represent something positive: virility, desire, passion.</p><p>Contrast this with the recent tragedy of fire in Canada. Lytton, B.C. reached temperatures nearly halfway to boiling and 90 per cent of the village burned to the ground. Hundreds of people throughout the province have likely died from extreme heat.</p><p>The disaster wasn't confined to the West. In late July, Dr. Samantha Green, an expert in climate change and health, wrote that forest fire smoke from northern Ontario was polluting Canada's largest city: \"For several days last week, Toronto had some of the worst air quality in the world.\"</p><p>Fire has these dual aspects: fervour on the one hand, devastation on the other. To stop the latter, we have to ignite more of the former.</p><p>Many people say we must see the climate crisis for what it is - an emergency - and act accordingly. This is certainly true. But this means bringing to the issue a depth of emotion normally reserved for private life. If our children were trembling on a window ledge about to fall, we would do anything to save them. That's the urgency we have to bring to the climate situation.</p><p>This election we must apply a \"my kids\" test to candidates' promises. We must ask whether their commitments will protect the next generation.</p><p>What would pass the test?</p><p>At minimum, all parties should support greenhouse gas reductions far greater than the 40 to 45 per cent Ottawa is contemplating. We need a cut of at least 60 per cent before the end of the decade.</p><p>We also require electrification of all personal transportation and home heating systems; a massive increase in solar and wind power deployment; immediate cancellation of government subsidies to fossil fuel producers, with a transition plan for all workers in the sector; and no new coal, oil or gas development.</p><p>These are the policies you make when your family's very life hangs in the balance.</p><p>When we cast our ballots this year, we must - like Yeats' Aengus - have fire in our heads. Let's pursue climate solutions the way we pursue love.</p><p>Gideon Forman is a policy analyst at the David Suzuki Foundation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-news20210815TTAW1a973bebe94543cf897f5d4722695a7e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63DM-0DH1-JDV5-F554-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"473\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The requirements were:installing three streetlights; installing one of two fire hydrants; upgrading a water main from 100 millimeters to 200 mm and extending the storm sewer.</p><p>While council members expressed support for reducing the setback from Fifth Avenue, concerns were expressed about waiving other requirements.</p><p>Coun. Tim Lavery said storm water handling and fire hydrants would be two items he would have difficulty waiving, but street work would be a possibility. Lavery said he is struggling because the association is \u201cone of our premier community organizations, does incredibly good work on a key point of land and I want to find ways to support them.\u201d</p><p>Other council members also mentioned their high regard for the organization and fall fair.</p><p>Coun. Chad Eliason agreed with Lavery, noting the improvements required are expensive because the parcel has been under-serviced for years, something the board didn\u2019t realize. For him, the requirements he couldn\u2019t waive would be fire hydrants and street lights.</p><p>\u201cThe worst time to get a fire hydrant variance is just after a heat wave in a high forest-fire season,\u201d Eliason remarked.</p><p>Coun. Sylvia Lindgren said she could likely support most of the variances other than storm water, and perhaps the city could help cover some expenses.</p><p>Mayor Alan Harrison expressed his appreciation for the agricultural association.</p><p>\u201cI think council all recognizes the value of SASLAA in the community and the fact this is a non profit; it puts a different light on it.\u201d</p><p>He asked that the fire chief be invited to the July 12 council meeting when the application would be complete and council would decide on it. He said he would follow whatever the fire chief recommends regarding fire hydrants.</p><p>Harrison described street lighting as crucial because Fifth Avenue is a heavily walked area.</p><p>The handling of storm water is also important, he said, as \u201cwe\u2019ve all walked through big puddles on that site.\u201d</p><p>Jayme Franklin, president of the association\u2019s engineering firm, pointed out the issue with storm water goes back to when Fifth Street was built and all the catch basins drained water onto the property. He said one small building would have negligible impact.</p><p>Phil Wright, president of the SASLAA board, thanked council for the direction and said he and the engineering firm would see what they could come up with in the next week.</p><p>Salmon Arm Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALARM-news20210714PSHA0002007778</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALARM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634X-8MX1-JD2C-J05D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438273</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

AFP. <br/> 'This is a very flammable pine-covered area.' <br/> Meanwhile, another forest fire broke out in Vilia, Attica, some 60 kilometres (37 miles) northwest of Athens, prompting the mobilisation of air and ground forces. <br/> Authorities have called for the evacuation of two nearby villages, while another 40 firefighters were battling the blazes, according to a firefighting official. <br/> The fires come on the heels of blazes in recent weeks that have destroyed homes, properties, pine forests, beehives and livestock across more than 100,000 hectares of affected land. <br/> The island of Evia, 200 kilometres northeast of Athens, has paid the heaviest price with more than half of the hectares burned there. <br/> The Peloponnese peninsula, 300 kilometres west of Athens, but also the northern suburbs of the capital, were also heavily affected by some 600 fires. <br/> The blazes were finally brought under control Friday. <br/>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said the fires offered a dire warning. <br/> 'The climate crisis tells us everything must change,' he said. <br/> As global temperatures rise, heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent and intense, and their impacts more widespread, scientists say. <br/><url

Gideon Forman</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's an issue that should become salient in the upcoming national vote. It's at once obvious and, this year, sadly pertinent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The issue is fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the moment, we associate it with calamity. But in world literature it has a host of other connotations.</p><p>In Samuel Beckett's \"Krapp's Last Tape,\" the sole character looks back on his life and declares, \"Perhaps my best years are gone ... But I wouldn't want them back. Not with the fire in me now.\"</p><p>The titular character in W.B. Yeats' \"The Song of Wandering Aengus\" begins his quest for a beautiful woman with the words, \"I went out to the hazel wood / Because a fire was in my head.\"</p><p>And Rainer Maria Rilke's poem \"Spanish Dancer\" tells us the performer's \"wheeling dance\" is \"made of pure fire.\"</p><p>For these writers, flames represent something positive: virility, desire, passion.</p><p>Contrast this with the recent tragedy of fire in Canada. Lytton, B.C. reached temperatures nearly halfway to boiling and 90 per cent of the village burned to the ground. Hundreds of people throughout the province have likely died from extreme heat.</p><p>The disaster wasn't confined to the West.</p><p>In late July, Dr. Samantha Green, an expert in climate change and health, wrote that forest fire smoke from northern Ontario was polluting Canada's largest city: \"For several days last week, Toronto had some of the worst air quality in the world.\"</p><p>Fire has these dual aspects: fervour on the one hand, devastation on the other. To stop the latter, we have to ignite more of the former.</p><p>Many people say we must see the climate crisis for what it is - an emergency - and act accordingly. This is certainly true. But this means bringing to the issue a depth of emotion normally reserved for private life. If our children were trembling on a window ledge about to fall, we would do anything to save them. That's the urgency we have to bring to the climate situation.</p><p>This election we must apply a \"my kids\" test to candidates' promises. We must ask whether their commitments will protect the next generation.</p><p>What would pass the test?</p><p>At minimum, all parties should support greenhouse gas reductions far greater than the 40 to 45 per cent Ottawa is contemplating. We need a cut of at least 60 per cent before the end of the decade.</p><p>We also require electrification of all personal transportation and home heating systems; a massive increase in solar and wind power deployment; immediate cancellation of government subsidies to fossil fuel producers, with a transition plan for all workers in the sector; and no new coal, oil or gas development.</p><p>These are the policies you make when your family's very life hangs in the balance.</p><p>When we cast our ballots this year, we must - like Yeats' Aengus - have fire in our heads. Let's pursue climate solutions the way we pursue love.</p><p>Gideon Forman is a policy analyst at the David Suzuki Foundation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20210815TTA2021081561946958</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63D1-N3W1-F197-52GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"473\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Lumber prices help our customers which leads to us getting more opportunity.\"</p><p>USNR supplies equipment and technologies for the wood-processing industry.</p><p>Seaman said just over 100 people currently work at the facility.</p><p>At the beginning of 2020, the company had to \"lighten a little bit,\" but then lumber prices increased which meant more staff.</p><p>Seaman said while the site used to be mainly manufacturing, that's handled in other divisions. The Salmon Arm facility is mostly engineering now.</p><p>Read more: Hot U.S. lumber market good for trade talks: Canadian ambassador</p><p>Read more: Wood products pricing surge expected to persist, raising 2021 house, renovation costs</p><p>Over at Canoe Forest Products, general manager Marcello Angelozzi said the company had a difficult 2019 which continued until about the spring of 2020.</p><p>\"By midsummer things were changing, both the lumber market and the plywood side. The markets are very strong right now.</p><p>\"We have order files that take us through to summer \u2013 long order files means that we're in good shape in terms of the market staying strong for a while.\"</p><p>Angelozzi commented on one unfortunate occurrence that's good for business.</p><p>\"Typically if we see a bad forest fire season it actually pushes prices even higher \u2013 but we'd prefer not to see that.\"</p><p>He said the Salmon Arm plywood plant has managed to skirt many of the issues that have plagued some companies. He said Canoe Forest Products' management team has done a great job on the COVID-19 front, adapting and losing very little time from employees being off.</p><p>\"We've been pretty lucky on that front, you know we have the best safety metrics we've ever seen in our plant. The guys are doing a great job for sure.\"</p><p>He said the plant has seen fewer safety incidents every month, and year over year there's been a great improvement.</p><p>The Salmon Arm plant employs just under 200 people, with about 1,000 total in the Gorman group. That includes a variety of operations in Revelstoke, Westbank, Lumby and Oroville, Washington.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:martha.wickett@saobserver.net\">martha.wickett@saobserver.net</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 Salmon Arm Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALARM-news20210426PSB4148658</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALARM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62HX-XF21-JD2C-J55G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438273</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"404\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

These investments help create jobs, boost economic activity, strengthen communities and celebrate Canada's rich cultural heritage.</p><p>The Canadian Bushplane Heritage Centre preserves and tells the story of Canada's bushplane and forest fire protection heritage, and how it has shaped life in northern and remote parts of Canada. The centre collects, preserves, exhibits and interprets a collection of bushplanes and related material, and promotes public understanding of their significance by offering quality presentations, education programs and visitor experiences in a public museum facility. It also serves as a centre of research and information on bushplane and forest fire fighting heritage.

I was \u2013 no, I still am \u2013 appalled by this callous flyer.</p><p>We are in the midst of one of the worst forest fire seasons in the Interior and this letter provides \u201cIdeas for Summer Fun.\u201d You suggest visiting a park, such as Silver Star Provincial Park. What is there to see with all the smoke? The world is on fire, not just B.C. \u2013Siberia, Greece, Turkey, China, California. Where there is no fire there are droughts. Or floods. People are dying. And you have the audacity to suggest to \u201cDine out.\u201d</p><p>Sure, you are the representative for North Okanagan and Shuswap, not of Sichuan province. But, as I sure hope, you are aware that people have had to leave their homes or are on evacuation alert in your constituency. Not a word about this, not even condolences. The next pandemic is dry and hot and politicians will have to do more than to \u201cTry a new brew.\u201d</p><p>Granted, you and the Conservative Party are in the opposition with limited political power. Yet, instead of demanding even more subsidies for oil and gas (\u201cRemove the carbon tax on gasoline, diesel fuel, and natural gas used by Canadian farmers\u201d), you could hold the Liberals accountable for wasting some $4.8 billion a year in subsidies for oil and gas.</p><p>We are on the brink of catastrophe from climate breakdown, as even conservative politicians such as the UK\u2019s Tory climate chief Alok Sharma have warned. You will appreciate this assessment by taking a trip and talking to the communities in the Interior affected by wildfire, drought or both. We have not had any substantial rain in the past two months. The air is difficult to breath. 47.9</p><p>C in Lytton this June was a temperature record for Canada. This is not just one bad summer. Last year was the hottest year on record. The last decade was the hottest decade. Climate change is here, even if the Conservative Party refuses to acknowledge this.</p><p>In times of crisis people looking for leadership, not for platitudes or avoidance. Imagine Sir Winston Churchill on the brink of defeat against Nazi Germany rallying his people to \u201clegalize single-event sports betting\u201d (Conservative Bill C-218) and selling this as \u201cdelivering results for our community.\u201d</p><p>Your newsletter is out of sync with the reality many in B.C. \u2019s Interior face and will continue to face. Definitely \u201cwrong track\u201d to answer the survey attached to your newsletter.</p><p>Cornelius Suchy, Revelstoke Editor\u2019s note:Mel Arnold is the MP for the North Okangan-Shuswap.

Previous exploration on the property has identified several styles of mineralization including copper-gold skarn mineralization, massive sulfide zones (pyrite, pyrrhotite) and epithermal alteration (silicification and veining). Free gold is reported in samples from the western part of the claims A mineralized quartz feldspar porphyry dyke has also returned elevated values of copper mineralization, and could suggest porphyry mineralization potential.</p><p>In 2020, Belmont completed an airborne magnetic survey and a Lidar survey over the property. Numerous features of interest were defined by the surveys, which are assisting in geological mapping and interpretation in areas of cover. An extensive rock-sampling program is currently underway, which will target areas of identified skarn mineralization and epithermal alteration, as well as features of interest from the magnetic and Lidar surveys.</p><p>The sampling program will be followed by an IP survey, which was originally scheduled for June of this year, but was suddenly cancelled due to unusual high temperatures and forest fire danger rating in the project area. The objective of the IP survey is to map the resistivity and chargeability distribution and provide specific diamond drill targets.</p><p>About Belmont Resources</p><p>Belmont Resources is engaged in the business of acquiring and re-developing past producing copper-gold-silver mines in southern British Columbia and Northern Washington State. This region is considered to have the highest concentration of mineralization and past producing mines in western North America. By utilizing new exploration technology, geological modelling and specialized 3D data analysis, the company is successfully identifying new areas of mineralization beneath and/or in the near vicinity of the past producing mines.</p><p>The Belmont project portfolio://st- Athelstan-Jackpot, B.C. *Athelstan &amp;Jackpot Gold-Silver mines- Come By Chance, B.C. *Betts Copper-Gold mine- Lone Star, Washington *Lone Star Copper-Gold mine- Pathfinder, B.C. *Bertha &amp;Pathfinder GoldSilver mines- Black Bear, B.C.

If we can get our structural protection set up on these residences, it allows us to move away.</p><p>\u201cWhat these setups do is kind of create a moisture bubble around these structures which then often means a wildfire event will move around the structure as opposed to burning it down.\u201d</p><p>Training on structure protection techniques is scheduled for May 1 and 2. In June, Smithers firefighers will take the province\u2019s Wildland Firefighter Level 1 program, which includes basic fire suppression and fire entrapment avoidance components.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMTINW-news20210304PQLA0001661439</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMTINW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6273-VCY1-F0HF-80NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438222</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"410\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational in April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Sunday, Jan. 18, there were 18 active speed cameras according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Well, experts have noted volcanic activity throughout the years, particularly since 1975. But they advise that there'll be plenty of warning before an eruption through earthquakes, venting and other signs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-3988087</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRM-CTF1-JDH1-C021-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"207\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Abbotsford News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001985</classCode><className>VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001196</classCode><className>NATIVE AMERICANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR120</classCode><className>NORTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
