Businesses have suffered as tourists leave or stay away, wineries are concerned about tainted grapes, and even the apiarist who keeps bees in my yard warned me to keep a safe distance from the hives, because \"the bees are mad.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Related: B.C. wildfire season now second worst in province's history</p><p>A recent change in the weather has improved the situation in the southern Interior, but there are still significant fires burning in the mountains of the Similkameen, Kettle and West Kootenay.</p><p>Some have called this the \"new normal,\" but unfortunately it's only part of a trend &amp;#8212; things will likely become more severe as the years go on. Luckily there are things we can and must do to reduce the impacts of climate change in both the short and long term.</p><p>First, we can adapt to these changes by altering how we work in our forests. Most forestry activities in Canada are regulated by the provincial governments, but the federal government can become involved at higher levels with significant funding and research. After the catastrophic fires of 2003 the B.C. government commissioned the Filmon Report, but few of the recommendations in it were fully implemented. Recently, the provincial government asked former cabinet minister George Abbot for a similar report after last year's record-setting fire season. I hope that report is more thoroughly acted on.</p><p>Thinning forests around communities would be a great opportunity for jobs and the local economy, while effectively fire-proofing neighbourhoods against wildfires. These projects require up-front government investments, but can be designed to recoup costs. Dealing with waste wood after logging is another area to act upon. There are more and more innovative ways to use this waste &amp;#8212; for value-added products such as pellets, paper and advanced chemicals &amp;#8212; instead of simply burning them as has been the case.</p><p>There are also the obvious long-term actions we need to take to reduce the extent and strength of global warming. These actions will not stop forest fires and floods in British Columbia right away &amp;#8212; but they are necessary so that Canada can do its part in global climate action. And while these must be long-term actions, we must start them now. We have to stop arguing about carbon pricing and simply do it. We've had a carbon tax in B.C. for nine years and we've reduced our emissions while leading the country with the strength of our economy.</p><p>Related: Cannings cycling through his riding for third year</p><p>The federal government can take bold actions on its own &amp;#8212; building significant electric vehicle infrastructure for instance. Once range anxiety is taken care of, Canadians will shift to electric vehicles that are much cheaper to fuel and maintain than gas-fueled cars. Buildings are the source of almost 40 per cent of our carbon emissions, and bringing back the very successful ecoENERGY Retrofit program would get us started on that front.</p><p>On another front, I'm cycling around the riding this week to meet constituents on the trails and in cafes and restaurants along the way. For a detailed itinerary of where you can meet me &amp;#8212; or cycle along &amp;#8212; go to my website at richardcannings.ndp.ca and scroll down for the itinerary link.</p><p>See you on the trail!</p><p>Richard Cannings is a member of the NDP and the South Okanagan-West Kootenay riding MP. Cannings is also the critic for post-secondary education and critic for natural resources.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PENNWS-3651300</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PENNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T55-SSP1-JDH3-G3Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438267</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Penticton Western News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 29, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>Business &amp;

Under the program, the Department of Highways and local authorities would make a list of needed road repairs. The new municipality would then do the renovations over an eight or 10 year period, with Highways paying 75 per cent of the cost. Possibly the province would pick up 75 per cent of the sinking fund for Clearwater's water system if the community incorporates.

Last week, strong winds blew smoke and ash over Red Deer, triggering several 911 calls to the fire department.</p><p>King said Friday that although the fire had not grown in size over the previous 24 hours, it was not contained within its perimetre and was still considered to be out of control.</p><p>Although no evacuations have been ordered, the fire as of Friday morning was within two kilometres of Mountain Aire Lodge, a wilderness resort near the junction of the Foresty Truck and Coal Camp roads, said King.</p><p>The lodge is now the base camp for more than 150 firefighters and their equipment, including six helicopters, 18 dozers, eight water trucks, four skidders, two backhoes, one nodwell and one airtanker group.</p><p>King said there have been no reports of injuries to firefighters or to any people with a need to be in the region. She added the fire boss in charge of fighting the blaze is working closely with area oil and gas industry officials worried about potential damage to their facilities. King said there are no reports of damage to any oil and gas structures.</p><p>Meanwhile, provincial fire officials now confirm that the origin of the massive fire was the result of an abandoned camp fire along the eastern Rocky Mountain slopes that was first reported to rangers on Sept. 29.</p><p>Earlier reports the fire was originally part of a controlled burn or prescribed fire were not true, said King.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Scott Van Seggelen, Red Deer Express; BLACK HAZE: Smoke from a forest fire south of Sundre was visible in Red Deer last Tuesday. ;</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LACEXP-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">REDDER2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4J9M-8X80-TX77-D2VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459603</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"349\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2001 Red Deer Express All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Red Deer Express (Alberta)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>October 21, 2001 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN6R</classCode><className>PUBLIC OFFICIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001240</classCode><className>OIL &amp; GAS INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Firefighters were able to beat back that fire with the help of some rain, and residents were allowed to return home.</p><p>Vonderporten said Saturday that there was no significant rain in the forecast and much would depend on what happens with the winds overnight.</p><p>''We're hoping winds will die down and we're hoping the forecast for slightly decreased winds will come true.''</p><p>Helicopters and air tankers were to attack the fire throughout the day Sunday, helping the 288 firefighters on the fire lines.</p><p>While residents on the west side of Okanagan Lake were forced to evacuate, 2,000 residents in the town of Lillooet, about 300 kilometres northwest, watched as fire advanced perilously close to their community.</p><p>The B.C. Forest Service said the Mount McLean fire, which began with a lightning strike more than one week ago, now spans more than 26 square kilometres.</p><p>The fire is classified as out of control and is just one kilometre away from Lillooet.</p><p>Still, residents of the tight-knit community said they're doing what they always do in times of turmoil.</p><p>''We've all pulled together no matter what, and it's been very encouraging,'' Jerry Sucharyna, information officer with the District of Lillooet, said Saturday in an interview.</p><p>''We've been down this road with previous fires. The community is very much behind the firefighters and doing everything in their power to co-operate.''</p><p>Isabelle Jacques, a fire information officer with the B.C. Forest Service, described the situation near Lillooet as ''critical.''</p><p>''It's still hot and dry. We did get a few drops of rain, but nothing significant for this fire,'' she said.</p><p>Sucharyna says anyone evacuated from Lillooet would be redirected to Kamloops, about 170 kilometres east.</p><p>''The first step is to notify the RCMP, who will deliver notices, as well as contact Lillooet radio so that announcements can be made,'' he said.</p><p>''And then the emergency operations centre will direct people in a civilized, organized fashion to prevent anybody from being left behind.''</p><p>Sucharyna said hospital staff are also standing by in case of any emergencies.</p><p>More than 60 firefighters and 15 helicopters spent much of Saturday trying to contain the Mount McLean blaze.</p><p>''What we're focusing on is building contingency lines around the fire,'' Jacques said.</p><p>''Helicopters are actioning hot spots on the fire. And the crews on the ground are focusing on building a fire-guard so the fire won't spread any further.''</p><p>The fire was estimated to be 22 square kilometres in size Friday night. Jacques said the increase is due to the fact that the B.C. Forest Service remapped the fire's perimeter to include areas that had intentionally been burned off.</p><p>Fire officials kept a nervous eye on the sky Saturday as thunderstorms, lightning and winds appeared in the forecast.</p><p>Jacques said some of those winds were present on Saturday afternoon, but they were pushing the fire back up the hill, as opposed to further down and towards Lillooet.</p><p>Meanwhile, a fire on Blackcomb Mountain in Whistler is now 50 per cent contained. Blackcomb Mountain will host bobsleigh, luge and skeleton events during the 2010 Olympics.</p><p>'The fire is still estimated at 30 hectares and crews estimate the fire will be 100 per cent contained within two to three days,'' the Resort Municipality of Whistler said in a written statement.</p><p>The Blackcomb fire was also caused by a lightning strike Thursday afternoon. About 375 staff and guests on the ski hills above Whistler village were forced to flee from Blackcomb and adjacent Whistler Mountain as a result.</p><p>B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell on Friday implored British Columbians to stay out of the backcountry as they celebrate the long weekend in order to prevent more forest fires.</p><p>Since April there have been more than 1,800 forest fires in the province, half of them human caused.</p><p>About 85 per cent of the province is at a high or extreme fire hazard level, and it has cost the province about $3 million a day to fight the current fires, many of them caused by human activity.</p><p>With files from Sunny Dhillon in Vancouver</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20090802CPCPG9808</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W94-SF80-Y9NS-W0P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>August 2, 2009 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOAM</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLYR</classCode><className>PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

One downside is that using multiple drones requires multiple human operators, which presents a coordination problem. </p><p>Researchers have a solution: brain control. The idea of controlling drones through thought processes comes from Arizona State University[1] (ASU). Researchers noted that controlling a single drone is a relatively straightforward task via devices like joysticks, radio controllers, and mobile phones. However, the use of multiple drones, for tasks like aerial photography and security patrols invariably creates coordination problems.The growth in human-brain interfaces has the potential to enable the seamless control a swarm of drones. This is the idea of Panos Artemiadis, director of the Human-Oriented Robotics and Control Lab at ASU. Such interfaces are a direct communication[2] pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device. In a related development, Elon Musk has recently launched Neuralink[3], which is a venture to merge the human brain with artificial intelligence.  Looking to the near-future, Professor Artemiadis highlights five areas[4] where brain-controlled drones can be applied. Search and Rescue Missions Artemiadis predicts that people will collaborate with aerial robots in search and rescue scenarios. A brain-robot interface would allow for control of many robots simultaneously allowing a large area to be covered in a short time in less time. Fire Fighting Drones equipped with infrared imaging equipment can track the spread of a forest fire in real time. This would allow emergency services to adjust their plans accordingly. In addition, drones could alert fire fighters to factors like a shift in wind direction. Agriculture Analysis Drones are already being put to good use in agriculture[5]; however teams of drones can oversee and analyze large agricultural fields to produce topographic maps for soil analysis and irrigation planning. Once seeds have been planted, drones can also spot for crop infections or infestations. Entertainment Drones can enhance the broadcasting of big events; for example a single person could operate a fleet of drones shooting images and videos at an outdoor concert or sports venue. Cyber-physical surveillance systems Advances with brain-drone interfaces could lead to the creation of cyber-physical surveillance systems that bring together human intuition and experience along with the sensing capabilities of multiple drones. The outcome would be a more efficient and accurate surveillance system than is currently possible.

The dramatic weather frequently knocks out power, leading some residents of storm-ridden or fire-prone areas to seek backup power options for their homes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In California, utilities are shutting off power proactively to help prevent forest fires on days when the risk is high, impacting millions of customers.</p><p>\"The electric system in the U.S. is 100 years old, so that system is struggling in light of extreme weather,\" said Audrey Lee, vice-president of energy services at Sunrun, which leases and sells solar energy systems.</p><p>Backup power options range from gasoline-powered portable generators, which can cost $1,000 or more, to solar panels plus batteries, which cost tens of thousands of dollars to purchase and install. Prices of solar panels and batteries have been coming down, making solar-plus-storage more attractive.</p><p>After Hurricane Maria, which destroyed much of Puerto Rico's electric grid in 2017 and left millions of residents of the island territory without power for months, many critical buildings such as hospitals and fire stations were outfitted with solar panels and batteries to better withstand the next major storm.</p><p>One resident in California's wine country, which has been scorched by deadly forest fires over the past few years, installed solar panels and two Tesla Powerwall batteries after a forest fire knocked out power to his new home for two days.</p><p>\"I told my wife, 'We can't do this,'\" said Justin Montague, 38, a sales professional. \"I wanted to make sure that when I'm at work my kids and my wife are safe.\"</p><p>PORTABLE GENERATORS</p><p>There are two types of generators: portable, which typically weigh about 200 pounds and can be wheeled outside for use, or stationary - known as standby generators - which are permanently installed.</p><p>Portable generators are the most popular option, accounting for about 95% of generator sales, and when a storm is reeling toward a community people flock to stores to buy them, according to Consumer Reports.</p><p>The upfront cost is more affordable than options such as standby generators or solar panels, but buying the vast quantities of gasoline needed to run a generator - and replacing that gasoline when it expires - adds up. They also require work to keep gasoline on hand and feed it into the generator.</p><p>\"If you have a generator running at full capacity, they can burn through close to a gallon an hour,\" said Paul Hope, senior home editor at Consumer Reports. The generator will continue supplying energy for as long as you have fuel on hand.</p><p>Portable generators must be operated outside, at least 20 feet away from a home with the exhaust facing away from the house, because they emit carbon monoxide, which can be deadly.</p><p>STANDBY GENERATORS</p><p>A more permanent - and costly - option is a standby generator, which is professionally installed outside a home and hooked up to a fuel source such as natural gas. Standby generators can be connected to a circuit breaker so a family can still run appliances that are hard-wired into a circuit breaker, such as a furnace or water heater. By contrast, a portable generator typically only works for appliances that are plugged into outlets, such as toasters or smartphone chargers.</p><p>Standby generators are best suited to people who live in areas where blackouts happen frequently and last a long time. Standby generators that are hooked up to a natural gas source could run indefinitely, as long as there is no disruption to the natural gas service. Other models that run on propane could power a home from 180 to 349 hours on a 275-gallon propane tank, Hope said.</p><p>\"They're much quieter, they turn on instantly, they're designed to power your entire house without any compromise,\" Hope said.</p><p>However, while a good portable generator can cost $1,000 or more, standby generators typically cost at least $2,000, and installation can cost $10,000 or more, Hope said.</p><p>SOLAR PANELS PLUS BATTERIES</p><p>Installing solar panels and batteries requires more investment than other forms of backup power, costing tens of thousands of dollars depending on system size, regional incentives and installation costs, but they can dramatically reduce electricity bills. Companies such as Sunrun and Vivint give customers the option to lease solar panels, requiring less upfront investment.</p><p>However, solar panels alone won't get you through a power outage. For that, you will need a battery. That's because solar panels are designed to switch off during a power outage to prevent them from sending electricity to power lines around the house, potentially electrocuting repair crews.</p><p>Adding a battery allows solar customers to continue drawing electricity from solar panels during a blackout because an internal switch prevents electricity from being transmitted to the wires around the house.</p><p>Battery installations have soared in California, Hawaii, Germany and Australia led by consumers interested in renewable energy or self-sufficiency, according to Navigant Research.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-56e0afbfe5ee41bdaf7d62f2cad787d3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X34-4TT1-DY9S-T0S6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><timeReceived>10:01 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 18, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

When it rained it really rained and then of course it would quit for a while and the sun would shine. Oh, well. It will soon be summertime, maybe it will turn around and be nice for a change, but the way it is right now there isn't too much of a forest fire hazard which saves a lot of our trees and in many cases our homes as well. We certainly don't want another repeat of the fire storm they had in Fort McMurray.</p><p>Winners for the day yesterday are as follows: MaryAnn Beck, 316; Greta Taylor, 293; and Willi Bretz, 289.</p><p>Hidden Score winner was Ken Molyneaux who didn't stay around to collect his winnings; I guess he figured his score was so low that he wouldn't be in the money. Oh well, we will give him the good news next Sunday.</p><p>Share the Wealth was shared by Robert Francis, Betty Cawley, Ray Burrows, Robert Walker, and Greta Taylor.</p><p>Call One went to Barb Frazer, who also won the door prize.</p><p>Be reminded that our next bus trip to Rama is July 3. This is a regular trip and leaves at the usual times: 4 p.m. from McKellar and 4:30 p.m. from Parry Sound Sobeys. There are no more special days as of yet to announce, but hopefully there will be something in the near future so keep checking our newsletters for any updates.</p><p>We hope everyone is doing well and enjoying life. To those of you who aren't we wish you all the best in health and happiness.</p><p>A mesmerizing quote from William Shakespeare: I always feel happy; you know why? Because I don't expect anything from anyone. Expectations always hurt, life is short, so love your life, be happy and keep smiling, just live for yourself. And before you speak, listen; before you write, think; before you spend, earn; before you pray, forgive; before you hurt, feel; before you hate, love; before you quit, try; and before you die, live.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2017062042792730</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NVM-DW51-JDH3-G0CP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Miranda Louie of the Nadleh Whut'en in central B.C. said the regional district has been communicating with Chief Larry Nooski by phone to let him know when it issues an evacuation order or alert, leaving band members scrambling at times to knock on doors and tell residents to get out.

One fire broke out at the Ministry of Transportation's weight scales around 1 p.m. A section of Highway 11 southbound had to be closed for several hours while it was being extinguished.</p><p>The two other wildfires near rail tracks were at Caroline Street and Winhara Road. The Winhara Road fire caused about $30,000 in damages, due to a nearby trailer home being engulfed in flames. At the time, nobody was living in it permanently.</p><p>CN is currently investigating the cause of these fires, along with the others off Aspdin Road in Huntsville and Stephenson Road 1 in Port Sydney that occurred a short time later.</p><p>Mayor Paisley Donaldson has launched inquiries to the rail company and said at District of Muskoka council, a claim is going to CN \"because it cost us substantial money to fight those fires.\"</p><p>At the Aspdin Road fire, a rail car carrying wooden railway tires was on fire and extinguished quickly. The rail car could have been responsible for the other spot fires in Muskoka, said Gravenhurst fire chief Larry Brassard.

We're going to assess those levels and compare to what we know are normal levels in a home in Canada.\"</p><p>Chan and his team are looking to analyze residual ash from the blaze that consumed 2,400 homes after it hit the city last May.</p><p>On July 10, Chan and two of his students will head to Fort McMurray and begin collecting samples from homes in the city and nearby Fort McKay First Nation, which wasn't hit by the fire, but winds blew ash its way.</p><p>Chan said he was initially hoping to take samples from 40 places, but residents of 220 homes said they'll open doors to the researchers.</p><p>\"We will try to go to as many places as we can,\" he said.</p><p>\"We will pick up a few samples at each place. We'll try to look at areas that are more accessed, like the living room floor, and then other places that are less frequently cleaned, like the tops of doors.\"</p><p>Chan, who has a background in atmospheric chemistry, first got the idea for the study when he read a news article roughly a month after the wildfire began about people preparing to return to their homes. It got him thinking about the long-term effects of the blaze.</p><p>When the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Alberta Innovates and the Canadian Red Cross put out a call for proposals to look at various health effects in the aftermath of the fire, Chan proposed his research, which won approval and funding from the group along with six other studies.</p><p>The other projects are looking at issues that range from the health effects of the blaze on first responders, to the mental health needs of children, to food safety.</p><p>Chan said his team will collect samples this summer, again in the fall and a final time next winter and will look to publish the results once their analysis is complete.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2017061442723299</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NSX-NCW1-F105-63FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"407\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Lt.-Col. James Garcia, a spokesman for the New Jersey Air National Guard, said the fire was believed to have been started Tuesday afternoon with a flare dropped from an F-16 fighter jet.</p><p>The same range was involved in 2004 when a National Guard jet accidentally strafed an elementary school with large-calibre rounds during a training exercise.</p><p>Firefighters worked overnight to create fire breaks along the Garden State Parkway in effort to contain the blaze, and state police said they would close a portion of the toll road if visibility became dangerously low. Bert Plante, a division fire warden with the forest fire service, said another 15 square kilometres could burn before the blaze is extinguished.</p><p>Showers and thunderstorms were forecast for Wednesday, but so were 32 kilometre an hour winds that could spread the flames.</p><p>Two other major fires were also burning in the United States on Wednesday.</p><p>Along the Florida-Georgia state line, firefighters were making progress against a blaze that had charred 1,000 square kilometres across the two states and forced hundreds of people to evacuate homes.</p><p>''Overnight, we had a good night,'' said Columbia County, Fla., spokesman Harvey Campbell. ''Winds were a threat on Monday and Tuesday, but today we are just expecting variable winds'' of less than 10 km/h.</p><p>In northern Minnesota, residents chased from their homes by a forest fire on the Gunflint Trail were told they would be allowed to return for brief visits starting Thursday. The fire has burned 300 square kilometres in Minnesota and into nortwestern Ontario, and many cabins and smaller structures have been destroyed.</p><p>But two days of wet, cool weather have helped firefighters get the blaze 55 per cent contained on the U.S. side and 20 per cent contained in Canada.</p><p>''I'm dreading to see the black,'' said Lorraine Carpenter, whose garage was lost but whose home on Sea Gull Lake survived when the fire burned through the surrounding forest. ''That is not going to be pretty.''</p><p>The people evacuated in southern New Jersey included residents of several retirement communities, patients from a nursing home and students from an outdoor survival school. Nearly 700 people were in shelters Wednesday morning, said Drew Lieb of the New Jersey State Police.</p><p>The fire destroyed three homes and 12 to 15 were heavily damaged in Ocean County, said Forest Fire Service assistant division warden Chris Irick.</p><p>Helen Sura, who evacuated a housing development in Barnegat, said she and her cat, aptly named Smoky, spent a sleepless night in her car in a Burger King parking lot.</p><p>''I didn't grab anything but the cat and myself, and we scrammed,'' she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20070516CPCPW8748</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4NRS-NH90-TX4V-K23H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>May 16, 2007 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

What you'll see is a very old-fashioned idea popularized by young people and new technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The gender reveal party-a soir\u00e9e typically thrown by expectant parents to \"reveal\" the gender (or to be accurate, the biological sex) of their baby to friends and family-is consistently in the news these days because it paints a picture of millennials that is very different from the one we are used to seeing. It paints a picture of young parents who don't reject outdated gender stereotypes but rather, who fervently embrace them.</p><p>C\u00e9line Dion may have recently launched a gender-neutral clothing label whose colours consist predominantly of grey and black, but all over YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest, people half her age are baking baby pink cupcakes to celebrate a girl in utero, and crocheting baby blue booties in honour of a boy on the way.</p><p>But these parties are also in the news because they tend to be tacky in the extreme and occasionally, dangerous. Last year an Arizona border patrol agent shot a rifle at a target containing tannerite, a highly explosive substance. The target was supposed to release a blue or pink dust upon impact-revealing the sex of the agent's future child. Instead the thing exploded, starting a forest fire that would scorch more than 45,000 acres and cost more than $8 million in damages.</p><p>Earlier this year, a Louisiana man dropped a jello-infused watermelon into the jaws of his pet alligator who immediately chomped down on the fruit causing it to ooze blue. Translation: It's a boy. Mazel tov.</p><p>This month, Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi, the most memorable star of the 2000s' reality TV show Jersey Shore, and ironically one of the least traditional people to ever grace the earth, threw her own bash in honour of traditional gender norms. Snooki, who is expecting her third child, video blogged her gender reveal party (complete with baby blue and baby pink decorated cannoli), an event at which her husband pitched her six-year-old son a novelty baseball that exploded into a plume of blue smoke when it hit his bat. Another boy. Mazel Tov.</p><p>Watch a few of these videos online and the reactions are almost always more enthusiastic-more joyous-when the reveal is a male one. I always look at the faces of the little girls in the crowd at these parties. What is going through their minds when they see all the men in their lives-fathers, brothers, uncles- pumping their fists in triumph through blue smoke and blue balloons? I'll never know, but I can't imagine that it will serve them well in the future.</p><p>Of course it makes sense that expectant parents want to learn as much as they can about their future kids, and biological sex is one of the only things we are able to learn about a baby before it's born. I can imagine the urge is very strong to know this and more critically, to celebrate it. But I also come from a culture that doesn't typically even do baby showers on account of superstition. And I maintain (even though I've attended several) that any party-shower or gender reveal-that occurs before a baby's birth is a little weird.</p><p>It just seems wise, in my mind, to wait until your kid enters the world before you start amassing a bunch of stuff in their name. Gender reveal parties are not all that different from baby showers, except that the parents who throw them don't amass material things. They amass presumptions. They presume to know something about their kids they can't possibly know. Blue and pink aren't just different colours. Even now, they're different worlds. Even now blue world trumps pink world.</p><p>Everyone learns this eventually. But I'm going to guess that kids whose parents assign so much importance to biological sex they are willing to explode small objects in the backyard, learn this sooner than they should.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2018121448850627</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYS-NF11-F103-31SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"656\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Daily News Group Inc.

Just looking forward to summers in the Okanagan now, it brings with it that sense of realization this is what it's going to be like when the fires and smoke arrive.</p><p>Related: Telehealth line set up for B.C. to help people feeling anxiety, depression, stress</p><p>\"It can sometimes feel very unrelenting.\"</p><p>Swoboda recommends that one key to to help reduce the mental health blues is to maintain your regular daily life routine.</p><p>\"Your time can be very challenged in a fire situation where the basics such as getting a proper amount of sleep or eating properly can be compromised. Retaining some normalcy in or leading up to a possible crisis can help reduce the level of stress,\" she said.</p><p>Given that crisis in forest fire season often equates to evacuating your home, Swoboda suggests also being prepared to flee for safety at a moment's notice.</p><p>Related: Columnist recants his own flashbacks at Mother Nature's fury</p><p>\"Plan ahead of time. Think about your pets, personal papers, photos that are important to you. Dealing with all that in the moment is very hard to do because you often don't often have much time to gather your things and leave,\" she said.</p><p>Swoboda adds that social connections, talking to friends and neighbours, reaching out to assist others who are vulnerable or isolated, can help off-set your own sense of worry and concern.</p><p>\"It's normal to feel stressed and worried, and it can be traumatic if a fire directly has an impact on you. But if you start to notice those feelings start to extend week after week, feeling anxious and fearful, having trouble sleeping or eating properly, hard to focus on taking care of yourself or others, than you might need to reach out for help and support,\" she said.</p><p>To report a typo, email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:edit@kelownacapnews.com\">edit@kelownacapnews.com</email></p><p>@<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:BarryGerdingbarry.gerding@blackpress.caLike\">BarryGerdingbarry.gerding@blackpress.caLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECC-3642573</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T20-87W1-JDH3-G06B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438265</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Lake Country Calendar (Winfield)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 14, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Hundreds of homes were destroyed, and hundreds of people took refuge on local beaches to escape the blaze. More than 180 people were injured.</p><p>Many survivors were forced to swim out to sea to escape the intensity of the fire and smoke, where they spent hours before being rescued by coast guard and private boats. Some drowned.</p><p>A judicial investigation into the fire is underway.</p><p>___</p><p>1 p.m.</p><p>An insect expert in Finland says the exceptionally hot summer has taken its toll on the Nordic country's mosquito population and they have all but vanished from some areas, particularly so in the Lapland area in the Arctic north.</p><p>Dr. Jukka Salmela from the Provincial Museum of Lapland told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the typical breeding grounds for mosquitoes such as shallow ponds and other damp areas have dried up in the heat wave, resulting in fewer of them flying around.</p><p>Finland has experienced one of its hottest and driest summers on record with no rain in weeks and temperatures reaching up to 33 C (91 F) in several places. Over a third of the country's surface extends above the Arctic Circle where high temperatures have been recorded as well.</p><p>Salmela said the disappearance of the blood-sucking insects, seen by most people as a major nuisance, has made it more pleasant to visit Lapland which is notorious for mosquito infestations from late June until August.</p><p>Salmela said that around 40 different mosquito types exist in Finland.</p><p>___</p><p>10:55 a.m.</p><p>A county near Norway's capital has beaten a 71-year-old record of consecutive days with temperatures above 25 C (77 F).</p><p>Norway's meteorological institute says the previous record for Buskerud county, west of Oslo, was 62 days in row in 1947. The record was beaten on Monday, and Wednesday marked the 65th straight day of temperatures above 25 C.</p><p>The Nordic countries have had unusually hot weather in the past few weeks with Sweden seeing dozens of wildfires, mostly in the central, western and northern parts of the country. The fires have died down, but authorities remain vigilant.</p><p>The institute said Wednesday that the first nightly temperatures below freezing have been recorded in Cuovddatmohkki, in the Arctic Finnmark county, near the border with Russia.

(CP) - A feared cold front that was supposed to pack winds gusting to 85 kilometres an hour passed harmlessly over this half-evacuated southern B.C. city without pushing a nearby forest fire into town.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The front came later and proved weaker than forecast, forestalling a repeat of last Wednesday's conflagration that destroyed 16 homes and damaged 25 other buildings in Salmon Arm's rural outskirts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">-BODY- About 8,000 people, almost half the city's population, were ordered to flee the most threatened districts Sunday after B.C. Premier Glen Clark declared a state of emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clark credited residents' calm for the smoothness of the evacuation and praised the professionalism of emergency workers and firefighters.</p><p>Forests Ministry fire managers have been criticized by some residents who say the crisis could have been avoided if the blaze had been attacked more aggressively in its early days.</p><p>Clark backed his managers but reiterated the operation would be subject to an independent review.</p><p>While evacuees went to friends, relatives or emergency shelters in neighboring communities, a force of 300 firefighters, backed by 100 soldiers, prepared to face the expected onslaught.</p><p>It never came.</p><p>The front moved through early Monday evening and the winds hardly rustled leaves.</p><p>\"The wind stayed at upper levels,'' said Mitzi Bushell, a B.C. Forest Service fire information officer.</p><p>Weather forecasters now predict a high-pressure ridge will rebuild over the region for the next few days.</p><p>\"That will bring hot, dry weather and winds will be fairly light,'' Bushell said.</p><p>\"We're cautiously optimistic at this point.''</p><p>Crews using heavy machinery as well as shovels and axes have completed guards around the fire, removing potential fuel sources. They spent Monday dealing with flareups within the fire's perimeter, which expanded its area to 5,000 hectares.</p><p>A hectare is about the size of a football field.</p><p>Containing the fire within guards, however, is not the same as declaring it under control, Bushell stressed.</p><p>\"It'll be weeks before it is under control,'' she said. \"We definitely need some rain, some measureable amount of rain, before it can be considered under control.''</p><p>Although the threat has slackened, officials are not letting their guard down.</p><p>The evacuation alert declared Sunday for all of Salmon Arm remained in effect and those who have left are not being allowed back for the time being.</p><p>Only about 3,400 people had registered at emergency centres in cities such as Vernon and Kamloops, said Doug Diamond, manager of Salmon Arm's emergency planning command centre.</p><p>\"People are still trying to establish themselves and going through the backlog,'' he said. \"There's a tremendous amount of pressure on the centres.''</p><p>The evacuation made it easier for firefighters facing the blaze, knowing they would not have to contend with a crush of last-minute refugees if they had to fight the fire in town.</p><p>\"It's a relief for me,'' city fire chief Ken Tebo said.</p><p>If the rest of the city was forced to evacuate, \"to move them out in a very short time is just about impossible.''</p><p>Most residents in the affected area left between late Sunday and early Monday, leaving Salmon Arm a veritable ghost town.</p><p>Shops and restaurants were closed, leaving remaining tourists in the lakeside city with little to do.</p><p>But possibly hundreds of people chose to stay, at least until the danger was more imminent.</p><p>\"If it was up to me, I wouldn't leave,'' said Bob Kline as he checked under the hood of his pickup truck. \"The wife wants to leave. There is no wind right now, eh.''</p><p>Others planned to defy both the flames and police, who have the power to force them out if they impede firefighters.</p><p>Since the fire first took off, farmer Rick Hyam has politely turned aside firefighters' daily requests to leave his family's 105-year-old homestead.</p><p>He and his brother-in-law worked 12 hours a day putting out spot fires caused by embers blowing across the valley from the heart of the blaze.</p><p>When would he leave?</p><p>\"When my house is on fire. Then there's no sense staying any more.''</p><p>Standing in the fire's way - an army of firefighters, backed by soldiers, a fleet of water-bombing helicopters and planes and dozens of pieces of heavy equipment, including 40 fire trucks from across British Columbia.</p><p>It was a baptism of fire for Charlie Company of the 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Regiment, who after a day of training helped deal with flareups and mopped up hot spots.</p><p>Some of the soldiers had fought fires before in Alberta and New Brunswick, while others were learning, said unit commander Maj. David Anderson.</p><p>He said his men, used to dangerous missions, were relishing the fire fight, but he didn't underestimate this enemy.</p><p>\"Right now it's a series of small battles and I don't think there's been a major battle yet,'' said Anderson.</p><p>\"I definitely think we're winning winning the war and we haven't lost a small battle yet when it comes to the fire.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199808110015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4701-3B40-01G6-8558-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>August 11, 1998 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>AB C COMMUNICATIONS CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000971D</classCode><className>POPULATION SIZE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009WM9</classCode><className>THREATENED &amp; SENSITIVE SPECIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000506</classCode><className>DISASTER PLANNING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N624230MM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SHELTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLYR</classCode><className>PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DFTB</classCode><className>STATES OF EMERGENCY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Laurel Scott.</p><p>All four people in the second vehicle were killed.</p><p>Two of the Americans in the van died at the scene and two other members of the family were badly injured. Scott said a two-year-old in the van was not hurt.</p><p>\"Miraculously, a young toddler survived with no injuries,\" she said Wednesday.</p><p>CTV News said the dead included Angela Elkins of Louisiana and her son-in-law, Nick Copeland of Texas. Elkins' husband, Curtis, and daughter, Sarah, were taken to Edmonton hospitals in serious condition.</p><p>Scott said a third vehicle drove off the road to avoid the wreck and two people in that car suffered minor injuries.</p><p>Several passing motorists stopped to pull people out of the vehicles, she said, including a retired firefighter from Australia.</p><p>Gagan Sidhu of Surrey, B.C., was travelling the highway with his wife and daughter when they saw black smoke and figured it was a forest fire. As they got closer and saw the burning wreckage of two vehicles, he got out to help.</p><p>Some people were doing CPR, others were offering survivors juice and blankets, he said. Two men who were injured died as he was at the scene.</p><p>Sidhu was handed a fire extinguisher and, with the help of a few others, put out flames that were spreading from the vehicles through grass toward some trees.</p><p>\"People really gave their all ... to help out,\" he said.</p><p>RCMP Sgt. Rick Bidaisee in Jasper thanked everyone who pitched in.</p><p>\"Members of the public were enormously helpful in saving lives and helping everyone they could,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>The Icefields Parkway, officially Highway 93 North, is a popular tourist route, especially in the summer, for those travelling between the resort communities of Jasper and Lake Louise. Winding through the Rocky Mountains, the road passes by glaciers, waterfalls and turquoise lakes.</p><p>Rob Jeffrey of Halifax was heading to Jasper with his wife and three young children Tuesday when Mounties closed the section of the highway to investigate the crash.</p><p>While other motorists pulled out tents to settle in for the night, he and his family tried to catch some sleep in their rented minivan.</p><p>The highway opened again around 6 a.m., said Jeffrey, and as they drove by the crash site there was nothing left to see but burn marks on the road.</p><p>RCMP could not provide medical updates on the two Americans taken to hospital.</p><p>STARS air ambulance service said a 26-year-old woman was flown to Edmonton in critical condition. Alberta Health Services said another woman was taken to Jasper hospital in stable condition.</p><p>Crashes on Alberta highways have claimed six other lives in recent days.</p><p>Three people were killed Sunday, including a five-year-old, after a truck and an SUV vehicle collided head on near Sylvan Lake, south of Edmonton. And early Tuesday, three people died when a car and SUV crashed near the community of Priddis, southwest of Calgary.</p><p>- By Chris Purdy in Edmonton</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-d991391ffe1149f683e18b9ed61c66a6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T0J-0N81-JBVR-33H9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><timeReceived>10:36 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 8, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And they should.\"</p><p>Quealey said the staff who man the stations in B.C. 24/7 are volunteers who undergo hundreds of hours of training and service to the public. They also undertake fundraising to buy the equipment they need to do their job.</p><p>RCMSAR standard is to react to any situation within 30 minutes of a call for help.</p><p>READ MORE: Sooke search and rescue station under scrutiny after crash</p><p>To drive the point home, Black Press was invited to tour the specialized equipment at the training facility at RCMSAR headquarters in East Sooke, located on the shoreline in what was once a Roman Catholic church retreat.</p><p>\"We have a marine simulator here that's one of the few in Canada. It's a training platform that allows us to safely train our future coxswains and other volunteers to the highest level possible,\" Quealey said.</p><p>\"The candidates who come here for training give up several days of their time and live here on the site. They miss work and are away from their families, just to qualify for the certification that will allow them to volunteer even more time out on the water.\"</p><p>Francois Michaud, the marine simulator trainer, said a key part of the training involves the simulator.</p><p>\"We use this simulator to practice all kinds of scenarios to ensure that, if mistakes are made, they are made on the simulator and not out on the water,\" Michaud said.</p><p>\"There are cameras inside the simulator as well, so that instructors in the control area can track, not just the actions of the crew, but the facial expressions and reactions to the stress of the situation.\"</p><p>The simulator technology can reproduce any maritime area in any conditions and are designed to test the volunteer's knowledge and judgment in a variety of scenarios.</p><p>Quealey also highlighted the partnerships the RCMSAR service has forged across the province.</p><p>\"Beyond the relationship, we have with the Canadian Coast Guard, the Royal Canadian Air Force, local fire departments and the RCMP, we are always renewing and establishing new partnerships and relationships,\" he said.</p><p>\"We recently signed an MOU (memorandum of understanding) with the Red Cross so that, even in incidents not maritime based, we can provide support in incident command.\"</p><p>A similar arrangement in the past has allowed RCMSAR to provide command support in forest fire emergencies.</p><p>Quealey pointed to another initiative where his service is involving Indigenous communities along the B.C. coast to forge partnerships and assist in training.</p><p>\"This is a real two-way street, actually.

Africa likely witnessed its hottest temperature ever in early July - 51.3 C (124 Fahrenheit) in Algeria. All-time heat records were also set in Montreal, California, New Hampshire, Armenia, south Russia and Tbilisi, Georgia. Spain may sweat through its hottest day ever this weekend.</p><p>And as nature turned up the thermostat, forests burned uncontrollably- in Ontario, California and, most tragically, Greece where 91 people died in wildfires.</p><p>In the face of what might seriously be called a \"Global Warmaggedon,\" climate-change skeptics will argue it always gets hot in summertime, that there are always forest fires and that climate patterns shift over the centuries without any human involvement.</p><p>Sorry. That doesn't explain what's unfolding now. Intense, potentially lethal summer temperatures are more widespread than before. More wildfires are burning than in a typical year. And you know things are positively weird when vegetation north of the Arctic Circle catches flames and scientists say they've never seen a heat wave so far north.</p><p>The link between human-driven climate change and this long, hot summer which is only half-way over is, according to climate scientists, clear and definite.</p><p>In the words of one of the world's foremost climate scientists, Penn State University's Michael Mann, \"This is the face of climate change.\"</p><p>To be sure it is imprecise to say climate change caused a specific heat wave or forest fire. According to scientists like Mann, however, climate change has created the conditions that allow these extreme events, and make them happen more often.</p><p>Jet-steam patterns have been crazily altered, allowing hot air masses to move where they normally wouldn't. Warmer springs encourage vegetation growth, while heat and drought dries out that vegetation, fueling more wildfires.</p><p>Of course, if the experts are correct, the world has just started to feel the impact of climate change. The good news is we know what must be done to avert its catastrophic consequences - slash the greenhouse gas emissions that come from, among other human activities, burning fossil fuels.</p><p>The bad news is we're not doing what we must. Under the misguidance of President Donald Trump, the United States pulled out of the Paris agreement on climate change.</p><p>In Canada, many provincial governments, including Ontario, are resisting the federal government's push for putting a price on carbon emissions in order to reduce them.</p><p>Indeed this week, perhaps buckling under pressure from some provinces as well as the business community, the federal Liberals scaled back their demands for taxing carbon emissions.</p><p>We know that politicians walk a precarious tightrope as they balance economic and environmental imperatives. But we have to do better. Here in Ontario, where the new Progressive Conservative government has scrapped an earlier initiative to reduce carbon emissions, there is no discernible provincial plan to fight climate change. That's unacceptable.</p><p>Billions of people in the Northern Hemisphere have been feeling the heat this summer. It's time the politicians responsible for dealing with climate change did, too.</p><p>Factbox:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-08/03/201847031756</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SYD-HRN1-F105-6552-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"630\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

A lot of people were evacuating, there was lots of smoke...There was lots of traffic moving in the other direction and it reminded me of our experience in 2011.\"</p><p>He said the devastation and evacuation were similar to what played out around Slave Lake, noting that they were trying to move 10,000 people out of his community rather than the 80,000 or so being evacuated from Fort McMurray.</p><p>Warman, who was in the fire department and a member of the Slave Lake council in 2011, said thick, black smoke filled the air in Fort McMurray as flames crept close to the roadways. He said he and others were heading out again Wednesday to help fight the fire after getting a couple of hours of sleep.</p><p>Lesser Slave River Reeve Murray Kerik, who also fought the Slave Lake fire, said he was heart sick when he turned on the TV and saw how a fire he had been monitoring for a couple of days in Fort McMurray had turned so dangerous, so quickly. He said it played out much like it did in Slave Lake, which had the added difficulty of flames that were whipped by 100-kilometre-an-hour winds.</p><p>\"Watching it on TV, we could really feel for them because we've been there,\" he said from his home in Slave Lake. \"It just makes my stomach turn. I've been there, I've seen this.\"</p><p>Kerik says he went three days without sleep while fighting the fire in Slave Lake.</p><p>On Tuesday, when he saw the flames inching closer to Fort McMurray, he immediately thought: \"Here we go again.\"</p><p>In the end, some estimates pegged the damage in Slave Lake at up to $1 billion, which insurance adjusters estimated at the time made it the second-costliest disaster after the Quebec-Ontario ice storm of 1998. It was later determined that the an arsonist recklessly or deliberately ignited the forest fire that reduced a third of Slave Lake to rubble.</p><p>No civilians were hurt, but a fire-fighting helicopter pilot died after crashing on Lesser Slave Lake. About 1,400 firefighters along with 170 helicopters and tankers were deployed to Slave Lake, which is about 430 kilometres away from Fort McMurray.</p><p>A subsequent report into the disaster found Alberta's forest fire danger had grown to the point where it was beginning to outstrip the province's ability to respond. It said the fires moved faster than officials were able to communicate with each other or the people of Slave Lake. As a result, residents weren't told about how quickly the danger to themselves and their community was escalating.</p><p>Some residents complained that they were forced to turn back into the inferno when they tried to leave town because they found that roads had been closed.</p><p>Kerik says it's too soon to say what may be learned form the fire in Fort McMurray, but that it appears they did well to get people out of the city quickly. He said a fire smart program has helped educate residents about risks, particularly when it comes to removing timber from near their homes to reduce it as a fuel source.</p><p>He said part of the problem in Fort McMurray may be the presence of black spruce trees, which he described as a low-lying swamp tree that can get extremely hot and be quite flammable. Kerik said they have tried to remove much of it from around Slave Lake.</p><p>Asked what he would tell the residents of Fort McMurray, Kerik referred to a sign that went up in Slave Lake after the blaze that read, \"God bless, we will rebuild.\"</p><p>\"And they will rebuild, it's just a matter of sticking to it,\" he said.</p><p>Warman also said it's too early to say whether lessons from the Slave Lake incident apply to this latest disaster.</p><p>\"There will be lots of lessons learned here and some of them will be ones that we'd experienced before and some will be new,\" he said.</p><p>\"We just feel very fortunate that we are able to come up here and lend a hand and pay some of that back, but we also recognize there's a long road ahead and it will take a while to get Fort McMurray back on its feet.\"</p><p>Follow @alison_auld on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-bd7569c58dcb40dbb0c7c4474221852b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JP6-2TX1-DY9S-T37T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><timeReceived>12:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 4, 2016 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Many survivors spent hours in the water until they were rescued by the coast guard, fishing boats and other boats. Several drowned.</p><p>Coroner Ilias Bogiokas said the wildfire was so hot that \"there was almost nothing left\" of many of the bodies.</p><p>\"For the bodies to be in this state, with full carbonization and with parts often turned to ashes ... the temperatures must have been very high in a very short period of time,\" he told The Associated Press. \"Whatever happened, happened in minutes.\"</p><p>One more woman died Friday of her wounds from the Mati wildfire, yet 11 days after the fire the exact death toll was still unclear, with figures diverging between coroners and the fire department.</p><p>On July 27, coroners announced they had performed autopsies on the remains of 86 people. In addition, one more person died that day in a hospital and another woman died in hospital on Friday. On July 30, coast guard divers recovered the body of a man from the sea off the coast of the decimated resort area, which would bring the number of dead to 89.</p><p>The fire service, however, which has been issuing the official death toll, put the number of dead Friday night at 88, including two unidentified, unclaimed bodies and five people who died in hospitals.</p><p>Neither the coroners' office nor the fire department could explain the discrepancy.</p><p>Greek state ERT TV said the woman who died Friday was the 35-year-old mother of a six-month-old baby that died in the fire and the wife of a fireman who fought the blaze.</p><p>____</p><p>Nicholas Paphitis contributed to this story.

A senior government official says the U.S. and Mexico's return to the table to sort out their differences is a positive sign for the future of NAFTA, even if Canada wasn't invited to take part. Top Canadian negotiators are expected to rejoin NAFTA talks by mid-August.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">---</p><p>ONTARIO FOREST FIRE DISPLACES RESIDENTS</p><p>Several residents have evacuated their homes as a raging fire known as Parry Sound 33 burns in northeastern Ontario. The blaze began on July 18 and has now burned more than 100 square kilometres. Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources says the blaze is just five kilometres from the Trans-Canada Highway and will likely spread in the next days. More than 500 firefighters are battling the fire, including more than 200 from Mexico.</p><p>---</p><p>OTTAWA KEEPING EYE ON U.S. 3D GUN DEBATE</p><p>Public Safety Canada says it Is closely monitoring U.S. moves to allow designs for 3D-printed guns to be posted online, but there are rules already in place to prevent unauthorized weapons from being made. The federal department says regardless of how they are made, all firearms are subject to the Firearms Act, the Criminal Code and associated regulations. Downloadable gun blueprints were expected to be posted online today, but a federal judge in Seattle has issued a temporary restraining order to stop the release of the blueprints.</p><p>---</p><p>CUPE TO REPRESENT WESTJET CABIN CREWS</p><p>WestJet says the Canada Industrial Relations Board has issued an interim order to allow the Canadian Union of Public Employees to represent cabin crew members. The union had filed an application on July 10th to represent the flight attendants after a majority signed cards stating they supported joining CUPE. The airline said it now has until Aug. 10 to make submissions on which positions to exclude from the bargaining unit.</p><p>---</p><p>THREE DEAD IN CALGARY; SUSPECT ARRESTED</p><p>Calgary police have a suspect in custody after finding three people dead at two different homes in the city. Police found a woman dead at a home in the city's southwest, then found the body of a woman and a man at a home in the northeast. Police say the deaths appear to be related, but don't yet know if any of the people knew each other.</p><p>---</p><p>COURT JUDGES DO CRY, LAW PROFESSOR SAYS</p><p>A legal expert is arguing that judges shouldn't be expected to be emotionless robots, after a defence lawyer questioned a British Columbia judge's ability to deliver a fair sentence because she cried during a victim impact statement. Defence lawyer Jacqueline Halliburn has asked provincial court Judge Monica McParland to recuse herself from the Kelowna courtroom because of what she argued was an \"overall tone of bias\" in a sexual interference case. </p><p>---</p><p>ALSO IN THE NEWS TODAY:</p><p>- Companies reporting results today include Domtar, TorStar, Encana, Molson Coors and Restaurant Brands International,</p><p>- Syncrude Canada to appear in court on charges related to the deaths of blue herons at one of its mines in 2015.</p><p>- An announcement will be made regarding Alberta hunting regulations.</p><p>- Status of Women Minister Maryam Monsef will make a funding announcement in Yellowknife related to the economic security and prosperity of Indigenous women in the north.</p><p>- The Toronto International Film Festival will announce its Canadian lineup.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-c58854bacf0d43edbc7356f020e9ce5f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXV-6X41-DY9S-T08V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"590\"/><timeReceived>07:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 1, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Africa likely witnessed its hottest temperature ever in early July - 51.3 C (124 Fahrenheit) in Algeria. All-time heat records were also set in Montreal, California, New Hampshire, Armenia, south Russia and Tbilisi, Georgia. Spain may sweat through its hottest day ever this weekend.</p><p>And as nature turned up the thermostat, forests burned uncontrollably - in Ontario, California and, most tragically, Greece where 91 people died in wildfires.</p><p>In the face of what might seriously be called a \"Global Warmaggedon,\" climate-change skeptics will argue it always gets hot in summertime, that there are always forest fires and that climate patterns shift over the centuries without any human involvement.</p><p>Sorry. That doesn't explain what's unfolding now. Intense, potentially lethal summer temperatures are more widespread than before. More wildfires are burning than in a typical year. And you know things are positively weird when vegetation north of the Arctic Circle catches flames and scientists say they've never seen a heat wave so far north.</p><p>The link between human-driven climate change and this long, hot summer which is only halfway over is, according to climate scientists, clear and definite.</p><p>In the words of one of the world's foremost climate scientists, Penn State University's Michael Mann, \"This is the face of climate change.\"</p><p>To be sure it is imprecise to say climate change caused a specific heat wave or forest fire. According to scientists like Mann, however, climate change has created the conditions that allow these extreme events, and make them happen more often.</p><p>Jet-steam patterns have been crazily altered, allowing hot air masses to move where they normally wouldn't. Warmer springs encourage vegetation growth, while heat and drought dries out that vegetation, fuelling more wildfires.</p><p>Of course, if the experts are correct, the world has just started to feel the impact of climate change. The good news is we know what must be done to avert its catastrophic consequences - slash the greenhouse gas emissions that come from, among other human activities, burning fossil fuels.</p><p>The bad news is we're not doing what we must. Under the misguidance of President Donald Trump, the United States pulled out of the Paris agreement on climate change.</p><p>In Canada, many provincial governments, including Ontario, are resisting the federal government's push for putting a price on carbon emissions in order to reduce them.</p><p>Indeed this week, perhaps buckling under pressure from some provinces as well as the business community, the federal Liberals scaled back their demands for taxing carbon emissions.</p><p>We know that politicians walk a precarious tightrope as they balance economic and environmental imperatives. But we have to do better. Here in Ontario, where the new Progressive Conservative government has scrapped an earlier initiative to reduce carbon emissions, there is no discernible provincial plan to fight climate change. That's unacceptable.</p><p>Billions of people in the Northern Hemisphere have been feeling the heat this summer. It's time the politicians responsible for dealing with climate change did, too.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-08/03/201847032101</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SYD-HRN1-F105-655J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"629\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

A database maintained by the Centre for the Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels shows it as the deadliest wildfire in Europe since 1900.</p><p>The vast majority of victims died in the fire itself, though a number drowned in the sea while fleeing the flames. Until Sunday night, Greek officials had not provided a tally of the people reported missing.</p><p>Hellenic Fire Service spokeswoman Stavroula Malliri provided a breakdown that illustrated why the death toll continued to expand and the list of people thought to be missing was difficult to draw up with precision.</p><p>Malliri said that as of Sunday evening, 59 victims had been identified from bodies or remains and another four people injured in the fire had died in area hospitals. But identities have not yet been linked to another 28 sets of remains, she said.</p><p>Relatives or friends reported 25 people who were considered officially missing, Malliri said.</p><p>A fire service official said some or all of the 25 missing people could be among the yet-unidentified remains of the dead. The official requested anonymity because the fire still is under investigation.</p><p>At the morning memorial service in Mati, the senior local Greek Orthodox Church official, Bishop Kyrillos, said the community was grieving the simultaneous loss of family, neighbours and friends.</p><p>\"There's fewer of us now than usually,\" the bishop said. \"It is the victims of the recent fire that are missing - friends, relatives and acquaintances, next-door people that we saw every day in town and on the beach.\"</p><p>Local resident Angeliki Galiatsatou said she narrowly managed to escape the fire that killed others in their cars and homes.</p><p>\"I came to pray for the people who were lost and I pray that God blesses us all,\" she said.</p><p>Dozens of volunteer divers, some of them retired Navy Seals, ventured into the sea again Sunday to look for the bodies of more possible victims. The search was abandoned, without result, because of a sudden storm.</p><p>Greek authorities have said they have reason to believe the fire resulted from arson and turned so deadly because winds of up to 100 kilometres per hour (62 mph) buffeted the pine-forested seaside resorts at the time.</p><p>The Greek government also has come under criticism for how buildings and roads were laid out in the area and an alleged lack of adequate preparation for fire season. More than 2,000 homes were damaged in the fire and roughly a quarter will have to be demolished, Greek officials said Friday.</p><p>The Holy Synod made up of all Greek bishops said in a letter read out loud at Sunday's memorial service that everyone bears responsibility for protecting the environment from haphazard development.</p><p>\"What words of comfort can you offer the person who has lost their father, their mother, the grandparents in whose arms their grandchildren were found?\" Kyrillos said. \"What words of solace can you offer a mother who has lost her baby and left a few flowers on the beach?\"</p><p>___</p><p>Nellas reported from Athens.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Costas Kantouris on Twitter: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/CostasKantouris\">https://twitter.com/CostasKantouris</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e4391bcaefda4cf0901cbd3be3f89847</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SX6-8D11-JBVR-34NW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"602\"/><timeReceived>10:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 29, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The model evaluates existing wildfire datapoints and feeds into an ad hoc trading platform which key stakeholders can use to option the right amount of services and supplies in the most cost-effective manner. The project aims to bring together local governments, insurers and medical supplies providers to collaborate and plan proactively for optimal disaster management. Available in June 2020, the platform is the first in a series of analytics tools that the Schulich School of Business and Exigent will develop to deliver on their core focus:\u00a0turning data into actionable business intelligence and community-centric analytics products.</p><p>The collaboration is part of the Masters in Business Analytics Program (MBAN) at Schulich. Students are working alongside Exigent's data and business analysts to build a model that identifies the environmental, social and economic impact of wildfires in Canada, and subsequently the United States. Artificial intelligence is at the core of the team's efforts to create their predictive tool, which will absorb and structure data, find and evaluate patterns, calculate impact and feed into a bespoke analytics tool.</p><p>The Exigent-Schulich project aims to predict with a high degree of accuracy the supplies and services needed for effective disaster response, for example, the number of medical supplies or number of medical professionals needed in the event of a wildfire in a specific area with particular weather patterns. The highly reliable predictive models feed data into a shared trading platform, where stakeholders can opt to acquire supplies at the best time with regard to price and preparedness. The predictive analytics model, coupled with the trading platform, will allow insurance companies to calculate the best premium, suppliers to accurately forecast medical supplies and local authorities to purchase the right amount of supplies at the best price. Should the disaster not strike a particular province or state, options can be then traded to those affected.\u00a0 The option structure will keep prices low and incentivize suppliers to build inventory.</p><p>Based on data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, more than 6,000 fires occur (on average) each year and destroy over 2.7 million hectares (6.7 million acres) of land. in 2018, in the Province of Ontario alone, the Canadian government spent $212 million in combating forest fires. \u00a0The infamous 2016 fire that burned much of Fort McMurray in northern Alberta\u00a0cost insurance companies $3.58 billion. On the other side of the border, fires in the US burnt a massive 3.5 million hectare (8.8 million acres) in 2018, with the California Department of Insurance stating\u00a0that, as of April 2019, insurance claims from the Camp, Hill and Woolsey Fires in November 2018 have exceeded $12 billion. The Exigent trading platform is estimated to cut costs by 20% and drive down premiums. More importantly, having an inventory of medical supplies available, and with improved predictive analytics, this tool also aims to reduce fire related injuries and resulting deaths, which have been rising in recent years.</p><p>\"The numbers are staggering and sadly we are reminded of the tragedy that wildfires cause more and more often, like in California just now, where entire communities face uncertainty and loss, both physical and emotional,\" said David Holme, CEO of Exigent. \"It's shocking that collectively we are not using the huge amount of data available to make a difference, both on a social and business level. With Schulich, we are trying to shift attitudes towards data and provide a tangible platform for change for all stakeholders involved. From our own experience as data evangelists in the legal industry and with corporations, we know that demonstrating how data can save money and lives in this case  is key to getting people on board. We are building a tool that gives incontrovertible proof of that.\"</p><p>Murat Kristal, Program Director of Schulich's MBAN Program and an Associate Professor of Operations Management &amp; Information Systems, added: \"We're very excited to give our students the opportunity to learn from industry leaders how to tangibly make a difference through data. Hands-on guidance from a company that handles global organizations' complex data across departments and turns it into bottom-line results is invaluable.\"</p><p>About ExigentExigent is a technology provider and consulting organization that is breaking industry boundaries and raising the bar for data-driven decision-making.

Now he says he has updated his data and created a variety of different ways of describing the risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The graph shown above is based on an analysis of the forest within ten kilometres of a city's limits. Blackwell used GIS and a provincial fuel type inventory to analyze risk.</p><p>\"Every forest cover polygon is converted into a fuel type and then we know how it will burn. We created a distribution of fuel types for that 10 kilometre area as a proportion of the total area.\"</p><p>Every fuel type is assigned a classification from high to no risk.</p><p>There are some smaller communities that are potentially at higher risk than Nelson but a fire would not affect as many people. Among Kootenay towns with fewer than 10,000 people, some, like Sparwood, Elkford and Fernie are in more danger than Nelson. See chart below.</p><p>\"These are different ways of expressing it and a different way of ranking, I mean you could rank it many different ways, by the number of historic fires (for example) but I think this is a measure of potential fire behaviour around specific communities and it emphasizes the need to get busy.\"</p><p>Get busy doing what?</p><p>Blackwell says we should not leave it up to the government. Blackwell does not discount the need for governments and industry to reduce fuel on Crown land, but he wants landowners to step up also.</p><p>Blackwell recommends a system of development permit areas so governments have the power to manage hazards on private land.</p><p>Related stories in the Nelson Star:</p><p>&amp;#8226; Action by Nelson area landowners key to wildfire safety, expert says</p><p>&amp;#8226; FireSmart assessment an eye-opener for Nelson homeowner</p><p>&amp;#8226; Nelson area wildfire protection plan presented</p><p>About 14 per cent of the land within 10 kilometres of Nelson is privately owned, and governments have no power to make a private landowner do anything to prevent wildfire. But those landowners should look at the safety of their building materials, Blackwell says.</p><p>\"We have many people who want to live next to the forest but they are not hardening their structures, so they are vulnerable to fire. People need to focus on how they build their homes.</p><p>\"If everyone in the Kootenays that had a wood roof changed it, or (built with) roofing that is not vulnerable, they would have an 85 per cent chance of surviving an interface fire. A lot of people don't get that.\"</p><p>He said this is an important part of the FireSmart principles that municipalities and regional districts are attempting, with less than satisfactory engagement, to promote among homeowners. The principles are not just about the building envelopes but also about nearby combustibles, surface vegetation, ladder fuels, forest overstorey, and setback from the edge of slopes, all of which private landowners can control.</p><p>\"People think the forest service is going to come and save them when there is a bad forest fire. And they should be thinking about saving themselves. This is not to say the forest service is not doing anything. But last year in BC was a classic example: the resources we had were overwhelmed with fire and you can throw half a billion at it and look what happened.\"</p><p>Related stories in the Nelson Star:</p><p>&amp;#8226; Nelson conference will explore climate change and wildfire</p><p>&amp;#8226; RDCK plans wildfire fuel action</p><p>&amp;#8226; CBT funding Nelson $137K for wildfire mitigation</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bill.metcalfe@nelsonstar.com\">bill.metcalfe@nelsonstar.com</email> Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-3630473</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SW8-T9Y1-JDH3-G560-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"605\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nelson Star</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 23, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSII</classCode><className>PRIVATE LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0008XKH</classCode><className>CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS &amp; COMPONENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX055</classCode><className>VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The small airstrips in St. Theresa Point and Garden Hill mean only small planes, carrying 40 to 45 people each, could be used.</p><p>The Red Cross was also working with the City of Winnipeg to set up a large emergency shelter in Winnipeg at the RBC Convention Centre.</p><p>Water bombers were bring brought in from the Northwest Territories, Minnesota and Ontario to fight the Wasagamack fire and other blazes that have cropped up following weeks of hot, dry weather.</p><p>A 46-square-kilometre fire was within 3.5 kilometres of Poplar River, where residents had been evacuated earlier as a precaution. A smaller blaze was reported six kilometres from the Fox Lake First Nation.</p><p>The Wasagamack fire remained the biggest concern Wednesday. McDougall said the winds that had driven the fire close to the community had switched, and the fire had not made any further advance as a handful of officials remained at the scene.

It got so hot sitting in the sun that you could hardly touch them with your bare hands. Even if it got hot during the day, at night it would cool down to about 20 degrees or less. One night it was cold enough too wake me up and I turned off the fan and pulled up the comforter.</p><p>The only problem has been the lack of rain. I have heard of a few wells going dry and some of the lakes are getting a bit shallow. Even up on Nip the water is beginning to be noticeably low. I just hope that the rain we get comes over a few days and not overnight. It needs to soak in a bit and not just run off if we want an end to this total fire ban. We have been very lucky that this area has not gone up in smoke. Most people do not realize how easy it is for a fire to get started. It can be a cigarette butt, lightning strike, camp fire or even a smashed glass bottle. There are lots of things that can start a fire when no one is looking. But sad to say, lots are started from camp fires that people think they have put out. I had the misfortune of seeing one from start to finish.</p><p>I had a job, looking after a man's house that was several miles back in the woods. There was always lots to do because it was a rather fancy house with a garden, small golfing green, tennis court and so on. In the summer months I was there seven days a week. So I see every track that any vehicle made coming or going. There were some people that liked to camp down the lake. They rode in on their bicycle, stayed a day or two and then left. One time, two days after they had left, I saw what looked like fog hanging over one spot on the lake. It just so happened that on this day, there was more than just myself working at the camp. So I hopped into the boat and went to have a look. You could smell smoke when I beached the boat. I went maybe a hundred yards and found a patch of ground that would glow red hot whenever a breath of wind would blow. I could see where the campfire had been but the forest fire had started quite some ways over from that spot.</p><p>Looked like it had burned underground away from the fire ring and them popped up days after that. When I kicked at some flames close to where I stood. It got worse and burned higher. It was several inches deep into the carpet of pine needles and tree litter.</p><p>I called for help and the boys at camp came with shovels, the gas fire pump and several hundred feet of hose. We worked until almost dark, but by then the fire was out and the area looked more like a swamp we had put so much water on it. Found out these things are easier to start than put out! Hats off to the fire ban!</p><p>Bill Eden is a columnist with the Almaguin News. His column, Fish Tales, appears weekly.

Southern and eastern Ontario suffered the same heat but Ontario doesn't track heat-related deaths the same way, so nobody knew how many people had been affected in the province next door</p><p>Dr. Courtney Howard, an emergency physician from Yellowknife who wrote the Canadian section of the report, said right now the world is on pace for temperature increases we can't adapt to, resulting in more deaths and disease.</p><p>The world's average surface temperature is already about 1 C warmer than it was in the pre-industrial era, and if we continue to emit greenhouse gases at present levels, the increase will be between 2.6 C and 4.8 C by the end of the century.</p><p>\"We're not sure we can adapt to that in a way where we can maintain the same civilizational stability and health-care systems we're used to,\" said Howard. \"We're talking about not just maintaining disease levels, we're talking about our ability to provide health care.\"</p><p>Fine particles of pollutants in the air cause premature deaths from heart disease, strokes, lung cancer, acute respiratory infections and chronic lung disease. More frequent heat waves contribute to heat stroke and more intense pollen seasons, which can aggravate allergies and asthma, as can forest fires.</p><p>Warmer temperatures are also helping insects thrive, which means more bug-borne illnesses. The incidence of Lyme disease, which is carried by ticks, went up 50 per cent in 2017 alone.</p><p>Howard said a new term emerging among mental-health professionals is \"eco-anxiety,\" describing mental stress caused by climate-related changes - or even just the threat they might occur.</p><p>Public-health officials are going to have to adapt their responses to dangers such as forest fires, because the increased intensity and frequency of the fires means more communities have bad air for far longer, she said. Most health authorities will advise people to stay indoors on smoky days, but when those periods last for weeks, that is not a sustainable solution.</p><p>In San Francisco this month, smoke from wild fires made the air some of the most dangerous in the world. Doctors told people to stay in, and to wear masks if they absolutely had to go outdoors.</p><p>Howard said work is underway to improve smoke forecasting, so people can be told when they can expect to go outdoors and get exercise and sunlight safely during extended smoke warnings.</p><p>She said the last few summers have alerted Canadians to what climate change is going to look like, with record-breaking forest-fire seasons in British Columbia in both 2017 and 2018, drought on the Prairies, heat waves in central Canada, and flooding in communities almost from coast to coast. She said some people think this is a new normal - but it's not.</p><p>\"It's going to be worse in 10 years,\" she said.</p><p>Howard said if we don't step up our efforts, the change to the world will be massive, including more wars and migration.</p><p>\"I'm an emergency doctor and I'm working on this because this is an emergency,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-9f78e46e8f1443449facff7457f05fcb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TVM-WRM1-DY9S-T30D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><timeReceived>06:47 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 28, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
