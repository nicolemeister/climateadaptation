After some reflection, he decided to hop onto the saddle instead, joining the \"Brainiacs\" team that included his cousin and his cousin's wife.</p><p>Cancer, which afflicts an estimated one half all of all Canadians at some point in their lives, has hit Wilson's family heavily.</p><p>\"There are many people from over the years that I am riding for, all punctuated by 2016, when I lost both my mom (Carol) and younger brother (Mike) to cancer and saw my wife, Inge, begin her year-long battle with breast cancer,\" said Wilson in his fund-raising bio.</p><p>\"In recent years, I have seen too much cancer first hand,\" he continued. \"During that time, I have seen the good work that the BC Cancer Agency does, both in successful treatments and in cases where the disease is too far gone.</p><p>\"Most recently, I accompanied Inge to all of her breast cancer treatments in Abbotsford. Through her courage and the excellent facilities and people there, she is now cancer free.</p><p>\"Other than Inge's treatment, there have been other successes: my friend Bruce, my aunt Doris, my uncle Lyle, our good friend Louise and my retired boss, Bob - all attributable to the excellent treatments that are available in British Columbia,\" said Wilson, an engineer for Emil Anderson Construction.</p><p>Wilson said he's covered over 800 km in training, since March, for the ride that entails about 100 km on each of the two days. To qualify, though, every rider in the event has to raise at least $2,500 in order to take part - and Wilson has surpassed that.</p><p>\"This year, I've raised $3,850,\" he said, Monday. \"Four hundred of that came from Hope Motor Sports, from the Canada Day car show.</p><p>\"The Brainiacs were founded by four brain cancer survivors,\" said Wilson of his team. \"Last year, we raised $680,000 - but this year, we're just barely over $200,000 with three weeks to go. Last year was a special year, with the 10-year anniversary and the first time for the ride being all in B.C.\" Previously, the ride started in B.C. and finished in Washington state.</p><p>Last year, recalled Wilson, \"It was dry for the first 12 kilometres. After that, it was socked in. It was disappointing - but only a small bit of discomfort, compared to what cancer patients go through.</p><p>This year - if plans stay on-course - the ride will start on Saturday, August 24, in Surrey and follow a circuitous route to the Chilliwack Fairgrounds, where riders will camp out and enjoy meals and entertainment before heading for Hope, via Agassiz on Sunday morning. Finish line activities start at Sixth Avenue Park at 11 a.m. and continue till 6.</p><p>\"There'll be a kind of tour of Hope before getting to the finish line,\" said Wilson. \"It'll be cool, for a small town to see.\"</p><p>In addition to Wilson, be on the lookout for a team called \"Wheeled Wild Women,\" consisting of Hilary Kennedy (team captain), Michele Drummond, Anne Fortoloczky, Maureen Kehler, Natalie Lowe, Debbie Pauls, Tammy Shields - and a recent recruit, Debbie's daughter Tansie, who will be riding in memory of her grandma, Dora Pauls, who died of cancer last September.</p><p>Riding solo, is Cathy Harry of Hope Kal Tire, who had $1557 in pledges, as of Wednesday. To help her reach the qualifying goal, you can make a pledge at the store, or online at ride.conquercancer.ca/vancouver19.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOPEST-3849764</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOPEST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT1-W5P1-JDH1-C4HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hope Standard</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 11, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000248</classCode><className>CANCER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DLDH</classCode><className>MOTORSPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000208</classCode><className>BREAST CANCER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX002002</classCode><className>MEDICAL TREATMENTS &amp; PROCEDURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001248</classCode><className>ONCOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D1CN</classCode><className>BRAIN CANCER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000769</classCode><className>FUNDRAISING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000A0CR</classCode><className>CANADA DAY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000093</classCode><className>ANNIVERSARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001248</classCode><className>ONCOLOGY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It was one of several ideas the union was considering to create jobs for the employees who were being laid off due to the closure of the plant and the opening of a new, modern sawmill. The local was also contemplating establishing a natural fish hatchery in the region, he said.</p><p>28 Years Ago (1990): A signed 25-year agreement meant Ainsworth Lumber had 30 months to get a strandboard plant up and running. The agreement also stipulated construction had to start within a year. David Ainsworth was cautious about committing himself to dates but told an audience of about 80 at the Red Coach Inn that \"we will be able to meet the time frame. Financing will be the major hurdle from now on. It's a lot of money for a company the size of Ainsworth. It isn't that simple.\"</p><p>22 Years Ago (1996): British Columbians were set to go to the polls on May 28 and all three major Cariboo South campaigns were more than anxious to get going after Premier Glen Clark asked to dissolve legislation following the tabling of a budget. NDP Campaign manager Gillian MacDonald said her troops \"know we've got lots of work to do.\" Liberal nominee Dave Worthy said he thought the South Cariboo was \"going to be a very close fight.\"</p><p>17 Years Ago (2001): The Cariboo South riding would not have a B.C. Green Party candidate because of a conflict between the party and Ruth Lake area farmer Charles Jones. Jones said the Green Party leader, Adriane Carr, refused to sign his nomination because he wasn't a member of the environmental groups that ran the Green Party. \"I really don't want to discourage anyone from voting for the Green. There's still a lot of good people. It still has potential,\" he said. \"I think right now, we've got some bad administrators.\"</p><p>9 Years Ago (2009): A 650-hectare forest fire that took 70 Mile House by surprise left three of its residents without homes and a nearby 60 home subdivision miraculously untouched. According to 70 Mile VFD chief Dave Lindenfelger, one of his members spotted smoke from the fire at about 12:30 p.m. and alerted others. A call for mutual aid was made to six other departments. He said the fire was approximately one acre in size when they arrived on scene and travelling west toward residences on Komori Road.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLEHFP-3583667</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S8F-22D1-JDH3-G056-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"406\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>100 Mile House Free Press</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 5, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00070DV</classCode><className>AINSWORTH LUMBER CO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>INTERNATIONAL WOODWORKERS OF AMERICA US AFL-CIO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS321219 RECONSTITUTED WOOD PRODUCT MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC2493 RECONSTITUTED WOOD PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

They're working with the industry-federal agency FPInnovations to use log scanning technology that helps mills detect flaws inside logs to get a viable lumber product out of otherwise uneconomic timber.</p><p>They've endured shutdowns due to log shortages, high costs and union demands. And now they face a new threat - drastically increased log exports in the North Coast region that siphon off even more of the scarce high-grade timber.</p><p>That's right, despite Premier John Horgan's endless rant against exporting \"raw logs\" and jobs, despite mill shutdowns across the province due to jacked-up stumpage taxes on the coast and falling timber supply in the Interior, the export limit has been doubled in the Northwest Interior region around Kitimat, Terrace, Smithers and Hazelton. Similar cabinet orders increase export limits for the vast North Coast, Cassiar and Haida Gwaii regions, apparently so Indigenous communities in the region can make money shipping the best \"raw logs\" overseas.</p><p>RELATED: Skeena Sawmills spends millions to modernize</p><p>RELATED: Syrian refugees find work at Terrace sawmill</p><p>Skeena Sawmills president Roger Keery sent a blistering letter to Horgan and Forests Minister Doug Donaldson in late July. He calculated that more than half of the Northwest's actual log harvest was exported before the NDP government raised the limit from 20 per cent to 40 per cent.</p><p>\"The largest tenure holder in the area is B.C. Timber Sales [a provincial agency], and with this increase in exportable volumes, the government will in effect be the largest log exporter,\" Keery wrote. \"We are shocked and disappointed by the changes to the [cabinet orders allowing exports], particularly given the many assurances we received during the review process that government was committed to supporting domestic manufacturing and investment.\"</p><p>In response to my questions about the letter, the ministry issued a statement that quibbled with its numbers, noting the new quotas exclude export of cedar and cypress, which are now banned from export as logs.</p><p>(Full letter, ministry response below)</p><p>\"We have committed verbally and in writing to Skeena that we are monitoring the impact of the [cabinet orders] and if the objectives government outlined are not being achieved, we will revisit the policies,\" the ministry stated.</p><p>The statement makes no reference to why log export limits have been increased. Ellis Ross, former chief of the Haisla Nation and now B.C. Liberal MLA for Skeena, offered his take.</p><p>\"What surprises me is after years of complaining and campaigning, the NDP quietly increased log exports in the Northwest,\" Ross told me. \"I know First Nations depend on log exports for revenues, but the problem is that our local sawmill employs First Nations as well. In choosing to increase log exports, our local sawmill is put in an even more difficult position.\"</p><p>Horgan has repeatedly stepped in to assist Donaldson with the difficulties of the forests ministry. The much-criticized forest fire recovery programs have been transferred to the public safety ministry. Former B.C. Liberal MLA Blair Lekstrom was hired to extract the province from a secret deal to set aside vast new areas for caribou protection. Delta North MLA Ravi Kahlon was appointed as parliamentary secretary for forests.</p><p>Now this.</p><p>Skeena Sawmills.donaldson.j... by Tom Fletcher on Scribd</p><p>Forests Ministry Response A... by Tom Fletcher on Scribd</p><p>Tom Fletcher is B.C. legislature reporter and columnist for Black Press Media.

This force of nature can be destructive on human structures. Because of this we have tended to want to control and suppress it. Even when we've not lost any structures, a burnt forest is often seen negatively. However, is fire truly the villain we make it out to be?</p><p>Ecosystems need fire to remain healthy and balanced. Fire breaks down deadwood and organic litter on the forest floor then injects those nutrients back into the ecosystem to start anew. This vital cycle helps seeds in the soil to recolonize the area, while trees and other vegetation that survived the fire use these nutrients to boost growth.</p><p>Fire occurs naturally at different intervals in a healthy ecosystem. Dry environments understandably have fire more often then wet ones. Vegetation that naturally reside in these fire prone ecosystems have developed ways of protecting themselves. Trees like ponderosa pine and interior Douglas-fir have a fire-retardant bark to help protect them from the flames while species like lodgepole pine have serotinous cones. Serotinous cones use fire as a signal to open and release their seeds in order produce a new generation after the fire has passed.</p><p>It's not only vegetation that benefits from fire; animals need fire just like ecosystems do. Fire clears out dense and overgrown vegetation to allow for easier movement through the bush. Following a fire, a stand blossoms with a lot of new vegetation and provides a great food source for deer and elk. Trees that have been killed by fire but remain standing become excellent trees for wildlife. These trees can be home to bats, squirrels, and many different species of birds, including owls. Trees that end up falling to the ground provide refuge for rodents and insects to take shelter in and for fungi to grow upon and decompose.</p><p>Without fire as an integral part of the ecosystem, forests would become unhealthy due to a build up of dead standing and or diseased trees, excessive accumulation of deadwood on the forest floor and an overgrown understory vegetation that inhibits ungulate passage.</p><p>Ecosystems without fire has caused a shift in the natural build up of dead wood and other fire fuels that, when we can't put out the fire, will lead to unnaturally largescale, and very hot fires. These hotter and fiercer fires burn deep into the soil destroying the seedbank that is there to re-establishing the vegetation soon after the fire is out.</p><p>It takes a long time for a forest with damaged soil to recover from this event. These intense fires near residences also lead to a greater loss of property, similar to what happened in Kelowna just a few years ago.</p><p>We can do something about these out of control largescale fires though. Volunteer groups can conduct thinning of built up fuel debris on forest floors near our structures. Industry professionals can also conduct controlled burns which significantly helps to reduce the fuel buildup. Unless fires are allowed to return to their natural patterns forest fires will continue to burn out of control.</p><p>Next time we hear about a forest fire on the news we should all think about the broader benefits of its effects instead of wanting to snuff it out right away.</p><p>Devon Smith and Colby Dunphy are second-year recreation, fish and wildlife students at Castlegar's Selkirk College campus</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CASNWS-3718749</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CASNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V1J-RVK1-F103-33SJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"555\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Castlegar News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 22, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLQ6</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE MATERIALS &amp; PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000854</classCode><className>PLANT CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000187</classCode><className>BIRDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008ZJW</classCode><className>RODENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000D5IA</classCode><className>INSECTS &amp; ARACHNIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

VIEWS: Sawmill struggles as NDP boosts northwest log exports</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If there's a bright spot in the struggling B.C. forest industry, it's Skeena Sawmills.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since new investors took over the 59-year-old operation from West Fraser in 2011, they have poured millions into restarting and upgrading Terrace's only sawmill, fixing old buildings and retooling to handle smaller second-growth timber from the economically marginal forest stands that are left in the region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They've invested more millions into building a pellet plant for biofuel exports. They're working with the industry-federal agency FPInnovations to use log scanning technology that helps mills detect flaws inside logs to get a viable lumber product out of otherwise uneconomic timber.</p><p>They've endured shutdowns due to log shortages, high costs and union demands. And now they face a new threat - drastically increased log exports in the North Coast region that siphon off even more of the scarce high-grade timber.</p><p>That's right, despite Premier John Horgan's endless rant against exporting \"raw logs\" and jobs, despite mill shutdowns across the province due to jacked-up stumpage taxes on the coast and falling timber supply in the Interior, the export limit has been doubled in the Northwest Interior region around Kitimat, Terrace, Smithers and Hazelton. Similar cabinet orders increase export limits for the vast North Coast, Cassiar and Haida Gwaii regions, apparently so Indigenous communities in the region can make money shipping the best \"raw logs\" overseas.</p><p>RELATED: Skeena Sawmills spends millions to modernize</p><p>RELATED: Syrian refugees find work at Terrace sawmill</p><p>Skeena Sawmills president Roger Keery sent a blistering letter to Horgan and Forests Minister Doug Donaldson in late July. He calculated that more than half of the Northwest's actual log harvest was exported before the NDP government raised the limit from 20 per cent to 40 per cent.</p><p>\"The largest tenure holder in the area is B.C. Timber Sales [a provincial agency], and with this increase in exportable volumes, the government will in effect be the largest log exporter,\" Keery wrote. \"We are shocked and disappointed by the changes to the [cabinet orders allowing exports], particularly given the many assurances we received during the review process that government was committed to supporting domestic manufacturing and investment.\"</p><p>In response to my questions about the letter, the ministry issued a statement that quibbled with its numbers, noting the new quotas exclude export of cedar and cypress, which are now banned from export as logs.</p><p>(Full letter, ministry response below)</p><p>\"We have committed verbally and in writing to Skeena that we are monitoring the impact of the [cabinet orders] and if the objectives government outlined are not being achieved, we will revisit the policies,\" the ministry stated.</p><p>The statement makes no reference to why log export limits have been increased. Ellis Ross, former chief of the Haisla Nation and now B.C. Liberal MLA for Skeena, offered his take.</p><p>\"What surprises me is after years of complaining and campaigning, the NDP quietly increased log exports in the Northwest,\" Ross told me. \"I know First Nations depend on log exports for revenues, but the problem is that our local sawmill employs First Nations as well. In choosing to increase log exports, our local sawmill is put in an even more difficult position.\"</p><p>Horgan has repeatedly stepped in to assist Donaldson with the difficulties of the forests ministry. The much-criticized forest fire recovery programs have been transferred to the public safety ministry. Former B.C. Liberal MLA Blair Lekstrom was hired to extract the province from a secret deal to set aside vast new areas for caribou protection. Delta North MLA Ravi Kahlon was appointed as parliamentary secretary for forests.</p><p>Now this.</p><p>Skeena Sawmills.donaldson.j... by Tom Fletcher on Scribd</p><p>Forests Ministry Response A... by Tom Fletcher on Scribd</p><p>Tom Fletcher is B.C. legislature reporter and columnist for Black Press Media.

Wildfire Service announced Wednesday that Category 2 open fires will be prohibited throughout the Coastal Fire Centre's jurisdiction, except in Haida Gwaii and the northern tip of Vancouver Island, to help prevent human-caused wildfires and protect public safety.</p><p>The prohibition will remain in effect until Oct. 20 or until the public is otherwise notified. This prohibition covers all B.C. parks, crown lands and private lands within the Coastal Fire Centre, but does not apply within the boundaries of a local government that has forest fire prevention bylaws in place and is serviced by a fire department.</p><p>The open fire ban that started this week applies to the burning of any material, stubble or grass, and the use of fireworks, firecrackers or burning barrels.</p><p>The prohibition does not ban campfires that are smaller than a half-metre high by a half-metre wide, or apply to cooking stoves that use gas, propane or briquettes.</p><p>A poster explaining the different categories of open burning can be found online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://ow.ly/znny309kJv5\">http://ow.ly/znny309kJv5</url> . People lighting a campfire must keep flammable debris from the campfire area and they must have at least eight litres of water available nearby to properly extinguish the fire. Fires must be completely extinguished, with ashes cold to the touch, before campers leave the area.</p><p>Anyone who lights an open fire when a fire prohibition is in place or fails to comply with an open fire prohibition may be issued a ticket for $1,150 or, if convicted in court, be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to a year in jail or could be billed for firefighting costs in the event of a wildfire.</p><p>To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1-800-663-5555 or *5555 on a cellphone.

Sixteen people died and 13 were injured.</p><p>\"We train for events like train derailments or big automobile accidents, but we don't do a lot of training for what happens if there is a big mental-health type of issue in your community,\" Day said at a disaster management conference in Winnipeg on Wednesday.</p><p>Day first heard about the collision on social media. A call from Nipawin's mayor followed soon after and officials quickly assembled in Humboldt to figure out what happened, how bad the crash was and what the community's response should be.</p><p>\"It was completely overwhelming how many moving parts there were in the first two, 2 1/2 days,\" Day said.</p><p>\"It was necessary for such broader, bigger trauma counselling and trauma response that we really weren't prepared with how to deal with that.\"</p><p>Humboldt fire Chief Mike Kwasnica told the conference he received a phone call from Nipawin's fire chief soon after the crash. Humboldt's volunteer firefighters were 170 kilometres away from the site so their roles as first responders changed drastically.</p><p>They were often a shoulder to cry on or directed traffic on top of responding to their regular calls for fires and car crashes.</p><p>\"I don't know if you can plan for it,\"said Kwasnica, who added that the crash affected some firefighters directly because they had billeted players in the past.</p><p>It soon became clear that Humboldt would become a place to mourn, but unlike a forest fire or a flood, the province didn't have mental-health professionals who could respond at a moment's notice, Day said.</p><p>Workers from local non-governmental organizations volunteered their time and spent days at the Elgar Petersen Arena, which became the gathering centre for people grieving.</p><p>The Sunday following the crash thousands of people crowded into the area for a vigil that was broadcast around the world.</p><p>Day said the grief didn't end after the vigil or when the media coverage of the tragedy began to wane. For the families affected and for people in the community, mental-health supports were needed long after.</p><p>Officials in Humboldt are involved in a review with Public Safety Canada and Day said it's important they reflect on the steps taken in the moments, days and weeks after the fatal crash.</p><p>\"This is an event that for us isn't over,\" Day said.</p><p>\"We went through a lot.

The temporary suspension of underground mining operations and removal of non-essential personnel was a precautionary decision to ensure the safety of its personnel from the threat of heavy smoke and ash from a local forest fire. The Company will continue to closely monitor the forest fire situation to ensure the safety and health of its employees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Company's timeline to resume full underground production is expected to be early next week. Personnel are scheduled to return to site starting tomorrow, July 17, 2015, and continuing through to July 20, 2015. During the temporary suspension, the mill processed approximately 850 tonnes per day from the surface stockpile. The current stockpile is approximately 8,500 tonnes and it will continue to be processed until underground mining operations resume. At this time, the Company expects to meet its production guidance for the year.</p><p>Brian Skanderbeg, President and CEO commented, \"We are pleased that we are now able to safely resume mining operations at the Seabee Gold Operation. We would like to thank all those who have supported and helped in our efforts to manage the forest fire. Also, I would like to specifically thank our dedicated staff who remained on site and worked tirelessly to implement protective measures to ensure the safety of our employees and facilities.\"</p><p>Claude Resources Inc. is a publicly traded gold exploration and mining company based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, whose shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: CRJ) and the OTCQB (OTCQB: CLGRF). Its asset base is located entirely in Canada and since 1991, Claude has produced over 1,000,000 ounces of gold from its Seabee Gold Operation in northeastern Saskatchewan.

Ninety per cent of the time firefighters are suppressing the fire and the remaining time is spent getting ready for the next day.</p><p>There are periods of heavy rain expected today but McCool said it is unlikely to quench the fire, but it will be extremely helpful.</p><p>This is the 21st fire in Algonquin Park this year.

The ban was a result of the fire danger rating reaching extreme levels. It means there is a full ban on all fires until further notice.</p><p>\"This means no campfires, no burning of brush, no open flame (i.e. chimneas) and no fireworks. This ban will remain in effect until significant rainfall is received throughout Muskoka,\" said Mike Vadlja, fire prevention officer for the Huntsville-Lake of Bays Fire Department. \"The Muskoka fire chiefs appreciate the public's assistance in adhering to this ban, which will help prevent any fires that would adversely affect property, buildings and the natural beauty of Muskoka.\"</p><p>The Muskoka fire season runs April 1 to Oct. 31 each year. The fire rating is verified daily and updated whenever the rating changes.</p><p>For complete information on burning in your municipality please check with your local municipal office at:</p><p>Bracebridge 705-8258</p><p>Georgian Bay 705-538-2765</p><p>Gravenhurst 705-687-3412</p><p>Huntsville 705-789-5201</p><p>Lake of Bays 705-635-2272</p><p>Muskoka Lakes 705-765-3156</p><p>The Muskoka Fire Danger Rating is determined using the Fire Weather Index (FWI), an internationally used method for determining the risk of fires in open air. It uses factors such as the relative humidity, temperature, previous 24-hour rain amount, wind directions and wind speed in combination with the forest fuel type and loads to determine the risk of the forest to certain fire types. From this calculation the forest fire danger rating is made in consultation with the fire chiefs of the six area municipalities and the Ministry of Natural Resources.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2016080939195858</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KFF-JVW1-JDV5-F3BS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"281\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The rest were caused by people.</p><p>The centre reported 41 forest fires starting in eastern and northern Ontario since Wednesday; 21 in Quebec; 27 in New Brunswick; eight in Nova Scotia; and three in Newfoundland.</p><p>In total, there have been 5,391 forest fires across Canada so far this year, consuming 543,000 hectares - an area about the size of Prince Edward Island.</p><p>That's below the 10-year average of nearly 6,000 fires for the same period, but firefighters say the combination of a heat wave and low precipitation has them nervous about the rest of the forest fire season.</p><p>\"The eastern regions are all in high to extreme hazard levels. They all have very high chances of (the fires) getting out of hand,\" said Bokovay.</p><p>Ontario has imported 280 firefighters and six planes from the western provinces and the Northwest Territories to deal with its fires.</p><p>New Brunswick has borrowed two helicopters from Quebec to battle blazes that are breaking out in the southwestern part of the province.</p><p>Near St. Andrews, N.B., 24 families were evacuated on Wednesday from their homes and cottages as a fire consumed about 12 hectares of dry forest.</p><p>In Nova Scotia, the woods were closed to travel - including hiking, picnicking and picking berries - and campfires were banned after three weeks with no rain.</p><p>Temperatures that soared into the 30s over the past two weeks scorched lawns, shrank lakes, erased streams and pushed forest-fire danger indices to extreme levels in most parts of the province.</p><p>Atlantic Canada has seen much larger blazes, such as a 1999 forest fire that consumed 424 hectares of land about 80 kilometres west of Miramichi, N.B.</p><p>But in northern Nova Scotia, David Sweet, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Department, said the forest fire index was \"the highest risk level\" he could recall.</p><p>When the rain has fallen, it has poured down in outbursts that have quickly evaporated.</p><p>\"That's not what sustains a water table anywhere.

The banks of the Mission Creek have been built up and new development along the creek has changed the flow pattern. One family has remained in their house at the mouth of Mission Creek through the flood of '48 and 2017.</p><p>The Truswell Family have occupied this house at the mouth of Mission Creek since 1940 and I moved in when I was three weeks old in March 1941, and now it is passed to my grown children.</p><p>As a historical side-note (to the current floods) my father, Harold A \"Trus\" Truswell, went through the 1948 flood all alone here at the house (that must have been scary) because he sent my mother and I to Seattle to stay with my mother's sister until the flood receded.</p><p>He did this because he was afraid that I might contact polio and it was suggested to him by the heads of local public health service, Dr. Helen Zeeman and Dr.Clark, to get me out of harm's way. My father was friends with the public health service because he had sold them a fleet of cars from the Ford dealership.</p><p>Dad and his German pointer dog Paddy walked the double sandbags from the front gate down the driveway to the kitchen front door for several weeks until the water receded in 1948. Leaving his vehicle at the roadway, dad told me that the water reached seven inches below the hardwood floors at the height of the flood water (343.28 Meters above sea level).</p><p>As the song goes \"this old house has seen it all\" and as stubborn as this family is we will again survive the flood of 2017.</p><p>A big thank you in 2017: The Truswell family would expressly like to thank Ed and Viida Ruff and the BC crews of Forest Fire fighters for their untiring effort to help with installing flood prevention measures. We greatly appreciate all the efforts that have been directed to save our house and this property on Okanagan Lake.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KLOWNA-3373445</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KLOWNA2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NPJ-XV31-JDH3-G3MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"310\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kelowna Capital News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 2, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000733</classCode><className>FLOOD CONTROL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DLEV</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLE DEALERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N923120CC</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N441110MM</classCode><className>NEW CAR DEALERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DLEV</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLE DEALERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N441110MM</classCode><className>NEW CAR DEALERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>GX518</classCode><className>SEATTLE, WA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

the homes they were forced to leave earlier this week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While a mandatory evacuation order has been lifted in Temagami, Ont., firefighters in the area were still battling 25 active fires Friday afternoon, said Shayne McCool, fire information officer from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>Even though they're back in their homes, some residents were still worried by the situation.</p><p>\"It is not only a fire, it's a forest fire, so it won't be done any time soon,\" said Stephanie Wagner, who owns the Temagami Shores Inn Resort with her husband.</p><p>Wagner said approximately 30 people had to evacuate the resort, where she lives with her husband and their son, on Sunday evening.</p><p>\"We were crying and leaving everything behind because our first priority was safety for our staff and our guests,\" she said.</p><p>\"We drove into town and waited for a few hours, but the smoke was so heavy that we had to stay at our friends' house.\"</p><p>They were able to go back to their property on Wednesday evening and are now hosting some of the pilots and staff battling the forest fires in the area, Wagner said.</p><p>Despite the fires, Wagner said numerous guests are starting to gather at the resort for a wedding on Saturday.</p><p>\"The situation is not ideal, but the bride and groom are ready to rock.\"</p><p>Mayor Lorie Hunter said that depending on the force of the wind, the smoke and the fire can still be seen in parts of the community.</p><p>\"The residents are cautious because the situation could change at any moment and they could be asked to leave again,\" Hunter said.</p><p>A number of water bombers are operating during the day to control the fires, which creates smoke, Wagner said.</p><p>\"The smoke kept changing colours because they brought in nine different water bombers, so every time the water got dumped, it would puff up different colours.\"</p><p>It has been a bad year for forest fires in Ontario, with 504 recorded fires to date compared to 143 at this time last year, according to the ministry's data.</p><p>On Friday afternoon, there were 60 active fires in northeastern Ontario and 22 of them were not yet under control, McCool said.</p><p>\"The situation is changing quickly because we continue to find new fires,\" he said.</p><p>\"Our firefighters have made excellent progress on this and the fires have not spread out in recent days,\" McCool said.</p><p>A risk of thunderstorms Friday evening could spark more lightning fires and Environment Canada warned of elevated pollution levels in the area.</p><p>Almost 200 firefighters from across Canada have joined the 400 firefighters already working on the ground in Ontario's northeast.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The fire covered more than 360 square kilometres - roughly about one-third of the park.</p><p>Dianne Pachal, who co-ordinates the annual bird count at Waterton, said birders recorded a total of 167 individual birds from 21 species on Dec. 15. That's well below the 40-year average of 27 species and 493 birds.</p><p>A number of possible reasons for the drop include an extremely high wind on the day of the count - which would make it more difficult to find the birds - and some areas of the park hit by the fire being closed to the public, she said.</p><p>But it's undeniable that the balance of species at Waterton will be affected by last year's fire, Pachal said</p><p>\"The forest was burned there, and who knows which species are remaining and what new ones are there?\" Pachal asked.</p><p>\"With a forest fire, often we see the cavity-nesting birds increase and insect-eating birds, particularly woodpeckers, follow a lot of species of insects that come in immediately following a fire.\"</p><p>Pachal said ecosystems evolve and some species initially found immediately after a fire will move on once the forest begins to mature.</p><p>\"So you won't see as many woodpeckers - we would expect to see more of those now we have had a major fire here.\"</p><p>There are 255 different species recorded in Waterton, said Pachal, who added most are likely to be still around but have relocated to different parts of the park.</p><p>The bird count is a 40-year tradition in which members of the public conduct a tally of birds and their species. Annual counts are done across North America between Dec. 14 and Jan. 5. They're co-ordinated by Bird Studies Canada in conjunction with the National Audubon Society, which began the practice in 1900.</p><p>\"It provides us with a great annual snapshot of what's happening with the birds in the park.\".</p><p>- By Bill Graveland in Calgary.

Sparks thrown by trains and arson are also leading causes.</p><p>-BODY- Every grass fire or forest fire that has spread out of control this season in Manitoba and northwestern Ontario has been caused by humans, fire officials say.</p><p>In Saskatchewan, fires have hovered on the outskirts of several communities.</p><p>A fire that started on farmland outside the northern town of Carrot River on the weekend burned several sheds before entering the provincial forest. It also came close to the local airport and within a few kilometres of the Weyerhaeuser sawmill.</p><p>The forest was still smoking Monday even in cool, damp weather.</p><p>\"Our crews are there and will remain there until it is completely out - last smoke seen two days ago sort-of-thing,'' Mark Campbell, provincial fire duty officer, said Monday.</p><p>\"There is no way they are going to walk away from that one.''</p><p>Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management sent in five water bombers, a helicopter, heavy equipment and 50 firefighters to contain the blaze.</p><p>The forest fire appears to have started when a controlled domestic fire nearby spread across the dry ground aided by high winds, said Campbell.</p><p>Many Carrot River residents gave a helping hand to firefighters while others watched the spectacular scenes from afar.</p><p>\"It was pretty impressive to watch. There was this tremendous cloud of smoke and you could see the water-bombers coming in from the west. They'd disappear into the smoke and then come back out and circle around,'' said Mayor David Stanger.</p><p>\"We were very relieved when everything was under control.''</p><p>Another weekend fire came close to the hospital at Unity, Sask., and destroyed several farm buildings and an auction mart before it was brought under control.</p><p>So far, there have been 45 fires in Manitoba and 24 in northwestern Ontario.</p><p>Rural residents shouldn't burn land, even if their municipality allows it, said Tom Mirus, duty officer with Manitoba's forest fire program.</p><p>\"It's very dry, and with the winds we've been getting, it especially concerns us,'' Mirus said.

The BC Wildfire Service contacted fire chief Terry Murphy to take delivery of the sign.</p><p>After cruising the highway from one end of the lake to the other fire chief Terry Murphy decided the best place for the sign would be in the 60 km zone in the most visible spot he could find.</p><p>Terry approached the Lac La Hache Community Club for permission to hang it under their sign and it was approved by a unanimous decision.</p><p>The downtown Lac La Hache Volunteer Fire Department will be responsible for maintaining the sign and for changing the status as required.</p><p>Horse event</p><p>The weekend of June 23 and 24 was a beehive of activity at the Monical Ranch with the grounds filled with vehicles towing horse trailers. There were many riders and horses present from all over B.C and Alberta.</p><p>The competition consisted of many different levels of skills, with both the riders and horses being judged. It was a special cutting horse event where the participants could double their points if they secured a winning spot as well as a fundraiser with any proceeds going to the BCCHA Youth Development Fund.</p><p>The next scheduled event will be held August 4 and 5 at the Monical Ranch.</p><p>School's out</p><p>The school year is now officially over as of June 28.</p><p>The students celebrated the end of the school year with a barbecue on Wednesday, June 27.</p><p>Food was plentiful with a great variety of salads, hamburgers, hot dogs and even some Chinese Food!

The emergency management team will be meeting this evening and further updates will be released when they become available.</p><p>The Town of Temagami is on an evacuation alert due to the threat of several forest fires in their area.</p><p>On Sunday, July 8, at approximately 5:45 p.m. Temiskaming OPP assisted the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry by advising residents living between Finlayson Point Provincial Park Road and Jessie Lake to evacuate their homes due to a dangerously close active forest fire near Temagami. The MNRF has implemented this mandatory evacuation and there are approximately 20 homes in this area.</p><p>Members of the public have been asked to leave their residence immediately and travel northbound on Highway 11, away from the active fires.</p><p>Residents living in the area between Jessie Lake and the Lake Temagami Access Road have been placed on, \"alert\" suggesting that they may be asked to evacuate should fire conditions in their area worsen.</p><p>Those residents residing in the Town of Temagami are currently on a voluntary notice to evacuate and are also being asked to travel northbound on Highway 11, if they choose to leave at this time.</p><p>Assisting with the operations is the Temagami Fire Department. There are currently no road closures which will allow residents time to travel; however, it is anticipated that fire conditions may worsen and as such Highway 11 may be closed at a later time.</p><p>The North Bay Fire Services are in contact with MNRF's Fire Management Team and working within the Mutual Aid Agreements.</p><p>Locally the City of North Bay has activated its Emergency Management Plan to monitor the situation. At this time there is no immediate threat to the North Bay Area and there have been no requests for local resources with respect to supporting evacuation requirements.</p><p>The City of North Bay has initiated contact with local resources should there be a need to offer assistance in the event of a full-scale evacuation.</p><p>The City of North Bay will continue to monitor the situation and update as new information presents. Reminder that the City of North Bay is currently under a complete fire ban.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018070946797996</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SSH-6GW1-JDH3-G39P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"440\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

It's one of the tools we use in forest management.\"</p><p>The Jack pines are also the desired habitat of the Kirtland's warbler, which winters in the Bahamas.</p><p>Ken Tuininga, a species at risk biologist with the Canadian Wildlife Service, said it was exciting to the see the habitat restoration project taking shape.</p><p>\"We're really hoping we're going to get Kirtland's warblers but there are other species at risk (we want); birds, pollinators, even monarch butterflies,\" he said. \"We're really targeting an ecosystem and making it a real multi-species project.\"</p><p>Tuininga said he's also excited to see how the project promotes a diverse pine and oak ecosystem, which he said are nearly gone from southern Ontario.</p><p>\"A very diverse landscape is the healthiest landscape that you can have,\" he said. \"We're looking at this as a starting point, we're really hoping that we're going to be able to increase that across the landscape in southern Ontario.\"</p><p>The burn is expected to be complete by Sept. 20, and planting of native species will take place in the spring. The forest habitat restoration project is anticipated to be complete by 2020.</p><p>If all goes well, the forest will be suitable habitat for the Kirtland's warbler between 2023 and 2040.</p><p>The total estimated cost to complete the project is $340,800, with $167,950 coming from the Government of Canada, US $30,000 from not-for-profit conservation organization American Forests, and $58,300 from the county forestry reserve.</p><p>For more information about the project, visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.simcoe.ca/restorationproject\">https://www.simcoe.ca/restorationproject</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018092047654406</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TB3-3B71-F103-31T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"502\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Hopefully Zimmer doesn't think that the Conservative Party's next leader, the one that will lead them in the next federal election against Justin Trudeau's Liberals, needs to Make Canada Great Again.</p><p>The federal Conservatives, as well as the B.C. Liberals, should be watching what the Republican Party is going through with fear and concern. The carnage in Cleveland is what happens when broad right-of-centre movements unravel and factional warfare breaks out.</p><p>Too many pundits, however, on both sides of the border, are too quick to write off the Grand Ol' Party. It will survive.</p><p>Someone on Twitter called the convention a dumpster fire this week but a forest fire would be a better description. A forest fire is unpredictable, burning hot and loud, causing significant devastation. What happens afterwards, however, is entirely predictable. With the dead wood destroyed and the established trees killed or significantly damaged, there is plenty of room for rebirth and new growth.</p><p>Regardless of whether Trump wins the presidency in November, he has blown through the Republican Party like a raging blaze, exposing how millions of Americans and a significant number of Main Street card-carrying Republicans do not approve of the party's small-c conservative principles drafted by the Wall Street and K Street establishment in New York and Washington. Trump's bombastic, take-no-prisoners style has certainly attracted support but so has his refusal to toe the line, to be a \"real\" Republican.</p><p>Trump is not the future of the Republican Party. He is merely a reflection of its current frustrated, schizophrenic self, much like Barry Goldwater was in 1964. Goldwater was labelled an extremist, even within his own ranks, but his candidacy rejuvenated the party.</p><p>In the short term, it allowed Richard Nixon to come back from the political grave and lead the Republicans back to the White House with a moderate, modern conservative agenda. Before Watergate, Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and fostered a relationship with Communist China. In the long term, Goldwater's legacy was Ronald Reagan. Goldwater thought America was going to hell in a handbasket, Reagan turned that frown into a smile because it was Morning In America.</p><p>Four years after Goldwater divided the party of Lincoln, perhaps ruining it forever, the Republicans came back to take the White House in 1968. Except for Jimmy Carter's one-term presidency, they held onto it until 1992.</p><p>Somewhere in Cleveland, far away from the cameras and microphones, ambitious young Republicans, along with a few experienced veterans, are gathering to talk about the future, about what happens after Trump. The old hands will tell them about Reagan's \"shining city on a hill\" metaphor and the young Republicans will latch onto that spirit of optimism through uncertain times. They will forge a new conservative agenda built around hope, enthusiasm and inclusiveness, instead of the hate, fear and anger epitomized by Trump.</p><p>This is the territory where right-of-centre parties have enjoyed the most success, both in the United States and in Canada. Mad-as-hell conservatives, whether they are Goldwater, Trump, Preston Manning or Stephen Harper, just scare most voters. Harper would never have been prime minister if the federal Liberals hadn't become so arrogant and corrupt. Canadians never stopped being uneasy about Harper and cheerfully showed him the door as soon as a credible candidate with a hopeful message stepped forward.</p><p>Reagan and Brian Mulroney.</p><p>Closer to home and to present day, Gordon Campbell and Christy Clark.</p><p>Their \"sunny ways\" conservatism unites right-of-centre supporters and is the proven path to political power.

While this may not seem significant, I would ask all those reading this to take time and remember what their local ecosystem looked like when they were a kid, and compare to what they see around them today. Climate change has already affected us, from the lake levels we're seeing now, to the increase in forest fire activity in our great province, and in the absence of snowpack in our mountains to sustain our communities fresh water resources.</p><p>Yet, if this report is to be taken seriously, as it should be, then the future this report paints should terrify us all. It lays out that these temperature increases, caused by both human and and natural activities, are primarily caused by human activity, stating that \"the human factor is dominant\". The report also lays out, that in a high emission scenario, we could see record highs in daily temperatures every two years as opposed to every 20, and \"extreme hot temperatures will become more frequent and more intense.\" This will lead to increased risk of drought, wildfires, and inland flooding.</p><p>Furthermore, this change in temperatures will also affect our pristine environment. Even under a medium emission scenario the report reads that, \"glaciers across the mountains of western Canada will lose 74 per cent to 96 per cent of their volume by the late century.\"</p><p>However, despite all of this negative news there is some positive to go along with it. This report details that, in a low emission scenario, most of the catastrophic events that I just layed out can be mitigated, but our emissions outputs must peak immediately. With a federal election coming this fall it is possible to put a party in power that is willing to fight for a bold, progressive plan for fighting this generational crisis. Which is why I'm astonished that Conservatives are now leading in the polls. A party who hasn't even had the common courtesy to placate concerns around climate change, and has yet to release a climate change plan. The main reason for this is that climate change is a generational issue. The simple fact is that the most conservative voting group in our country is also the oldest. For many of those in this group, they will not have to face the effects of climate change that those in our youngest generations will. This makes climate change less of a priority for them. And, I want to take a second to say I'm not trying to insult anyone, and I do understand the rationale of some of these older voters.</p><p>However, the future belongs to the young in this country, and we are terrified of the possibilities that may face us. That is why young people, yes I'm talking to you millennials and gen z'ers, now is our time to shine. We need to be forceful in our support for politicians who actually take this problem seriously, and swift in our condemnation of those who don't. We need to make our voices heard this time around. We must refuse to be silenced. And above all else, we need to tell all of our politicians in Canada that climate change matters to us, and we will no longer settle for good enough, but rather strive for the best. In 2019, we need to stand up and scream that our future is our say.</p><p>Matt Kercher</p><p>Lake Cowichan</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COWCIT-3775908</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COWCIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT9-ND61-JDH1-C2VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438285</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"598\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cowichan Citizen</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 3, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Business &amp;

But Waddington predicts the firefighters will need ongoing support and possible treatment for serious illnesses over the next 10 to 20 years.</p><p>\"Realistically, a lot of our guys, their lives are going to be shortened because of this incident,\" Waddington says bluntly. \"When you compound that with everything that we're going to have in our careers, we're definitely going to be in a high risk.\"</p><p>The fire spread into the oilsands capital on May 3 and forced more than 80,000 people to leave. It destroyed roughly 2,400 homes and other buildings - about onetenth of the city. Firefighters were credited with saving the rest of the community.</p><p>Municipal crews were assisted in the following days by firefighters from other communities and wildland firefighters from across Canada and other countries - about 2,200 in all.</p><p>But the hometown crew was there first, working around the clock, when the forest fire morphed into an urban blaze and moved from timber to buildings with toxins in vinyl siding, treated lumber and furniture.</p><p>Firefighters \"would have been out there for long periods of time sucking in the smoke,\" says Fort McMurray fire Chief Darby Allen.</p><p>He explains that municipal firefighters normally wear a selfcontained breathing apparatus. The air in the tanks might last up to an hour - enough time for going into a single house fire, but not for a marathon shift fighting flames consuming hundreds of homes.</p><p>\"We didn't have time to get back to the hall to charge (the tanks).\"</p><p>Forest crews sometimes wear particulate filter masks. Waddington says those P100 masks aren't stocked in large numbers at municipal fire stations. Pallets of them arrived a few days after the fire raced into the city.</p><p>But wearing such masks is a \"double-edge sword,\" Waddington says. The filters make it harder to breathe and can get plugged.</p><p>And the half-masks can cause safety glasses and visors to fog, says Jamie Coutts, fire chief of Slave Lake, Alta.</p><p>\"How do you wear that for six days?\" he says.</p><p>Coutts and 13 Slave Lake firefighters helped during the initial days of the Fort McMurray fire and he says he didn't get a filter mask.</p><p>He also didn't have one during a forest fire that spread into his town in 2011 and destroyed about 400 buildings.</p><p>In the months after that fire, members of the Slave Lake crew developed chest infections and nose and throat problems, Coutts says. He was diagnosed with asthma and later lung sarcoidosis, although he says the disease can't be directly linked to the fire.</p><p>After Coutts got home from Fort McMurray, he was coughing and wheezing again and couldn't run up the stairs, he says.</p><p>\"I'm a firefighter. I've got a better-than-average chance of dying of cancer. It is what it is.\"</p><p>Coutts says experts need to come up with a better way to protect crews when forest fires move into urban area.</p><p>\"They're going to have to make better particulate masks.\"</p><p>Peter Krich, president of the Alberta Fire Chiefs Association, says his group may look at whether filter masks should be stocked in communities in forested areas.</p><p>The Fort McMurray fire was unusually large, Krich points out. \"You're not just fighting one fire. You're fighting two fires, three, four, five ... It was going on and on and you could never stop.\"</p><p>The challenge, he says, is that firefighters will do whatever it takes without thinking of their health.</p><p>\"We have to learn,\" he says. \"Hopefully we can ... be more prepared or help each other better in the event of something of this nature happening ever again.\" - with files from Lauren Krugel !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Hydro board urging it to build the multi-million dollar transmission line as soon as possible, after hearing the project has been pushed back to 2025. It was originally planned for completion by 2022.</p><p>Coun. Rick de Jong, who suggested the letter be written to the B.C. Hydro board, said it's time for the Crown corporation to move ahead with the project, expressing frustration at the delay.</p><p>His council colleagues agreed, noting the second transmission line project appeared to have much more urgency when former Kelowna-West B.C. Liberal MLA and premier Christy Clark initiated it in 2015 and said it would take six years to build.</p><p>At that time, Clark pressed B.C. Hydro to start work on the project following concerns by the city that its power supply was in jeopardy because there is only one transmission line feeding the community. The same single line currently also feeds the Westbank First Nation, Peachland, parts of the Regional District of Central Okanagan and as far south as Summerland.</p><p>In 2014, a forest fire east of West Kelowna threatened the line.</p><p>With Clark now out of politics and the NDP in government, the project &amp;#8212;in some people's minds&amp;#8212;appears to have stalled.</p><p>But B.C. Hydro officials say that is not the case.</p><p>Despite that assertion, in presentations to West Kelowna council in recent years, Hydro officials have repeatedly said work is continuing on finalizing the route, with consultations with stakeholders including First Nations, environmental and socio-economic impact assessments and investigations into safety and cost.</p><p>A route between the Nicola substation and Westbank is the preferred one but a specific corridor has yet to be identified.</p><p>In her presentation to council this week, B.C. Hydro representative Sue Foster said the latest delay was caused by more time required for regulatory permits, approvals and authorizations, as well as completion of field studies and construction.</p><p>Her presentation also noted, as a footnote, that construction will not start until the project is approved by the B.C. Utilities Commission and a final investment decision is supported by the B.C. Hydro board.</p><p>So council voted to send the letter pressing the board for approval and to start construction sooner rather than later.</p><p>Foster said B.C. Hydro expects to make a final decision about the route early next year and then a \"definition phase\" would take place, involving more consultation with First Nations and other stakeholders, conducting a centre-line survey for the route, geotechnical investigations, environmental and forestry field studies and engineering field work.</p><p>The current stage of work has included consultation, desktop work looking at environmental, socio-economic, archaeological and traditional use and engineering studies. Geotechnical investigations have also been conducted, as well as a wildfire risk assessment. The type of transmission line to be used has also been looked at, as well as the size of conductors to be used on the line.</p><p>To report a typo, email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newstips@kelownacapnews.com\">newstips@kelownacapnews.com</email></p><p>@KelownaCapNews <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newstips@kelownacapnews.comLike\">newstips@kelownacapnews.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KLOWNA-3705789</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KLOWNA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TVN-FTR1-JDH1-C2NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kelowna Capital News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 29, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>Energy &amp;

You look out the window, and through the dawn light you can see clouds still settled over a lush alpine forest. You're in a tower in the sky, in the shadow of our tallest peaks, surrounded by wilderness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Camping in a fire lookout tower is like no other experience in the Pacific Northwest. It's a unique opportunity to sleep above the treetops, living like an old fire lookout, more cheaply than at most motels. It's no wonder the towers have fast become the hottest rentals in the region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But booking a night in a fire lookout can be harder than getting a ticket to \"Hamilton,\" thanks to high demand, short supply, and prices from $35 to $65 a night. Of the hundreds of lookouts in Oregon and Washington, only 22 are available to the public. The rest are either in disrepair, still in use or stuck in bureaucratic limbo, refurbished but waiting to house travellers.</p><p>As technology makes fire lookouts obsolete, federal and state agencies are stuck with the question of what to do with the towers. Should they be turned into vacation rentals? Torn down? Preserved in public parks and museums?</p><p>The answers are few and far between.</p><p>SKY HIGH DEMAND</p><p>Let's say you want to rent a lookout tower. You've found the perfect location and scheduled your vacation days. You wake up early on the day the lookout opens for rental - six months before your vacation - head to Recreation.gov and pull out your credit card . only to see that the lookout is already booked.</p><p>That's the frustrating reality of trying to book a lookout in the Pacific Northwest. All the planning in the world can be undone by another person just a few seconds quicker, or by somebody who booked it earlier for the maximum 14 days.</p><p>Constructed in the early 20th century, often atop high peaks in rugged wilderness, fire lookout towers are particularly susceptible to lightning strikes, high winds and heavy snows, which can take them out of commission until difficult and costly repairs are made.</p><p>Because of that reality, relatively few lookouts are open to the public. The U.S. Forest Service manages 160 towers in Oregon and Washington, of which 22 are available for rent. Of those, most are available only seasonally - they're either occupied by the forest service during fire season or inaccessible in the winter. And they can be booked for one or two weeks at a time, limiting the number of people who have a shot at them.</p><p>Jocelyn Biro, a regional program manager in charge of the forest service rentals, said the agency is considering limiting the maximum stay to help curb competition.</p><p>Biro said the agency is also trying to manage a tricky balancing act between charging enough to maintain the structures, keeping the lookouts affordable and figuring out their fair market value.</p><p>\"The bottom line is we haven't been able to keep up with the inflation or the needs out there,\" she said. \"Because we're the government and we do get appropriated funding, we're not operating it like a private business.\"</p><p>The Forest Service could sell the lookouts to private concessionaires, which run lodges, hot springs and other destinations. But Biro said the agency isn't interested in doing so because lookout towers require more care and maintenance than other properties.</p><p>\"Be careful what you ask for,\" she said. A concessionaire \"can change those fees, but how much of those fees go back into the lookout?\"</p><p>Even if the Forest Service figures out a fair price, a long and complicated process still stands in the way of changing the fees.</p><p>LOOKOUT LIMBO</p><p>Under federal law, any new fees on forest service structures must go before a recreation advisory committee, an 11-person panel whose members come from specific backgrounds, like \"non-motorized guides,\" as well as from environmental groups and state tourism.</p><p>Biro said it's difficult to find enough interested parties for the committee. As a result, there haven't been any meetings since 2010. That forces the agency into a state of limbo, where structures are fixed up only to languish. Right now, the agency has several newly refurbished lookouts and cabins that it can't put on the market.</p><p>\"It's kind of like building a new hotel but not being able to rent those rooms out,\" Biro said.</p><p>The forest service can get permission directly from state governors to charge new fees, but she said that course of action can be onerous, too. Local forest officials have begun the process of asking Oregon Gov. Kate Brown for a waiver, Biro said, but it could be a long time before anything comes of it. A spokesman for the governor's office said Brown hasn't yet received a request.</p><p>There are issues, too, with simply raising existing fees. Fee increases are necessary for long-term maintenance but must be approved by the federal government, a process that can take months or years. According to the agency, the Forest Service has 11 lookouts and 11 cabins across Oregon and Washington awaiting approval for a fee hike.</p><p>Raising fees and putting more structures on the market could help stem competition for lookout rentals, but even if the forest service gets through the red tape, hundreds of fire lookouts across the Pacific Northwest will still sit unused, falling slowly into disrepair.</p><p>LOST LEGACY</p><p>According to the Forest Fire Lookout Association, a national organization dedicated to restoring historic lookouts, there are just more than 200 standing lookouts in Oregon and more than 100 in Washington. The U.S. Forest Service owns 160, while the rest are on a mixture of private and public lands.</p><p>In Oregon, a few dozen remaining lookout towers are managed by the Oregon Department of Forestry, which until the 1990s staffed the towers in its six state forests. Since then, towers have been replaced by smoke-detection cameras and aerial observation.</p><p>\"We're most proud of the people that were in those stations, and I think as Oregonians we all owe those men and women a debt of gratitude,\" department spokesman Jim Gersbach said. But the cameras are simply more efficient. \"They don't go to sleep and they don't blink. They don't need to make breakfast. They're a nice tool in that they're always on the job.\"</p><p>Since the switch, different fates have befallen towers managed by the department. Some are still in use as mounts for the cameras; others are simply torn down. The department's job is to protect the forests, not the lookouts, Gersbach said, and when the lookouts are no longer of use, they're a potential liability due to hikers who might seek them out or climb them.</p><p>It would be nice to keep the structures, he said - and the department isn't against working with private landowners to do so - but the department of forestry isn't the parks department, and unlike the U.S. Forest Service it has neither the funds nor resources to rent to the public.</p><p>That mindset is certainly logical, but it has riled up the people who see the towers with a more romantic eye, as invaluable artifacts of our Northwest legacy.</p><p>Howard Verschoor, the Oregon director for the Forest Fire Lookout Association, said if it wasn't for the U.S. Forest Service rental program, few would care enough about the lookouts to keep them. He said he doesn't understand why the towers can't be dismantled and reconstructed in parks or fairgrounds.</p><p>\"Oregon Department of Forestry, they're tearing out a part of our history,\" he said.</p><p>Over the last few years, Verschoor has made a concerted effort to raise awareness and support for the lookout towers. He's started two Facebook groups, he said, and has developed a following among those who see the romance and history in the lookouts.</p><p>Ultimately, the Forest Fire Lookout Association aims to raise funds and gather volunteers to restore old lookouts. Those projects can range from $5,000 to $100,000 to complete, Verschoor said, and can come with a host of unforeseen complications.</p><p>Verschoor said it's nice to have renewed public interest in the lookout towers, though it appears to have done little besides adding to the competition for rentals. Representatives from the Oregon Department of Forestry and the U.S. Forest Service said they, too, feel the romantic allure of the towers, but most are simply too difficult to maintain.</p><p>\"Like lighthouses, they were built with a very specific purpose in mind,\" Gersbach said. \"These structures are like any other equipment that becomes obsolete - let's not burden the taxpayers with that.\"</p><p>Fans of the lookouts argue that paying a little extra to fix them up or to reconstruct them in a public park is money well spent.</p><p>\"People don't realize how much history there is on these mountaintops,\" Verschoor said. \"It's heartbreaking.\"</p><p>Fire lookout towers were tools for early foresters as well as homes for men and women who spent countless hours peering at the tops of the trees, waiting for a plume of smoke to rise.</p><p>Today, if you're lucky, you can get some idea of the life those lookouts lived - you just might not have that opportunity for long.</p><p>___</p><p>Information from: The Oregonian/OregonLive, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.oregonlive.com\">http://www.oregonlive.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-4a31d562d8594bfa80699f3620070fb2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8J-NH71-DY9S-T45M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1507\"/><timeReceived>12:38 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 26, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But Waddington predicts the firefighters will need ongoing support and possible treatment for serious illnesses over the next 10 to 20 years.</p><p>\"Realistically, a lot of our guys, their lives are going to be shortened because of this incident,\" Waddington says bluntly. \"When you compound that with everything that we're going to have in our careers, we're definitely going to be in a high risk.\"</p><p>The fire spread into the oilsands capital on May 3 and forced more than 80,000 people to leave. It destroyed roughly 2,400 homes and other buildings - about onetenth of the city. Firefighters were credited with saving the rest of the community.</p><p>Municipal crews were assisted in the following days by firefighters from other communities and wildland firefighters from across Canada and other countries - about 2,200 in all.</p><p>But the hometown crew was there first, working around the clock, when the forest fire morphed into an urban blaze and moved from timber to buildings with toxins in vinyl siding, treated lumber and furniture.</p><p>Firefighters \"would have been out there for long periods of time sucking in the smoke,\" says Fort McMurray fire Chief Darby Allen.</p><p>He explains that municipal firefighters normally wear a self-contained breathing apparatus. The air in the tanks might last up to an hour - enough time for going into a single house fire, but not for a marathon shift fighting flames consuming hundreds of homes.</p><p>\"We didn't have time to get back to the hall to charge (the tanks).\"</p><p>Forest crews sometimes wear particulate filter masks. Waddington says those P100 masks aren't stocked in large numbers at municipal fire stations. Pallets of them arrived a few days after the fire raced into the city.</p><p>But wearing such masks is a \"double-edge sword,\" Waddington says. The filters make it harder to breathe and can get plugged.</p><p>And the half-masks can cause safety glasses and visors to fog, says Jamie Coutts, fire chief of Slave Lake, Alta.</p><p>\"How do you wear that for six days?\" he says.</p><p>Coutts and 13 Slave Lake firefighters helped during the initial days of the Fort McMurray fire and he says he didn't get a filter mask.</p><p>He also didn't have one during a forest fire that spread into his town in 2011 and destroyed about 400 buildings.</p><p>In the months after that fire, members of the Slave Lake crew developed chest infections and nose and throat problems, Coutts says. He was diagnosed with asthma and later lung sarcoidosis, although he says the disease can't be directly linked to the fire.</p><p>After Coutts got home from Fort McMurray, he was coughing and wheezing again and couldn't run up the stairs, he says.</p><p>\"I'm a firefighter. I've got a better-than-average chance of dying of cancer.

But Waddington predicts the firefighters will need ongoing support and possible treatment for serious illnesses over the next 10 to 20 years.</p><p>\"Realistically, a lot of our guys, their lives are going to be shortened because of this incident,\" Waddington says bluntly. \"When you compound that with everything that we're going to have in our careers, we're definitely going to be in a high risk.\"</p><p>The fire spread into the oilsands capital on May 3 and forced more than 80,000 people to leave. It destroyed roughly 2,400 homes and other buildings - about onetenth of the city. Firefighters were credited with saving the rest of the community.</p><p>Municipal crews were assisted in the following days by firefighters from other communities and wildland firefighters from across Canada and other countries - about 2,200 in all.</p><p>But the hometown crew was there first, working around the clock, when the forest fire</p><p>morphed into an urban blaze and moved from timber to buildings with toxins in vinyl siding, treated lumber and furniture.</p><p>Firefighters \"would have been out there for long periods of time sucking in the smoke,\" says Fort McMurray fire Chief Darby Allen.</p><p>He explains that municipal firefighters normally wear a selfcontained breathing apparatus. The air in the tanks might last up to an hour - enough time for going into a single house fire, but not for a marathon shift fighting flames consuming hundreds of</p><p>homes. \"We didn't have time to get back to the hall to charge (the tanks).\"</p><p>Forest crews sometimes wear particulate filter masks. Waddington says those P100 masks aren't stocked in large numbers at municipal fire stations. Pallets of them arrived a few days after the fire raced into the city.</p><p>But wearing such masks is a \"double-edge sword,\" Waddington says. The filters make it harder to breathe and can get plugged.</p><p>And the half-masks can cause safety glasses and visors to fog, says Jamie Coutts, fire chief of Slave Lake, Alta.</p><p>\"How do you wear that for six days?\" he says.</p><p>Coutts and 13 Slave Lake firefighters helped during the initial days of the Fort McMurray fire and he says he didn't get a filter mask.</p><p>He also didn't have one during a forest fire that spread into his town in 2011 and destroyed about 400 buildings.</p><p>In the months after that fire, members of the Slave Lake crew developed chest infections and nose and throat problems, Coutts says. He was diagnosed with asthma and later lung sarcoidosis, although he says the disease can't be directly linked to the fire.</p><p>After Coutts got home from Fort McMurray, he was coughing and wheezing again and couldn't run up the stairs, he says.</p><p>\"I'm a firefighter. I've got a better-than-average chance of dying of cancer. It is what it is.\"</p><p>Coutts says experts need to come up with a better way to protect crews when forest fires move into urban area.</p><p>\"They're going to have to make better particulate masks.\"</p><p>Peter Krich, president of the Alberta Fire Chiefs Association, says his group may look at whether filter masks should be stocked in communities in forested areas.</p><p>The Fort McMurray fire was unusually large, Krich points out. \"You're not just fighting one fire.

Family and friends think that gave him the idea to become a firefighting pilot himself.</p><p>It was a plan that took him 15 years and took brought him from northern Canada to Fiji.</p><p>Hilts died May 22 when his plane went down while he was fighting a forest fire in Cold Lake, Alta.</p><p>\"His entre career was focused on flying the water bombers, that's all he wanted to do,\" recalled friend Brad Blois, who met Hilts in 2003 and flew for many of the same companies.</p><p>\"He was a tremendous pilot.\"</p><p>After attending John McCrae and College Avenue public schools and Centennial high school in Guelph, Hilts completed his pilot training at Confederation College in Thunder Bay. He worked for years as a pilot in Northern Ontario and Prince Rupert, B.C., and even flew for Turtle Airlines in Fiji, in order to log enough hours to certify on water bombers.</p><p>Many of the Northern Ontario trips involved flying into remote First Nations reserves with no roads.</p><p>\"He was both upset by what he saw in some of these communities and glad to be serving those communities,\" said his father, Stew Hilts.</p><p>Another time when he was flying from Kenora to Yellowknife he had to land without an engine on an isolated northern lake, but managed to do it successfully, remembered his father.</p><p>Hilts was loved the outdoors and spent much of his time hunting, fishing, sea kayaking camping and skiing.</p><p>He also loved spending time on the Northern B.C. island of Haida Gwaii, during the winter, the off-season for firefighter pilots.</p><p>\"His mother always worried that he'd be lonely or not eating right, like mothers do, so last fall he sent us a picture of all the venison he was freezing, salmon he was canning and the venison sausages he was making,\" said his father.</p><p>This would have been Hilts' fourth summer flying with Conair Aerial Firefighting out of Abbotsford, B.C.</p><p>Although the nature of his job meant he was \"somewhat nomadic,\" Hilts had a wide network of friends, his father said.</p><p>Messages from across the country have been flowing in on a memorial site his family set up.</p><p>\"You could go for months or maybe even a couple of years and not see Will, and then just pick up right where you left off, \" said Melissa Chan, another friend in B.C.</p><p>\"You don't go through life and meet many people that are as good a friend as Will.\"</p><p>Don Nguyen went to high school in Guelph with Hilts and the two remained close.</p><p>Hilts stayed with him just this month in Cranbrook, B.C., as he prepared for the fire season.</p><p>Nguyen said Hilts sometimes came off as a \"grumpy curmudgeon\" on the surface, but was really a \"big kid at heart\" who was always laughing.</p><p>Nguyen, who was one of the last friends to see him other than his fellow water bomber pilots, shared a few beers with Hilts last week.</p><p>\"He was just talking about how excited he was about flying the bomber. It was scary but exciting,\" recalled Nguyen, who said it was satisfying to watch his friend chase and achieve his lifelong dream.</p><p>\"He worked a long time to get there. To achieve it and not give up is very admirable.\"</p><p>mwarren@guelphmercury</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2015052733498238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G36-DJM1-F197-54GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"568\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

little more hustle and bustle landed at the Trail Regional Airport (YZZ) last week when eastern smoky skies forced planes to divert to the city's airfield.</p><p>Two flights that were originally intended to land in Cranbrook on Friday (Sept. 1) were re-routed to Trail, explained YZZ Manager Robert Baker.</p><p>\"We were told that the smoke in the East Kootenay was impacting access by Pacific Coastal Airlines into the Cranbrook airport,\" he told the Trail Times .</p><p>The Trail airport was notified about two incoming flights at 1 p.m.</p><p>The first flight from Kelowna landed at 2:30 p.m. followed by another plane from Vancouver at 3 p.m., then at 4:30 p.m. the regularly scheduled Vancouver to Trail flight landed.</p><p>Baker says Pacific Coastal Airlines managed everything very smoothly, for them, it was was just another set of flights.</p><p>\"From the airport's perspective, we got a taste of what it would be like at a larger airport with back-to-back-to-back flights,\" Baker said.</p><p>\"It was certainly a bit of excitement for the day, and we're happy to have been able to help those travelers get to where they needed to go,\" he added.</p><p>\"Aside from the extra revenue from landing fees, we sold a bit of fuel, so a definite win-win for everyone.\"</p><p>Passengers who needed to get to Cranbrook were met with a charter bus.</p><p>Baker said, \"The bus came air side, so that passengers could conveniently move from the terminal building directly onto the bus.\"</p><p>With the smoke migrating to the West Kootenay this week, YZZ could see the reverse happen whereby flights in this region need to divert elsewhere.</p><p>\"Certainly this forest fire season is affecting everyone, and has quite a domino effect across the economy,\" Baker said.</p><p>A special air quality statement in effect for the West Kootenay was issued by Environment Canada Tuesday morning.</p><p>High winds throughout the Southeast Fire Centre, paired with ongoing hot and dry conditions, resulted in increased fire behaviour and a High Risk (7) Air Quality Health Index.</p><p>The government advises the general population to consider reducing or rescheduling strenuous

Favorable winds kept the 2,000-hectare fire from engulfing the town Monday.</p><p>\"Things are looking pretty good,'' said Bon.</p><p>Most of the evacuees drove 100 kilometres north to Lynn Lake where many bunked with friends and relatives or were put up in hotels or other facilities.</p><p>About 170 were flown south to Thompson where they slept in two high school gymnasiums. Some simply climbed into their campers and drove to their lakeside holiday haunts.</p><p>The situation is a reversal from last year when 850 residents of Lynn Lake spent a week in Leaf Rapids and Thompson to escape a huge fire.</p><p>Many blazes break out in the region every summer and evacuations are becoming almost commonplace for local residents.</p><p>\"It's the third time in five years we've had to leave,'' said Andre Thibault, who was evacuated to Lynn Lake. \"It's starting to become a fact of life.''</p><p>In Leaf Rapids, emergency workers were also kept busy feeding cats, dogs and other pets left behind in the rush to evacuate.</p><p>\"We're getting phone calls from people letting us know that they do have animals and what their needs are,' said town administrator Ernie Epp.</p><p>Bon said the fire was fuelled by a summer-long drought during which the northern part of Manitoba received half its usual amount of rain. Showers were forecast for the area, but Bon said only a heavy rain would have a real impact on the fire.</p><p>The short days of autumn were working in favor of the 75 firefighters on duty.</p><p>\"When it gets dark, the fires lie a little low, the humidity comes up and the temperature cools so the fire behavior slackens,'' said Bon.</p><p>The evacuation was a harrowing one for Sheldon Lambe, who escaped with his pregnant wife Margie - already few days overdue - and his 2 1/2-year-old daughter Jessica.</p><p>\"It looked like thunderclouds,'' Lambe said of the thick smoke enveloping the town.</p><p>The employee of Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd. got one of the last hotel rooms available in Lynn Lake.</p><p>\"We packed whatever we could squeeze in the car, right down to my daughter's Barney.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199409200004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1994</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:470S-H9V0-01G6-82D5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"497\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1994 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"1994\"><dateText>September 20, 1994 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000A3EZ</classCode><className>CATS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX056</classCode><className>WINNIPEG, MB, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS169</classCode><className>MANITOBA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I have a background as a military policeman.\"</p><p>Volunteers for the ACT number 310, and Gibbs said they had 64 new recruits sign up in recent weeks.</p><p>\"In New South Wales we have 72,000 firefighting volunteers. We don't deal with contractors back home. The government will supply all the equipment such as uniforms, vehicles and the rest is down to volunteers.\"</p><p>In the rural section of the ACT there are 750 firefighting volunteers and 1,000 community fire unit volunteers and they are people who live in the urban-rural interface.</p><p>\"There is a trailer parked at the end of the street with a pump and equipment and they will look after their own area,\" Gibbs said. \"And we only have a population of 350,000.\"</p><p>Gibbs said the development of volunteer firefighting units was a response to terrible bush fires in 2003 where they lost 520 homes and 70 per cent of pastures, plantations and nature parks were severely damaged.</p><p>\"It was an absolute bloody disaster and in 2004 they changed things and amalgamated everything under one agency.\"</p><p>There are also urban fire departments in place that do structure protection that have paid firefighters, he added.</p><p>As for his time in the Cariboo, Gibbs \"loved\" it.</p><p>\"The first two weeks I was here we were just running on adrenalin from seven in the morning until 10:30 at night. We'd do 14 days on and two days off.\"</p><p>Praising the staff at the CFC and the newly-hired manager Mike Gash, who started on the same day as he did, Gibbs said they were very welcoming.</p><p>\"They were quite trusting, to be honest. They didn't know me from Adam. I hope I didn't let them down. It's nice to come over and think that you've helped or at least given people a break.\"</p><p>Gibbs is going home to a fire danger rating that is already high in Australia and they have just finished winter there.</p><p>\"The forest fuel index is 10, which is as high as it goes, and the forecast is for little rain and above high temperatures. We've had fires all up the coast already in the winter in areas which are supposed to be lush and green.\"</p><p>Carroll works for the government of Nfld. and Labrador in forest fire management and co-ordination.</p><p>He arrived in Williams Lake on Aug. 23 after spending one day at the Prince George Fire Centre.</p><p>During his time at the CFC he was chief for the planning section, tracking all resources, especially crews such as unit crews, 20-packs, initial attacks, contracts, emergency firefighters and structural protection contractors.</p><p>Compared to Newfoundland, Carroll noticed the BCWF approach was \"a lot more in depth.\"</p><p>\"What I mean by that is there's a lot more thorough planning and operations of course, just simply because of the magnitude of fires in the centre compared to what we'd experience back home.

I also got to work with very professional people. It was a life-time experience I don't think I'll ever experience again.\"</p><p>He felt honoured to be asked to assist, he added.</p><p>\"I just came to pitch in and help my fellow Canadians when in need.\"</p><p>Turcott said at last year's peak, there were over 1,200 out-of-province personnel working in B.C. for the 2017 wildfires.</p><p>\"I do not have an exact breakdown readily available for how many of them were specifically stationed in the Cariboo last year, but I would imagine the majority of them would have been split between the Elephant Hill wildfire and all the other Wildfires of Note that were burning in the Cariboo Fire Centre, since that's where the majority of last year's fire activity occurred,\" Turcot said.</p><p>\"Last year's out-of-province personnel came from every province and territory in B.C.,except Nunavut, as well as from Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand.\"</p><p>Turcot said resources in Canada are shared on a formal basis under (MARS), which outlines three categories of resources: equipment, personnel, and aircraft.</p><p>The MARS facilitates co-operation among jurisdictions, allowing resources to be loaned and borrowed as needed, while the Canadian Mutual Aid Resource Sharing Agreement sets out the terms under which resources can be legally shared, how resources will be made available, what costs will be involved, and the conditions for their return.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:news@wltribune.comLike\">news@wltribune.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-3661087</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T8K-84W1-JDH1-C1D9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1097\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Williams Lake Tribune Advisor</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 14, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Extended drones, chantlike repeating phrases, tolling chords, spacious reverberation: Those are meditative sounds, defying fracture or interruption, tuning out the momentary and the trivial, invoking concentration, absorption, ritual and rapture. It's the kind of music Nick Cave has chosen for \"Ghosteen,\" his 17th studio album leading the Bad Seeds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cave has been prolific and chameleonic since the early 1980s, when he emerged with the Birthday Party, the Australian post-punk band whose jagged songs introduced Cave's lifelong fascination with humanity's extremes: evil and transcendence, desire and violence, perdition and redemption, creation and annihilation. He started the Bad Seeds after the Birthday Party disbanded in 1983; since then he has written books, acted in and scored films (with the Bad Seeds' longtime musical director, Warren Ellis) and also led a raucously collaborative band, Grinderman. His music never settled into any idiom for long.</p><p>\"Ghosteen\" is an eerie, sombre monolith, a set of 11 songs that stretches over an hour and is grouped on two CDs. \"The songs on the first album are the children. The songs on the second album are their parents. Ghosteen is a migrating spirit,\" Cave wrote.</p><p>Throughout \"Ghosteen,\" the tempos are slow and slower, as songs circle through a handful of chords or hover in place while tension builds. Although the Bad Seeds still have the lineup of a rock band, on \"Ghosteen\" drums and guitars are almost entirely absent, replaced by the disembodied, sustained tones of synthesizers and string sections - built from Ellis' violin - behind Cave's brooding baritone, singing or speaking. Cave foreshadowed the approach with songs on \"The Skeleton Tree\" in 2016 - \"Girl in Amber,\" \"Magneto\" and \"Distant Sky\" - but those were interludes. This is a whole.</p><p>Throughout \"Ghosteen,\" Cave ponders love, faith, loss, consolation, mortality and time itself. Occasionally the songs' lyrics overlap, returning to insoluble obsessions; they wander among observation, parable, reminiscence and incantation, sometimes infusing the most commonplace sentiments with mystery. \"I love my baby and my baby loves me,\" Cave repeats again and again in \"Leviathan.\" The words arrive in a falsetto, a husky rasp, a calm affirmation and a whisper. He could well be invoking a partner or a child, a certainty or a longing.</p><p>In 2015, Cave's 15-year-old son Arthur had a fatal accident: He fell off a seaside cliff in England after taking LSD. Cave's raw grief was captured in a documentary, \"One More Time With Feeling,\" on \"Skeleton Tree\" and in an extended Bad Seeds tour. More recently, Cave has toured solo with a show called \"Conversations With Nick Cave,\" answering fan questions and playing songs at the piano. He has also posted compassionate, essayistic responses to his fans' letters at a site called \"The Red Hand Files,\" which is far more writerly and revealing than most performer-fan interactions. He has not put the grief behind him; he has learned from its presence.</p><p>From its title on, \"Ghosteen\" clearly continues Cave's mourning. And from the sound of the music, every song could be an elegy. But Cave isn't trapped in his sorrow or consumed by it; he has figured out how to live past it, to seek solace after desolation. In \"Sun Forest,\" as Satie-like piano chords emerge from an electronic haze, Cave places himself at a still point within a raging forest fire, intoning, \"I say goodbye to all that/ As the future rolls in like a wave, like a wave/ And the past with its savage undertow lets go.\" The song ends with a postscript, a fragile high vocal promising, \"I am beside you, I am within you.\" Those lines return later in \"Ghosteen Speaks,\" with soothing major chords cascading between keyboards and wordless vocal harmonies; Cave makes the same promise in full voice.</p><p>But the album doesn't offer an easy happy ending. The longer, even more contemplative songs in the second part question the hopes of the first. The 12-minute \"Ghosteen\" lingers over an orchestral introduction and moves into a chiming vision of bliss - \"A ghosteen dances in my hand\" - that soon falls away, leaving Cave to sing, \"The past with its fierce undertow won't ever let us go.\" And \"Hollywood,\" the album's darkly dramatic finale, pulses throughout its 14 minutes with a foreboding bass line as Cave sings about predators, abandonment and a child's death. \"Everybody's losing someone/ It's a long way to find peace of mind,\" he concludes. Recognizing that he's not alone is no consolation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2019101055955779</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7M-T7F1-F103-3315-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"759\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.
