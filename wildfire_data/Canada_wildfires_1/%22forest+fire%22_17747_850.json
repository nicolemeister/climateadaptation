Funded by Columbia Basin Trust, the ReDi program allows residents to give input on which local projects should be funded by the Trust.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This year, Valemount organizations are requesting a total of about $383,000 in funding, less than the roughly $493,000 available, said Village Grant Writer Taggart Wilson. Leftover funds will be rolled over into next year\u2019s ReDi program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ReDi grant process includes a public presentation of project proposals, held this year on Sunday, March 2nd, and a public survey which allows residents to rank projects on a scale of zero to five, with five indicating strong support. The survey can be accessed on the Village of Valemount\u2019s website and is open until midnight on Thursday, March 6th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This year, 11 organizations applied for the program, with a total of 12 projects.</p><p>Valemount Fire Department: Structure Protection Unit</p><p>The Valemount Volunteer Fire Department is applying for $16,550 to fund a Structure Protection Unit \u2013 a type of trailer equipped with pumps, sprinklers, a hose, and other tools needed to fight wildfires that encroach on buildings. The trailer would contain enough equipment to protect at least 35 residential buildings from a forest fire, according to the presentation.</p><p>\u201cThis is something that we need to help protect  homes that are outside of reach,\u201d said Donovan Gee, Deputy Chief for the fire department. \u201cAny interface homes where you have a lot of trees right beside a home that\u2019s a long way from a hydrant, you need to be able to protect that home somehow when the fire is approaching.\u201d</p><p>Legion Branch 266: Kitchen expansion and renovation</p><p>The Valemount branch of the Royal Canadian Legion is requesting $45,000 to expand and renovate the building\u2019s kitchen. The renovations would include installing a commercial three bay sink, a commercial dishwasher and a hand washing area. It would also allow the organization to expand its kitchen by another five and a half feet.</p><p>\u201cRight now, the space isn\u2019t really functional for us,\u201d said presenter Dave Blanchette. \u201cIt\u2019s a polka to try and get things done.\u201d</p><p>Rocky Mountain Racing Association: Water truck</p><p>The Rocky Mountain Racing Association, based in Cedarside, is applying for $40,000 to purchase a water truck. The Truck would allow the organization to reduce dust and contribute to fire suppression, said Tamara and Joel Cinnamon. The organization would use the truck to suppress wildfires in the Cedarside area if necessary, they said.</p><p>Organizers water the race track the night before a race to reduce dust, and they are currently renting water trucks, Tamara Cinnamon said.</p><p>\u201c[Dust] means the drivers can\u2019t see. It\u2019s a really big safety piece for us. It\u2019s also going to be an economic impact: more racers, because racers want to race on a good track. More racers results in more visitors,\u201d she added. \u201cIf we had our own water truck and we weren\u2019t taking away from the ones in town, we would certainly be available to go out on fires.\u201d</p><p>VARDA: Bike park trail rehabilitation</p><p>The Valemount and Area Recreation Development Association, commonly referred to as VARDA, is requesting almost $15,000 to rehabilitate the Bacon and Tinfoil Hat trails in the Valemount Bike Park, and to improve the skills development area in the main staging location. This includes assessing trail conditions, regrading worn-out sections, and installing drainage features, among other improvements, according to the organization.</p><p>\u201cStaff and volunteers spend countless hours every year on regular maintenance of the area, although there are times where regular maintenance does not cut it,\u201d said Tanner Ross, who sits on the Association\u2019s board of directors. \u201cThis project represents a one-time investment in essential upgrades that will extend the life of these important trails.\u201d</p><p>VARDA: Swift Creek study</p><p>VARDA is also applying for about $60,000 to fund another project, a study of the Swift Creek property. The Association hopes to enhance the property by developing it further, for example by establishing dry campgrounds for mountain bikers, said presenter Sean Kelly. However, the property falls within one of the Village\u2019s Development Permit Areas, meaning the Association will have to satisfy extensive regulations to develop the land.</p><p>Construction engineering company McElhanney quoted the Association about $60,000 to conduct environmental, technical and historical assessments on the property, Kelly said. The analyses will help identify future infrastructure and tourism opportunities for the Swift Creek area, and ensure future projects are built safely and sustainably, he added.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important that anything that\u2019s done on that piece of property is done properly with the right geotech and engineering behind it,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some ideas of potentially putting in some small campsites, day use areas, potentially toilet facilities. These are all just in the idea phase right now, with the goal of maintaining public access to the space and increasing recreation opportunities.\u201d</p><p>Valemount Curling Club: Door replacements</p><p>The Valemount Curling Club is requesting nearly $32,000 to replace six exterior doors at the club. Last year, the club requested about $50,000 to replace the club\u2019s exterior doors. Since then, the club has re-evaluated its request and attained more detailed quotes from contractors, presenters said.</p><p>Valemount Community Sports Day Association: Valemountain Days</p><p>The Valemount Community Sports Day Association is requesting about $18,000 to pay for activities and performers at Valemountain Days. The budget items \u2013 which include a petting zoo, the purchase of a dunk tank and cotton candy machine for this year and future years \u2013 were informed by consulting with residents and youths on what they would like to see at the event this year, said board member Rashmi Narayan. Additionally, the funding would contribute to sidewalk chalk murals, which would be created live by high school students at the event, said presenter Jory Wong.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeking to strengthen partnerships, have new events, keep the event free, as well as offer compensation for locals who have to volunteer their time to make this event fun,\u201d Narayan said.</p><p>Valemount Entertainment Society: TV guide and backup equipment</p><p>The Valemount Entertainment Society is requesting about $39,000 for two projects: an on-screen TV guide and the purchase of backup equipment for radio and television broadcasting. The TV guide would be located on a dedicated channel where users could see the schedule for the 20 channels locally available, said presenter Michael Peters. Additionally, the Society does not currently have a spare digital television or radio broadcast equipment \u2013 this means if a piece of equipment breaks, it takes four to six weeks to have it repaired or replaced, according to Peters.</p><p>\u201cThere is an online television guide that you can go to\u2026 but a lot of our viewers aren\u2019t really computer literate or they don\u2019t really want to get onto computers,\u201d Peters said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been asking us to put on an online television guide.\u201d</p><p>Valemount Learning Centre: Emotional intelligence program</p><p>The Valemount Learning Centre is requesting nearly $8,000 to provide an eight-week emotional intelligence program, which would allow residents to learn emotional regulation skills. The program is adapted from the Circle of Security Parenting Program, which teaches emotional regulation for parents and their children, and has been expanded to suit adults with or without children, said literacy coordinator Regena Bergen. The Centre will pay for food for participants, as well as a babysitter if parents of young children enrol.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be teaching the program, but I\u2019ll need a co-facilitator. My job is only 18 hours a week, so we\u2019ll have to pay me for a few of the hours to teach it every week,\u201d Bergen added. \u201cWe will be teaching it in September.\u201d</p><p>Valemount Marina Association: Boom Log Replacement</p><p>The Valemount Marina Association is requesting about $61,000 to purchase infrastructure that will prevent debris from floating through the Kinbasket Reservoir. Currently, the organization uses fir logs which are anchored to the bottom of the lake, said presenter Trent Clark.</p><p>The boom log replacement would consist of synthetic floating devices that could block debris, and would likely not need replacement for another 20 to 25 years.</p><p>Valemount Senior Citizens Housing Society: Ash Street Seniors Housing Project</p><p>The Valemount Senior Citizens Housing Society is requesting about $19,500 for the remaining touches on the Ash Street Seniors Housing Project. The money would fund more kitchen equipment, furniture for guest rooms, and maintenance equipment such as lawn mowers and snow blowers, said presenter Rob Hennigar. Furnishing a guest room would allow the organization to generate small amounts of revenue, he added.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re really down to the final straws \u2013 we\u2019re ready to open the doors. We\u2019re hoping [at the] end of March we\u2019re able to open it up and start having people come through,\u201d Hennigar said. \u201cOur only other way of earning this revenue is off the backs of people that live there. Other than raising rents\u2026 our fundraising ability is minimal.\u201d</p><p>Yellowhead Outdoor Recreation Association: Trail safety and enhancement</p><p>The Yellowhead Outdoor Recreation Association is requesting $30,000 for trail improvements, along with routine maintenance such as trail brushing and cleanup. This includes bolstering deteriorating bridges and boardwalks, widening narrow trails, and replacing old signage, said presenter Patricia Thoni. Among the trails targeted for improvement are Little Lost Lake, Swift Creek, Cranberry Marsh and Jackman Flats, according to the presentation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-0a85a5d901074fa99dc225de0b7c0a64</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB7-P3C3-S91V-F4KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1628\"/><timeReceived>03:53 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 13, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000813</classCode><className>GRANTS &amp; GIFTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001220</classCode><className>NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DLQ6</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE MATERIALS &amp; PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001620</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION FACILITIES &amp; VENUES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST000DSG4</classCode><className>KITCHEN REMODELING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001455</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A2W7</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000222</classCode><className>BUILDING RENOVATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The fire in the park's southwestern section was less than one hectare in size when it was spotted on Monday, according to Ontario's Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services (AFFES) agency. The agency deployed one firefighting crew to attack the blaze, which appears to have lit up just a few days after the park formally celebrated 80 years of operation. </p><p>It was one of four new wildfires that were identified late on Monday, including another small fire between Schreiber and Terrace Bay that has also been called out, the agency said. As of late Monday, there were 38 fires being monitored or fought by AFFES crews, with the majority \u2014 24 \u2014 merely being \"observed.\" Though the risk for new fires has been mainly high across the region, there was no word Tuesday on whether the province is considering implementing any bans on campfires or brush-burning. The largest active wildfire in the district is located about 50 kilometres northwest of the remote Severn River Provincial Park in the province's far north. That blaze had been mapped out at just over 15 square kilometres. \"This fire is being observed to allow the ecological benefits of wildland fire to take place as it would in the natural environment without human intervention,\" an AFFES spokeswoman said on Tuesday. Wildfire season, which officially began on April 1, has been light this summer compared to last year. So far this season, there have been 253 fires recorded across the province, compared to the 10-year average of about 525. The amount of area burned is also lower than previous years \u2014 about 231 square kilometres compared to nearly 1,960 square kilometres for the long-time average.

At 1:16 p.m., that day, the fire was reported as 0.3 hectares in size with two crews of fire rangers on site, as well as an EC130 helicopter.</p><p><br/><br/> People travelling in the area were told they would note smoke being generated by what grew to be a one-hectare wildland fire. Three Fire Ranger crews and an aerial fire suppression team were on site Sunday afternoon. Anyone out on area waterways was asked to steer clear of operations and allow aircraft ample room to work safely.<br/><br/> At 9 a.m. on Monday, Sept. 25, the fire was listed as \"not under control,\" on the ministry's interactive map.<br/><br/> By 11 a.m. on Monday, Sept. 25, the fire was considered \"being held,\" according to Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.<br/><br/> At 3:50 p.m., Parry Sound 14 continued to burn but was \"being held\" at one hectare. Three Fire Ranger crews were on site Monday.<br/><br/> By 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 26, the wildland fire south of Pointe Au Baril continued to burn but was labelled \"under control\" and remained at one hectare in size.<br/><br/> At 8:30 a.m. on Thursday, Sept. 28 the forest fire south of Pointe Au Baril continued as active but \"under control.\" By 3 p.m. the fire had been declared out.<br/><br/> There were 34 active wildland fires in the Northeast Region at 3:50 p.m. on Monday, Sept. 25. Of these, one fire (Parry Sound 14) was being held at that time but is now under control, one fire was listed under control and 32 were being observed.<br/><br/> The fire hazard was mostly moderate to high across the Northeast Region Monday afternoon, some pockets of the southern portion of the region were showing an extreme hazard this afternoon, generally east of Kawartha Lakes, through Bancroft and west of Carleton Place. Find the current fire danger ratings of West Parry Sound municipalities and regulations around burning here: West Parry Sound area fire danger rating 2023.<br/><br/> When waterbombers approach a body of water, boaters are asked to move close to the shore so they can perform their scoop safely. A waterbomber will not scoop from a lake or river if encroaching watercraft pose a safety hazard. Be safe, stay clear of waterbombers.<br/><br/> Also note, flying drones around forest fires is both dangerous and illegal. When you fly a drone near a forest fire, you can put the lives of pilots, firefighters and other emergency personnel at risk. Be safe, stay clear of forest fires.<br/><br/> Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services is responding to Parry Sound 14, which is a 0.3 of a hectare fire located approximately 1 km south of Pointe au Baril and west of Highway 69.

Among those were major wildfires in British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's a look at the most urgent situations in Western Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Northern B.C. sees rain and cooler temperatures, bringing 'excellent' conditions</p><p>As British Columbia continued to grapple with two wildfires of note - fires that are especially visible or threatening to public safety - the area received rain, cooler temperatures and more humidity, making for \"excellent\" fire fighting conditions, B.C. Wildfire Service announced Thursday.</p><p>The Parker Lake wildfire remained 2.5 kilometres southwest of Fort Nelson, with minimal growth, while the Patry Creek wildfire remained 25 km north, the service announced. The rain created favourable conditions for the next several days, but was not enough to break the long-term drought.</p><p>Encroaching B.C. fires lead to evacuation of more than 4,700 people</p><p>Two out-of-control wildfires in Northern B.C. prompted an evacuation order for the town of Fort Nelson, which has a population of 4,700. (About a dozen people have decided to stay back in order to help fire fighting efforts.)</p><p>Across the province, there were 123 active wildfires burning; 38 were declared in the last seven days and 16 were declared in the last 24 hours. Ten active wildfires were considered out of control, six were being held and 107 were under control.</p><p>In total, there were eight evacuation orders and five evacuation alerts. Evacuation orders were in place for the broader Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation, as well as the Doig River First Nation, Peace River Regional District, and Lytton First Nation.</p><p>The province has 401 firefighting personnel, two incident management teams, 60 aviation resources, 17 pieces of heavy equipment and 57 resources of structure protection.</p><p>Rain helps contain Fort McMurray fire, where 6,600 have evacuated</p><p>An out-of-control wildfire in the Alberta oilsands hub of Fort McMurray did not grow on Thursday thanks to cool, damp weather and hard-working crews. Still, about 6,600 residents remained out of their homes as some parts of Fort McMurray remained under evacuation order and other parts were on evacuation alert.</p><p>The fire remained about 200 square kilometres in size, some six kilometres from the southern outskirts of town.</p><p>It's the second time in eight years that Fort McMurray, a city of 68,000 people, has fled from fire. In 2016, a wildfire nicknamed The Beast destroyed more than 2,400 homes and forced 80,000 people to leave.</p><p>More Alberta communities</p><p>remain under evacuation alert</p><p>Across Alberta, there were 42 active wildfires and one wildfire of note.</p><p>An evacuation alert remained in place for the rest of Fort McMurray, as well as Saprae Creek, Gregoire Lake Estates, Fort McMurray 468 First Nation and Anzac, the Alberta government said Friday.</p><p>There were 224 firefighters, 22 helicopters and 57 pieces of heavy equipment assigned to the wildfire.</p><p>Manitoba fire forces 675 people to evacuate, some cleared to return</p><p>In Manitoba, wildfires led to the evacuation of the Cranberry Portage community, as well as Sourdough Bay, Twin Lakes, Whitefish Lake, Schist Lake North and Bakers Narrows Provincial Park.</p><p>Approximately 675 people were evacuated from the areas by Thursday, but the provincial government said on Friday that the fireline closest to Cranberry Portage was under control and as a result, residents of Cranberry Portage, Sourdough Bay, Whitefish Lake, Twin Lakes and Schist Lake North could return to their homes Sunday morning.</p><p>A fire near Flin Flon grew to a whopping 370 km in size while another near The Pas burned about 28 kilometres.</p><p>Efforts to suppress the massive fire near Flin Flon include the use of six water bombers, seven helicopters and more than 200 Manitoba personnel, the provincial government said. There were also 40 Ontario firefighters, five firefighters from Parks Canada, 20 from New Brunswick arriving Friday and 21 from Quebec arriving over the weekend.</p><p>With files from The Canadian Press </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2024051871528220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C28-HKK1-F197-51G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"688\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

No one was injured in any of the fires.</p><p>\u201cFireworks were responsible for numerous small fires that could have been far more serious in nature,\u201d the release stated.</p><p>According to local officials in the Barrie area, the chances of a widespread fire in the county forest caused by fireworks is highly unlikely for a number of reasons, including the types of trees in the woodlands and the amount of moisture in the air in our region.</p><p>\u201cThe forests within the Simcoe County area are comprised of a species mix, which includes deciduous species,\u201d said Graeme Davis, the county\u2019s forester. \u201cThis, combined with the more fractured nature of our woodlands and being within a climate which is generally high in humidity, means that we are at a much-reduced risk of catastrophic fire than other regions of Canada and beyond.\u201d</p><p>According to Davis, the county has included a plan to fight large wildfires when they discuss emergency preparedness, just in case.</p><p>\u201cThe county is not responsible for controlling wildland fires,\u201d he said. \u201cThe county does, however, play a key role in emergency management, including conducting emergency exercises annually, most recently in fall 2024, where the scenario was in response to a hypothetical fire in the county forests. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe also conducted a field exercise in spring 2024 with Wasaga Beach and the Canadian Armed Forces simulating a response to a large wildfire,\" Davis added.\u00a0</p><p>According to county officials, wildland fire response is the responsibility of the local fire departments, including within the expansive Simcoe County Forest. The county does, however, contribute several wildfire equipment caches that are maintained by local fire departments to support a response to a wildland blaze.\u00a0</p><p>Additionally, there are mutual-aid agreements in place with area fire departments and the county maintains contact with the Ministry of Natural Resources Aviation, Forest Fire, and Emergency Services Branch, which is included in exercises and planning.</p><p>Jeff Kirk, fire chief and director of fire and emergency services for Springwater Township, said he isn\u2019t in favour of a complete ban on fireworks.

(the Company or Integral) is pleased to provide an update on the field program completed in 2024 at the Burntwood Project in Manitoba. The program focused on advancing the understanding of the project's rare earth element (REE) potential through systematic sampling and geochemical analysis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Burntwood Project is a prospective syenite-carbonatite-hosted REE target located in northern Manitoba. The 2024 field program was designed to further evaluate mineralized trends identified in historical work and to explore for new zones of mineralization. Additionally, the Manitoba Geological Survey (MGS) conducted a parallel bedrock mapping program in the northwestern Burntwood Lake area, which has provided valuable geological context for ongoing exploration efforts.</p><p>The 2024 fieldwork was made possible through funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Mitacs, and the Manitoba Mineral Development Fund (MMDF). This collaborative funding support enabled Integral Metals to apply advanced exploration techniques, including geomicrobial and biogeochemical sampling, to refine mineralization models for the project.</p><p>Summary of 2024 Field Activities //st * Rock Sampling: A total of 442 rock samples were collected from outcrops to assess REE mineralization and alteration associated with carbonatite dikes. * Soil Sampling: 857 soil samples were collected in a grid-based pattern to evaluate geochemical dispersion and pathfinder element associations. * Biogeochemical Sampling: 109 black spruce samples were collected to test for their efficacy as indicators of REE mineralization in the region. * Geomicrobial Sampling: 860 soil samples were collected to assess microbial community signatures associated with mineralization.</p><p>The Manitoba Geological Surveys 2024 work built upon previous mapping efforts, benefiting from improved exposure due to a 2022 forest fire. Their findings included the identification of numerous carbonatite dikes within the Burntwood syenite complex, reinforcing the areas REE potential. The mapping also confirmed the presence of pegmatitic granite, quartz diorite, and tonalite intrusions, which will aid in refining exploration models. Furthermore, their study suggested an increase in the density and size of carbonatite intrusions in the northern portion of the complex.</p><p>Samples from the field program have been submitted to the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) for multi-element geochemical analysis, including assays for REEs, gallium, and associated pathfinder elements. The Institute for Microbial Systems and Society (IMSS) is currently preparing the soil microbial samples for sequencing. Results are expected before summer, and will guide the next phase of exploration at Burntwood, which may include geophysical surveys and drill targeting.</p><p>We are excited about the potential of the Burntwood Project, said Paul Sparkes, CEO of Integral Metals. This past years work significantly advances our understanding of the system, and we look forward to receiving assay results to refine our next steps. The Manitoba Geological Surveys contributions have been invaluable in refining our geological model.</p><p>Integral Metals remains committed to unlocking the value of the Burntwood Project through methodical exploration and data-driven decision-making. Further updates will be provided as assay results are received and interpreted.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>The scientific and technical content of this news release has been reviewed, verified, and approved by Jared Suchan, Ph.D., P.Geo., VP of Exploration at the Company, and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101. Verification included a detailed review of geochemical assay certificates, field notes, and geological mapping data provided by Childs Geoscience, who conducted the reconnaissance field survey. Spot checks were performed on assay data to confirm consistency with original laboratory results and compared field observations with reported sample locations to ensure accuracy.</p><p>On Behalf of the Board Directors</p><p>Paul Sparkes</p><p>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>825-414-3163</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@integralmetals.com\">info@integralmetals.com</email></p><p>ABOUT INTEGRAL METALS CORP.</p><p>Integral is an exploration stage company, engaged in the business of mineral exploration for critical minerals, including gallium, germanium, and rare earth elements, with the goal of contributing to the development of a domestic supply chain for these minerals.

The evacuation order covered parts of Ventura and Los Angeles counties.</p><p>The orders came as Los Angeles County officials announced the Eaton Fire near Pasadena that started Tuesday night burned more than 4,000 to 5,000 structures including vehicles.</p><p>Thousands of other structures in Pacific Palisades on the coast also burned.</p><p>The Kenneth blaze ignited less than 3.2 kilometres away from the El Camino Real Charter High School, where people are sheltering from the fire in Palisades. The two fires are about 18 kilometres apart.</p><p>Dozens of blocks were flattened to smouldering rubble in scenic Pacific Palisades. Only the outlines of homes and their chimneys remained. In Malibu, blackened palm strands were all that was left above debris where oceanfront homes once stood.</p><p>At least five churches, a synagogue, seven schools, two libraries, boutiques, bars, restaurants, banks and groceries were lost. So too were the Will Rogers' Western Ranch House and Topanga Ranch Motel, local landmarks dating to the 1920s. The government has not yet released figures on the cost of the damage or specifics about how many structures burned.</p><p>AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, on Thursday increased its estimate of the damage and economic loss to $135-$150 billion (US).</p><p>City leaders were encouraged Thursday after firefighters made significant gains at slowing the spread of the two biggest fires that had ignited block after block from Pacific Palisades to inland Altadena, a community near Pasadena.</p><p>Crews also knocked down a blaze in the Hollywood Hills, allowing an evacuation to be lifted Thursday. The fire that sparked up late Wednesday near the heart of the entertainment industry came perilously close to igniting the famed Hollywood Bowl outdoor concert venue.</p><p>\"While we are still facing significant threats, I am hopeful that the tide is turning,\" Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said Thursday.</p><p>Water dropped from aircraft helped fire crews quickly seize control of the fires in the Hollywood Hills and Studio City, Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass said. Much  of the widespread destruction  occurred Tuesday after those aircraft were grounded due to high winds.</p><p>Wind gusts were expected to strengthen Thursday evening through Friday morning, with another round of strong winds expected early next week, raising concerns that the conditions could worsen, the National Weather Service said.</p><p>But Thursday's daytime forecast provided a window for firefighters - including crews pouring in from neighbouring states and Canada - to make progress in reining in blazes that have killed at least five people and caused thousands of people to flee their homes.</p><p>Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Erik Scott said firefighters were able to keep the Hollywood Hills blaze in check because \"we hit it hard and fast and Mother Nature was a little nicer to us.\"</p><p>Fire officials said Thursday that they don't yet know the cause of the fires but are actively investigating.</p><p>At least 180,000 people were under evacuation orders, and the fires have consumed about 117 square kilometres - roughly the size of San Francisco. The Palisades Fire is already the most destructive in Los Angeles' history.</p><p>At least 20 arrests have been made for looting, and the city of Santa Monica declared a curfew Wednesday night.</p><p/><p>Canadian bombers, 'copters on the way</p><p>Canada's emergency preparedness minister says Canadian military personnel, their equipment and another 250 firefighters stand \"ready to support our American neighbours\" as wildfires devastate parts of Southern California. </p><p>Harjit Sajjan says in a social media post that \"Team Canada, with Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta, is ready to deploy 250 firefighters, aircraft equipment, and other resources as early as\" Thursday night. </p><p>Sajjan's pledge comes as the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre said Thursday that the U.S. National Interagency Fire Centre asked for two of its CL-415 Skimmer Airtankers to join the fight.</p><p>\"The request is being actioned but the delivery timeline is currently unavailable,\" the agency said. \"We are also proactively working to identify potential resource availability, should more requests come in.</p><p>The Canadian Press </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2025011074154037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DVT-SJW3-RS3T-P43K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"767\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

The five deaths recorded so far were from the Eaton Fire near Pasadena.</p><p>While those two fires were no longer spreading significantly, both remained at zero per cent containment, officials said.</p><p>In Pasadena, Fire Chief Chad Augustin said Wednesday that the city's water system was stretched and further hampered by power outages, but even without those issues, firefighters would not have been able to stop the fast-moving blaze.</p><p>\"Those erratic wind gusts were throwing embers for multiple miles ahead of the fire,\" he said.</p><p>Still, questions were being raised about why some hydrants ran dry and what caused the water system to buckle when it was needed most.</p><p>In Pacific Palisades, a hillside area along the coast dotted with celebrity homes, block after block of California Mission Style homes and bungalows were reduced to charred remains. Ornate iron railing wrapped around the smoldering frame of one house.</p><p>Roughly 180,000 people are under evacuation orders, and the fires have consumed about 45 square miles (117 square kilometres) - roughly the size of San Francisco. The Palisades Fire is already the most destructive in Los Angeles' history.</p><p/><p>Canadian bombers, 'copters on the way</p><p>The Canadian agency that co-ordinates cross-border wildfire response with the United States says it's working to send a pair of airtankers to Southern California. </p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, headquartered in Winnipeg, said Thursday that it got a request overnight for a pair of CL-415 Skimmer Airtankers to join the fight against the fires. </p><p>The request came from the U.S. National Interagency Fire Centre based in Idaho, it said. </p><p>\"The request is being actioned but the delivery timeline is currently unavailable,\" the agency said in an email to The Canadian Press. \"We are also proactively working to identify potential resource availability, should more requests come in.\" </p><p>Alberta was preparing to send water bombers, night-vision helicopters and incident command team support. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2025011074153143</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DVT-SJW3-RS3T-P3RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

More water bombers have arrived and neighbouring communities are stepping up to help those evacuated. CBC's Peter Cowen is covering this story and he's in Happy Valley, Goose Bay, where the evacuees have fled. Peter, What's the latest on the fires?</p><p><br/><br/>PETER COWEN (REPORTER):<br/>There's some good news. The first thing is that the fire near the town of Churchill Falls hasn't grown in size, and so the fire crews that I was talking to this morning are quite pleased that the work they did with four water bombers trying to contain it has been successful, at least so far, and the key thing they've been able to do is to keep the fire from jumping to the other side of the Churchill River because that river is acting as a natural barrier between the fire and the town. The other good news is they're getting some help. There are two Quebec water bombers that are sitting here at the tarmac in Happy Valley, Goose Bay at the airport, and there's another two on the way later today from Ontario, so they're going to have some extra help fighting the fire today.<br/><br/>PETER COWEN (REPORTER):<br/>So, Peter, you're in Happy Valley, Goose Bay. How is the community responding there to the arrival of the evacuees?<br/><br/>PETER COWEN (REPORTER):<br/>People here in Happy Valley, Goose Bay, have really stepped up to help the 500 or so people that have come from Churchill Falls last night they actually shut down the emergency center that they set up at the local YMCA. They didn't need to house anyone on the floor of the gym like they did the night before, and that's really because people here in the community have come out and just volunteered and said I've got an extra cabin or a spare room or you know, there's a bed that I'm not using. I met up with Ashley Bilard, who's from Churchill Falls he came with his family and his dog, and when he found out, it's going to be difficult to find a spot for the dog. A random woman walked up and said hey, I can take you, your family and your dog, which he says has made this whole experience a whole lot better.<br/><br/>ASHLEY BILARD (EVACUEE):<br/>I mean it's just somebody who, without being asked, going to a center where people are going to gather and just say hey, you know what I've got something to offer and you're welcome to it and that really is, is important.<br/><br/>PETER COWEN (REPORTER):<br/>So people are sitting around today they're waiting for some of that good news, hoping that these extra resources will make a difference on the fire because the thing they really want to do is just be able to get home<br/><br/>PETER COWEN (REPORTER):<br/>The CBC's Peter Cowen in Happy Valley, Goose Bay. Thanks, Peter.<br/><br/>PETER COWEN (REPORTER):<br/>Thank you.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCBCT-WR2406212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCBCT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C9H-NH21-JCWB-N22B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487018</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

For many years prior to that date he had lived in this part and was well known as a hockeyist, having played on several of the local teams.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good trapping \u2026 W. E. Evans and Albert Evans, who have been on the upper St. Mary's on a trapping expedition since January last, came into town this week with a splendid bunch of furs, each also had a fine set of whiskers.</p><p>Vimy Ridge heroes \u2026 The Editor, Cranbrook Herald, Sir, Don't you think it would have been better had you made sure of correct number of Cranbrook Heroes before you either specified names and number who fell on 9th April at Vimy Ridge. From a Sister of Another. (Editor's Note\u2014No other names than the two mentioned in the last issue of the Herald were known to the Editor. We would be only too glad to publish the names of other Cranbrook heroes of Vimy Ridge if the information is given us.</p><p>Missing hero name \u2026 Our attention has been drawn to the omission of the name of Private John MacDonald from the list of Vimy Ridge heroes mentioned in last week's issue of the Herald. Private MacDonald enlisted from Cranbrook with the 225th.</p><p>Police court \u2026 Three charges for alleged offences under the Prohibition Act have occupied the attention of Messrs. H. White and N. W. Burdett, Justices of the Peace, during the present week.</p><p>In the case of Edward Normandeau, bartender of the Canadian Hotel, the charge was dismissed on a technicality, it being brought out at the conclusion of the hearing that the stenographer who took down the evidence had not been sworn before the hearing commenced.</p><p>In connection with the charge against J .Brault the evidence for prosecution and defence has been heard and the magistrates will give their decision on Wednesday next.</p><p>Owing to the court being occupied with the Normandeau case on Tuesday, the hearing of a charge against J. Buchanan has been adjourned until Tuesday next, 16h instant.</p><p>Mr. Geo. J. Spreull is representing the city in all above cases. Mr. A.B. Macdonald is appearing for E. Normandeau and J. Brault, and Mr. W.A. Nisbet for J. Buchanan.</p><p>Sitting of county court \u2026 There was a special sitting of the County Court on Monday for the hearing by His Honor Judge Thompson on an action by Jones and Doris against J.O. Ingham in connection with a disputed account for alterations and additions to a residence onArmstrong Avenue.</p><p>After considerable evidence had been taken, the hearing was adjourned so that an inspection of the premises might be made.</p><p>Mr. W.A. Nisbet appeared for the plaintiffs and Mr. Geo. J. Spreull for the defendant.</p><p>Before the hearing commenced, Judge Thompson expressed himself very strongly on the utter disregard by the public attending Court here, of ordinary Court etiquette, which requires all persons present to rise when the Judge enters the Court room. Judge Thompson mentioned that this was not a personal matter, as far as he was concerned, but was simply showing proper respect to the Court. He hoped that no further reference to the matter would be necessary, but that in future the public attending Court here would be as punctilious in the matter of Court etiquette as the citizens of other points in East Kootenay.</p><p>Sitting of military appeal tribunal \u2026 His Honor Judge Thompson presided over a sitting of Military Appeal Tribunal No. 12 at the Court House on Tuesday morning.</p><p>Two appeals from Creston were on the list. George Huscroft who has been granted a three months exemption, applied for further exemption. The applicant's evidence failed to show that he or his father had made any effort to secure assistance in order to carry on their ranching operations. The appeal was disallowed. The hearing of James Edgar King's appeal was adjourned.</p><p>Mr. T.M. Roberts appeared in the interests of the Chief Public Representative.</p><p>Ear operation \u2026 Miss Della Drummond of the Cranbrook Jobbers Limited left last week for Spokane to consult a specialist for ear trouble. We learn that Miss Drummond was obliged to undergo an operation shortly after her arrival and from latest reports received may have to undergo another in a day or two.</p><p>We sincerely hope that the second operation, if necessary, may prove successful and that Miss Drummond may soon return fully recovered is the wish of her many Cranbrook friends.</p><p>Clauson's appeal is allowed \u2026 In connection with the appeal of T. Clauson against the decision of Magistrate Arnold, who imposed a fine of fifty dollars on the appellant after a search of the Queen's Hotel premises resulted in Chief of Police Hersey finding a bottle of whisky in a cupboard.</p><p>His Honour Judge Thompson after hearing the evidence and listening to lengthy arguments by Mr. A.B. Macdonald representing the appellant and Mr. Sherwood Herchmer, who appeared for the City of Cranbrook, has given a decision in favor of Clauson.</p><p>The Judge held that sufficient proof had been given that the premises in question are not a dwelling house within the meaning of the Prohibition Act and that the having or keeping of liquor on these premises would constitute an offence under the Act.</p><p>The bottle was discovered hidden amongst some curtains in a stove closet, but the appellant's evidence was to the effect that the closet contained curtains and other articles not in regular use and that the cupboard was never locked. He stated that he had no knowledge of how the bottle came to be in the cupboard and the Judge expressed the opinion that if Clauson had any liquor on the premises it is hardly likely that he would keep the same in an unlocked cupboard on a landing used by all those who occupied rooms in the hotel and to which cupboard not only his servants had access but which was liable to search at any time by the authorities.</p><p>The appeal was therefore allowed and the conviction quashed with costs to the appellant.</p><p>Walker-Fuller \u2026 On Saturday the sixth instant there was solemnized the marriage of Hugh Lanselot Fuller, of this place, to Margaret Ellen Walker. Mr. Fuller is an old-time rancher resident in this part and the bride is the eldest daughter of Mr. Arthur J. and Mrs. Walker, who came out from England some five years ago.</p><p>The ceremony took place at the residence of the bride's parents. Katherine Walker, sister of Mrs. Fuller, acted as bridesmaid, and James Lambert gave his support to the groom. The ceremony was performed by the Rev. E.G. Thatcher in accordance with the rites of the Church of England.</p><p>A reception was given after the wedding at which a great number of the intimate friends of the celebrants were present. The many presents received gave ample testimony as to the popularity of the newly married couple.</p><p>Furniture burnt \u2026 Mr. and Mrs. J. Johnson and family have left Fort Steele for High River, Alberta, where Mr. Johnson has work on one of the large ranches of the district. All of their furniture, which was shipped ahead of them, was burnt in a wreck at Pincher Creek. Mrs. Johnston had some very fine furniture and souvenirs and small things that she treasured that can never be replaced by money.</p><p>Start of \"The Herald\" \u2026 Twenty years ago on March 22, 1898, the first issue of the Cranbrook \"Herald\" was published.</p><p>The City of Cranbrook and the \"Herald\" were born simultaneously. When the townsite of Cranbrook was placed on the market in that year with the exception of Colonel Baker's house and farm, the place was a barren prairie.</p><p>The construction of the Crows Nest Pass branch of the C.P.R., the selection of Cranbrook as a divisional point and the partial control of the townsite by the Railway Company, were the chief factors which propelled the sale of lots at the time the townsite was placed on the market, but before many months had expired Cranbrook burst into a thriving town with well laid streets and sidewalks and many substantial buildings, a branch of the Bank of Commerce had opened up and the lumbering industry started with the old Leitch Mill.</p><p>The first two buildings to be erected were the old Cranbrook Hotel and the old Herald Office.</p><p>Mr. Fred E. Simpson, who till then had been boosting the town of Wardner, transferred his allegiance to \"Beautiful Cranbrook\" and brought into existence the \"Cranbrook Herald\" and no one will dispute that under his inspiring and breezy editorship the \"Herald\" played an important part in the up-building of the City and in advertising the resources of the District.</p><p>Perhaps only those who lived in the District in the early days before the coming of the railroad, when the hurricane deck of a cayuse was about the only means of locomotion, can fully appreciate the rapid development of Mining, Lumbering and Agriculture which has since taken place and the conviction that our marvelous resources have scarcely been tapped should breed an abiding confidence that during the next twenty years the Cranbrook District will assume a rapidly increasing share in the world's production, and that the City of Cranbrook will continue to reap the benefit of its location as the chief distributing centre for the District.</p><p>Fort Steele news \u2026 The masquerade given by the ladies of the Fort Steele Red Cross was well attended by people from Cranbrook, Bull River, and Wasa, as well as a large local crowd. Some very fine dance music was played by Geo James of Marysville, and dancing was continued until early morning.</p><p>The prizes for the costumes were awarded as follows: Ladies, best costume, Miss Frances Drummond of Cranbrook as a Chinese lady; character costume, Mrs. Ralph Henderson of Fort Steele, as a Japanese comic costume; Miss Margaret Simister of Fort Steele, as Brer Rabbit; gents, best costume, W. S. Bush of Wasa, as a brigand; character costume, Lewis A. Willicome of Fort Steele as Robin Hood; comic costume, R. Baker, of Fort Steele as Simple Simon. The costumes were judged by Mr. and Mrs. Douglas, and Mrs. Pownall of Fish Lakes.</p><p>The sum of $85.40 was realized at the door, the net proceeds amounted to $58.25 up to date.</p><p>Vimy ridge flag day \u2026 The Vimy Ridge Flag Day on Tuesday was conducted with the thoroughness that marks all the activities of the Cranbrook Branch of the St. John Ambulance Association.</p><p>The members were out early, attired in their attractive association costumes and armed with a supply of miniature flags that were in great demand.</p><p>No matter by which route anyone came downtown, no sooner did they reach Baker Street than they had an opportunity of purchasing a patriotic emblem and pedestrians not wearing flags were few and far between.</p><p>Those actively engaged in tagging, or to be correct \"flagging\", included Mrs. P.W. Green, Mrs. G.H. Thompson, Misses Melva Cartwright, Florence Erickson, Margery Fallows, J. Hallamore, A. McLennan, Edith McBride, A. McDonald, Marion and Madge Robertson, and Amy Woodland.</p><p>Special films were shown at the Rex Theatre. There was a matinee as well as the evening performance and with crowded houses the days results were considerably augmented.</p><p>At the evening performance vocal solos were given by Mrs. A.B. MacDonald and Mr. J. Venus. The theatre arrangements were in charge of Miss Hallamore, assisted by the Misses Drummond and the Misses Brown. After deducting expenses, the proceeds from sale of flags and theatre performances amounted to $275.</p><p>Cranbrook Masons \u2026 On Thursday a few Cranbrook Masons entertained their relatives and friends with an informal dance at the Masonic Temple. The Kootenay Orchestra provided the music in a very pleasing manner and Mr. W.P. Cameron made an excellent floor manager. Dancing was discontinued while supper was served at small tables seating six or eight people.</p><p>So enjoyable was the affair that many regretful remarks were heard when it concluded at two a.m. The splendid sum of $63.15 net was donated to the I.O.D. . local chapter.</p><p>It is proposed to hold another dance on May 24th, the proceeds of which are to be given to the local branch of the St. John Ambulance Association</p><p>Hospital ball \u2026 The annual Hospital Ball held at St. Mary's Hall on Monday was an excellent success, one of the largest crowds of the season being present.</p><p>Parker's Orchestra provided the music in their usual excellent manner and did much to make the dancing enjoyable.</p><p>The nurses from the St. Eugene Hospital, Miss MacDougall, Miss Simons. Miss Gregory, Miss Baker, Miss Horne and the Misses Carson, attended in a body, in uniform which made a most pleasing contrast with the light dresses of the ladies and dark suits of the gentlemen present.</p><p>Supper was served downstairs in buffet style, the room being tastefully decorated in gold and white, the nurses' class colors. Miss J. Jackson and Mrs. P. Mackle were in charge of the delightful supper.</p><p>The gratifying sum of $65 over and above expenses was cleared.</p><p>School news \u2026 The reproductions of the painting entitled \"The Fathers of Confederation\" will be framed by the pupils of the Manual Training School and placed in the different class rooms.</p><p>John K. Gilpin tendered his resignation as janitor of the Kootenay Orchards School, but was requested to continue to act for the present.</p><p>It was decided that all the gardening ground available at the Central School he put into vegetables.</p><p>Forest fire danger \u2026 The danger season for forest fires is near at hand. Rapidly drying soil has left the old grass, brush, leaves, etc., in a most perilous condition for starting fires.</p><p>An effort is being made by the fire rangers in this province to keep down the forest losses this year to a minimum.

When refilling, the sheer number of aircraft, as well as people on the ground _some of them civilians fleeing the flames __combine to create an \u2018\u2018intense\u201d situation, he said.</p><p>Thousands of firefighters were tackling multiple blazes that had killed at least two people and destroyed more than 1,000 structures across the Los Angeles area as of Wednesday morning, according to Los Angeles County\u2019s fire chief.</p><p>Coulson, which operates in the United States and Australia, said aircraft involved in fighting the fire include its double-rotor Chinook fleet and a smaller Sikorsky S-76 helicopter The company\u2019s social media post included a screen shot showing the flight paths of three of its water-bombing helicopters swirling repeatedly over the neighbourhood.</p><p>Canadians including Our Lady Peace singer Raine Maida and his family were among the more than 70,000 people forced to flee their homes. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve evacuated currently and our canyon is on fire,\u201d Maida told The Canadian Press.</p><p>Actor Eugene Levy, another prominent Canadian in L.A., told the Los Angeles Times that he faced gridlocked traffic as he attempted to vacate the area amid \u201cblack and intense\u201d smoke.</p><p>Dayn Nanda, a Toronto-born talent booker living in West Hollywood, described the view from his apartment as \u201capocalyptic.\"</p><p>\u201cEven just looking out of my window, the sky is full of black clouds and there\u2019s a noticeable difference in air quality,\u201d he said. \u201cThe winds are crazy. Things are falling over and breaking on my balcony.\u201d</p><p>Nanda said he moved to the city three years ago and knew wildfires were something to expect, but didn\u2019t imagine he\u2019d ever experience anything of this magnitude. While he wasn\u2019t personally affected by the blaze, he said several colleagues have lost homes.</p><p>The 30-year-old said he posted on social media to offer his spare bedroom to anyone displaced by the fire.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all going to come together and try to help each other in any way that we can. None of the glitz and glamour of L.A.matters at the end of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about your family. This really brings to light the things that matter, because all the material stuff you can lose in an instant.

The contract normally begins in September and lasts for between 90 and 180 days, with crews rotating in and out to ensure staffing.</p><p>Quebec Public Security Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bonnardel posted a message of support on X to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, saying the province is ready to send additional firefighters to the state if they are needed.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, which is operated by fire management agencies across Canada, said it has no resources deployed to the California firefighting effort, and there were no \u201canticipated requests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all going to come together and try to help each other in any way that we can.

Recent local flooding events remind us of the devastating impact of our changing atmosphere and variable weather events will be more frequent and severe into the future.</p><p>One of the most apparent ways in which we humans experience climate change is how it impacts our communities and the buildings we live in.</p><p>A flooded basement could affect the integrity of the building and the value of the property. An apartment that was never built for sweltering heat provides no respite of cooling at night. Though residents in Hamilton and Burlington have seen the changes in our weather patterns, we continue to build our cities not for the future but for an obsolete past.</p><p>For many homeowners, it is obvious older homes need to be upgraded. Windows need to be replaced and insulation needs to be redone. Not to mention, virtually all buildings are built to accommodate heating and cooling systems that rely on the very fossil fuels that create and worsen climate change.</p><p>While it's true some things get older and need to be replaced, right now we are building homes we know with absolute certainty will need serious renovations in the near future to keep them comfortable, safe and habitable in this changing climate.</p><p>Our provincial government has long ignored this inconvenient reality - and as a result, dozens of municipalities in southwestern Ontario have tried to fill this gap by instituting green development standards.</p><p>Essentially green development standards provide a more holistic set of requirements for a property. They set out performance standards that enhance property resilience to extreme weather while also reducing the embodied and future greenhouse gas emissions from any new building.</p><p>By ensuring all new developments meet these baseline standards, home buyers and tenants will have the assurance their property is ready for today and the future. Implementing green development standards can significantly boost the economy by fostering innovation and creating new markets. These standards give the housing market a predictable path for reaching net-zero emissions.</p><p>Job creation in the green sector addresses environmental challenges and social issues like unemployment and poverty. Green jobs offer decent wages, job security and opportunities for skills development and enhance the well-being of individuals and communities and lead to more inclusive and sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Many other municipalities already have green development standards and include Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Caledon, King City, Markham, Richmond Hill, Vaughan, Pickering and Oshawa. Even smaller communities like the counties of Grey, Wellington and Dufferin have developed green development standards.</p><p>So, how do we build our cities, buildings and homes for the future? We build communities that can manage ever-increasing extreme weather events. Every property is developed so it can play its part. For example, it includes how the community manages heavy rain. We design and build buildings that protect people from temperature extremes, maintain good indoor air quality when there is forest fire smoke outside and are already wired to accommodate solar generation on-site.</p><p>In summary, we develop properties and communities that maintain their value because they will withstand extreme weather and protect their inhabitants while promoting a sustainable economy. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2024122173995672</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DPJ-BYD3-RTRK-D0Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Because he knows the geography of the area intimately, he knew immediately how to get to one of the fires and what water sources would be nearby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cI knew that at least one of the strikes we could access by going up through the woodlot, up high,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou have to decide, OK, should we, in fact, respond? Is it within our scope? Can we do it? Is it safe? Safety is always number one, right? So, it\u2019s a dry, dry hillside, but I knew one little water source there, so we made the call to go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Valentine called the BC Wildfire Service to discuss the situation and the ASAP crew was actioning the fire with water and certified fallers by 9 a.m.</p><p>\u201cSo they knew. It wasn\u2019t a surprise to them \u2026 I was able to talk to them on the radio as they were surveying the new fires by helicopter and I was fortunate talking to be somebody I knew, so there were no surprises going on.\u201d</p><p>When BCWS arrived they left about 10 workers to work alongside the ASAP crew while others went on to develop a plan for the other two fires nearby.</p><p>Who is qualified to fight a wildfire? This action by Valentine and crew came at a time when some new questions are being asked in B.C. about who is allowed to fight a forest fire, who can train fire fighters and supervise them. At least three regional district boards, including the Regional District of Central Kootenay, in letters to Forest Minister Ravi Parmar, have objected to some aspects of new provincial initiative intended to give more fire response roles to community members.</p><p>In 2022 the province formed the Cooperative Community Wildfire Response (CCWR) program, set up to train and supervise rural community members to assist with firefighting.</p><p>This was a response to controversies over the past few fire seasons in which local B.C. community members have either defied evacuation orders and stayed to fight a fire, or were refused by BCWS when they offered their expertise and equipment to help fight one. Several communities pushed back loudly against the forest ministry, saying local residents\u2019 expertise, local knowledge and equipment were being wasted.</p><p>To enrol in the CCWR, a group must be self-organized as a society or as some other legal entity, and must take specific training from the BCWS. Only communities that do not have structural fire departments may enrol. The things that these neighbourhood groups are allowed and not allowed to do are clearly spelt out in the CCWR guidelines.</p><p>They may transport and supply resources (such as personnel, equipment and supplies), they may do mop-up work after the fire (for example, cooling ash pits), and they may patrol to prevent flare-ups.</p><p>But they are not allowed to attack or suppress a wildfire, enter an area that is under an evacuation order, or move/deploy BCWS resources.</p><p>According to the ministry there are 15 groups in the southern interior in various stages of signing up the the program. After local groups are trained and established they can be signed on as temporary employees and be paid for their work during a wildfire.</p><p>At the time of the Argenta fire in 2024, the ASAP group was in the process of signing up with the CCWR, and was not yet subject to CCWR\u2019s rules, Valentine said.</p><p>Pump on a stump Valentine moved to Argenta when he was a child and has never left. In the old days, he says, forest service personnel were locals who knew everyone, and fires were fought by locals.</p><p>\u201cThe forest service know who was good at what. They knew every road and trail. They knew who could fix a pump on the stump out in the bush. They knew who could fall dangerous trees. And maybe most importantly, they knew who was a good cook, because on those days, you camped on the fire, and at six o\u2019clock you were on the fire, ready to work.\u201d</p><p>More than 20 years ago, Valentine and others started gearing up to protect their remote community from fires. They started collecting equipment, with partial funding from the Regional District of Central Kootenay, but with only volunteer help. They built a fire shed. They got the late Dick Brenton, and later Valentine, trained and qualified to teach the S-100 and eventually the S-185 courses. The S-100 Basic Fire Suppression and Safety course provides classroom and field training and is the base-line requirement for anyone operating as a wildland firefighter. The S-185 Fire Entrapment and Safety course provides knowledge and procedures for avoiding fire entrapment, and survival measures in case escape is cut off. There are also several other BCWS courses either required or recommended for CCWR training. As an example of the kinds of knowledge community firefighters need, Valentine talks about water delivery:\u201cWhat kind of pumps? What you need to know about them? And we don\u2019t live in Kansas, where it\u2019s flat, right? We live in steep mountains, so it takes a lot of muscle to push water uphill, so you get into relay tanks.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t always have water on a fire, so you have to know how to deal with that when you have no water. And there\u2019s danger trees to deal with.\u201d</p><p>He added there is a lot to know about how to organize yourselves in an incident command system and how to set up your own dispatch system.</p><p>\u201cArgenta has been a stronghold of independent thinkers and doers for decades,\u201d said Deb Borsos, who is one of the original volunteers. \u201cWe don\u2019t find it strange that for 20 years already we have organized and co-ordinated our own fire crew to attack fires when they first hit.\u201d</p><p>Borsos has also worked, at various times since 2012, for the provincial government doing recovery work in communities after flooding and wildfires.</p><p>In last summer\u2019s fire, Borsos and the rest of the ASAP crew prepared the community for evacuation, organized and expedited various equipment and supplies, put up signage and ribbons, maintained gravity water supplies, watched for spot fires, brushed out out properties, moved flammable material away from buildings, installed water lines and sprinklers, organized food for their crew, and kept in touch with evacuees.</p><p>This was all done with the knowledge and co-operation of BCWS who were familiar with the group\u2019s capabilities and who paid some of the ASAP crew members to do this work.</p><p>Even though the fire grew to almost 20,000 hectares and caused an evacuation of Argenta and Johnsons Landing, no structures were burned and no one was injured.</p><p>More bureaucracy Valentine and Borsos are concerned about two aspects of how B.C. is rolling out the CCWR. One is the rule that a CCWR group is not allowed to fight a fire.</p><p>\u2018If responding promptly or remaining to do structure protection are not options acceptable to government I suspect a lot of these crews will respond anyway,\u201d Valentine said. \u201cAnd it will be a less than ideal situation.\u201d</p><p>He said there will be groups with resources in rural communities who want to be able to respond to a fire that starts near their community, and will either attack it while it\u2019s small or defend their homes if it is spreading.</p><p>\u201cI believe the best way to do this is with training, good communication, and in collaboration with Forest Service crews.\u201d</p><p>The second concern is that the province intends to introduce a third party between the BCWS and the communities. It wants regional districts to do the vetting and administration, and organize the training, for CCWR fire safety crews. In an email to the Nelson Star, the forest ministry stated that despite this regional district role, CCWR groups would still operate under the auspices of BCWS in the event of an actual fire.</p><p>Valentine said this would slow things down by inserting an extra level of bureaucracy into a situation in which it is \u201ccritical to try to mount a fast response to a wildfire start before it grows out of control. In the S-100 firefighting course it\u2019s known as the 10 o\u2019clock rule, or catch it while it\u2019s small before daytime heating begins.\u201d</p><p>He said this is where a trained and equipped fire response crew with experienced leaders can get the jump on a fire that starts near their community, while resources from BCWS can take hours or days to get there.</p><p>He said regional districts have no experience with any of this, and the Regional District of Central Kootenay agrees.</p><p>In a Jan. 28 letter to Forest Minister Ravi Parmar, RDCK board chair Aimee Watson said the regional district does not have the staff or the expertise to take on the new project of training and administering wildfire crews.</p><p>\u201cIncorporating the CCWR program, as currently outlined,\u201d Watson wrote, \u201cwould require significant administrative oversight and operational capacity \u2014 neither of which we have the ability to absorb without jeopardizing our existing responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>The Regional Districts of Kootenay Boundary and Columbia Shuswap have sent similar letters to the minister, both concerned about what they see as the downloading of provincial responsibility onto regional governments that do not have the resources or expertise to carry them out.</p><p>Valentine and Borsos say that the success of ASAP has been due to many years of positive relationship-building with BCWS in the region, and insertion of the RDCK into the mix could undo that.</p><p>\u201cIn Argenta we had a very positive, collaborative experience working with BCWS last summer,\u201d said Valentine. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where all this is heading or what the outcome will be.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20250313PRAA0004649616</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB3-MCY3-RTJS-94XK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1636\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Because he knows the geography of the area intimately, he knew immediately how to get to one of the fires and what water sources would be nearby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cI knew that at least one of the strikes we could access by going up through the woodlot, up high,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to decide, OK, should we, in fact, respond? Is it within our scope? Can we do it? Is it safe? Safety is always number one, right? So, it\u2019s a dry, dry hillside, but I knew one little water source there, so we made the call to go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Valentine called the BC Wildfire Service to discuss the situation and the ASAP crew was actioning the fire with water and certified fallers by 9 a.m.</p><p>\u201cSo they knew. It wasn\u2019t a surprise to them \u2026 I was able to talk to them on the radio as they were surveying the new fires by helicopter and I was fortunate talking to be somebody I knew, so there were no surprises going on.\u201d</p><p>When BCWS arrived they left about ten workers to work alongside the ASAP crew while others went on to develop a plan for the other two fires nearby.</p><p>Who is qualified to fight a wildfire?</p><p>This action by Valentine and crew came at a time when some new questions are being asked in B.C. about who is allowed to fight a forest fire, who can train fire fighters and supervise them. At least three regional district boards, including the Regional District of Central Kootenay, in letters to Forest Minister Ravi Parmar, have objected to some aspects of new provincial initiative intended to give more fire response roles to community members.</p><p>In 2022 the province formed the Cooperative Community Wildfire Response (CCWR) program, set up to train and supervise rural community members to assist with firefighting.</p><p>This was a response to controversies over the past few fire seasons in which local B.C. community members have either defied evacuation orders and stayed to fight a fire, or were refused by BCWS when they offered their expertise and equipment to help fight one. Several communities pushed back loudly against the forest ministry, saying local residents\u2019 expertise, local knowledge and equipment were being wasted.</p><p>To enrol in the CCWR, a group must be self-organized as a society or as some other legal entity, and must take specific training from the BCWR. Only communities that do not have structural fire departments may enrol. The things that these neighbourhood groups are allowed and not allowed to do are clearly spelt out in the CCWR guidelines.</p><p>They may transport and supply resources (such as personnel, equipment and supplies), they may do mop-up work after the fire (for example, cooling ash pits), and they may patrol to prevent flare-ups.</p><p>But they are not allowed to attack or suppress a wildfire, enter an area that is under an evacuation order, or move/deploy BCWS resources.</p><p>According to the ministry there are 15 groups in the southern interior in various stages of signing up the the program. After local groups are trained and established they can be signed on as temporary employees and be paid for their work during a wildfire.</p><p>At the time of the Argenta fire in 2024, the ASAP group was in the process of signing up with the CCWR, and was not yet subject to CCWR\u2019s rules, Valentine said.</p><p>Pump on a stump Valentine moved to Argenta when he was a child and has never left. In the old days, he says, forest service personnel were locals who knew everyone, and fires were fought by locals.</p><p>\u201cThe forest service know who was good at what. They knew every road and trail. They knew who could fix a pump on the stump out in the bush. They knew who could fall dangerous trees. And maybe most importantly, they knew who was a good cook, because on those days, you camped on the fire, and at six o\u2019clock you were on the fire, ready to work.\u201d</p><p>More than 20 years ago, Valentine and others started gearing up to protect their remote community from fires.

Crook spent much of his teenage years there\u00a0skiing\u00a0with the Larch Hills Nordic\u00a0Ski Club.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I grew up in Salmon Arm, and as a teen I trained at the Larch Hills Ski Club and represented B.C.\u00a0at the National Junior Championships (1983)\u2026,\" said Crook in an email to the Observer. \"While I was a teen skier in Salmon Arm, so many families helped me: Pat Hutchins would come to Canoe to pick me, Stig Keskinen would take me up to Larch Hills sometimes, and Reino Keski-Salmi himself \u2013 he would take me for swims and bike rides as we were both training for\u00a0the summer triathlon we used to have. He won over all, and I won the Junior Boys.\"</p><p>Keski-Salmi\u00a0was a founding member of the club and an international cross-country ski champion. He died in a\u00a0helicopter crash in 1985,\u00a0while working with a forest fire-fighting crew. In 1987, the former two-year-old Larch Hills Marathon was renamed in his honour.</p><p>\"He was a real mentor of young athletes\u2026,\" said Crook in an interview. \"He really did help me in practical ways as well as inspirational ways, formative ways.\"</p><p>Crook would give up skiing for running, which he continued after leaving Salmon Arm for university. He now has teenage\u00a0kids of his own in Ottawa, where he's a professor at Carleton University. After several decades away from cross-country skiing, he's now back into it, both skiing and coaching.</p><p>\"There\u2019s a cross-country ski club in Ottawa, a really big one, and I sent my kids there and was coaching there and this woman comes up to me at practice one morning and says, 'Are you the Zeba Crook from Salmon Arm?',\" shared Crook. \"I said I am. She identified herself as the little girl who used to sit in the back of the car when her dad would drive me up to practice at Larch Hills. Her dad is Pat Hutchins, a now retired teacher and president of the club in its early days.</p><p>\"I was a teenager so I barely remembered that, but I remembered so many people helping me, driving me up to Larch Hills because my family couldn\u2019t. So here I was, coaching the granddaughter, on the other side of the country, of one of the people who used to drive me up to Larch Hills\u2026That\u2019s kind of how small the cross-country skiing community is in the country, how tightly knit we all are.\"</p><p>Crook said about five years ago there was an exchange for 13-year-old skiers with the Ottawa and Salmon Arm clubs, which gave Crook and opportunity to bring one of his kids to Salmon Arm to ski the trails he trained on.</p><p>\"I got to see the new chalet and ski the trails \u2013\u00a0it was December so not loppet time,\"\u00a0said Crook. \"It was an amazing thing, because of how much was familiar and how much was unfamiliar \u2013 that weird mix\u00a0that I\u2019ve been here before but it\u2019s all new.\"</p><p>Crook will be\u00a0on sabbatical in January, and will be returning to Salmon Arm to compete in his first Reino Keski-Salmi Loppet. He said it will be a\u00a0very\u00a0meaningful experience for him, an opportunity\u00a0to pay tribute to an athlete who showed kids from Salmon Arm what they could accomplish.</p><p>\"He as one of Canada\u2019s top cross-country skiers \u2013\u00a0he won Canadian championships twice and\u00a0he put some good results in Europe. He was\u00a0one of the first Canadian cross-country skiers to do that\u2026,\" said Crook. \"It kind of showed kids from Salmon Arm that was an option.\"</p><p>This year's Reino Keski-Salmi Loppet offers a new 32-kilometre single-lap course, along with 17-,10-,5-,2- and 1-km courses.

(\"VOY\" or the \"Optionor\"), whereby the Company may acquire a 100-per-cent interest in VOY's North Star Group property, consisting of 2922 Ha in 21 contiguous claims and two mining leases, located 50 kilometres west of Snow Lake Manitoba, as well as the Jewel Box claim located 30 km east of Flin Flon (collectively, the \"Property\"). The terms of the Agreement include the following conditions:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Issuing 500,000 common shares on signing the Option and 500,000 common shares on the first anniversary of the Option for a total of 1,000,000 common shares of the Company, subject to final approval of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the \"CSE\");</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Complete exploration expenditures aggregating $350,000 on or before the third anniversary of the effective date;</p><p>Annual cash payments totaling $50,000 over the four years, including $10,000 received on signing the Option;</p><p>For the duration of the Agreement and after the Company exercises its option to purchase the Property, the Company will pay the Optionor a Net Smelter Return Royalty (\"NSR Royalty\") equals to a 1.5% aggregate of Net Smelter Returns as described in, and determined pursuant to, the Agreement with 0.5% which can be purchased for $500,000.</p><p>The Property represents a strategic growth opportunity for the Company. We look forward to further advancing exploration efforts and unlocking the full value of this asset for our shareholders. Boreal Gold Inc. is also pleased to welcome Voyageur Mineral Explorers Corp. as a shareholder.</p><p>The Property consist of three contiguous properties which are: the North Star Gold Property; the Gold Rock Mining Lease and the Sewell Lake Critical Metals Property which is contiguous with HudBay Minerals Rail Zone Copper Deposit to the south and the former Dickstone Copper Zinc Mine to the North.</p><p>The North Star and Gold Rock properties host a series of deposits along the same 2.5 km long structure. The North Star near the south end of the shear is roughly 2 to 4 meters wide with a grade averaging from face sampling around 0.29 oz gold/ tonne. The Gold Rock at the north end of the shear consists presently of at least two zones 0.5 to 3 m (2 to 10ft) wide but higher grade on average than North Star. There has not been a lot of drilling in between the two deposits which are approximately 1 km apart on the same structure. Also on this group are a number of parallel but narrower gold structures both to the west and to the east. The West Vein is parallel and immediately west of the North Star Deposit and the Richard Vein parallel and North East of the Gold Rock are most notable of these structures. Important intersects of the West Vein are 26.75 g/t Au over 1.1 m from drill hole NS-04-57, 76.18g/t Au over 0.7 m in drill hole NS-03-45, 30.68 g/t Au over 1.0 m in drill hole NS-03-02 and 191.70 g/t Au over 0.2 m in drill hole NS-05-87 (September 23, 2005, Wayne W. Valliant, Foran Mining Corporation NI 43-101 Report, filed on SEDAR). The Richard vein in the 2010 drilling returned values of 15.65 g/t Au over 1.5 meters in drill hole GR-10-115 and 14.41 g/t Au over 3.3 meters in drill hole GR-10-114 (Voyageur Mineral Explorers Corp. (VOY) Press Release April 28, 2010).</p><p>Prior to exploration efforts after 2003 on the North Star Group property, there were two periods of activity, pre war and post WW2. From 1915 to 1939 work consisted of mainly extensive trenching, pits and small shafts, and minor drilling by prospectors. The Federal Government geologist's report noted extensive high grade gold mineralization. 1n 1939 those that held the claims went off to war and apparently did not return to the property. The property sat idle until the resurgence of base metal exploration in the 1950's and the operation of the nearby Dickstone Copper-Zinc base metal mine.</p><p>From 1950 to 1988 Hudson Bay staked the property for base metals, carried out geophysical surveys and drilling on electromagnetic conductors and only had a cursory drill program on the gold structure before letting the claims lapse after which it was held by prospectors. The lack of development on this gold deposit after 1939 until 2003 was that it was tied up by Exploration companies not that interested in gold or by prospectors.</p><p>In 2003 Foran Mining Corporation (\"Foran\") carried out extensive work on the property under then President and CEO, Stephen Masson, after the acquisition of Foran's McIlvenna deposit the property was shelved in favour of the larger project. In 2007 Copper Reef Mining Corporation under Stephen Masson, after leaving Foran in 2006, acquired the property from Foran where it carried out three more drill programs, mainly on the Gold Rock Vein and Richard Vein as well as completed an VTEM Airborne Magnetic and EM Survey. After 2012 Copper Reef found it difficult to raise funds for the project, due to market conditions and much lower gold prices than we currently have.</p><p>Since 2003 the North Star Group property became an advanced exploration property where more than $9 million has been spent on it in the last 20 years with the following work completed:</p><p>Five major drilling programs, 135 drill holes at North Star and 143 drill holes at Gold Rock</p><p>Ramp access and underground development and sampling;</p><p>Large surface blast hole sampling and trenching together with extensive assaying for gold, trace elements and whole rock geochemistry. Average grade from blast holes and trench faces was over 0.35 oz/t gold. (Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Release April 16, 2003). Gold on April 16, 2003 was $332.60 to 333.40 oz (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usagold.com/daily-gold-price-history/\">https://www.usagold.com/daily-gold-price-history/</url>) compared to over $3300/oz US or greater than $4500/oz Canadian today.</p><p>Extensive metallurgical testing at Lakefield established 85% recovery of gold by gravity alone. LR10572-002-Progress Report #1(Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Release May 3, 2003).</p><p>A large grid covers the gold shear with mapping, prospecting and geophysical surveys carried out. The Shear is still open to the north and south and the grid can be extended to follow the shear on strike (unexplored). The shear zone in between the Gold Rock and North Star deposits has seen little drilling.</p><p>There is a two km of all-weather road to the North Star site, as well as 15 km of the Dickstone road being brought back to all weather road status with creek crossings improved and adjoining swamps lowered to improve road quality plan for this summer.</p><p>Numerous environmental surveys were completed, including: ungulate, rare plant, raptor, fish surveys and other surveys required for the establishment of tailings facilities.</p><p>A digital topographical airborne survey was carried out over the main area of the vein, and potential areas for tailings disposal and water intake.</p><p>Camp site and storage areas were established and permitted. These permits are still valid as is the road permit. A mill foundation; a concrete slab shop floor and a water waste disposal pond were completed.</p><p>A VTEM survey was carried out over the entire claim group in 2010.</p><p>Highlights from the history above were:</p><p>At North Star 2003</p><p>A 6,000 tonne bulk sample was extracted from a 120m long pit that was blasted to a depth of 6m and an average width of approximately 5m. The average grade from the pit face and blast hole is 0.35 oz/ton gold (13 g/t Au). Blast holes were drilled at 1.35 m (4 foot) centers.

(\"VOY\" or the \"Optionor\"), whereby the Company may acquire a 100-per-cent interest in VOY's North Star Group property, consisting of 2922 Ha in 21 contiguous claims and two mining leases, located 50 kilometres west of Snow Lake Manitoba, as well as the Jewel Box claim located 30 km east of Flin Flon (collectively, the \"Property\"). The terms of the Agreement include the following conditions: //st * Issuing 500,000 common shares on signing the Option and 500,000 common shares on the first anniversary of the Option for a total of 1,000,000 common shares of the Company, subject to final approval of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the \"CSE\"); * Complete exploration expenditures aggregating $350,000 on or before the third anniversary of the effective date; * Annual cash payments totaling $50,000 over the four years, including $10,000 received on signing the Option; * For the duration of the Agreement and after the Company exercises its option to purchase the Property, the Company will pay the Optionor a Net Smelter Return Royalty (\"NSR Royalty\") equals to a 1.5% aggregate of Net Smelter Returns as described in, and determined pursuant to, the Agreement with 0.5% which can be purchased for $500,000.</p><p>The Property represents a strategic growth opportunity for the Company. We look forward to further advancing exploration efforts and unlocking the full value of this asset for our shareholders. Boreal Gold Inc. is also pleased to welcome Voyageur Mineral Explorers Corp. as a shareholder.</p><p>The Property consist of three contiguous properties which are: the North Star Gold Property; the Gold Rock Mining Lease and the Sewell Lake Critical Metals Property which is contiguous with HudBay Minerals Rail Zone Copper Deposit to the south and the former Dickstone Copper Zinc Mine to the North.</p><p>The North Star and Gold Rock properties host a series of deposits along the same 2.5 km long structure. The North Star near the south end of the shear is roughly 2 to 4 meters wide with a grade averaging from face sampling around 0.29 oz gold/ tonne. The Gold Rock at the north end of the shear consists presently of at least two zones 0.5 to 3 m (2 to 10ft) wide but higher grade on average than North Star. There has not been a lot of drilling in between the two deposits which are approximately 1 km apart on the same structure. Also on this group are a number of parallel but narrower gold structures both to the west and to the east. The West Vein is parallel and immediately west of the North Star Deposit and the Richard Vein parallel and North East of the Gold Rock are most notable of these structures. Important intersects of the West Vein are 26.75 g/t Au over 1.1 m from drill hole NS-04-57, 76.18g/t Au over 0.7 m in drill hole NS-03-45, 30.68 g/t Au over 1.0 m in drill hole NS-03-02 and 191.70 g/t Au over 0.2 m in drill hole NS-05-87 (September 23, 2005, Wayne W. Valliant, Foran Mining Corporation NI 43-101 Report, filed on SEDAR). The Richard vein in the 2010 drilling returned values of 15.65 g/t Au over 1.5 meters in drill hole GR-10-115 and 14.41 g/t Au over 3.3 meters in drill hole GR-10-114 (Voyageur Mineral Explorers Corp. (VOY) Press Release April 28, 2010).</p><p>Prior to exploration efforts after 2003 on the North Star Group property, there were two periods of activity, pre war and post WW2. From 1915 to 1939 work consisted of mainly extensive trenching, pits and small shafts, and minor drilling by prospectors. The Federal Government geologist's report noted extensive high grade gold mineralization. 1n 1939 those that held the claims went off to war and apparently did not return to the property. The property sat idle until the resurgence of base metal exploration in the 1950's and the operation of the nearby Dickstone Copper-Zinc base metal mine.</p><p>From 1950 to 1988 Hudson Bay staked the property for base metals, carried out geophysical surveys and drilling on electromagnetic conductors and only had a cursory drill program on the gold structure before letting the claims lapse after which it was held by prospectors. The lack of development on this gold deposit after 1939 until 2003 was that it was tied up by Exploration companies not that interested in gold or by prospectors.</p><p>In 2003 Foran Mining Corporation (\"Foran\") carried out extensive work on the property under then President and CEO, Stephen Masson, after the acquisition of Foran's McIlvenna deposit the property was shelved in favour of the larger project. In 2007 Copper Reef Mining Corporation under Stephen Masson, after leaving Foran in 2006, acquired the property from Foran where it carried out three more drill programs, mainly on the Gold Rock Vein and Richard Vein as well as completed an VTEM Airborne Magnetic and EM Survey. After 2012 Copper Reef found it difficult to raise funds for the project, due to market conditions and much lower gold prices than we currently have.</p><p>Since 2003 the North Star Group property became an advanced exploration property where more than $9 million has been spent on it in the last 20 years with the following work completed: //st * Five major drilling programs, 135 drill holes at North Star and 143 drill holes at Gold Rock * Ramp access and underground development and sampling; * Large surface blast hole sampling and trenching together with extensive assaying for gold, trace elements and whole rock geochemistry. Average grade from blast holes and trench faces was over 0.35 oz/t gold. (Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Release April 16, 2003). Gold on April 16, 2003 was $332.60 to 333.40 oz (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usagold.com/daily-gold-price-history/\">https://www.usagold.com/daily-gold-price-history/</url>) compared to over $3300/oz US or greater than $4500/oz Canadian today. * Extensive metallurgical testing at Lakefield established 85% recovery of gold by gravity alone. LR10572-002-Progress Report #1(Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Release May 3, 2003). * A large grid covers the gold shear with mapping, prospecting and geophysical surveys carried out. The Shear is still open to the north and south and the grid can be extended to follow the shear on strike (unexplored). The shear zone in between the Gold Rock and North Star deposits has seen little drilling. * There is a two km of all-weather road to the North Star site, as well as 15 km of the Dickstone road being brought back to all weather road status with creek crossings improved and adjoining swamps lowered to improve road quality plan for this summer. * Numerous environmental surveys were completed, including: ungulate, rare plant, raptor, fish surveys and other surveys required for the establishment of tailings facilities. * A digital topographical airborne survey was carried out over the main area of the vein, and potential areas for tailings disposal and water intake. * Camp site and storage areas were established and permitted. These permits are still valid as is the road permit. A mill foundation; a concrete slab shop floor and a water waste disposal pond were completed. * A VTEM survey was carried out over the entire claim group in 2010.</p><p>Highlights from the history above were: //st At North Star 2003 A 6,000 tonne bulk sample was extracted from a 120m long pit that was blasted to a depth of 6m and an average width of approximately 5m. The average grade from the pit face and blast hole is 0.35 oz/ton gold (13 g/t Au). Blast holes were drilled at 1.35 m (4 foot) centers. (2003 Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Releases February 26, March 11, March 17, March 19, March 31, April 16). 2003 -2004 48 NQ drill holes with selected examples of NS-03-02 24.29 g/t Au over 2.2m, NS-03-05 14.94 g/t Au over 4.8m, NS-03-11 23.4 g/t Au over 2.5m, NS-03-32 31.98 g/t Au over 1.7m and NS-03-45 21.83 g/t Au over 1.5m. (2003 Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Release August 5, August 25). 2003-2004 Geophysical ground surveys, enviromental studies and geological mapping 2004 Spring Underground Development/Bulk Sample. Overall grade of 0.28 oz Au/ton over 2.2 m true width. An 8,000 tonne bulk sample was extracted from a sill 224m long at the 100 foot vertical level The underground sample from the 100 feet vertical level averaged 0.29 Au oz/t in the north part of the sill and 0.27 Au oz/t in the south part of the sill. (Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Release May 25, 2004).</p><p>All weather Road Completed 2003-4 Winter Metallurgical Testing by SGS Lakefield Research Limited, A gold recovery of approximately 97% with a gravity, flotation, and cyanidation process and 85% by gravity alone. (Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Release May 3, 2003). Drilled 35 NQ diamond drill holes, 4979.9m. Several drill holes returned excellent gold intersections. For example: NS-04-57 23.34 g/t Au over 1.9m and NS-04-71 16.33 g/t Au over 1.4m. 2005 Fall New Resource Estimate (North Star Only) 19,100 t, grading 10.6 g/t, at a cut-off grade of 7.0 g/t and are classified as indicated resources based on the close spacing of the data. Note high cut-off grade as gold was at $400/oz. (Roscoe Postle Associates Inc., Wayne W. Valliant NI43-101 Technical Report September 23, 2005), The estimate supersedes Pearson and Hogan (May 3, 2004) report of 28,000 t grading 9.3 g/t Au with a cut off of 5 g/t Au which was based on an Inverse Distance Squared technique on a resource block model using only diamond drill data. Using a 1 g/t Au cut off grade, the tonnage is 160,900 tonnes with an average grade of 3.61 g/t Au. 2005 Winter Drilled 50 NQ diamond drill holes on the extremities of North Star Zone. Stephen Masson departs as President of Foran. 2006 Copper Reef Mining Corp. acquires the North Star Group from Foran Mining Corp. At Gold Rock (The Resource for this Vein System has not been calculated) 2007 Geological Mapping and Prospecting, Discovery of the new Richard quartz vein, where a grab sample assayed 0.91 oz/ton gold. 2008 Drilling at Gold Rock, Drilled 79 HQ diamond drill holes, 2,873.7m.

(Voyageur Mineral Explorers Corp. (VOY) Press Release October 16, 2009). 2009 Drilled 33 HQ diamond drill holes, 1,176.9m. Several drill holes returned excellent gold intersections, such as: GR-09-81 11.02 g/t Au over 3.8m, GR-09-91 15.95 g/t Au over 2.9m, GR-09-95 6.95 g/t Au over 1.9m, GR-09-108 6.66 g/t Au over 3.95m, GR-09-111 5.78 g/t Au over 1.9m. (Voyageur Mineral Explorers Corp (VOY) Press Release January 27, 2010, July 30, 2010). 2010 Step out drilling at Gold Rock Drilled 23 HQ and 1 NQ diamond drill holes, 3,350.6m. Significant values from step outs are: the Richard Vein (A new vein to the North East) assayed 14.41 g/t Au over 3.3m (11 ft.) in hole GR-10-114 and on the Gold Rock Vein in a new deeper lens to the south assayed: 7.79 g/t Au over 2.1m. in hole GR-10-119 and 7.01 g/t Au over 2.3m in hole GR-10-125. (Voyageur Mineral Explorers Corp.

This portion of the grid is almost 25 years old and overgrown to obliterated as it was cut a few years (12) after a forest fire.</p><p>Geological Mapping, Prospecting and Sampling</p><p>The Grids from Lines 59+50 N south to L 46 N will require geological remapping and detailed sampling to bring it up to the standard and detail of the northern grids that cover the Gold Rock and Richard Veins, with special emphasis on the section in between the North Star and Gold Rock deposits.</p><p>Drilling</p><p>Selective infill drilling, as well as down plunge drilling on the Gold Rock Vein with a view of completing a resource estimate and NI 43-101 compliant technical report (never undertaken). Ultimately the plan is to drill off enough tonnes That the combined resource of the North Star and Gold Rock Vein Structures, with sufficient grade, will warrant to bring it to a prefeasibility study. Even if successful on the first pass, this objective will require a few additional drill programs.</p><p>Jewel Box Claim</p><p>The Gold Button showing on the Jewel Box claim is located approximately 8 kilometers west of the Gurney Mine, a vein gold deposit which produced approximately 25 000 ounces of gold in the 1930s.</p><p>The Gold Button area was staked in 1947 and in 1950 John Murray who drilled three holes totaling 140 m. The Vein structure ins narrow but high grade. Core from holes 11, 12 and 13 returned values of 199 g/t Au over 10cm, 511 g/t Au over 25cm and 143 g/t Au over 28cm, respectively. The gold intercepts were marked by quartz veining, visible gold and, in DDH 11 and 13, by chalcopyrite (Assessment File 90313). Grab sampling in 2011 by Copper Reef Mining Corporation returned values up to 64.88g/t Au and in 2020 confirmation sampling by Voyageur Mineral Explorers Corp. returned values up to 28.15 g/t Au from trenches on the narrow vein structure. No work is planned on this property for 2025, due to other commitments.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Stephen L.

(\"VOY\" or the \"Optionor\"), whereby the Company may acquire a 100-per-cent interest in VOY's North Star Group property, consisting of 2922 Ha in 21 contiguous claims and two mining leases, located 50 kilometres west of Snow Lake Manitoba, as well as the Jewel Box claim located 30 km east of Flin Flon (collectively, the \"Property\"). The terms of the Agreement include the following conditions: //st * Issuing 500,000 common shares on signing the Option and 500,000 common shares on the first anniversary of the Option for a total of 1,000,000 common shares of the Company, subject to final approval of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the \"CSE\"); * Complete exploration expenditures aggregating $350,000 on or before the third anniversary of the effective date; * Annual cash payments totaling $50,000 over the four years, including $10,000 received on signing the Option; * For the duration of the Agreement and after the Company exercises its option to purchase the Property, the Company will pay the Optionor a Net Smelter Return Royalty (\"NSR Royalty\") equals to a 1.5% aggregate of Net Smelter Returns as described in, and determined pursuant to, the Agreement with 0.5% which can be purchased for $500,000.</p><p>The Property represents a strategic growth opportunity for the Company. We look forward to further advancing exploration efforts and unlocking the full value of this asset for our shareholders. Boreal Gold Inc. is also pleased to welcome Voyageur Mineral Explorers Corp. as a shareholder.</p><p>The Property consist of three contiguous properties which are: the North Star Gold Property; the Gold Rock Mining Lease and the Sewell Lake Critical Metals Property which is contiguous with HudBay Minerals Rail Zone Copper Deposit to the south and the former Dickstone Copper Zinc Mine to the North.</p><p>The North Star and Gold Rock properties host a series of deposits along the same 2.5 km long structure. The North Star near the south end of the shear is roughly 2 to 4 meters wide with a grade averaging from face sampling around 0.29 oz gold/ tonne. The Gold Rock at the north end of the shear consists presently of at least two zones 0.5 to 3 m (2 to 10ft) wide but higher grade on average than North Star. There has not been a lot of drilling in between the two deposits which are approximately 1 km apart on the same structure. Also on this group are a number of parallel but narrower gold structures both to the west and to the east. The West Vein is parallel and immediately west of the North Star Deposit and the Richard Vein parallel and North East of the Gold Rock are most notable of these structures. Important intersects of the West Vein are 26.75 g/t Au over 1.1 m from drill hole NS-04-57, 76.18g/t Au over 0.7 m in drill hole NS-03-45, 30.68 g/t Au over 1.0 m in drill hole NS-03-02 and 191.70 g/t Au over 0.2 m in drill hole NS-05-87 (September 23, 2005, Wayne W. Valliant, Foran Mining Corporation NI 43-101 Report, filed on SEDAR). The Richard vein in the 2010 drilling returned values of 15.65 g/t Au over 1.5 meters in drill hole GR-10-115 and 14.41 g/t Au over 3.3 meters in drill hole GR-10-114 (Voyageur Mineral Explorers Corp. (VOY) Press Release April 28, 2010).</p><p>Prior to exploration efforts after 2003 on the North Star Group property, there were two periods of activity, pre war and post WW2. From 1915 to 1939 work consisted of mainly extensive trenching, pits and small shafts, and minor drilling by prospectors. The Federal Government geologist's report noted extensive high grade gold mineralization. 1n 1939 those that held the claims went off to war and apparently did not return to the property. The property sat idle until the resurgence of base metal exploration in the 1950's and the operation of the nearby Dickstone Copper-Zinc base metal mine.</p><p>From 1950 to 1988 Hudson Bay staked the property for base metals, carried out geophysical surveys and drilling on electromagnetic conductors and only had a cursory drill program on the gold structure before letting the claims lapse after which it was held by prospectors. The lack of development on this gold deposit after 1939 until 2003 was that it was tied up by Exploration companies not that interested in gold or by prospectors.</p><p>In 2003 Foran Mining Corporation (\"Foran\") carried out extensive work on the property under then President and CEO, Stephen Masson, after the acquisition of Foran's McIlvenna deposit the property was shelved in favour of the larger project. In 2007 Copper Reef Mining Corporation under Stephen Masson, after leaving Foran in 2006, acquired the property from Foran where it carried out three more drill programs, mainly on the Gold Rock Vein and Richard Vein as well as completed an VTEM Airborne Magnetic and EM Survey. After 2012 Copper Reef found it difficult to raise funds for the project, due to market conditions and much lower gold prices than we currently have.</p><p>Since 2003 the North Star Group property became an advanced exploration property where more than $9 million has been spent on it in the last 20 years with the following work completed: //st * Five major drilling programs, 135 drill holes at North Star and 143 drill holes at Gold Rock * Ramp access and underground development and sampling; * Large surface blast hole sampling and trenching together with extensive assaying for gold, trace elements and whole rock geochemistry. Average grade from blast holes and trench faces was over 0.35 oz/t gold. (Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Release April 16, 2003). Gold on April 16, 2003 was $332.60 to 333.40 oz (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usagold.com/daily-gold-price-history/\">https://www.usagold.com/daily-gold-price-history/</url>) compared to over $3300/oz US or greater than $4500/oz Canadian today. * Extensive metallurgical testing at Lakefield established 85% recovery of gold by gravity alone. LR10572-002-Progress Report #1(Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Release May 3, 2003). * A large grid covers the gold shear with mapping, prospecting and geophysical surveys carried out. The Shear is still open to the north and south and the grid can be extended to follow the shear on strike (unexplored). The shear zone in between the Gold Rock and North Star deposits has seen little drilling. * There is a two km of all-weather road to the North Star site, as well as 15 km of the Dickstone road being brought back to all weather road status with creek crossings improved and adjoining swamps lowered to improve road quality plan for this summer. * Numerous environmental surveys were completed, including: ungulate, rare plant, raptor, fish surveys and other surveys required for the establishment of tailings facilities. * A digital topographical airborne survey was carried out over the main area of the vein, and potential areas for tailings disposal and water intake. * Camp site and storage areas were established and permitted. These permits are still valid as is the road permit. A mill foundation; a concrete slab shop floor and a water waste disposal pond were completed. * A VTEM survey was carried out over the entire claim group in 2010.</p><p>Highlights from the history above were: //st At North Star 2003 A 6,000 tonne bulk sample was extracted from a 120m long pit that was blasted to a depth of 6m and an average width of approximately 5m. The average grade from the pit face and blast hole is 0.35 oz/ton gold (13 g/t Au). Blast holes were drilled at 1.35 m (4 foot) centers. (2003 Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Releases February 26, March 11, March 17, March 19, March 31, April 16). 2003 -2004 48 NQ drill holes with selected examples of NS-03-02 24.29 g/t Au over 2.2m, NS-03-05 14.94 g/t Au over 4.8m, NS-03-11 23.4 g/t Au over 2.5m, NS-03-32 31.98 g/t Au over 1.7m and NS-03-45 21.83 g/t Au over 1.5m. (2003 Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Release August 5, August 25). 2003-2004 Geophysical ground surveys, enviromental studies and geological mapping 2004 Spring Underground Development/Bulk Sample. Overall grade of 0.28 oz Au/ton over 2.2 m true width. An 8,000 tonne bulk sample was extracted from a sill 224m long at the 100 foot vertical level The underground sample from the 100 feet vertical level averaged 0.29 Au oz/t in the north part of the sill and 0.27 Au oz/t in the south part of the sill. (Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Release May 25, 2004).</p><p>All weather Road Completed 2003-4 Winter Metallurgical Testing by SGS Lakefield Research Limited, A gold recovery of approximately 97% with a gravity, flotation, and cyanidation process and 85% by gravity alone. (Foran Mining Corporation (FOM) Press Release May 3, 2003). Drilled 35 NQ diamond drill holes, 4979.9m. Several drill holes returned excellent gold intersections. For example: NS-04-57 23.34 g/t Au over 1.9m and NS-04-71 16.33 g/t Au over 1.4m. 2005 Fall New Resource Estimate (North Star Only) 19,100 t, grading 10.6 g/t, at a cut-off grade of 7.0 g/t and are classified as indicated resources based on the close spacing of the data. Note high cut-off grade as gold was at $400/oz. (Roscoe Postle Associates Inc., Wayne W. Valliant NI43-101 Technical Report September 23, 2005), The estimate supersedes Pearson and Hogan (May 3, 2004) report of 28,000 t grading 9.3 g/t Au with a cut off of 5 g/t Au which was based on an Inverse Distance Squared technique on a resource block model using only diamond drill data. Using a 1 g/t Au cut off grade, the tonnage is 160,900 tonnes with an average grade of 3.61 g/t Au. 2005 Winter Drilled 50 NQ diamond drill holes on the extremities of North Star Zone.

This portion of the grid is almost 25 years old and overgrown to obliterated as it was cut a few years (12) after a forest fire.</p><p>Geological Mapping, Prospecting and Sampling</p><p>The Grids from Lines 59+50 N south to L 46 N will require geological remapping and detailed sampling to bring it up to the standard and detail of the northern grids that cover the Gold Rock and Richard Veins, with special emphasis on the section in between the North Star and Gold Rock deposits.</p><p>Drilling</p><p>Selective infill drilling, as well as down plunge drilling on the Gold Rock Vein with a view of completing a resource estimate and NI 43-101 compliant technical report (never undertaken). Ultimately the plan is to drill off enough tonnes That the combined resource of the North Star and Gold Rock Vein Structures, with sufficient grade, will warrant to bring it to a prefeasibility study. Even if successful on the first pass, this objective will require a few additional drill programs.</p><p>Jewel Box Claim</p><p>The Gold Button showing on the Jewel Box claim is located approximately 8 kilometers west of the Gurney Mine, a vein gold deposit which produced approximately 25 000 ounces of gold in the 1930s.</p><p>The Gold Button area was staked in 1947 and in 1950 John Murray who drilled three holes totaling 140 m. The Vein structure ins narrow but high grade. Core from holes 11, 12 and 13 returned values of 199 g/t Au over 10cm, 511 g/t Au over 25cm and 143 g/t Au over 28cm, respectively. The gold intercepts were marked by quartz veining, visible gold and, in DDH 11 and 13, by chalcopyrite (Assessment File 90313). Grab sampling in 2011 by Copper Reef Mining Corporation returned values up to 64.88g/t Au and in 2020 confirmation sampling by Voyageur Mineral Explorers Corp. returned values up to 28.15 g/t Au from trenches on the narrow vein structure. No work is planned on this property for 2025, due to other commitments.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Stephen L.

Because he knows the geography of the area intimately, he knew immediately how to get to one of the fires and what water sources would be nearby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I knew that at least one of the strikes we could access by going up through the woodlot, up high,\" he said.</p><p>\"You have to decide, OK, should we, in fact, respond? Is it within our scope? Can we do it? Is it safe? Safety is always number one, right? So, it's a dry, dry hillside, but I knew one little water source there, so we made the call to go ahead.\"</p><p>Valentine called the BC Wildfire Service to discuss the situation and the ASAP crew was actioning the fire with water and certified fallers by 9 a.m.</p><p>\"So they knew. It wasn't a surprise to them \u2026 I was able to talk to them on the radio as they were surveying the new fires by helicopter and I was fortunate talking to be somebody I knew, so there were no surprises going on.\"</p><p>When BCWS arrived they left about 10 workers to work alongside the ASAP crew while others went on to develop a plan for the other two fires nearby.</p><p>Who is qualified to fight a wildfire?</p><p>This action by Valentine and crew came at a time when some new questions are being asked in B.C. about who is allowed to fight a forest fire, who can train fire fighters and supervise them. At least three regional district boards, including the Regional District of Central Kootenay, in letters to Forest Minister Ravi Parmar, have objected to some aspects of new provincial initiative intended to give more fire response roles to community members.</p><p>In 2022 the province formed the Cooperative Community Wildfire Response (CCWR) program, set up to train and supervise rural community members to assist with firefighting.</p><p>This was a response to controversies over the past few fire seasons in which local B.C. community members have either defied evacuation orders and stayed to fight a fire, or were refused by BCWS when they offered their expertise and equipment to help fight one. Several communities pushed back loudly against the forest ministry, saying local residents' expertise, local knowledge and equipment were being wasted.</p><p>To enrol in the CCWR, a group must be self-organized as a society or as some other legal entity, and must take specific training from the BCWS. Only communities that do not have structural fire departments may enrol. The things that these neighbourhood groups are allowed and not allowed to do are clearly spelt out in the CCWR guidelines.</p><p>They may transport and supply resources (such as personnel, equipment and supplies), they may do mop-up work after the fire (for example, cooling ash pits), and they may patrol to prevent flare-ups.</p><p>But they are not allowed to attack or suppress a wildfire, enter an area that is under an evacuation order, or move/deploy BCWS resources.</p><p>According to the ministry there are 15 groups in the southern interior in various stages of signing up the the program. After local groups are trained and established they can be signed on as temporary employees and be paid for their work during a wildfire.</p><p>At the time of the Argenta fire in 2024, the ASAP group was in the process of signing up with the CCWR, and was not yet subject to CCWR's rules, Valentine said.</p><p>Pump on a stump</p><p>Valentine moved to Argenta when he was a child and has never left. In the old days, he says, forest service personnel were locals who knew everyone, and fires were fought by locals.</p><p>\"The forest service know who was good at what. They knew every road and trail. They knew who could fix a pump on the stump out in the bush. They knew who could fall dangerous trees. And maybe most importantly, they knew who was a good cook, because on those days, you camped on the fire, and at six o'clock you were on the fire, ready to work.\"</p><p>More than 20 years ago, Valentine and others started gearing up to protect their remote community from fires. They started collecting equipment, with partial funding from the Regional District of Central Kootenay, but with only volunteer help. They built a fire shed. They got the late Dick Brenton, and later Valentine, trained and qualified to teach the S-100 and eventually the S-185 courses. The S-100 Basic Fire Suppression and Safety course provides classroom and field training and is the base-line requirement for anyone operating as a wildland firefighter. The S-185 Fire Entrapment and Safety course provides knowledge and procedures for avoiding fire entrapment, and survival measures in case escape is cut off. There are also several other BCWS courses either required or recommended for CCWR training. As an example of the kinds of knowledge community firefighters need, Valentine talks about water delivery: \"What kind of pumps? What you need to know about them? And we don't live in Kansas, where it's flat, right? We live in steep mountains, so it takes a lot of muscle to push water uphill, so you get into relay tanks.</p><p>\"You don't always have water on a fire, so you have to know how to deal with that when you have no water. And there's danger trees to deal with.\"</p><p>He added there is a lot to know about how to organize yourselves in an incident command system and how to set up your own dispatch system.</p><p>\"Argenta has been a stronghold of independent thinkers and doers for decades,\" said Deb Borsos, who is one of the original volunteers. \"We don't find it strange that for 20 years already we have organized and co-ordinated our own fire crew to attack fires when they first hit.\"</p><p>Borsos has also worked, at various times since 2012, for the provincial government doing recovery work in communities after flooding and wildfires.</p><p>In last summer's fire, Borsos and the rest of the ASAP crew prepared the community for evacuation, organized and expedited various equipment and supplies, put up signage and ribbons, maintained gravity water supplies, watched for spot fires, brushed out out properties, moved flammable material away from buildings, installed water lines and sprinklers, organized food for their crew, and kept in touch with evacuees.</p><p>This was all done with the knowledge and co-operation of BCWS who were familiar with the group's capabilities and who paid some of the ASAP crew members to do this work.</p><p>Even though the fire grew to almost 20,000 hectares and caused an evacuation of Argenta and Johnsons Landing, no structures were burned and no one was injured.</p><p>More bureaucracy</p><p>Valentine and Borsos are concerned about two aspects of how B.C. is rolling out the CCWR. One is the rule that a CCWR group is not allowed to fight a fire.</p><p>'If responding promptly or remaining to do structure protection are not options acceptable to government I suspect a lot of these crews will respond anyway,\" Valentine said. \"And it will be a less than ideal situation.\"</p><p>He said there will be groups with resources in rural communities who want to be able to respond to a fire that starts near their community, and will either attack it while it's small or defend their homes if it is spreading.</p><p>\"I believe the best way to do this is with training, good communication, and in collaboration with Forest Service crews.\"</p><p>The second concern is that the province intends to introduce a third party between the BCWS and the communities. It wants regional districts to do the vetting and administration, and organize the training, for CCWR fire safety crews.

Because he knows the geography of the area intimately, he knew immediately how to get to one of the fires and what water sources would be nearby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I knew that at least one of the strikes we could access by going up through the woodlot, up high,\" he said.</p><p>\"You have to decide, OK, should we, in fact, respond? Is it within our scope? Can we do it? Is it safe? Safety is always number one, right? So, it's a dry, dry hillside, but I knew one little water source there, so we made the call to go ahead.\"</p><p>Valentine called the BC Wildfire Service to discuss the situation and the ASAP crew was actioning the fire with water and certified fallers by 9 a.m.</p><p>\"So they knew. It wasn't a surprise to them \u2026 I was able to talk to them on the radio as they were surveying the new fires by helicopter and I was fortunate talking to be somebody I knew, so there were no surprises going on.\"</p><p>When BCWS arrived they left about 10 workers to work alongside the ASAP crew while others went on to develop a plan for the other two fires nearby.</p><p>Who is qualified to fight a wildfire?</p><p>This action by Valentine and crew came at a time when some new questions are being asked in B.C. about who is allowed to fight a forest fire, who can train fire fighters and supervise them. At least three regional district boards, including the Regional District of Central Kootenay, in letters to Forest Minister Ravi Parmar, have objected to some aspects of new provincial initiative intended to give more fire response roles to community members.</p><p>In 2022 the province formed the Cooperative Community Wildfire Response (CCWR) program, set up to train and supervise rural community members to assist with firefighting.</p><p>This was a response to controversies over the past few fire seasons in which local B.C. community members have either defied evacuation orders and stayed to fight a fire, or were refused by BCWS when they offered their expertise and equipment to help fight one. Several communities pushed back loudly against the forest ministry, saying local residents' expertise, local knowledge and equipment were being wasted.</p><p>To enrol in the CCWR, a group must be self-organized as a society or as some other legal entity, and must take specific training from the BCWS. Only communities that do not have structural fire departments may enrol. The things that these neighbourhood groups are allowed and not allowed to do are clearly spelt out in the CCWR guidelines.</p><p>They may transport and supply resources (such as personnel, equipment and supplies), they may do mop-up work after the fire (for example, cooling ash pits), and they may patrol to prevent flare-ups.</p><p>But they are not allowed to attack or suppress a wildfire, enter an area that is under an evacuation order, or move/deploy BCWS resources.</p><p>According to the ministry there are 15 groups in the southern interior in various stages of signing up the the program. After local groups are trained and established they can be signed on as temporary employees and be paid for their work during a wildfire.</p><p>At the time of the Argenta fire in 2024, the ASAP group was in the process of signing up with the CCWR, and was not yet subject to CCWR's rules, Valentine said.</p><p>Pump on a stump</p><p>Valentine moved to Argenta when he was a child and has never left. In the old days, he says, forest service personnel were locals who knew everyone, and fires were fought by locals.</p><p>\"The forest service know who was good at what. They knew every road and trail. They knew who could fix a pump on the stump out in the bush. They knew who could fall dangerous trees. And maybe most importantly, they knew who was a good cook, because on those days, you camped on the fire, and at six o'clock you were on the fire, ready to work.\"</p><p>More than 20 years ago, Valentine and others started gearing up to protect their remote community from fires. They started collecting equipment, with partial funding from the Regional District of Central Kootenay, but with only volunteer help. They built a fire shed. They got the late Dick Brenton, and later Valentine, trained and qualified to teach the S-100 and eventually the S-185 courses. The S-100 Basic Fire Suppression and Safety course provides classroom and field training and is the base-line requirement for anyone operating as a wildland firefighter. The S-185 Fire Entrapment and Safety course provides knowledge and procedures for avoiding fire entrapment, and survival measures in case escape is cut off. There are also several other BCWS courses either required or recommended for CCWR training. As an example of the kinds of knowledge community firefighters need, Valentine talks about water delivery: \"What kind of pumps? What you need to know about them? And we don't live in Kansas, where it's flat, right? We live in steep mountains, so it takes a lot of muscle to push water uphill, so you get into relay tanks.</p><p>\"You don't always have water on a fire, so you have to know how to deal with that when you have no water. And there's danger trees to deal with.\"</p><p>He added there is a lot to know about how to organize yourselves in an incident command system and how to set up your own dispatch system.</p><p>\"Argenta has been a stronghold of independent thinkers and doers for decades,\" said Deb Borsos, who is one of the original volunteers. \"We don't find it strange that for 20 years already we have organized and co-ordinated our own fire crew to attack fires when they first hit.\"</p><p>Borsos has also worked, at various times since 2012, for the provincial government doing recovery work in communities after flooding and wildfires.</p><p>In last summer's fire, Borsos and the rest of the ASAP crew prepared the community for evacuation, organized and expedited various equipment and supplies, put up signage and ribbons, maintained gravity water supplies, watched for spot fires, brushed out out properties, moved flammable material away from buildings, installed water lines and sprinklers, organized food for their crew, and kept in touch with evacuees.</p><p>This was all done with the knowledge and co-operation of BCWS who were familiar with the group's capabilities and who paid some of the ASAP crew members to do this work.</p><p>Even though the fire grew to almost 20,000 hectares and caused an evacuation of Argenta and Johnsons Landing, no structures were burned and no one was injured.</p><p>More bureaucracy</p><p>Valentine and Borsos are concerned about two aspects of how B.C. is rolling out the CCWR. One is the rule that a CCWR group is not allowed to fight a fire.</p><p>'If responding promptly or remaining to do structure protection are not options acceptable to government I suspect a lot of these crews will respond anyway,\" Valentine said. \"And it will be a less than ideal situation.\"</p><p>He said there will be groups with resources in rural communities who want to be able to respond to a fire that starts near their community, and will either attack it while it's small or defend their homes if it is spreading.</p><p>\"I believe the best way to do this is with training, good communication, and in collaboration with Forest Service crews.\"</p><p>The second concern is that the province intends to introduce a third party between the BCWS and the communities. It wants regional districts to do the vetting and administration, and organize the training, for CCWR fire safety crews. In an email to the Nelson Star, the forest ministry stated that despite this regional district role, CCWR groups would still operate under the auspices of BCWS in the event of an actual fire.</p><p>Valentine said this would slow things down by inserting an extra level of bureaucracy into a situation in which it is \"critical to try to mount a fast response to a wildfire start before it grows out of control. In the S-100 firefighting course it's known as the 10 o'clock rule, or catch it while it's small before daytime heating begins.\"</p><p>He said this is where a trained and equipped fire response crew with experienced leaders can get the jump on a fire that starts near their community, while resources from BCWS can take hours or days to get there.</p><p>He said regional districts have no experience with any of this, and the Regional District of Central Kootenay agrees.</p><p>In a Jan. 28 letter to Forest Minister Ravi Parmar, RDCK board chair Aimee Watson said the regional district does not have the staff or the expertise to take on the new project of training and administering wildfire crews.</p><p>\"Incorporating the CCWR program, as currently outlined,\" Watson wrote, \"would require significant administrative oversight and operational capacity \u2014 neither of which we have the ability to absorb without jeopardizing our existing responsibilities.\"</p><p>The Regional Districts of Kootenay Boundary and Columbia Shuswap have sent similar letters to the minister, both concerned about what they see as the downloading of provincial responsibility onto regional governments that do not have the resources or expertise to carry them out.</p><p>Valentine and Borsos say that the success of ASAP has been due to many years of positive relationship-building with BCWS in the region, and insertion of the RDCK into the mix could undo that.</p><p>\"In Argenta we had a very positive, collaborative experience working with BCWS last summer,\" said Valentine. \"We don't know where all this is heading or what the outcome will be.\"</p><p>Copyright 2025 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20250311PAB4702293</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F9N-NC93-RRW3-70CB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Group Ltd.

Council voted unanimously to give RFRS pre-approval to deploy a crew if officially requested by the provincial government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThis is just putting out feelers, looking for departments that can support,\u201d DeRousie said, although adding that RFRS could be asked as early as this week to come to California.</p><p>RFRS is prepared to send a crew and vehicle at BC Wildfire Service\u2019s request, DeRousie said, which would include a four-person structure protection unit and a truck equipped with a pump, water tank and hoses.</p><p>\u201cWe all know that the conditions are not getting significantly better there,\u201d DeRousie said of L.A., noting California\u2019s firefighter crews will need to be swapped out after two weeks of action. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be on the front lines.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just going to be helping out.\u201d</p><p>DeRousie said this could mean deploying sprinklers in more contained areas or putting out smaller brush fires in the Palisades, while California\u2019s fire protection department would continue to fight the bigger blazes.</p><p>Thanks to council\u2019s motion, DeRousie explained, the WorkSafeBC coverage that protects all city staff in Revelstoke would extend to cover RFRS\u2019s operations in L.A.</p><p>Coun. Matt Cherry asked about insurance and local taxpayer implications in the case that RFRS\u2019s vehicle was damaged or destroyed during deployment.</p><p>BC Wildfire Services is expected to fully reimburse the city for all expenses if a crew is deployed, and Revelstoke\u2019s taxpayers likely won\u2019t incur any cost, DeRousie said.</p><p>As he understands, RFRS\u2019s ICBC policy grants the same coverage in the U.S.for a work vehicle as for a personal vehicle, which ICBC staff confirmed is true on a general basis, though they noted vehicles may be rated differently based on where they go in the U.S.</p><p>To help cut expenses, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, run by the Office of the Fire Commissioner, Fire Chiefs Association of BC and provincial government, sets rates to cover all anticipated costs, according to DeRousie.</p><p>Without council approval, RFRS vehicles can\u2019t leave the municipal boundary, DeRousie said, meaning the same request must be asked to expedite support for neighbouring B.C. communities battling wildfires.</p><p>\u201cIn most likelihood, if there was damage to the truck, we would have to cover those costs up front, but we would then resubmit that invoice back to BC Wildfire for excess damage,\u201d he said, noting fuel, food and staffing costs should also be covered.</p><p>While repairs and maintenance are typically covered by BC Wildfire Service as needed, DeRousie added, fire departments must pick the vehicles they send carefully to ensure they meet specific provincial requirements.</p><p>As of Wednesday, Jan. 15, B.C. has 34 firefighters from all across the province helping crews in L.A., with 12 highly-trained technical specialists working as a senior management team and 22 BC Wildfire Service ground crew members deployed. Locations where the firefighters are from have not been confirmed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re following their lead, if you will,\u201d DeRousie said, adding that helping L.A.could result in a giveback from other fire departments, should Revelstoke need it.</p><p>Reflecting on the 2022 West Kelowna fires, he recalled more than 40 B.C. fire departments turning up. DeRousie added that B.C. would\u2019ve needed support from U.S.fire crews if the province\u2019s fire departments had exhausted their own services, and that Osoyoos regularly coordinates with U.S.fire departments along the B.C.-Washington border.</p><p>\u201cI think that if our community was facing the same challenges as the community of Los Angeles at this time, we would want everybody showing up as well,\u201d Coun. Tim Stapenhurst said at Tuesday\u2019s meeting. Coun. Aaron Orlando added that \u201cRevelstoke has a small department and a lot of forest around us, and we may need the support one day.\u201d</p><p>Coun. Tim Palmer also expressed support for potential deployment to L.A., though primarily because RFRS\u2019s request comes outside of B.C. \u2019s wildfire season.</p><p>\u201cOf course we want to help,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cIt\u2019s just in the blood of any rescue organization of firefighters.\u201d</p><p>After the fires began to burn in L.A., DeRousie put a feeler out to his firefighter staff to determine whether he\u2019d approach council Tuesday. He said there\u2019s no particular hierarchy for who gets picked first to respond to out-of-city calls.</p><p>\u201cWe try to reward the people who work the hardest in our city,\u201d he explained, calling the L.A.wildfires a tremendous learning experience for the chosen deployment crew, especially for a career firefighter to take a leadership role.</p><p>The only concern DeRousie raised, when asked by Cherry about \u201cany negatives\u201d council should know, is that as fire chief he can\u2019t leave Revelstoke while the team would be deployed, so he can maintain command remotely.</p><p>In such a scenario, \u201cI want to make sure that they feel the support that their chief is with them.\u201d</p><p>Black Press Media has reached out to BC Wildfire Service for comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">REVTME-news20250123PSDA0004571358</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">REVTME2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DYR-7JB3-RXF3-S0DN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438270</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

The funding will support FireSmart BC in increasing the province's resource capacity to manage wildfire risks and provide training to wildfire practitioners. The funding will also support the development and implementation of educational programs in schools that teach students how to make homes and communities more resilient to wildfires and increase province-wide FireSmart awareness through media campaigns, encouraging British Columbians to take proactive action to reduce the negative impacts of wildfires.</p><p>Keeping Canadians safe and healthy is a top priority for the Governments of Canada and British Columbia. By working with provinces, territories, Indigenous communities and international allies, the federal government continues to address and support the fight against wildfires to protect Canadian lives, as well as the health, safety, homes and livelihoods of our communities across the country.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"As we come to the end of another wildfire season, we are looking ahead to prevent and reduce wildfire risk in the next season and beyond. That starts with having the right tools and structures in place to keep British Columbians safe now and into the future.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jonathan WilkinsonMinister of Energy and Natural Resources</p><p>\"As the impact of climate change continues to create hotter and drier summers, we must adapt to the growing threat of wildfire in our communities. We know that wildfire doesn't respect boundaries, and the only way forward is to work together. This collaborative funding is a welcome addition as B.C. continues to accelerate wildfire prevention efforts and strengthen FireSmart education and accessibility.\"</p><p>The Honourable Bruce RalstonBritish Columbia's Minister of Forests</p><p>Quick Facts</p><p> Both Canada and British Columbia are providing $475,061 each over one year through the Resilient Communities throughFireSmart Program.FireSmart Canada, a national program within the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, empowers Canadians to increase neighborhood resilience to wildfires and minimize their negative impacts.

It is devastating to consider the lives lost in these wildfires and heartbreaking to think about the 12,000 homes and other buildings already reported as destroyed in the disaster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alberta is no stranger to wildfire devastation. When the request came through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre for help in assisting California, Alberta Wildfire answered the call by sending two fully-equipped wildfire crews, including 40 highly skilled and experienced wildland firefighters and two agency representatives.</p><p>If requested, additional Type 1 firefighters, incident Command personnel, and qualified support staff are also ready to go. As well, Alberta Wildfire is preparing water bombers, pilots, and contracted night vision helicopters to assist in California, should they be needed.</p><p>You may remember that during Alberta\u2019s record-breaking wildfire season in 2023, 115 firefighters and support staff from California came to help Alberta\u2019s wildfire response.</p><p>Alberta is committed to providing support and expertise to help protect the lives, property, and communities of our friends and partners in the United States. I\u2019m forever grateful to brave people everywhere who are willing to share their skills \u2013 and face extraordinary and dangerous circumstances \u2013 to keep others safe.</p><p>There are, of course, outstanding people who make valuable contributions in many different areas of life. Take, for example, those exceptional Albertans who dedicate their time and energy uplifting the lives of seniors across the province. The Government of Alberta is so appreciative of such people that for 26 years now, the Minister\u2019s Senior Service Awards have recognized and celebrated outstanding individuals and organizations for their service to Alberta\u2019s seniors. Nominations are now open for 202425 and Albertans are encouraged to nominate individuals, businesses, and non-profit organizations who showed kindness, compassion, and dedication for Alberta\u2019s seniors in 2024 and 2025.</p><p>Up to 13 awards will be presented this time around. This includes the Alice Modin Award, which recognizes a senior individual or couple for exceptional commitment to their community and the province through long-term volunteer service. This award is given in honour of Alice Modin, who campaigned for a Seniors\u2019 Day and paved the way for the provincewide Seniors\u2019 Week that is celebrated annually.</p><p>Two special service awards are also being featured this year. The first is the Bridging Generations Award, which honours individuals, groups or organizations that excel in uniting generations through shared experiences and backgrounds. The second is the Community Philanthropy in Action Award, which recognizes Albertans who mobilize community resources through philanthropic efforts to support seniors.</p><p>The deadline for nominations is April 30, 2025.</p><p>Did you know that the government of Alberta just launched a digital, interactive web map that allows people to learn about the origins of the names of almost 9,000 rivers, mountains, towns and more across Alberta? It\u2019s called the Alberta Geographical Names Web Map, and is a terrific tool to help Albertans learn about the rich cultures, people, and history that have shaped our province. This is just another way that Alberta\u2019s government is strengthening our province\u2019s heritage by expanding resources, promoting preservation, and celebrating Alberta\u2019s unique cultural heritage and identity.</p><p>The minister of Arts, Culture and the Status of Women is responsible for naming geographical places in Alberta. If you\u2019d like to make a suggestion for a new place name or for a change to an existing place name, there\u2019s a program set up for that. The Alberta Geographical Names Program provides an application on their website for such proposals.</p><p>I have mentioned before the success of the first round of public engagements set up by the Ministry of Health to gather feedback and input from Albertans and health care providers on the new, refocused health care system. Between January and June of 2024, 65 in-person public sessions were held across the province. Almost 3,000 Albertans, health care workers, patients, and caregivers participated. More than 18,000 people also shared their feedback through online tools and almost 10,000 people participated in virtual town halls.</p><p>The findings from the first round have been summarized in a report called What We Heard, and have helped guide the design and implementation of the refocused health care system.</p><p>The Ministry of Health has announced that they will continue the conversation with Albertans about building a health care system that works for all Albertans, and will hold a second round of engagements, including in-person public sessions, beginning Jan. 21. These sessions will update Albertans on the latest refocusing work, will gather perspectives on access to health care and the current experiences of the health care workforce, and identify opportunities to improve local decision-making. There\u2019s a session scheduled in Wetaskiwin on Friday, April 11, 2025 from 12 to 2 p.m.</p><p>Also on the health care front, I am pleased to share the very good news that on Dec. 19, the province announced a new compensation model for primary care physicians with a panel size of 500 or more patients. This new model comes as a result of extensive discussions and collaboration with the Alberta Medical Association; it will improve access to family physicians and stabilize hospital services across Alberta.</p><p>I hope the first few weeks of this new year have been good for you and that you have plenty to look forward to in the weeks ahead!</p><p>Hon.

Few people could have predicted that a comment he made then, dismissing victims of Chile\u2019s most notorious pedophile, would blow up into the biggest crisis of his papacy. But it was one that eventually set the Catholic Church on a new path of accountability for clergy sexual abuse.

The FDA currently allows 36 color additives, including eight synthetic dyes. In January, the agency banned the color known as Red 3.</p><p>WORDS: 1107 - MOVED: 04/22/2025 6:23 p.m. EDT</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:6f6c1aa08aafdae1925718804f360c0b&amp;mediaType=text\">https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:6f6c1aa08aafdae1925718804f360c0b&amp;mediaType=text</url></p><p>___</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>CLIMATE-CORAL BLEACHING</p><p>84% of the world\u2019s coral reefs hit by worst bleaching event on record</p><p>SUMMARY: Harmful bleaching of the world\u2019s coral has now grown to include 84% of the ocean\u2019s reefs in the most intense event of its kind in recorded history. That\u2019s according to the International Coral Reef Initiative. Warming oceans cause corals to expel the colorful algae living inside of them, putting the coral at risk of death. Healthy corals are essential for seafood production, jobs and coastline protection worldwide. Scientists say it\u2019s essential to reduce greenhouse gases that are the main driver of atmospheric warming. Last year was the warmest on record, and much of that heat is going into oceans.</p><p>WORDS: 632 - MOVED: 04/23/2025 2:44 a.m. EDT</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:fdbeddf7ae3ccc9d7cf85d1c3267e581&amp;mediaType=text\">https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:fdbeddf7ae3ccc9d7cf85d1c3267e581&amp;mediaType=text</url></p><p>___</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>EDUCATION</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>US--EDUCATION-INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS</p><p>International students stripped of legal status in the US are piling up wins in court</p><p>SUMMARY: Some international students in the U.S. who have had their legal status terminated in recent weeks have found a measure of success in court, with federal judges around the country issuing orders to restore students\u2019 status at least temporarily.

Crook spent much of his teenage years there\u00a0skiing\u00a0with the Larch Hills Nordic\u00a0Ski Club.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I grew up in Salmon Arm, and as a teen I trained at the Larch Hills Ski Club and represented B.C.\u00a0at the National Junior Championships (1983)\u2026,\" said Crook in an email to the Observer. \"While I was a teen skier in Salmon Arm, so many families helped me: Pat Hutchin\u00a0would come to Canoe to pick me, Stig Keskinen would take me up to Larch Hills sometimes, and Reino Keski-Salmi himself \u2013 he would take me for swims and bike rides as we were both training for\u00a0the summer triathlon we used to have. He won over all, and I won the Junior Boys.\"</p><p>Keski-Salmi\u00a0was a founding member of the club and an international cross-country ski champion. He died in a\u00a0helicopter crash in 1985,\u00a0while working with a forest fire-fighting crew. In 1987, the former two-year-old Larch Hills Marathon was renamed in his honour.</p><p>\"He was a real mentor of young athletes\u2026,\" said Crook in an interview. \"He really did help me in practical ways as well as inspirational ways, formative ways.\"</p><p>Crook would give up skiing for running, which he continued after leaving Salmon Arm for university. He now has teenage\u00a0kids of his own in Ottawa, where he's a professor at Carleton University. After several decades away from cross-country skiing, he's now back into it, both skiing and coaching.</p><p>\"There\u2019s a cross-country ski club in Ottawa, a really big one, and I sent my kids there and was coaching there and this woman comes up to me at practice one morning and says, 'Are you the Zeba Crook from Salmon Arm?',\" shared Crook. \"I said I am. She identified herself as the little girl who used to sit in the back of the car when her dad would drive me up to practice at Larch Hills. Her dad is Pat Hutchins, a now retired teacher and president of the club in its early days.</p><p>\"I was a teenager so I barely remembered that, but I remembered so many people helping me, driving me up to Larch Hills because my family couldn\u2019t. So here I was, coaching the granddaughter, on the other side of the country, of one of the people who used to drive me up to Larch Hills\u2026That\u2019s kind of how small the cross-country skiing community is in the country, how tightly knit we all are.\"</p><p>Crook said about five years ago there was an exchange for 13-year-old skiers with the Ottawa and Salmon Arm clubs, which gave Crook and opportunity to bring one of his kids to Salmon Arm to ski the trails he trained on.</p><p>\"I got to see the new chalet and ski the trails \u2013\u00a0it was December so not loppet time,\"\u00a0said Crook. \"It was an amazing thing, because of how much was familiar and how much was unfamiliar \u2013 that weird mix\u00a0that I\u2019ve been here before but it\u2019s all new.\"</p><p>Crook will be\u00a0on sabbatical in January, and will be returning to Salmon Arm to compete in his first Reino Keski-Salmi Loppet. He said it will be a\u00a0very\u00a0meaningful experience for him, an opportunity\u00a0to pay tribute to an athlete who showed kids from Salmon Arm what they could accomplish.</p><p>\"He as one of Canada\u2019s top cross-country skiers \u2013\u00a0he won Canadian championships twice and\u00a0he put some good results in Europe. He was\u00a0one of the first Canadian cross-country skiers to do that\u2026,\" said Crook. \"It kind of showed kids from Salmon Arm that was an option.\"</p><p>This year's Reino Keski-Salmi Loppet offers a new 32-kilometre single-lap course, along with 17-,10-,5-,2- and 1-km courses.

When refilling, the sheer number of aircraft, as well as people on the ground \u2014 some of them civilians fleeing the flames \u2014 combine to create an \u201cintense\u201d situation, he said.</p><p>Thousands of firefighters were tackling multiple blazes that had killed at least two people and destroyed more than 1,000 structures across the Los Angeles area as of Wednesday morning, according to Los Angeles County\u2019s fire chief.</p><p>Coulson, which operates in the United States and Australia, said aircraft involved in fighting the fire include its double-rotor Chinook fleet and a smaller Sikorsky S-76 helicopter.

Crook spent much of his teenage years there\u00a0skiing\u00a0with the Larch Hills Nordic\u00a0Ski Club.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I grew up in Salmon Arm, and as a teen I trained at the Larch Hills Ski Club and represented B.C.\u00a0at the National Junior Championships (1983)\u2026,\" said Crook in an email to the Observer. \"While I was a teen skier in Salmon Arm, so many families helped me: Pat Smith would come to Canoe to pick me, Stig Keskinen would take me up to Larch Hills sometimes, and Reino Keski-Salmi himself \u2013 he would take me for swims and bike rides as we were both training for\u00a0the summer triathlon we used to have. He won over all, and I won the Junior Boys.\"</p><p>Keski-Salmi\u00a0was a founding member of the club and an international cross-country ski champion. He died in a\u00a0helicopter crash in 1985,\u00a0while working with a forest fire-fighting crew. In 1987, the former two-year-old Larch Hills Marathon was renamed in his honour.</p><p>\"He was a real mentor of young athletes\u2026,\" said Crook in an interview. \"He really did help me in practical ways as well as inspirational ways, formative ways.\"</p><p>Crook would give up skiing for running, which he continued after leaving Salmon Arm for university. He now has teenage\u00a0kids of his own in Ottawa, where he's a professor at Carleton University. After several decades away from cross-country skiing, he's now back into it, both skiing and coaching.</p><p>\"There\u2019s a cross-country ski club in Ottawa, a really big one, and I sent my kids there and was coaching there and this woman comes up to me at practice one morning and says, 'Are you the Zeba Crook from Salmon Arm?',\" shared Crook. \"I said I am. She identified herself as the little girl who used to sit in the back of the car when her dad would drive me up to practice at Larch Hills. Her dad is Pat Hutchins, a now retired teacher and president of the club in its early days.</p><p>\"I was a teenager so I barely remembered that, but I remembered so many people helping me, driving me up to Larch Hills because my family couldn\u2019t. So here I was, coaching the granddaughter, on the other side of the country, of one of the people who used to drive me up to Larch Hills\u2026That\u2019s kind of how small the cross-country skiing community is in the country, how tightly knit we all are.\"</p><p>Crook said about five years ago there was an exchange for 13-year-old skiers with the Ottawa and Salmon Arm clubs, which gave Crook and opportunity to bring one of his kids to Salmon Arm to ski the trails he trained on.</p><p>\"I got to see the new chalet and ski the trails \u2013\u00a0it was December so not loppet time,\"\u00a0said Crook. \"It was an amazing thing, because of how much was familiar and how much was unfamiliar \u2013 that weird mix\u00a0that I\u2019ve been here before but it\u2019s all new.\"</p><p>Crook will be\u00a0on sabbatical in January, and will be returning to Salmon Arm to compete in his first Reino Keski-Salmi Loppet. He said it will be a\u00a0very\u00a0meaningful experience for him, an opportunity\u00a0to pay tribute to an athlete who showed kids from Salmon Arm what they could accomplish.</p><p>\"He as one of Canada\u2019s top cross-country skiers \u2013\u00a0he won Canadian championships twice and\u00a0he put some good results in Europe. He was\u00a0one of the first Canadian cross-country skiers to do that\u2026,\" said Crook. \"It kind of showed kids from Salmon Arm that was an option.\"</p><p>This year's Reino Keski-Salmi Loppet offers a new 32-kilometre single-lap course, along with 17-,10-,5-,2- and 1-km courses.

This really brings to light the things that matter, because all the material stuff you can lose in an instant. Life can change in a blink of an eye.\"</p><p>Coulson, which is based in Port Alberni, B.C., but also operates in the United States and Australia, said aircraft involved in fighting the fire include its double-rotor Chinook fleet and a smaller Sikorsky S-76 helicopter. The company's social media post included a screen shot showing the flight paths of three of its water-bombing helicopters swirling repeatedly over the neighbourhood.</p><p>A spokesperson for Quebec's Transport Department said the province's current California contingent includes the two planes as well as eight pilots and four technicians.</p><p>The Canadian-made CL-415 planes and their pilots and maintenance crews are sent to California every fall as part of an annual contract in place since 1994. The contract normally begins in September and lasts for between 90 and 180 days, with crews rotating in and out to ensure staffing.</p><p>Quebec Public Security Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bonnardel posted a message of support on X to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, saying the province is ready to send additional firefighters to the state if they are needed.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, which is operated by fire management agencies across Canada, said it has no resources deployed to the California firefighting effort, and there were no \"anticipated requests.\"</p><p>The disaster prompted the NHL to postpone a Los Angeles Kings home game against the Calgary Flames on Wednesday. The Kings saluted the hard-working first responders who are trying to contain the fires and protect the community.</p><p>\"We appreciate the league's support in keeping our fans, staff, and players safe,\" the team said in a statement.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20250108PAB4682521</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DVJ-9K23-RRJ4-V4T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Group Ltd.

But instead the government lacks transparency about its consultations and research reviews, and fails to act even though three other Canadian provinces already include wildland firefighters in their presumptive coverage.</p><p>\u201cThey're simply not doing enough to protect these heroes who every single year protect the rest of us,\u201d the member for Edmonton-Beverly-Clareview said as Canada\u2019s Firefighter Cancer Awareness Month was about to end.</p><p>The provincial government maintains that progress is hampered by the scope of existing research and conflicting conclusions.</p><p>Unavailable for an interview, Jobs Minister Matt Jones said in emailed response to questions from The Macleod Gazette: \u201cThe current cancer research on firefighters has largely focused on career or full-time structural firefighters, making it difficult to generalize conclusions to firefighters working in other capacities, such as wildland firefighters.\u201d</p><p>He added: \u201cHazards and exposure risks are different for wildland fires than they are for structural fires, and there is conflicting research about how the hazards impact firefighters\u2019 health.\u201d</p><p>For the last wildfire season, the province had funding to hire 1,000 wildland firefighters, up from 900 the year before. The government of Canada estimates that there are about 4,550 structural firefighters in Alberta, 84 per cent of whom are employed by municipal, regional, Indigenous or other governing administrations.</p><p>Alberta\u2019s Occupational Health and Safety legislation applies to firefighters, requiring employers to assess and control or eliminate worksite hazards, Jones pointed out. The minister also noted that personal protective equipment is important, but comparisons are challenging because PPE is different for wildland firefighters than it is for structural firefighters.</p><p>\u201cPrevention is the key to workplace safety,\u201d said Jones. \u201cPPE is critical to the health and safety of all workers, especially our firefighters.\u201d</p><p>Alberta is \u201cconstantly reviewing and updating our requirements for workers and workplaces to keep our workers safe on the job,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure our firefighters have the very best tools and equipment to do their job safely.\u201d</p><p>But Wright said emphasizing PPE isn\u2019t enough for an \u201cinherently complex\u201d type of firefighting that doesn\u2019t fit neatly into categories. Alberta faces more and hotter wildfires, these days, which swoop into built-up areas and cast firefighters into gruelling and unfamiliar situations.</p><p>\u201cFighting a grass fire is different from fighting a forest fire or a fire on the edge of town. If it's a different structure, you need different things. If you're in the middle of the bush somewhere, you need different PPE and other equipment than if you're in the middle of the prairie somewhere, because different things burn at different rates,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u00a0Shifts are \u201cincredibly long\u201d and wildland firefighters are \u201cincredibly tired\u201d on the job.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re asking them to do an awful lot, compressed into a relatively tiny time. And that the UCP government is unwilling to protect them in the same way as municipal firefighters is something I really don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Jones, the member for Calgary-South East, said: \u201cAlberta\u2019s government will continue to work with other jurisdictions and stakeholders to collect and review the latest research regarding wildland firefighters. Alberta currently aligns with most jurisdictions in Canada in not extending presumptions for occupational cancers and heart attacks to wildland firefighters.\u201d</p><p>Most research confirms that structural firefighters face elevated cancer diagnoses. But in June 2022, the International Agency for Research on Cancer began to classify all firefighting as a known human carcinogen.</p><p>The agency, which is part of the World Health Organization, wrote at the time: \u201cThe term firefighters encompasses a heterogeneous group of paid and unpaid workers in industrial, municipal, and wildland settings, at the wildland-urban interface, and in other situations. In some settings, firefighting exposures have become more prevalent over time, because of the impacts of climate change.\u201d</p><p>A study by the University of the Fraser Valley in B.C. found that nearly 86 per cent of job-related firefighter fatalities in Canada were attributed to cancer. The study looked at fatality and injury claims between 2006 and 2018.</p><p>Health Canada says that firefighters have a 14 per cent higher risk of dying from cancer than the general public does and a nine per cent higher risk of being diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>Jones said: \u201cWe want to get this policy right for our firefighters, and getting the policy right means not making rash decisions that may have long-term implications for the firefighter community. Alberta\u2019s government is working diligently to review the guidelines as fast as reasonably possible.\u201d</p><p>The minister wouldn\u2019t estimate when the government might change its policy. \u201cThe health and safety of our firefighters is something we can\u2019t afford to get wrong,\u201d he said in his emailed comments.</p><p>\u201cAlberta\u2019s government will continue to work tirelessly, doing the work to collect and review the latest research regarding presumptive coverage for firefighters.\u201d</p><p>Provinces and territories look after their own workers\u2019 compensation laws and regulations. Ontario, Manitoba and B.C. currently consider lists of cancers presumptive for wildland firefighters. Saskatchewan introduced amendments in December to extend to them presumptive coverage.</p><p>Said Wright: \u201cWildland firefighters are indeed firefighters. They are different from municipal firefighters, although structures can certainly be included in their work. But the fact is that they are exposed to a whole bunch of things that are at elevated levels, lots of particulate matter, things that I cannot pronounce, lots of volatile organic substances.\u201d</p><p>Jones said that the lack of presumptive coverage does not prevent wildland firefighters and their families from making compensation claims through the regular process for work-related injuries, illnesses or fatalities.</p><p>\u201cAlberta\u2019s government acknowledges the significant risks that our wildland firefighters take to protect our communities,\u201d Jones said.</p><p>\u201cOur government continues to meet with stakeholders, review research and evidence related to workers\u2019 compensation coverage, and monitor developments in other Canadian jurisdictions as we assess the potential for presumptions for wildland firefighters,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWorker health and safety is a top priority of Alberta\u2019s government. Our goal is to ensure every Albertan goes home healthy and safe after each workday.\u201d</p><p>Elsewhere in his responses, Jones said: \u201cAlberta\u2019s first-responders are heroes. We want to make sure they get the respect and compensation they deserve for their hard work and sacrifice as fast as possible.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-c1b94aa9f3cb444499afc8e9041390c7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F1H-2F03-RYCR-T3FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1236\"/><timeReceived>04:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 31, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Because he knows the geography of the area intimately, he knew immediately how to get to one of the fires and what water sources would be nearby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I knew that at least one of the strikes we could access by going up through the woodlot, up high,\" he said.</p><p>\"You have to decide, OK, should we, in fact, respond? Is it within our scope? Can we do it? Is it safe? Safety is always number one, right? So, it's a dry, dry hillside, but I knew one little water source there, so we made the call to go ahead.\"</p><p>Valentine called the BC Wildfire Service and notified them of his plan, and they had the fire under control by the time BCWS got there at 9 a.m.</p><p>\"So they knew. It wasn't a surprise to them \u2026 I was able to talk to them on the radio, and I was fortunate talking to be somebody I knew, so there was no surprises going on.\"</p><p>BCWS left a handful of workers behind to finish the work on the fire, and the rest headed off to several other new fires in the area.</p><p>Who is qualified to fight a wildfire?</p><p>This action by Valentine and crew came at a time when some new questions are being asked in B.C. about who is allowed to fight a forest fire, who can train fire fighters and supervise them. At least three regional district boards, including the Regional District of Central Kootenay, in letters to Forest Minister Ravi Parmar, have objected to some aspects of new provincial initiative intended to give more fire response roles to community members.</p><p>In 2022 the province formed the Cooperative Community Wildfire Response (CCWR) program, set up to train and supervise community members to assist with firefighting.</p><p>This was a response to controversies over the past few fire seasons in which local B.C. community members have either defied evacuation orders and stayed to fight a fire, or were refused by BCWS when they offered their expertise and equipment to help fight one. Several communities pushed back loudly against the forest ministry, saying local residents' expertise, local knowledge and equipment were being wasted.</p><p>To enrol in the CCWR, a group must be self-organized as a society or as some other legal entity, and must take specific training from the BCWR. Only communities that do not have structural fire departments may enrol. The things that these neighbourhood groups are allowed and not allowed to do are clearly spelt out in the CCWR guidelines.</p><p>They may transport and supply resources (such as personnel, equipment and supplies), they may do mop-up work after the fire (for example, cooling ash pits), and they may patrol to prevent flare-ups.</p><p>But they are not allowed to attack or suppress a wildfire, enter an area that is under an evacuation order, or move/deploy BCWS resources.</p><p>According to the ministry there are 15 groups, all in the southern interior, in various stages of signing up the the program. After local groups are trained and established they can be signed on as temporary employees and be paid for their work during a wildfire.</p><p>At the time of the Argenta fire in 2024, the ASAP group was in the process of signing up with the CCWR, and was not yet subject to CCWR's rules, Valentine said.</p><p>Pump on a stump</p><p>Valentine moved to Argenta when he was a child and has never left. In the old days, he says, forest service personnel were all locals who knew everyone, and fires were fought by locals.</p><p>\"The forest service know who was good at what. They knew every road and trail. They knew who could fix a pump on the stump out in the bush. They knew who could fall dangerous trees. And maybe most importantly, they knew who was a good cook, because on those days, you camped on the fire, and at six o'clock you were on the fire, ready to work.\"</p><p>More than 20 years ago, Valentine and others started gearing up to protect their remote community from fires. They started collecting equipment, with partial funding from the Regional District of Central Kootenay, but with only volunteer help. They built a fire shed. They got the late Dick Brenton, and later Valentine, trained and qualified to teach the S-100 and eventually the S-185 courses. The S-100 Basic Fire Suppression and Safety course provides classroom and field training and is the base-line requirement for anyone operating as a wildland firefighter. The S-185 Fire Entrapment and Safety course provides knowledge and procedures for avoiding fire entrapment, and survival measures in case escape is cut off. There are also several other BCWS courses either required or recommended for CCWR training. As an example of the kinds of knowledge community firefighters need, Valentine talks about water delivery: \"What kind of pumps? What you need to know about them? And we don't live in Kansas, where it's flat, right? We live in steep mountains, so it takes a lot of muscle to push water uphill, so you get into relay tanks.</p><p>\"You don't always have water on a fire, so you have to know how to deal with that when you have no water. And there's danger trees to deal with.\"</p><p>He added there is a lot to know about how to organize yourselves in an incident command system and how to set up a dispatch system.</p><p>\"Argenta has been a stronghold of independent thinkers and doers for decades,\" said Deb Borsos, who is one of the original volunteers. \"We don't find it strange that for 20 years already we have organized and co-ordinated our own fire crew to attack fires when they first hit.\"</p><p>Borsos has also worked, at various times since 2012, for the provincial government doing recovery work in communities after flooding and wildfires.</p><p>In last summer's fire, Borsos and the rest of the ASAP crew prepared the community for evacuation, organized and expedited various equipment and supplies, put up signage and ribbons, marked standpipes, watched for spot fires, brushed out out properties, moved flammable material away from buildings, installed water lines and sprinklers, organized food for their crew, and kept in touch with evacuees.</p><p>This was all done with the knowledge and co-operation of BCWS who were familiar with the group's capabilities and who paid some of the ASAP crew members to do this work.</p><p>Even though the fire grew to almost 20,000 hectares and caused an evacuation of Argenta and Johnsons Landing, no structures were burned and no one was injured.</p><p>More bureaucracy</p><p>Valentine and Borsos are concerned about two aspects of how B.C. is rolling out the CCWR. One is the rule that a CCWR group is not allowed to fight a fire.</p><p>'If responding promptly or remaining to do structure protection are not options acceptable to government I suspect a lot of these crews will respond anyway,\" Valentine said. \"And it will be a less than ideal situation.\"</p><p>He said there will be groups with resources in rural communities who want to be able to respond to a fire that starts near their community, and will either attack it while it's small or defend their homes if it is spreading.</p><p>\"I believe the best way to do this is with training, good communication, and in collaboration with Forest Service crews.\"</p><p>The second concern is that the province intends to introduce a third party between the BCWS and the communities.

Because he knows the geography of the area intimately, he knew immediately how to get to one of the fires and what water sources would be nearby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I knew that at least one of the strikes we could access by going up through the woodlot, up high,\" he said.</p><p>\"You have to decide, OK, should we, in fact, respond? Is it within our scope? Can we do it? Is it safe? Safety is always number one, right? So, it's a dry, dry hillside, but I knew one little water source there, so we made the call to go ahead.\"</p><p>Valentine called the BC Wildfire Service to discuss the situation and the ASAP crew was actioning the fire with water and certified fallers by 9 a.m.</p><p>\"So they knew. It wasn't a surprise to them \u2026 I was able to talk to them on the radio as they were surveying the new fires by helicopter and I was fortunate talking to be somebody I knew, so there were no surprises going on.\"</p><p>When BCWS arrived they left about ten workers to work alongside the ASAP crew while others went on to develop a plan for the other two fires nearby.</p><p>Who is qualified to fight a wildfire?</p><p>This action by Valentine and crew came at a time when some new questions are being asked in B.C. about who is allowed to fight a forest fire, who can train fire fighters and supervise them. At least three regional district boards, including the Regional District of Central Kootenay, in letters to Forest Minister Ravi Parmar, have objected to some aspects of new provincial initiative intended to give more fire response roles to community members.</p><p>In 2022 the province formed the Cooperative Community Wildfire Response (CCWR) program, set up to train and supervise rural community members to assist with firefighting.</p><p>This was a response to controversies over the past few fire seasons in which local B.C. community members have either defied evacuation orders and stayed to fight a fire, or were refused by BCWS when they offered their expertise and equipment to help fight one. Several communities pushed back loudly against the forest ministry, saying local residents' expertise, local knowledge and equipment were being wasted.</p><p>To enrol in the CCWR, a group must be self-organized as a society or as some other legal entity, and must take specific training from the BCWR. Only communities that do not have structural fire departments may enrol. The things that these neighbourhood groups are allowed and not allowed to do are clearly spelt out in the CCWR guidelines.</p><p>They may transport and supply resources (such as personnel, equipment and supplies), they may do mop-up work after the fire (for example, cooling ash pits), and they may patrol to prevent flare-ups.</p><p>But they are not allowed to attack or suppress a wildfire, enter an area that is under an evacuation order, or move/deploy BCWS resources.</p><p>According to the ministry there are 15 groups in the southern interior in various stages of signing up the the program. After local groups are trained and established they can be signed on as temporary employees and be paid for their work during a wildfire.</p><p>At the time of the Argenta fire in 2024, the ASAP group was in the process of signing up with the CCWR, and was not yet subject to CCWR's rules, Valentine said.</p><p>Pump on a stump</p><p>Valentine moved to Argenta when he was a child and has never left. In the old days, he says, forest service personnel were locals who knew everyone, and fires were fought by locals.</p><p>\"The forest service know who was good at what. They knew every road and trail. They knew who could fix a pump on the stump out in the bush. They knew who could fall dangerous trees. And maybe most importantly, they knew who was a good cook, because on those days, you camped on the fire, and at six o'clock you were on the fire, ready to work.\"</p><p>More than 20 years ago, Valentine and others started gearing up to protect their remote community from fires. They started collecting equipment, with partial funding from the Regional District of Central Kootenay, but with only volunteer help. They built a fire shed. They got the late Dick Brenton, and later Valentine, trained and qualified to teach the S-100 and eventually the S-185 courses. The S-100 Basic Fire Suppression and Safety course provides classroom and field training and is the base-line requirement for anyone operating as a wildland firefighter. The S-185 Fire Entrapment and Safety course provides knowledge and procedures for avoiding fire entrapment, and survival measures in case escape is cut off. There are also several other BCWS courses either required or recommended for CCWR training. As an example of the kinds of knowledge community firefighters need, Valentine talks about water delivery: \"What kind of pumps? What you need to know about them? And we don't live in Kansas, where it's flat, right? We live in steep mountains, so it takes a lot of muscle to push water uphill, so you get into relay tanks.</p><p>\"You don't always have water on a fire, so you have to know how to deal with that when you have no water. And there's danger trees to deal with.\"</p><p>He added there is a lot to know about how to organize yourselves in an incident command system and how to set up your own dispatch system.</p><p>\"Argenta has been a stronghold of independent thinkers and doers for decades,\" said Deb Borsos, who is one of the original volunteers. \"We don't find it strange that for 20 years already we have organized and co-ordinated our own fire crew to attack fires when they first hit.\"</p><p>Borsos has also worked, at various times since 2012, for the provincial government doing recovery work in communities after flooding and wildfires.</p><p>In last summer's fire, Borsos and the rest of the ASAP crew prepared the community for evacuation, organized and expedited various equipment and supplies, put up signage and ribbons, maintained gravity water supplies, watched for spot fires, brushed out out properties, moved flammable material away from buildings, installed water lines and sprinklers, organized food for their crew, and kept in touch with evacuees.</p><p>This was all done with the knowledge and co-operation of BCWS who were familiar with the group's capabilities and who paid some of the ASAP crew members to do this work.</p><p>Even though the fire grew to almost 20,000 hectares and caused an evacuation of Argenta and Johnsons Landing, no structures were burned and no one was injured.</p><p>More bureaucracy</p><p>Valentine and Borsos are concerned about two aspects of how B.C. is rolling out the CCWR. One is the rule that a CCWR group is not allowed to fight a fire.</p><p>'If responding promptly or remaining to do structure protection are not options acceptable to government I suspect a lot of these crews will respond anyway,\" Valentine said. \"And it will be a less than ideal situation.\"</p><p>He said there will be groups with resources in rural communities who want to be able to respond to a fire that starts near their community, and will either attack it while it's small or defend their homes if it is spreading.</p><p>\"I believe the best way to do this is with training, good communication, and in collaboration with Forest Service crews.\"</p><p>The second concern is that the province intends to introduce a third party between the BCWS and the communities. It wants regional districts to do the vetting and administration, and organize the training, for CCWR fire safety crews. In an email to the Nelson Star, the forest ministry stated that despite this regional district role, CCWR groups would still operate under the auspices of BCWS in the event of an actual fire.</p><p>Valentine said this would slow things down by inserting an extra level of bureaucracy into a situation in which it is \"critical to try to mount a fast response to a wildfire start before it grows out of control.

At 1:16 p.m., the fire was reported as 0.3 hectares in size with two crews of fire rangers on site, as well as an EC130 helicopter. People travelling in the area will note smoke being generated by this now one-hectare wildland fire. Three FireRanger crews and an aerial fire suppression team were on site Sunday afternoon. Anyone out on area waterways is asked to steer clear of operations and allow aircraft ample room to work safely.<br/><br/> When waterbombers approach a body of water, move close to the shore so they can perform their scoop safely. A waterbomber will not scoop from a lake or river if encroaching watercraft pose a safety hazard. Be safe, stay clear of waterbombers.<br/><br/> Also note, flying drones around forest fires is both dangerous and illegal. When you fly a drone near a forest fire, you can put the lives of pilots, firefighters and other emergency personnel at risk. Be safe, stay clear of forest fires.<br/><br/> The fire hazard is mostly moderate to high across the majority of the Northeast Region with some areas generally located north of Sault Ste Marie and Temiskaming Shores, and south of the highway 11 north corridor showing a low fire hazard. Find the current fire danger ratings of West Parry Sound municipalities and regulations around burning here: West Parry Sound area fire danger rating 2023.<br/><br/> Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services is responding to Parry Sound 14, which is a 0.3 of a hectare fire located approximately 1 km south of Pointe au Baril and west of Highway 69. Two crews of FireRangers are on site, as well as an EC130 helicopter.<br/><br/> - Ontario Forest Fires (@ONforestfires) September 24, 2023<br/><br/> SMOKE FORECAST<br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.<br/><br/> See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in?

An apartment that was never built for sweltering heat provides no respite of cooling at night. </p><p>Though residents in Hamilton and Burlington have seen the changes in our weather patterns, we continue to build our cities not for the future but for an obsolete past.</p><p>For many homeowners, it is obvious older homes need to be upgraded. Windows need to be replaced and insulation needs to be redone. </p><p>Not to mention, virtually all buildings are built to accommodate heating and cooling systems that rely on the very fossil fuels that create and worsen climate change.</p><p>While it's true some things get older and need to be replaced, right now we are building homes we know with absolute certainty will need serious renovations in the near future to keep them comfortable, safe and habitable in this changing climate.</p><p>Our provincial government has long ignored this inconvenient reality - and as a result, dozens of municipalities in southwestern Ontario have tried to fill this gap by instituting green development standards.</p><p>Essentially green development standards provide a more holistic set of requirements for a property. They set out performance standards that enhance property resilience to extreme weather while also reducing the embodied and future greenhouse gas emissions from any new building.</p><p>By ensuring all new developments meet these baseline standards, home buyers and tenants will have the assurance their property is ready for today and the future. </p><p>Implementing green development standards can significantly boost the economy by fostering innovation and creating new markets. </p><p>These standards give the housing market a predictable path for reaching net-zero emissions.</p><p>Job creation in the green sector addresses environmental challenges and social issues like unemployment and poverty. Green jobs offer decent wages, job security and opportunities for skills development and enhance the well-being of individuals and communities and lead to more inclusive and sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Many other municipalities already have green development standards and include Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Caledon, King City, Markham, Richmond Hill, Vaughan, Pickering and Oshawa. </p><p>Even smaller communities like the counties of Grey, Wellington and Dufferin have developed green development standards.</p><p>So, how do we build our cities, buildings and homes for the future? We build communities that can manage ever-increasing extreme weather events. </p><p>Every property is developed so it can play its part. For example, it includes how the community manages heavy rain. We design and build buildings that protect people from temperature extremes, maintain good indoor air quality when there is forest fire smoke outside and are already wired to accommodate solar generation on-site.</p><p>In summary, we develop properties and communities that maintain their value because they will withstand extreme weather and protect their inhabitants while promoting a sustainable economy.</p><p>Victoria Coffin is the acting manager of the Bay Area Climate Change Council.

So, it's a dry, dry hillside, but I knew one little water source there, so we made the call to go ahead.\"</p><p>Valentine called the BC Wildfire Service and notified them of his plan, and they had the fire under control by the time BCWS got there at 9 a.m.</p><p>\"So they knew. It wasn't a surprise to them \u2026 I was able to talk to them on the radio, and I was fortunate talking to be somebody I knew, so there was no surprises going on.\"</p><p>BCWS left a handful of workers behind to finish the work on the fire, and the rest headed off to several other new fires in the area.</p><p>Who is qualified to fight a wildfire?</p><p>This action by Valentine and crew came at a time when some new questions are being asked in B.C. about who is allowed to fight a forest fire, who can train fire fighters and supervise them. At least three regional district boards, including the Regional District of Central Kootenay, in letters to Forest Minister Ravi Parmar, have objected to some aspects of new provincial initiative intended to give more fire response roles to community members.</p><p>In 2022 the province formed the Cooperative Community Wildfire Response (CCWR) program, set up to train and supervise community members to assist with firefighting.</p><p>This was a response to controversies over the past few fire seasons in which local B.C. community members have either defied evacuation orders and stayed to fight a fire, or were refused by BCWS when they offered their expertise and equipment to help fight one. Several communities pushed back loudly against the forest ministry, saying local residents' expertise, local knowledge and equipment were being wasted.</p><p>To enrol in the CCWR, a group must be self-organized as a society or as some other legal entity, and must take specific training from the BCWR. Only communities that do not have structural fire departments may enrol. The things that these neighbourhood groups are allowed and not allowed to do are clearly spelt out in the CCWR guidelines.</p><p>They may transport and supply resources (such as personnel, equipment and supplies), they may do mop-up work after the fire (for example, cooling ash pits), and they may patrol to prevent flare-ups.</p><p>But they are not allowed to attack or suppress a wildfire, enter an area that is under an evacuation order, or move/deploy BCWS resources.</p><p>According to the ministry there are 15 groups, all in the southern interior, in various stages of signing up the the program. After local groups are trained and established they can be signed on as temporary employees and be paid for their work during a wildfire.</p><p>At the time of the Argenta fire in 2024, the ASAP group was in the process of signing up with the CCWR, and was not yet subject to CCWR's rules, Valentine said.</p><p>Pump on a stump</p><p>Valentine moved to Argenta when he was a child and has never left. In the old days, he says, forest service personnel were all locals who knew everyone, and fires were fought by locals.</p><p>\"The forest service know who was good at what. They knew every road and trail. They knew who could fix a pump on the stump out in the bush. They knew who could fall dangerous trees. And maybe most importantly, they knew who was a good cook, because on those days, you camped on the fire, and at six o'clock you were on the fire, ready to work.\"</p><p>More than 20 years ago, Valentine and others started gearing up to protect their remote community from fires. They started collecting equipment, with partial funding from the Regional District of Central Kootenay, but with only volunteer help. They built a fire shed. They got the late Dick Brenton, and later Valentine, trained and qualified to teach the S-100 and eventually the S-185 courses. The S-100 Basic Fire Suppression and Safety course provides classroom and field training and is the base-line requirement for anyone operating as a wildland firefighter. The S-185 Fire Entrapment and Safety course provides knowledge and procedures for avoiding fire entrapment, and survival measures in case escape is cut off. There are also several other BCWS courses either required or recommended for CCWR training. As an example of the kinds of knowledge community firefighters need, Valentine talks about water delivery: \"What kind of pumps? What you need to know about them? And we don't live in Kansas, where it's flat, right? We live in steep mountains, so it takes a lot of muscle to push water uphill, so you get into relay tanks.</p><p>\"You don't always have water on a fire, so you have to know how to deal with that when you have no water. And there's danger trees to deal with.\"</p><p>He added there is a lot to know about how to organize yourselves in an incident command system and how to set up a dispatch system.</p><p>\"Argenta has been a stronghold of independent thinkers and doers for decades,\" said Deb Borsos, who is one of the original volunteers. \"We don't find it strange that for 20 years already we have organized and co-ordinated our own fire crew to attack fires when they first hit.\"</p><p>Borsos has also worked, at various times since 2012, for the provincial government doing recovery work in communities after flooding and wildfires.</p><p>In last summer's fire, Borsos and the rest of the ASAP crew prepared the community for evacuation, organized and expedited various equipment and supplies, put up signage and ribbons, marked standpipes, watched for spot fires, brushed out out properties, moved flammable material away from buildings, installed water lines and sprinklers, organized food for their crew, and kept in touch with evacuees.</p><p>This was all done with the knowledge and co-operation of BCWS who were familiar with the group's capabilities and who paid some of the ASAP crew members to do this work.</p><p>Even though the fire grew to almost 20,000 hectares and caused an evacuation of Argenta and Johnsons Landing, no structures were burned and no one was injured.</p><p>More bureaucracy</p><p>Valentine and Borsos are concerned about two aspects of how B.C. is rolling out the CCWR. One is the rule that a CCWR group is not allowed to fight a fire.</p><p>'If responding promptly or remaining to do structure protection are not options acceptable to government I suspect a lot of these crews will respond anyway,\" Valentine said. \"And it will be a less than ideal situation.\"</p><p>He said there will be groups with resources in rural communities who want to be able to respond to a fire that starts near their community, and will either attack it while it's small or defend their homes if it is spreading.</p><p>\"I believe the best way to do this is with training, good communication, and in collaboration with Forest Service crews.\"</p><p>The second concern is that the province intends to introduce a third party between the BCWS and the communities. It wants regional districts to do the vetting and administration, and organize the training, for CCWR fire safety crews. In an email to the Nelson Star, the forest ministry stated that despite this regional district role, CCWR groups would still operate under the auspices of BCWS in the event of an actual fire.</p><p>Valentine said this would slow things down by inserting an extra level of bureaucracy into a situation in which it is \"critical to try to mount a fast response to a wildfire start before it grows out of control. In the S-100 firefighting course it's known as the 10 o'clock rule, or catch it while it's small before daytime heating begins.\"</p><p>He said this is where a trained and equipped fire response crew with experienced leaders can get the jump on a fire that starts near their community, while resources from BCWS can take hours or days to get there.</p><p>He said regional districts have no experience with any of this, and the Regional District of Central Kootenay agrees.</p><p>In a Jan. 28 letter to Forest Minister Ravi Parmar, RDCK board chair Aimee Watson said the regional district does not have the staff or the expertise to take on the new project of training and administering wildfire crews.</p><p>\"Incorporating the CCWR program, as currently outlined,\" Watson wrote, \"would require significant administrative oversight and operational capacity \u2014 neither of which we have the ability to absorb without jeopardizing our existing responsibilities.\"</p><p>The Regional Districts of Kootenay Boundary and Columbia Shuswap have sent similar letters to the minister, both concerned about what they see as the downloading of provincial responsibility onto regional governments that do not have the resources or expertise to carry them out.</p><p>Valentine and Borsos say that the success of ASAP has been due to many years of positive relationship-building with BCWS in the region, and insertion of the RDCK into the mix could undo that.</p><p>\"In Argenta we had a very positive experience working with BCWS last summer,\" said Valentine. \"We don't know where all this is heading or what the outcome will be.\"</p><p>Copyright 2025 Nelson Star</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20250306PKO4701969</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F8P-1323-RRP8-2359-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1622\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

However, he says\u00a0a heat wave is not expected, as temperatures are expected to return quickly to normal.</p><p>\"What we see in the pattern is very seasonal in general.... I\u00a0don't see anything out of the norm,\" he said.</p><p>\"But in the summertime, we we do expect thunderstorm activity, so that's something that we have to prepare for.\"</p><p/><p>Recent precipitation in Thunder Bay and the surrounding region has helped to keep forest fire activity to a minimum\u00a0- as of Friday afternoon, there were no active fires reported in the northwest, said Alison Bezubiak, a fire information officer with Ontario's Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services.</p><p>\"Each fire season is really variable based on the weather trends that developed throughout the season,\" she said. \"Through the spring,\u00a0we received really regular and widespread precipitation, as well as cooler temperatures, and that helped to keep the fire load to a minimum up to this point.\"</p><p>So far this fire season\u00a0- which began April 1 - 39 wildland fires have been confirmed in the northwest. They've burned about 52 hectares of land.</p><p>During the same period in 2023, 182 fires had been reported, which burned more than 85,000 hectares of land, Bezubiak said.</p><p>\"At the moment, we're observing a mostly low-to-moderate wildland fire hazard across the northwest region,\" she said. \"Most of the region did receive significant rainfall earlier this week, but it was accompanied by widespread lightning, which can be the source of holdover fires.\"</p><p>Holdover fires, Bezubiak\u00a0explained, \"are fires that occur when lightning strikes a tree or other forest fuels and ignites a fire under the forest floor.\"</p><p>\"Once weather dries up, winds increase [and]\u00a0temperatures rebound, holdover lightning fires can appear up to about a week later,\" she said. \"Instances of lightning fires do tend to increase as we head into the summer months. Given that we're starting to see a slight drying trend right now, we are carefully monitoring for new starts from lightning.\"</p><p>However, forest fire activity is very hard to predict, Bezubiak said.</p><p>\"It's very much a weather-driven phenomenon. Weather plays a significant role in determining the frequency and the severe severity of wildland fires,\" she said.</p><p>\"Because of how the weather has played out, and will continue to play out, that will determine fire season as we go forward.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadathunderbaysummerweathernwo17242914</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CB5-2K41-F03F-K2RP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"466\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Three Fire Ranger crews were on site Monday.</p><p><br/><br/> Parry Sound 14 was confirmed at 12:42 p.m. on Sunday, Sept. 24 approximately one kilometre south of Pointe au Baril and west of Highway 69. At 1:16 p.m., that day, the fire was reported as 0.3 hectares in size with two crews of fire rangers on site, as well as an EC130 helicopter.<br/><br/> People travelling in the area would note smoke being generated by what grew to be a one-hectare wildland fire. Three FireRanger crews and an aerial fire suppression team were on site Sunday afternoon. Anyone out on area waterways was asked to steer clear of operations and allow aircraft ample room to work safely.<br/><br/> At 9 a.m. on Monday, Sept. 25, the fire was listed as \"not under control,\" on the ministry's interactive map.<br/><br/> By 11 a.m. on Monday, Sept. 25, the fire was considered \"being held,\" according to Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, and continues with this designation.<br/><br/> There are currently 34 active wildland fires in the Northeast Region. Of these, one fire (Parry Sound 14) is being held, one fire is under control and 32 are being observed.<br/><br/> The fire hazard is mostly moderate to high across the Northeast Region Monday afternoon, some pockets of the southern portion of the region are showing an extreme hazard this afternoon, generally east of Kawartha Lakes, through Bancroft and west of Carleton Place. Find the current fire danger ratings of West Parry Sound municipalities and regulations around burning here: West Parry Sound area fire danger rating 2023.<br/><br/> When waterbombers approach a body of water, move close to the shore so they can perform their scoop safely. A waterbomber will not scoop from a lake or river if encroaching watercraft pose a safety hazard. Be safe, stay clear of waterbombers.<br/><br/> Also note, flying drones around forest fires is both dangerous and illegal. When you fly a drone near a forest fire, you can put the lives of pilots, firefighters and other emergency personnel at risk. Be safe, stay clear of forest fires.<br/><br/> Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services is responding to Parry Sound 14, which is a 0.3 of a hectare fire located approximately 1 km south of Pointe au Baril and west of Highway 69.

Three Fire Ranger crews were on site Monday.</p><p><br/><br/> Parry Sound 14 was confirmed at 12:42 p.m. on Sunday, Sept. 24 approximately one kilometre south of Pointe au Baril and west of Highway 69. At 1:16 p.m., that day, the fire was reported as 0.3 hectares in size with two crews of fire rangers on site, as well as an EC130 helicopter.<br/><br/> People travelling in the area would note smoke being generated by what grew to be a one-hectare wildland fire. Three FireRanger crews and an aerial fire suppression team were on site Sunday afternoon. Anyone out on area waterways was asked to steer clear of operations and allow aircraft ample room to work safely.<br/><br/> At 9 a.m. on Monday, Sept. 25, the fire was listed as \"not under control,\" on the ministry's interactive map.<br/><br/> By 11 a.m. on Monday, Sept. 25, the fire was considered \"being held,\" according to Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, and continues with this designation.<br/><br/> There are currently 34 active wildland fires in the Northeast Region. Of these, one fire (Parry Sound 14) is being held, one fire is under control and 32 are being observed.<br/><br/> The fire hazard is mostly moderate to high across the Northeast Region Monday afternoon, some pockets of the southern portion of the region are showing an extreme hazard this afternoon, generally east of Kawartha Lakes, through Bancroft and west of Carleton Place. Find the current fire danger ratings of West Parry Sound municipalities and regulations around burning here: West Parry Sound area fire danger rating 2023.<br/><br/> When waterbombers approach a body of water, move close to the shore so they can perform their scoop safely. A waterbomber will not scoop from a lake or river if encroaching watercraft pose a safety hazard. Be safe, stay clear of waterbombers.<br/><br/> Also note, flying drones around forest fires is both dangerous and illegal. When you fly a drone near a forest fire, you can put the lives of pilots, firefighters and other emergency personnel at risk. Be safe, stay clear of forest fires.<br/><br/> Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services is responding to Parry Sound 14, which is a 0.3 of a hectare fire located approximately 1 km south of Pointe au Baril and west of Highway 69. Two crews of FireRangers are on site, as well as an EC130 helicopter.<br/><br/> - Ontario Forest Fires (@ONforestfires) September 24, 2023<br/><br/> SMOKE FORECAST<br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area.

The 80-year-old Durbin has been a consistently liberal voice from a state that\u2019s grown increasingly Democratic. Durbin was first elected to the U.S. House in 1982 and succeeded the retiring Sen. Paul Simon in 1996. Durbin is largely credited with starting the movement to ban indoor smoking with legislation that prohibited it on airplane flights in 1987. Durbin also has been key on criminal justice system revamps.</p><p>WORDS: 722 - MOVED: 04/23/2025 11:25 a.m. EDT</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:02ff2de634c0e6b62842f80eef01f72e&amp;mediaType=text\">https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:02ff2de634c0e6b62842f80eef01f72e&amp;mediaType=text</url></p><p>___</p><p>US--TRUMP-THE LATEST</p><p>The Latest: Treasury secretary says Chinese economy should grow up</p><p>SUMMARY: U.S. markets opened with big gains and clear signs of relief after President Donald Trump said he would not attempt to fire the head of the Federal Reserve and his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects a \u201cde-escalation\u201d in what he called an unsustainable tariffs showdown against China. \u201cThere is an opportunity for a big deal here,\u201d Bessent said in a speech Wednesday morning, before adding that China should act more like an \u201cadult economy.\u201d China, meanwhile, said the Trump administration should stop trying to bully and blackmail its trading partner, and some on Wall Street expressed skepticism that Trump is done testing the limits of bellicose rhetoric on trade.</p><p>WORDS: 2288 - MOVED: 04/23/2025 11:01 a.m. EDT</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:506c7143a3e60b9e68431571d11b7993&amp;mediaType=text\">https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:506c7143a3e60b9e68431571d11b7993&amp;mediaType=text</url></p><p>___</p><p>US--IRS UPHEAVAL</p><p>IRS turmoil: Leadership churn, worker exodus and threats to groups\u2019 tax-exempt status roil agency</p><p>SUMMARY: The height of tax season was the height of turmoil at the IRS.

It is devastating to consider the lives lost in these wildfires and heartbreaking to think about the 12,000 homes and other buildings already reported as destroyed in the disaster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alberta is no stranger to wildfire devastation. When the request came through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre for help in assisting California, Alberta Wildfire answered the call by sending two fully-equipped wildfire crews, including 40 highly skilled and experienced wildland firefighters and two agency representatives.</p><p>If requested, additional Type 1 firefighters, incident Command personnel, and qualified support staff are also ready to go. As well, Alberta Wildfire is preparing water bombers, pilots, and contracted night vision helicopters to assist in California, should they be needed.</p><p>You may remember that during Alberta's record-breaking wildfire season in 2023, 115 firefighters and support staff from California came to help Alberta's wildfire response.</p><p>Alberta is committed to providing support and expertise to help protect the lives, property, and communities of our friends and partners in the United States. I'm forever grateful to brave people everywhere who are willing to share their skills \u2013 and face extraordinary and dangerous circumstances \u2013 to keep others safe.</p><p>There are, of course, outstanding people who make valuable contributions in many different areas of life. Take, for example, those exceptional Albertans who dedicate their time and energy uplifting the lives of seniors across the province. The Government of Alberta is so appreciative of such people that for 26 years now, the Minister's Senior Service Awards have recognized and celebrated outstanding individuals and organizations for their service to Alberta's seniors. Nominations are now open for 2024-25 and Albertans are encouraged to nominate individuals, businesses, and non-profit organizations who showed kindness, compassion, and dedication for Alberta's seniors in 2024 and 2025.</p><p>Up to 13 awards will be presented this time around. This includes the Alice Modin Award, which recognizes a senior individual or couple for exceptional commitment to their community and the province through long-term volunteer service. This award is given in honour of Alice Modin, who campaigned for a Seniors' Day and paved the way for the provincewide Seniors' Week that is celebrated annually.</p><p>Two special service awards are also being featured this year. The first is the Bridging Generations Award, which honours individuals, groups or organizations that excel in uniting generations through shared experiences and backgrounds. The second is the Community Philanthropy in Action Award, which recognizes Albertans who mobilize community resources through philanthropic efforts to support seniors.</p><p>The deadline for nominations is April 30, 2025.</p><p>Did you know that the government of Alberta just launched a digital, interactive web map that allows people to learn about the origins of the names of almost 9,000 rivers, mountains, towns and more across Alberta? It's called the Alberta Geographical Names Web Map, and is a terrific tool to help Albertans learn about the rich cultures, people, and history that have shaped our province. This is just another way that Alberta's government is strengthening our province's heritage by expanding resources, promoting preservation, and celebrating Alberta's unique cultural heritage and identity.</p><p>The minister of Arts, Culture and the Status of Women is responsible for naming geographical places in Alberta. If you'd like to make a suggestion for a new place name or for a change to an existing place name, there's a program set up for that. The Alberta Geographical Names Program provides an application on their website for such proposals.</p><p>I have mentioned before the success of the first round of public engagements set up by the Ministry of Health to gather feedback and input from Albertans and health care providers on the new, refocused health care system. Between January and June of 2024, 65 in-person public sessions were held across the province. Almost 3,000 Albertans, health care workers, patients, and caregivers participated. More than 18,000 people also shared their feedback through online tools and almost 10,000 people participated in virtual town halls.</p><p>The findings from the first round have been summarized in a report called What We Heard, and have helped guide the design and implementation of the refocused health care system.</p><p>The Ministry of Health has announced that they will continue the conversation with Albertans about building a health care system that works for all Albertans, and will hold a second round of engagements, including in-person public sessions, beginning Jan. 21. These sessions will update Albertans on the latest refocusing work, will gather perspectives on access to health care and the current experiences of the health care workforce, and identify opportunities to improve local decision-making. There's a session scheduled in Wetaskiwin on Friday, April 11, 2025 from 12 to 2 p.m.</p><p>Also on the health care front, I am pleased to share the very good news that on Dec. 19, the province announced a new compensation model for primary care physicians with a panel size of 500 or more patients. This new model comes as a result of extensive discussions and collaboration with the Alberta Medical Association; it will improve access to family physicians and stabilize hospital services across Alberta.</p><p>I hope the first few weeks of this new year have been good for you and that you have plenty to look forward to in the weeks ahead!</p><p>Hon.

Weinstein\u2019s retrial is happening at the same Manhattan courthouse as the 2020 trial, and two accusers from that trial are expected to testify again. Weinstein\u2019s retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first. Besides the charges being retried, he faces an additional charge based on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t a part of the first case.

Dick Durbin of Illinois says he won\u2019t seek reelection to a sixth term in 2026. The No. 2 Democrat in the Senate made the announcement Wednesday, piling more pressure on his party as it already faced a difficult path to reclaiming a Senate majority. The 80-year-old Durbin has been a consistently liberal voice from a state that\u2019s grown increasingly Democratic. Durbin was first elected to the U.S. House in 1982 and succeeded the retiring Sen. Paul Simon in 1996. Durbin is largely credited with starting the movement to ban indoor smoking with legislation that prohibited it on airplane flights in 1987.

Tens of thousands of police and soldiers fanned out across the region, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan. Authorities also erected additional checkpoints. Reports said they searched cars, used helicopters to search forested mountains and in some areas summoned former militants for questioning.

Francis\u2019 simple wooden casket was perched on a slight ramp, as four Swiss Guards stood at attention.
