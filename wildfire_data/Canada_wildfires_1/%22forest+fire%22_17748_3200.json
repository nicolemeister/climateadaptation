David Phillips, senior climatologist for Environment and Climate Change Canada, says that there's some moderation occurring along the west coast: Today, Lytton is forecasted to be at 41 C; Vancouver could hit a high of 29 C, compared to 32 C yesterday; Victoria will also likely be below the 30 C mark.</p><p>Though these are still higher temperatures than usual, \"there's no way that records are going to be broken today,\" Phillips said.</p><p>Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba are also experiencing temperatures above 30 C and are expected to cool down early next week. Phillips still predicts that the heat dome will migrate as far as Northwestern Ontario, which could also see warmer temperatures, but will not be a threat to Toronto.</p><p>\"That heat dome doesn't stay around, it's not something that comes from Vancouver right through to Bonavista, N.F.L.,\" Phillips said.</p><p>The BC Coroners Service received 233 reports of deaths over the days of Friday, June 25 to Monday, June 28. A spokesperson said that it is still speculative if the deaths are related to the heat wave and the cause of each death will be determined as cases close.</p><p>Though Phillips expects the recovery period after the heat dome to happen about a week into July, he says it should serve as a reminder for Canadians to up their heat tolerance for the rest of summer.</p><p>\"We think this is the flavour of the summer,\" Phillips said. \"Not as excruciatingly hot, but still on the warm side.\"</p><p>Phillips also advises people in the west to be more cautious about forest fire risks.</p><p>Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for northern and central British Columbia for \"strong winds and intense lightning,\" Phillips said. Because of how dry it is there, anything from an \"erratic cigarette butt\" to dry lightning could spark a forest fire.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">With files from Urbi Khan.</emphasis></p><p>Celina Gallardo is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star.

Higher temperatures, stronger winds and generally low humidity in that period contribute to the rapid spread of fires.<br/><br/> But with existing satellites - including NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite and its Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite - there's a coverage gap over Canada at that time.<br/><br/> WildFireSat aims to plug that gap. The constellation will adopt an idealized orbit that allows the satellites - at least three of them, possibly more - to pass over any given point in Canada at about the same time each day.<br/><br/> One other benefit is that WildFireSat would theoretically improve both the efficiency and the safety of current wildfire surveillance.<br/><br/> To fill in the reconnaissance gaps left by today's satellite orbits, firefighting teams often use planes, helicopters and drones to keep an eye on fires.<br/><br/> That's problematic in two ways. One, because those aircraft travel at relatively low altitudes, they may take a long time to build up a picture of a particularly large fire. And two, the flying of planes and helicopters over a large fire is a dangerous business.<br/><br/> WildFireSat can kill both of those birds with one stone. First, because of its orbit at a much higher altitude, it will be able to observe a much greater swath of land at one pass than a plane or helicopter. And because it will provide the data that fire managers need when they need it, it will eliminate or severely reduce the need for putting pilots in dangerous situations around fires.<br/><br/> The current satellites from which fire managers pull their data are general-purpose scientific satellites, said Johnston. Building WildFireSat, from the ground up as a dedicated firefighting platform also means they are able to tailor its satellites' cameras specifically to observing wildfires. <br/><br/> While the configuration of the satellites has yet to be decided, one of the criteria is for WildFireSat cameras to be able to observe the ground below not just in visible light wavelengths, but in specific infrared wavelengths chosen to produce, when combined, the most complete picture of Canada's wildfires. Infrared wavelengths are vital to the data collected, because, unlike visible light wavelengths, they are able to penetrate the smoke cover from a fire.<br/><br/> And at the heart of WildFireSat's observation package is an extraordinary piece of equipment - an infrared camera that does not need to be cooled.<br/><br/> Traditionally, satellite infrared cameras have required bulky, power-hungry cooling systems to bring the camera's temperature to the point where it's most effective. On the James Webb Space Telescope - another order of magnitude in terms of precision, size and expense - it took almost three weeks to cool the instruments down to -266 degrees Celsius once the telescope was in orbit.<br/><br/> The uncooled infrared camera does away with that bulk, meaning satellites can be made smaller - and much less expensive to launch - and less power-hungry. Johnston said the new infrared camera can run on the same power it takes to run a Christmas light bulb.<br/><br/> When it's in orbit, what that camera is looking for is a measure of Fire Radiative Power, a measure of the energy of the flames on the ground, said Miriam Micael, an engineer in Project Management, Space Utilization at the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), which will operate the satellite once its launched.<br/><br/> That data will be downloaded immediately from WildFireSat, then analyzed by the Canadian Forest Service - to give fire managers information about fire intensity and rate of spread - and Environment Canada - who can use it for smoke and air quality forecasts and to measure carbon emissions.<br/><br/> The CSA has contracted with three companies to design the particulars of WildFireSat.<br/><br/> Joel Spark is the chief satellite architect for Spire Global Inc. one of those companies.<br/><br/> \"One of the things that I think the CSA is doing right about this procurement is they are not specifying how it must be solved, they're just specifying what they ultimately need,\" he said.<br/><br/> \"It's very focused on the data. They've said, 'We need satellites which can observe Canada and the vegetated area with a certain frequency. Once we've observed it, we need to get that data down within 20 minutes and processed so that we can get it into the hands of our users.<br/><br/> \"We need the data to be observed during the peak burning period so that we cannot only track fires when they're spreading the most quickly, but also can understand more about it.'\"<br/><br/> While WildFireSat, is still in early planning stages, Micael said she expects that in about a year, one of those three companies will be targeted to build the system. WildFireSat is targeted for a proposed 2029 launch on a mission that is scheduled to last five years, with the possibility of an extension. <br/><br/> Steve McKinley is a Halifax-based reporter for the Star.

Public input is considered in two different ways: through an annual open house and survey, and through meetings with user groups.</p><p>\"We have a survey that we put out to the public (to discover) what their values are for the forest and we put that into our management plan.\"</p><p>They meet with user groups at least once a year: hikers, all-terrain vehicle riders. \"It's good to get everyone together,\" Law said. \"Certain recreation users bring up concerns\u2026the people out there using (the forest) \u2026that look at our harvesting practices and our silviculture practices and tell us what that's like.\"</p><p>User groups give forest managers suggestions on which features they would like to see opened up. For example, Law plans to harvest close to the forest fire lookout tower above Sproat Lake. It's an area where hiking groups have indicated they would like closer access.</p><p>Law had forest users in mind as he made plans to work around a slide that occurred on the road to the trail up to Mt. Klitsa. His crews were able to create a parking lot in an area they were planning on harvesting at the bottom of Klitsa Creek, closer to Taylor Main. When finished, the reconfiguration will give hikers better access to the trail.</p><p>\"We have the recreation user group just to focus. They're out there a lot,\" Law explained. \"We have the open house for the public because we want to hear from the public.\"</p><p>Law brings board members to the community forest at least once a year for an on-site explanation of management techniques. \"It's good for the board to get out in the forest and see what we are talking about,\" he said.</p><p>The community forest saw some of its busiest use ever during the coronavirus pandemic, when people were encouraged to go outdoors while keeping socially distanced. That use continues, Law said.</p><p>Another way people are using the community forest is as a source for firewood. The community forest will again be offering firewood cutting opportunities, once the fire hazard is lower, Law said. When crews harvest an area they typically move leftover pieces closer to the side of access roads within the forest so it's easier for the public to get to firewood cutting areas. Moving usable wood makes the harvesting site cleaner too.</p><p>\"There's less damaging impact for the environment by burning slash,\" Law said. Firewood permits are issued through the South Island Forest District\u2014search for firewood permits.</p><p>Representatives from the community forest board were at the Sept. 26 Port Alberni City Council meeting to present their annual dividend cheque to the city. This year's cheque was for $300,000.</p><p>Copyright 2022 Alberni Valley News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AVLNWS-news20220930PAE4378366</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AVLNWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66H7-RF51-JD2C-J00V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Public input is considered in two different ways:through an annual open house and survey, and through meetings with user groups.</p><p>\u201cWe have a survey that we put out to the public (to discover) what their values are for the forest and we put that into our management plan.\u201d</p><p>They meet with user groups at least once a year:hikers, all-terrain vehicle riders. \u201cIt\u2019s good to get everyone together,\u201d Law said. \u201cCertain recreation users bring up concerns...the people out there using (the forest).. .that look at our harvesting practices and our silviculture practices and tell us what that\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>User groups give forest managers suggestions on which features they would like to see opened up. For ex-ample, Law plans to harvest close to the forest fire lookout tower above Sproat Lake. It\u2019s an area where hiking groups have indicated they would like closer access.</p><p>Law had forest users in mind as he made plans to work around a slide that occurred on the road to the trail up to Mt. Klitsa. His crews were able to create a parking lot in an area they were planning on harvesting at the bottom of Klitsa Creek, closer to Taylor Main.</p><p>When finished, the reconfiguration will give hikers better access to the trail.</p><p>\u201cWe have the recreation user group just to focus. They\u2019re out there a lot,\u201d Law explained. \u201cWe have the open house for the public because we want to hear from the public.\u201d</p><p>Law brings board members to the community forest at least once a year for an on-site explanation of management techniques. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the board to get out in the forest and see what we are talking about,\u201d he said.</p><p>The community forest saw some of its busiest use ever during the coronavirus pandemic, when people were encouraged to go outdoors while keeping socially distanced. That use continues, Law said.</p><p>Another way people are using the community forest is as a source for firewood. The community forest will again be offering firewood cutting opportunities, once the fire hazard is lower, Law said. When crews harvest an area they typically move leftover pieces closer to the side of access roads within the forest so it\u2019s easier for the public to get to firewood cutting areas. Moving usable wood makes the harvesting site cleaner too.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s less damaging impact for the environment by burning slash,\u201d Law said. Firewood permits are issued through the South Island Forest District\u2014 search for firewood permits. Representatives from the community forest board will be at the Sept. 30 Port Alberni City Council meeting to present their annual dividend cheque to the city.</p><p>We have a survey that we put out to the public (to discover) what their values are for the forest and we put that into our management plan.</p><p>-Chris Law</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AVLNWS-news20220928PPFA0003015380</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AVLNWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66GT-SFP1-JD2C-J2BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"490\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Heavy mineral concentrates from 38 glacial till samples collected in 2019 for the purpose of gold grain counting were reprocessed to evaluate the abundance of tantalum oxide grains with the use of an automated scanning microscope based on a proprietary technology by IOS Services Geoscientifiques Inc.</p><p>Tantalum oxides (tantalite, columbotantalite, wodginite and micronite) are a class of mineral that almost exclusively form in lithium bearing pegmatite (or LCT pegmatite), such as those currently being evaluated at the nearby Pontax-Central occurrence (Stria Lithium under option by Cygnus (Avenir) Metals), as well as the James Bay Lithium project (formerly Cyr Lithium by Allken Mining), the Rose project (Critical Element Lithium Corporation) or the Wabouchi mine (Nemaska Lithium). Of these samples, a total of 5950 tantalum oxide grains were observed, for an average of 156 grains per samples. As a comparative basis, a regional survey in the same area conducted by the Ministere de l'Energie et des Ressources Naturelles du Quebec, processed using the same technology, yielded an average count of 36 grains per samples, meaning the average sample from Pontax-II stands at the 97.6 centile of the regional population. Samples from Pontax includes tantalum oxide counts up to 797 grains, the highest count ever recorded by the laboratory. The high counts samples are clustered into two distinct kilometer-scale groups (figure 1), suggestive of two distinct sources. As these counts are not down-ice from the Pontax-Lithium occurrence, originating from this occurrence is ruled-out. As per comparison, somewhat smaller isolated counts from the MERNQ survey were at the origin of Li-FT Power' Pontax and Rupert project, where the relation between tantalum dispersion and lithium sources was confirmed (figure 2). Similarly, an orientation till survey conducted at Stria's Pontax-Lithium occurrence by Cygnus Metal highlighted a dispersion of similar size and intensity directly adjacent to the deposit of what is reported here.</p><p>Dean Hanisch, CEO of Stria Lithium, said today: \"These results caught us by surprise, since we basically demontrated the potential of the property to host fertile pegmatite occurrence within months of its acquisition! If you look at the map of the overall till samples of the region in relation to our numbers and then you match that with the similar footprint at Pontax Central that was drill tested, it's really exciting. We are anxious to send a team of geologists to conduct a prospect as soon as the forest fire situation allows us. We feel very fortunate to lean on the proprietary technology developed by IOS and their years of experience in this region. This scanning electron machine is the only one of its kind in the world and is invaluable in making calculated decisions that save time and money.\"</p><p>Figure 1: Tantalite Grain counts Pontax II</p><p>Figure 2: Tantalite Grain counts immediate region</p><p>Figure 3: Tantalite Grain counts in the region</p><p>About Stria Lithium</p><p>Stria Lithium (TSX-V: SRA) is an emerging resource exploration company developing Canadian lithium reserves in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay Territory of Quebec, Canada, to meet legislated demand for electric vehicles and their rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>Lithium is a rare metal and an indispensable component of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, one of the safest and most efficient energy storage technologies available today, used in everything from cell phones and power tools to electric cars and industrial-scale energy storage for renewable power sources such as wind and solar generation.</p><p>Stria's Pontax-II Project covers 55 square kilometres, approximately 25 kilometres to the west-south-west of Pontax-Lithium and is located adjacent to the Billy-Diamond paved highway. The Eeyou Istchee James Bay Territory of Quebec, where the project is located, is one of only a few known sources of lithium available for hard rock mining in North America.</p><p>As momentum builds for the green energy revolution and the shift to electric vehicles, governments in Canada and the U.S. are aggressively supporting the North American lithium industry, presenting the industry and its investors with a rare, if not unprecedented, opportunity for growth and prosperity well into the next decade and beyond.</p><p>Stria is committed to exceeding the industry's environmental, social and governance standards. A critical part of that commitment is forging meaningful, enduring and mutually beneficial relationships with the James Bay Cree Nation (Eeyouch), and engaging openly and respectfully as neighbours and collaborators in this exciting project that has the potential to create lasting jobs and prosperity for Eeyou Istchee and its people.</p><p>The technical content disclosed in the current press release was reviewed and approved by Rejean Girard, P.Geo and president of IOS Services Geoscientifiques Inc, a qualified person as defined under National Instrument NI-43-101.</p><p>For more information about Stria Lithium and the Pontax Lithium project, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://strialithium.com\">https://strialithium.com</url></p><p>Follow us on:</p><p>Twitter@StriaLithium</p><p>Instagram@strialithium</p><p>Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/strialithium\">http://www.facebook.com/strialithium</url></p><p>LinkedIn<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/stria-lithium/\">http://www.linkedin.com/company/stria-lithium/</url></p><p>For more information on Stria Lithium Inc., please contact:</p><p>Dean Hanisch</p><p>CEO Stria Lithium</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dhanisch@strialithium.com\">dhanisch@strialithium.com</email></p><p>+1(613) 612-6060</p><p>Investors Relations, Stria Lithium Inc.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ir@strialithium.com\">ir@strialithium.com</email></p><p>Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the accuracy or adequacy of this release.</p><p>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information</p><p>Except for statements of historical fact, this news release contains certain \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities law.

As CTV's Creeson Agecoutay reports, a change in the weather may be just the break firefighters need.</p><p>CREESON AGECOUTAY (Reporter): For almost two weeks, fire crews have been fighting an uphill battle in excruciating heat, trying to put out a total of 52 active fires across BC's interior.</p><p>BRYAN ZANDBERG (BC Wildfire Service Information Officer): It's still very active. The fire is still out of control, and we are doing our utmost to contain it right now.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: The dryer than usual temperatures have only fueled the flames as more than 300 square kilometres have now burned. A heavy storm is on the way, but officials fear it could spark more fires.</p><p>MIKHAIL ELSAY (BC Wildfire Service): Which could bring some moisture, but usually in the summer, the systems coming up from the south usually are accompanied with lightning as well.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: The largest wildfire is in Keremeos Creek, with many on edge not knowing what will happen next.</p><p>JASMINE ANDERSON (Store Manager): It's a scary thing, right? Two of our employees have been evacuated from Olalla.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: Across the country in Newfoundland, the Bay d'Espoir Highway reopened today, reconnecting the southern residents that were cut off for five days, allowing food and supplies in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: There's people that are travelling, and there's people that are just away for the day that were expecting to be home that night, so, you know, being stranded is not an easy thing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: I miss two of my dogs at home.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: The fires have now grown to 200 square kilometres, with more than 100 of the most vulnerable already evacuated. Newfoundland's premier says thousands more are on evacuation standby if the fires move closer.</p><p>ANDREW FUREY (Newfoundland and Labrador Premier): It is still expanding. It is still active and that causes us great concern.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: Fire crews did get a bit of a break today as some much needed rain hit many parts of the area.</p><p>JEFF MOTTY (Newfoundland Forest Fire Deputy Officer): Some of the fire activity is still plenty of open flame and smoke on that site, but it's really going to turn the corner soon.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: There was also a plan to bring supplies to that isolated southern region by ferry, but mechanical issues forced them to scrap that trip as it gets fixed in St. John's. Omar.</p><p>SACHEDINA: All right, Creeson, thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6648-3DR1-DYX2-92T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"423\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 CTV Televisions, Inc.

It's caused the evacuation of some 67,000 people, about half the population of Shelburne County.</p><p><br/><br/> But the Tantallon wildfire - though 25 times smaller - has prompted the evacuation of some 16,000 people and left some 150 razed homes in its wake.<br/><br/> To a large extent, that potentially bloated price tag will have to do with the desire of many to get back to nature, to build their homes next to forested areas. And although that lifestyle comes with a great many perks, it can also come with significant risk.<br/><br/> Those developments are called wildland-urban interfaces (WUI) and part of the risk comes in the knowledge that fires are a natural part of many forest ecosystems. And when a fire begins to burn a forest with an urban development in it, that subdivision just becomes so much fuel for the fire.<br/><br/> These WUIs are significant because in terms of percentage of land considered WUI, the Maritimes leads the country by a long shot. And Nova Scotia is at the forefront of those three provinces by significant margin with 45 per cent of its area being a WUI.<br/><br/> Two years ago, as a fire was devastating the town of <url normalizedValue=\"http://Lost%20homes%20and%20screaming%20horses:%20How%20survivors%20of%20a%20Canadian%20inferno%20are%20greeting%20a%20raging%20new%20wildfire%20season\">Lytton, B.C.</url>, the National Research Council published the <url normalizedValue=\"https://nrc-publications.canada.ca/eng/view/ft/?id=3a0b337f-f980-418f-8ad8-6045d1abc3b3\">National Guide for Wildland-Urban Interface Fires</url>.<br/><br/> At the time it said: \"The threat posed by WUI fires is growing as urban areas expand into wildlands, rural areas increase in population, and wildfires become more frequent and severe due to climate change. In the coming decades, the risk of WUI fire is expected to increase both in regions of Canada with a long history of wildfires and in those with no such history.\"<br/><br/> \"If you build a house in a forest, you're actually removing trees to build the house. So, you're replacing one flammable fuel with another,\" said Jen Beverly, assistant professor of wildland fire at the University of Alberta.<br/><br/> \"They're putting themselves in a flammable landscape - (they're) not the cause of the flammability - (but) if you're building something embedded in a sea of fuel - which is a forest - there is potential for fire.\"<br/><br/> When those developments are built, she continued, many of its occupants are not anticipating climate change and droughts and atypical springs such as the one Canada is experiencing. But as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/climate-change.html\">climate chang</url>e continues to change global weather patterns, the frequency and severity of wildfires is also increasing.<br/><br/> According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, wildfires so far this year have burned 2.7 million hectares of forest. By contrast, the ten-year average of hectares burned by this time is 220,000. <br/><br/> That increase translates to WUIs too.<br/><br/> Lynn Johnston, a forest fire research specialist at the Canadian Forest Service, was co-author of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF16221\">research that first mapped Canada's WUIs.</url><br/><br/> A more recent study she undertook <url normalizedValue=\"https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/cjfr-2020-0422\">looked at climate change and how much more fire activity we're going to see in WUI communities.</url><br/><br/> \"It was shocking,\" she said. \"It's a lot more.<br/><br/> \"Fire activity is going to increase in most places in Canada, but those increases near the communities are very concerning. And the largest increases we found were in more remote and in particular First Nations communities.<br/><br/> \u201cSo yeah, it's going to get more and more challenging in the future, that's for sure.\"<br/><br/> But those communities have already been built, and people love living in them. It would be the rare person who would abandon their home for an increased fire risk, as evidenced by residents of California's Orange and San Bernardino Counties, as an example, who suffer almost annual wildfires.<br/><br/> Priority then turns to mitigating the risk for existing communities and prescient planning for those that don't.<br/><br/> \"Rather than a wildfire control problem, we have a problem with homes and structures that are way too easily ignited by small embers or just creeping low flames,\" said Alan Westhaver, a wildland urban fire expert, and the owner of ForestWise Environmental Consulting. \"And that needs to be our point of attack. And that's what wildfire risk mitigation is all about.\"<br/><br/> It's important to realize that in WUI fires houses aren't generally burned by a wall of flame, he said, rather in most cases they're ignited by burning embers from the forest that can travel on the wind a long way from the fire itself.<br/><br/> His studies on the fires that ravaged Fort McMurray found that two-thirds of the hazard of ignition of a house is related to the vegetation around that house. Other studies showed that in the Slave Lake fires in 2011 a number of houses were ignited by fire burning along wooden fences that attached to the house. There is even a case documented of a house being ignited by embers falling on a welcome mat.<br/><br/> So, the first step is making the house more resistant to ignition.<br/><br/> FireSmart, whose goal is to help homeowners address the challenges of living in WUIs, defines what it calls the Home Ignition Zone, the area 30 metres around a home where a homeowner can remove combustible materials - like bark mulch and piles of leaves and needles and trees up against the house.<br/><br/> FireSmart also makes recommendations for the actual structure of the house - sidings and roofing that are less flammable and screens over outside vents.<br/><br/> But a lot of the fire hazard can be mitigated by early planning too, if developers plan the community with an increased fire hazard in mind.<br/><br/> Sometimes, however, that's easier said than done.<br/><br/> \"Our development standards haven't kept pace with the changing environment,\" said Ray Ault, the director of FireSmart.<br/><br/> \"That whole notion of bylaws or development and planning? That really hasn't kept pace with our understanding of the potential risks that folks face. And I think that that's one of the concerns.\"<br/><br/> The aforementioned National Research Council guide, he said, contains a slew of recommendations for developers for planning communities that mitigate the risk of fire damage - things like reducing the area of the community in contact with the forest, planning golf courses or big box stores on the outskirts as de facto fire breaks, and even carefully planning what kinds of trees are planted in the community.<br/><br/> \"But it's a guide. It's not code, it's not regulation, it's not legislated, it's recommendations. One of the things that over time will happen is that that guide will in time become regulation.<br/><br/> \"(But) those processes take time. They require lots of consultation. And of course, anything that drives up the cost of housing is met with a fair amount of reluctance.<br/><br/> \"So, some of the challenge is going to be coming up with development plans that will take the wildland fire into consideration, but hopefully don't result in increased cost.\"<br/><br/> Steve McKinley is a Halifax-based reporter for the Star.

Open fire prohibitions came into effect on April 16.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fire Information Officer with the Provincial Wildfire Coordination Centre Hannah Swift said during the current pandemic, larger open burns pose an unnecessary risk and could detract from wildfire detection and response capabilities. The current open burning prohibitions should also decrease the number of \"false alarms\" (where firefighters respond to a report of smoke, only to find the smoke is coming from a controlled burn and not from a wildfire).</p><p>\"These open burning prohibitions will reduce demands on firefighting resources and help protect the health and safety of the public, as well as BC Wildfire Service staff. They will also help reduce the impact of wildfire smoke on air quality and public health during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" she added. \"These open burning prohibitions also support the BC Centre for Disease Control's recommendation to help reduce excess air pollution in airsheds throughout the province.\"</p><p>This season will be unusual for responders because of COVID-19 and Swift said they have developed protocols related to physical distancing and other precautions to support crews while they respond to wildfires.</p><p>\"We are also committed to finding innovative ways to work differently, if necessary, to maintain our ability to respond to wildfires,\" she said. \"We are prepared for the 2020 wildfire season. Other primary goals at this time are to: keep our staff informed about COVID-19; reduce their risk of exposure; maintain a supportive, healthy and resilient workforce; and adapt our operations and responses as necessary.\"</p><p>Some of the measures being taken by the BC Wildfire Service to respond to the COVID-19 situation are modifying required training and new employee orientation activities and implementing alternate ways to deliver this training where possible; postponing face-to-face meetings in favour of meetings by conference call or video conferencing; limiting travel, unless an urgent issue must be addressed and alternative means of communication are not practical; only engaging in field work activities (unrelated to wildfire response) that have a low risk of COVID-19 exposure for staff and following the advice of the Provincial Health Officer to help protect the well-being of BC Wildfire Service staff and others.</p><p>The Village of Telkwa is preparing for the season the best they can under the unusual circumstances.</p><p>\"We have to do our practices through on-line methods,\" said Fire Chief Laurence Turney. \"So far we've all been able to complete the Wildfire preparation lessons online, but we've been unable to do much for practical practices yet, due to the social distancing requirements. We're hopeful that we will be able to get out and work together outside relatively soon so that we can work with some of our newer people with using the tools, hoses and pumps; as well as showing them the different techniques for different wildland fires. With our grant money we have ordered some of our wildfire gear and expect to see it in the next week or so, with more coming as we get further into May.\"</p><p>Smithers Fire Chief Keith Stecko isn't sure yet what the season will look like.</p><p>\"A lot of that has to be determined,\" he said. \"Details have to be flushed out on what that looks like, if we have crews in the field and if we are engaged in fire fighting activity what that will look like, I haven't heard anything from the province yet.\"</p><p>The Bulkley Valley Emergency Support Services is also making changes on how they operate during the current pandemic.</p><p>Normally ESS volunteers meet face to face with people affected by disaster, in order to provide them with 72 hours of essential services like food, clothing, incidentals and other services, and to register them with the province.</p><p>\"At this time, ESS has changed to assessing needs and registering affected individuals over the phone whenever possible. If this is not possible, ESS volunteers can still meet affected individuals face to face while adhering to wearing recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), including: half mask respirators, face shields and gloves,\" said Director Matt Herzog. \"These measure are in place to protect our ESS volunteers, and the people they are meeting with.\"</p><p>He added in the event of a larger emergency or disaster, they would open reception centres, but with some notable changes to allow for social distancing and other measures to help stop the spread of COVID-19. It is important to note, he said, that these measures are in place for the protection of both the public and ESS volunteers, in order to operate and provide essential services.</p><p>Communications Specialist with Northwest Fire Centre Cathy L'Orsa said it is hard to tell yet what sort of fire season the region can anticipate.</p><p>\"As far as predictions for the upcoming fire season, I'm afraid the confidence in any seasonal forecast for that far in advance is very low considering the highly variable nature of the factors that influence wildfire. Fire season severity and day to day fire behaviour is very much driven by short term weather patterns,\" she said.</p><p>\"I can tell you that we ended fall 2019 with some pockets of deep dryness in the far north but the April snowpack numbers are well above normal up there which should balance that out. We have a fairly average snowpack for the rest of our fire centre and we are a couple of weeks behind in most areas with respect to the signs of spring. The next couple of weeks are forecast to see above-normal temperatures, so it is important that everyone heeds the prohibitions put in place by the BCWS and MoECCS to avoid smoke in the air and unnecessary risk to our first responders.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMTINW-3987207</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMTINW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YR6-FJR1-JDH1-C2R7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438222</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"983\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Smithers Interior News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May 2021, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Thursday, Sept. 28 2023, 18 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022 the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> (NEW: AUG. 21, 2023) Clarkson Road, between Matena Avenue and Sunningdale Bend in Ward 2<br/><br/> Cobalt Street, between Indian Road and Canyon Street in Ward 2.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May 2021, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Thursday, Sept. 28, 2023, 18 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022 the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> (NEW: AUG. 21, 2023) Clarkson Road, between Matena Avenue and Sunningdale Bend in Ward 2<br/><br/> Cobalt Street, between Indian Road and Canyon Street in Ward 2.

It burned for about a month, and produced smoke into October, though limited growth was observed after mid-September. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fire burned about 139 hectares of the nearly 28,000-hectare watershed.  </p><p>\u201cThe fire burned only a very small portion (0.5 %) of the Glacier Creek watershed and no creek drains the fire area,\u201d wrote provincial government geomorphologist Sarah Crookshanks. \u201cTherefore, the likelihood of downstream impacts is negligible.\u201d </p><p>The fire was located in steep, hard-to-access terrain, and was mostly just monitored by the BC Wildfire Service. It is listed as \u2018under control\u2019 by the forestry service. </p><p>Crookshank\u2019s surveys try to predict the impact fires can have on future flooding and landslides that affect water quality, roads and other infrastructure in an area. (Her recent report on the Briggs Fire east of Kaslo also foresaw limited impacts from that burn.) She found only 0.6% of the area suffered a high-burn severity, while 11% was moderately burned. </p><p>\u201cWhile the terrain is certainly steep to generate landslides, the incremental effect of the fire is low due to the low vegetation burn severity,\u201d she states in the report.  </p><p>She also determined a large 2007 landslide in the burn area was  unaffected by the fire. </p><p>\u201cThe area immediately above this slide has patchy moderate soil burn severity and low/unburned vegetation burn severity,\u201d she reports. \u201cThe likeliest time of year to see slide movement at this site is during the spring melt when the slope is saturated. Wildfire can increase snow accumulation and the rate of snowmelt through changes to the forest canopy.\u201d </p><p>However, she notes that because the fire had minimal impacts to that canopy above the slide, \u201cthe incremental effect of this fire on movement at this site is expected to be low.\u201d </p><p>That\u2019s good news for one landowner in the area, she says. </p><p>\u201cGiven the low burn severity, lack of creek channels and no history of overland flow, there is a low likelihood that the wildfire will contribute to the initiation of a landslide that would impact this dwelling,\u201d she says. </p><p>She also said the fire shouldn\u2019t have any significant impact on drinking water quality or the campground that\u2019s in the area. </p><p>Monument Creek hazard </p><p>Meanwhile, a report by Crookshanks on the Monument Creek fire northwest of Nelson, also released last month, found that residents who get their water from Duhamel Creek might face some degradation of their water quality at times in the future. </p><p>The September 4 fire burned about 440 hectares in the Duhamel Creek watershed and nipped the edge of the Lemon Creek watershed. While the Duhamel drainage has a history of floods and debris flows, the fire did not affect the most hazardous areas very severely. Thus, \u201cit is improbable that a debris flow generated within the fire area would transition to a debris flood within the main Duhamel Creek channel,\u201d the report states. </p><p>The report also recommends the Duhamel Face (Heights) road be closed, as it has a history of failure and the fire may have destabilized the road bed further. </p><p>\u201cEvidence of potential instability was observed at one location,\u201d she notes. \u201cThe burned area may increase the likelihood of landslides originating from this road.\u201d </p><p>There was no mention in the report of any potential impact to the Lemon Creek watershed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-4da8a7d0b1ec46dca385678a738db119</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66WV-HP81-DY9S-T48J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"592\"/><timeReceived>01:57 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 18, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEBQ</classCode><className>BURN INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001501</classCode><className>RIVERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A2NF</classCode><className>AQUIFERS &amp; WATERSHEDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001817</classCode><className>WATER QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001003</classCode><className>LANDSLIDES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRQJ</classCode><className>WATER SUPPLY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000A7YO</classCode><className>GEOGRAPHY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001914</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The 2023 drill program to date has focused on the continued expansion of the Hinge Target located immediately west of the Eau Claire Deposit with the goal of updating the Eau Claire Mineral Resource Estimate at the end of the season. Drilling at the Hinge Target continues to return multiple stacked zones of gold mineralization from each drill hole including 5.0 metres (m) of 3.6 g/t Au within a broader interval of 14.0m of 2.37 g/t Au. Additional drill intercepts include 6.5m of 2.66 g/t Au, 6.0m of 2.77 g/t Au and 1.0m of 10.35 g/t Au (Table 1; Figure 1).</p><p>Drill holes 23EC-063 and 23EC-064 have expanded the Hinge Target gold mineralization 50m up-dip and 75m to the west respectively. Drill hole 23EC-064 represents the first of a series of infill drill holes designed to tighten up the spacing of the 2022 Hinge Target drilling to a nominal spacing of 60-80m. Importantly, the broad intercepts of 14.0m of 2.37 g/t Au, 6.0m of 2.77 g/t Au and 6.5m of 2.66 g/t Au continue to show the overall strength of the mineralized system within the Hinge Target.</p><p>These initial results provide confidence in the modeled sub-vertical geometry of the veining at the Hinge Target as the Company works towards a meaningful update to the currently defined Eau Claire Resource which was last estimated in 2018 at 853,000 ounces (oz) gold at an average grade of 6.18 g/t gold in the Measured and Indicated Category and 500,000 oz gold at 6.35 g/t gold in the inferred category1.</p><p>\"Fury is pleased to announce the initial drill results from our 2023 drill program at Eau Claire, as these results further confirm our thesis that the Eau Claire resource is open for significant expansion. Importantly, we have continued to extend the mineralized footprint at the Hinge Target and confirmed our geologic model,\" commented Tim Clark, CEO of Fury. \"The results of the first three 2023 drill holes at Eau Claire are also important as we prepare for our resource update at year-end. As for the impact of the forest fire, we had a four-week hold on operations, but we are now actively drilling at full capacity with a helicopter and two drills turning on the property. Investors should expect a steady flow of news through year-end from Eau Claire, Percival, and a number of strong prospective anomalies to the east. With a recent directors and management site visit behind us, the three takeaways were: the reminder of the incredible infrastructure backdrop that exists in the James Bay region, the visual size and scale of the Eau Claire project today, and the tremendous potential for discovery surrounding the 30 kilometres of the Cannard Deformation Zone.\"</p><p>Table 1: Eau Claire Drill Results</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colnum=\"1\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry>Hole IDFromToLength (m)Au g/t</entry></row><row><entry>23EC-0624514521.0010.35</entry></row><row><entry>4674692.004.89</entry></row><row><entry>49350714.002.37</entry></row><row><entry>Incl.4995045.003.60</entry></row><row><entry>577.55780.504.32</entry></row><row><entry>581.5582.51.004.97</entry></row><row><entry>5915921.002.48</entry></row><row><entry>6226286.002.77</entry></row><row><entry>Incl.6226231.007.61</entry></row><row><entry>637.56391.501.76</entry></row><row><entry>667.56691.501.47</entry></row><row><entry>6776803.001.90</entry></row><row><entry>6936952.001.11</entry></row><row><entry>23EC-063417418.51.503.63</entry></row><row><entry>4814821.005.44</entry></row><row><entry>488.5489.51.002.65</entry></row><row><entry>4964971.006.67</entry></row><row><entry>529531.52.502.67</entry></row><row><entry>603604.51.501.97</entry></row><row><entry>6566582.001.45</entry></row><row><entry>667668.51.502.09</entry></row><row><entry>684.56916.502.66</entry></row><row><entry>Incl.688689.51.505.49</entry></row><row><entry>70871911.001.23</entry></row><row><entry>23EC-0644024042.003.80</entry></row><row><entry>503.5504.51.002.82</entry></row><row><entry>589.5592.53.002.64</entry></row><row><entry>622.5623.51.002.63</entry></row><row><entry>644.5647.53.003.03</entry></row><row><entry>6726731.009.31</entry></row><row><entry>7407411.002.50</entry></row><row><entry>749.57577.501.30</entry></row><row><entry>Main intervals - Au grade*thickness no less than 2 g/t*m with grade is no less than 1 g/t, maximum consecutive dilution 2mSub-intervals - Au grade*thickness no less than 7 g/t*m with grade is no less than 3.5 g/t, maximum consecutive dilution 2mDownhole thickness was used due to the unknown zone orientations</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Western Hinge Target</p><p>The 2023 exploration program at the Hinge Target is focusing on the continued expansion of the gold mineralization to the west and up-dip while tightening up the drill spacing to 70-80m to prove continuity. The reported intercepts at the Hinge Target are defined by two 100m wide corridors of mineralization each hosting multiple subvertical quartz tourmaline veins (Figure 2). A total of nineteen discrete veins have been modeled within the two corridors to date. The Hinge Target remains open in all directions.</p><p>\"The results from these first three 2023 drill holes build on the 2022 success at the Hinge Target. We have confirmed both continuity of the vein corridors as well as that the system remains open. The broad widths of mineralization, which we do not see typically within the core of the deposit, indicate the mineralization event at the Hinge Target was particularly intense. We look forward to additional results as the drill moves east towards the defined Eau Claire resource,\" stated Bryan Atkinson, SVP, Exploration of Fury.</p><p>Figure 1: Eau Claire Resource Long Section Looking North showing the location of the reported drill intercepts and the overall scale potential of the Hinge Target.</p><p>Figure 2: Cross Section of the Hinge Target Looking West, showing the multiple stacked sub-vertical veins.</p><p>Sampling and Assaying Disclosure</p><p>Analytical samples for the Drill Program were taken by sawing HQ diameter core into equal halves on site with one half sent to ALS Chemex in Val D'or, Quebec, Canada for preparation and analysis. All samples were assayed using a 50 g nominal weight fire assay with inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectrometry finish (Au-ICP22) and multi-element four acid digest ICP-AES/ICP-MS method (ME-MS61). Where Au-ICP22 results were greater than 0.5 ppm Au the assay was repeated with a 50 g nominal weight fire assay with atomic absorption finish (Au-AA24). Samples containing more than 10 ppm by Au-AA24 were re-assayed with 50 g nominal weight fire assay with gravimetric finish (Au-GRA22). QA/QC programs using internal standard samples, field and lab duplicates and blanks indicate good overall accuracy and precision.</p><p>1 See the technical report entitled \"Technical Report, Updated Mineral Resource Estimate and Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Eau Claire Gold Deposit, Clearwater Property, Quebec, Canada\" (the \"Eau Claire Report\") dated effective February 4, 2018, prepared by Eugene Puritch, P.Eng., FEC, CET, Antoine Yassa, P.Geo., Andrew Bradfield, P.Eng., Allan Armitage, Ph.D., P.Geo., which can be found on the Company's profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url> .</p><p>David Rivard, P.Geo, Exploration Manager at Fury, is a \"qualified person\" within the meaning of Canadian mineral projects disclosure standards instrument 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical disclosures in this press release.</p><p>About Fury Gold Mines Limited</p><p>Fury Gold Mines Limited is a well-financed Canadian-focused exploration company positioned in two prolific mining regions across Canada and holds a 59.5 million common share position in Dolly Varden Silver Corp (23.4%).

You just have to stand back and stay safe and let it do its thing,\" said Cowan, the lead trainer of Fire1, a private contractor that trains firefighters for Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's little comfort for the owners of thousands of homes that are at risk and the many more people subject to mandatory evacuation orders in Nova Scotia, where an \"out-of-control\" fire was raging some 20 km from the edge of the provincial capital Monday.</p><p>But that is the fickle nature of the threat.</p><p>\"The worst thing in our business - and I hated to see it - was losing somebody's house,\" Cowan said. \"You hear nightmares of whole communities burned - that would keep me up at night. It's always a struggle, because you never know.\"</p><p>According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, there are 213 fires underway across the country, 81 of which are considered to be \"out of control.\"</p><p>The bulk of the blazes are in Western Canada, with Alberta and British Columbia fighting more than a hundred between them.</p><p>Mike Flannigan, a professor and expert in wildland fire management at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, B.C., says the country is experiencing a \"really fast start\" to the wildfire season.</p><p>Every spring, he said, there is a risky period of between two and five weeks after the snow melts, during which dead organic material from the previous year - leaves, branches, fallen trees - are at risk of catching fire, whether through human activity or lightning strikes.</p><p>But preparing for the battle, and allotting resources, is the trickiest part of the challenge for governments.</p><p>Less than a week ago, Nova Scotia deemed its wildland fire situation to be at a \"manageable level\" - good enough, at least, to allow it to send 20 of its firefighters to help in Yellowknife.</p><p>But on Monday, it was all hands on deck to protect local lives and property in the Halifax region, with 170 traditional firefighters, 32 forest firefighters and another seven military firefighters working on the blaze that was moving south, blown by the winds.</p><p>\"It's hard to gauge sometimes, because you want to help,\" said Flannigan. \"Alberta, B.C., Northwest Territories, Saskatchewan - they need help at the moment. But you also want to protect your home base.\"</p><p>Each year, hundreds of young people sign up to do just that, going through basic training to qualify for a well-paid summer job filled with some risk but plenty of reward.</p><p>\"Some of them know zero. Some of them are money-motivated,\" said Cowan, who recalled a female recruit who confided that her parents had offered her $10,000 not to spend her summer fighting bush fires.</p><p>\"(The job) has its peaks and valleys, but the adrenalin - a lot of these people are adrenalin junkies, much like myself. They come in and they are seeking that adrenalin rush.\"</p><p>But while there is no shortage of young people ready to take up a hose, shovel and hard hat for the summer, there have been countrywide problems hanging on to senior-level firefighters who have the training and experience needed lead the fight against the flames.</p><p>\"Once you get a bit older and have been in the job for a while, everybody wants to build a life. With the young people, they don't mind a season and then they go travel or go back to school. But the more experienced people want to make a career out of it,\" Cowan said.</p><p>Instead, most must make do with seasonal, rather than permanent contracts. British Columbia hires about 1,000 wildfire firefighters each year, while Ontario is believed to hire fewer, about 700.</p><p>Cowan was one of the lucky ones, getting a permanent job five years after starting as a forest firefighter, allowing him to enjoy a 37-year career, which he has followed up with another decade as a trainer.</p><p>Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources, which oversees wildland firefighting services, revealed it had hired a consultant to work on recruitment and retention strategies, after complaints about pay and staffing levels from the union.</p><p>Concerns about hanging on to experienced firefighters have led some provinces to establish year-round wildland fire services. British Columbia did so last year, and Flannigan predicted other provinces would eventually follow suit.</p><p>If they are wise, provinces can put these year-round crews to work responding to other emergency events, Flannigan said.</p><p>\"They're there as a resource for emergency management when and where needed.\"</p><p>And the needs will only continue to increase as the impacts of climate change lead to more frequent extreme weather conditions, said Flannigan.</p><p>\"It's those hot, dry, windy days where you get those crown fires - fires that go from the forest floor up to the tops, or crowns, of the tree. They get so intense that no matter how many aircraft or how many crews there are, it's challenging-to-impossible to extinguish through direct attack.\"</p><p>They are the kind of wildland fires that people remember their entire careers.</p><p>For Cowan, it was the one that ignited in June 1980 in Thunder Bay.</p><p>\"It was large and it just wouldn't stop,\" he recalled. \"It started in June and we were working on that really until the snow was flying.\"</p><p>He remembers it, too, because it was his first season as a crew leader. His team of firefighters got \"burned out\" - evacuated urgently and forced to leave behind their camp gear and personal items.</p><p>\"We waited for the weather to finally put it out,\" he said.</p><p>Another time, he said, he was sent to help out in British Columbia. His crew was working a night shift and felt quite pleased with their efforts when they finally went to bed the following morning.</p><p>They woke to heartbreaking news: the fire had taken its revenge during the day, swallowing up 60 rural homes and trailers in a remote valley.</p><p>Cowans' last call was to fight the Ontario forest fires in Red Lake in 2021, which burned through the summer and into October. But at the age of 68, he still gets the same rush as the police officer who hears a siren, or the boxer who hears his waiting crowd.</p><p>\"As we speak right now, I can't see it but I hear a helicopter off in the distance and it makes me wonder if they've got a little lightning fire around here,\" he said. \"It's that sound you don't forget.\"</p><p>Allan Woods is a Montreal-based staff reporter for the Star.

You just have to stand back and stay safe and let it do its thing,\" said Cowan, the lead trainer of Fire1, a private contractor that trains firefighters for Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources.<br/><br/> That's little comfort for the owners of thousands of homes that are at risk and the many more people subject to mandatory evacuation orders in Nova Scotia, where an \"out-of-control\" fire was raging some 20 kilometres from the provincial capital Monday.<br/><br/> But that is the fickle nature of the threat.<br/><br/> \"The worst thing in our business - and I hated to see it - was losing somebody's house,\" Cowan said. \"You hear nightmares of whole communities burned - that would keep me up at night. It's always a struggle, because you never know.\"<br/><br/> According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, there are 213 fires underway across the country, 81 of which are considered to be \"out of control.\"<br/><br/> The bulk of the blazes are in western Canada, with Alberta and British Columbia fighting more than a hundred between them.<br/><br/> Mike Flannigan, a professor and expert in wildland fire management at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, B.C., says the country is experiencing a \"really fast start\" to the wildfire season.<br/><br/> Every spring, he said, there is a risky period of between two and five weeks after the snow melts, during which dead organic material from the previous year - leaves, branches, fallen trees - are at risk of catching fire, whether through human activity or lightning strikes.<br/><br/> But preparing for the battle, and allotting resources, is the trickiest part of the challenge for governments.<br/><br/> Less than a week ago, Nova Scotia deemed its wildland fire situation to be at a \"manageable level\" - good enough, at least, to allow it to send 20 of its firefighters to help in Yellowknife.<br/><br/> But on Monday, it was all hands on deck to protect local lives and property in the Halifax region, with 170 traditional firefighters, 32 forest firefighters and another seven military firefighters working on the blaze that was moving south, blown by the winds.<br/><br/> \"It's hard to gauge sometimes, because you want to help,\" Flannigan said. \"Alberta, B.C., Northwest Territories, Saskatchewan - they need help at the moment. But you also want to protect your home base.\"<br/><br/> Each year, hundreds of young people sign up to do just that, going through basic training to qualify for a well-paid summer job filled with some risk but plenty of reward.<br/><br/> \"Some of them know zero. Some of them are money-motivated,\" said Cowan, who recalled a female recruit who confided that her parents had offered her $10,000 not to spend her summer fighting bush fires.<br/><br/> \"(The job) has its peaks and valleys, but the adrenalin - a lot of these people are adrenalin junkies, much like myself. They come in and they are seeking that adrenalin rush.\"<br/><br/> But while there is no shortage of young people ready to take up a hose, shovel and hard hat for the summer, there have been countrywide problems hanging on to senior-level firefighters who have the training and experience needed lead the fight against the flames.<br/><br/> \"Once you get a bit older and have been in the job for a while, everybody wants to build a life. With the young people, they don't mind a season and then they go travel or go back to school. But the more experienced people want to make a career out of it,\" Cowan said.<br/><br/> Instead, most must make do with seasonal, rather than permanent contracts. British Columbia hires about 1,000 wildfire firefighters each year, while Ontario is believed to hire fewer, about 700.<br/><br/> Cowan was one of the lucky ones, getting a permanent job five years after starting as a forest firefighter, allowing him to enjoy a 37-year career, which he has followed up with another decade as a trainer.<br/><br/>Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources, which oversees wildland firefighting services, revealed it had hired a consultant to work on recruitment and retention strategies, after complaints about pay and staffing levels from the union.<br/><br/> Concerns about hanging on to experienced firefighters have led some provinces to establish year-round wildland fire services. British Columbia did so last year, and Flannigan predicted other provinces would eventually follow suit.<br/><br/> If they are wise, provinces can put these year-round crews to work responding to other emergency events, Flannigan said.<br/><br/> \"They're there as a resource for emergency management when and where needed.\"<br/><br/> And the needs will only continue to increase as the impacts of climate change lead to more frequent extreme weather conditions, Flannigan said.<br/><br/> \"It's those hot, dry, windy days where you get those crown fires - fires that go from the forest floor up to the tops, or crowns, of the tree. They get so intense that no matter how many aircraft or how many crews there are, it's challenging-to-impossible to extinguish through direct attack.\"<br/><br/> They are the kind of wildland fires that people remember their entire careers.<br/><br/> For Cowan, it was the one that ignited in June 1980 in Thunder Bay.<br/><br/> \"It was large and it just wouldn't stop,\" he recalled. \"It started in June and we were working on that really until the snow was flying.\"<br/><br/> He remembers it, too, because it was his first season as a crew leader. His team of firefighters got \"burned out\" - evacuated urgently and forced to leave behind their camp gear and personal items.<br/><br/> \"We waited for the weather to finally put it out,\" he said.<br/><br/> Another time, he said, he was sent to help out in British Columbia. His crew was working a night shift and felt quite pleased with their efforts when they finally went to bed the following morning.<br/><br/> They woke to heartbreaking news: the fire had taken its revenge during the day, swallowing up 60 rural homes and trailers in a remote valley.<br/><br/> Cowan's last call was to fight the Ontario forest fires in Red Lake in 2021, which burned through the summer and into October. But at the age of 68, he still gets the same rush as the police officer who hears a siren, or the boxer who hears his waiting crowd.<br/><br/> \"As we speak right now, I can't see it but I hear a helicopter off in the distance and it makes me wonder if they've got a little lightning fire around here,\" he said. \"It's that sound you don't forget.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023053068029976</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68BS-VBY1-F197-554C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1096\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

But you also want to protect your home base.\"<br/><br/> Each year, hundreds of young people sign up to do just that, going through basic training to qualify for a well-paid summer job filled with some risk but plenty of reward.<br/><br/> \"Some of them know zero. Some of them are money-motivated,\" said Cowan, who recalled a female recruit who confided that her parents had offered her $10,000 not to spend her summer fighting bush fires.<br/><br/> \"(The job) has its peaks and valleys, but the adrenalin - a lot of these people are adrenalin junkies, much like myself. They come in and they are seeking that adrenalin rush.\"<br/><br/> But while there is no shortage of young people ready to take up a hose, shovel and hard hat for the summer, there have been countrywide problems hanging on to senior-level firefighters who have the training and experience needed lead the fight against the flames.<br/><br/> \"Once you get a bit older and have been in the job for a while, everybody wants to build a life. With the young people, they don't mind a season and then they go travel or go back to school. But the more experienced people want to make a career out of it,\" Cowan said.<br/><br/> Instead, most must make do with seasonal, rather than permanent contracts. British Columbia hires about 1,000 wildfire firefighters each year, while Ontario is believed to hire fewer, about 700.<br/><br/> Cowan was one of the lucky ones, getting a permanent job five years after starting as a forest firefighter, allowing him to enjoy a 37-year career, which he has followed up with another decade as a trainer.<br/><br/>Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources, which oversees wildland firefighting services, revealed it had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.timminstoday.com/local-news/concerns-are-real-wildland-fire-program-feeling-the-burnout-7064919\">hired a consultant</url> to work on recruitment and retention strategies, after complaints about pay and staffing levels from the union.<br/><br/> Concerns about hanging on to experienced firefighters have led some provinces to establish year-round wildland fire services. British Columbia did so last year, and Flannigan predicted other provinces would eventually follow suit.<br/><br/> If they are wise, provinces can put these year-round crews to work responding to other emergency events, Flannigan said.<br/><br/> \"They're there as a resource for emergency management when and where needed.\"<br/><br/> And the needs will only continue to increase as the impacts of climate change lead to more frequent extreme weather conditions, said Flannigan.<br/><br/> \"It's those hot, dry, windy days where you get those crown fires - fires that go from the forest floor up to the tops, or crowns, of the tree. They get so intense that no matter how many aircraft or how many crews there are, it's challenging-to-impossible to extinguish through direct attack.\"<br/><br/> They are the kind of wildland fires that people remember their entire careers.<br/><br/> For Cowan, it was the one that ignited in June 1980 in Thunder Bay.<br/><br/> \"It was large and it just wouldn't stop,\" he recalled. \"It started in June and we were working on that really until the snow was flying.\"<br/><br/> He remembers it, too, because it was his first season as a crew leader. His team of firefighters got \"burned out\" - evacuated urgently and forced to leave behind their camp gear and personal items.<br/><br/> \"We waited for the weather to finally put it out,\" he said.<br/><br/> Another time, he said, he was sent to help out in British Columbia. His crew was working a night shift and felt quite pleased with their efforts when they finally went to bed the following morning.<br/><br/> They woke to heartbreaking news: the fire had taken its revenge during the day, swallowing up 60 rural homes and trailers in a remote valley.<br/><br/> Cowans' last call was to fight the Ontario forest fires in Red Lake in 2021, which burned through the summer and into October. But at the age of 68, he still gets the same rush as the police officer who hears a siren, or the boxer who hears his waiting crowd.<br/><br/> \"As we speak right now, I can't see it but I hear a helicopter off in the distance and it makes me wonder if they've got a little lightning fire around here,\" he said. \"It's that sound you don't forget.\"<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/authors.woods_allan.html\">Allan Woods</url> is a Montreal-based staff reporter for the Star.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May 2021, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Monday, Sept. 25 2023, 21 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022 the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> (NEW: AUG. 21, 2023) Clarkson Road, between Matena Avenue and Sunningdale Bend in Ward 2<br/><br/> Cobalt Street, between Indian Road and Canyon Street in Ward 2.

Others were on the receiving end of bad news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The RCMP called me this morning to say they went to see our house and it was burned down and they couldn't find the pets there,\" Katherine Tarateski told The Canadian Press on Monday.</p><p>Tarateski said she was with her husband Nick and their young daughter Mia at a family gathering on Sunday when they heard about the approaching fires and rushed back to their home in Hammonds Plains to save their dog and cat. But when they arrived police had already blocked their street.</p><p>\"The house can be rebuilt,\" she said. \"But my pets ... I'm just devastated. It's hard.\"</p><p>Through a dark haze of smoke, sometimes with fires burning along the side of the roads, approximately 16,000 people were forced to leave their homes amid multiple evacuation orders.</p><p>By early afternoon, Nova Scotia's Department of Natural Resources confirmed the wildfire covered about eight square kilometres and the wind had gusted from the north up to 40 kilometres per hour, making its progress dangerous and unpredictable. The evacuation orders, meanwhile, applied to an area of approximately 75 square kilometres, within about a 30-minute drive of Halifax.</p><p>At a Monday afternoon briefing at Emergency Management Office headquarters in Dartmouth provincial officials said that the wildfire had, at that point, burned 788 hectares.</p><p>\"We can only imagine the fear that you're feeling, the uncertainty you're feeling about when you will be able to return back to your home, what you may be returning to,\" said Nova Scotia premier Tim Houston.</p><p>\"But know that the Bluenoser spirit is alive and well in this province, and your friends and neighbours will be there to support you in every way that they can.\"</p><p>\"We will get through this. We will get through this together.\"</p><p>Houston said that the province would provide $500 to every household required to evacuate because of the Tantallon fires and those further southwest in Shelburne County, with funding to be administered through the Canadian Red Cross.</p><p>Volunteer firefighter Brett Tetanish fought back tears as he described arriving late Sunday at a house fire in the Westwood subdivision, the scene where the first fires were reported around 3 p.m.</p><p>\"There were fires on both sides of the road, structures on fire. There were cars abandoned and burnt in the middle of the road,\" he said while outside the command post.</p><p>Tetanish, a fire captain who has a full-time job as an electrician, said the wildfire was the worst he has seen in 32 years of firefighting. \"My body is sore. My joints are sore, my back is sore and I think the rest of my crew feels much the same,\" he said.</p><p>Ken Charsley, who has lived in the Westwood Hills subdivision for 23 years, said that by the time he had to leave his home on Sunday at 4 p.m., the sky was \"just black behind us.\"</p><p>The 74-year-old resident said the need for an evacuation order was obvious.</p><p>\"I was born and raised in northern Ontario's (Sudbury area), and when you see fire you get out,\" he said in an interview Monday. \"If you're not going to stay and fight it, leave.\"</p><p>Halifax Mayor Mike Savage declared a state of emergency for the region, giving the municipality access to contingency funds and powers to battle the fire.</p><p>During a briefing, Halifax Deputy Fire Chief David Meldrum said the extent of the fire and the damage it has done so far is unclear.</p><p>He said 100 firefighters and 30 vehicles had been deployed overnight to fight the fire, along with a number of water bombers - including some flown in from Newfoundland - and helicopters from the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resource and Renewables.</p><p>With no rain in the forecast, Meldrum said it could take the rest of the week to subdue the flames. \"We have a lot of work to do today, this week - for many days,\" he said. \"Residents must be prepared to remain out of their homes for several days at least.\"</p><p>The provincial ministry was flying aerial surveys to determine the extent of the fire.</p><p>\"This time of year is important,\" said Meldrum. \"This is a spring fire. Firefighters always hope to get through spring. We come out of winter and the ground cover is dry, it's brown, the vegetation hasn't taken on much hydration.</p><p>\"We believe that climate change contributes to volatility,\" he said. \"We're seeing more severe storms than we've seen before. Winds are very important to us. We're seeing wind action that exacerbates fires, and certainly long dry spells are becoming more common in many regions.\"</p><p>Temperatures had dropped Monday, and the wind had receded somewhat, shifting direction so the fire was moving back on itself, a small bit of good news, said Meldrum. As of Monday afternoon, the fire's perimeter had not expanded since the previous night, said provincial officials - a small piece of good news for crews fighting to contain the blaze.</p><p>But he characterized the fire as \"uncontrolled\" and said, with residents relocated, firefighters were prioritizing protecting homes and buildings still threatened by the fire.</p><p>\"Traditionally, we want to get hose lines around the entire perimeter of a fire and have what's called a wet hose line around the perimeter. This is a big perimeter.\"</p><p>At the same time as wildfires burned outside of Halifax, Nova Scotia fire crews were also battling another, larger wildfire in Shelburne County, in the southwestern part of the province.</p><p>Provincial officials said the uncontrolled wildfire in the remote area around Barrington Lake had nearly tripled in size to 2,296 hectares by Monday morning, propelled by high winds and high temperatures.</p><p>Evacuation orders were also in place for several communities in that area along with highway closures. Monday afternoon, officials estimated 400 people and counting had been evacuated from the region of the fire.</p><p>\"The forecast is not favourable,\" said Scott Tingley of Nova Scotia's Department of Natural Resources. \"We have a dry weather forecast for the week, no significant rain and still some wind.\"</p><p>He said although the Tantallon fire had stabilized for the time being, the Shelburne County fire was still going to pose a challenge for fire crews.</p><p>\"We have a tough week ahead yet,\" he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, about 400 homes in southwestern New Brunswick had been evacuated because of forest fires that began Sunday after an all-terrain vehicle burst into flames.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Thursday, Aug. 24, 2023, 21 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Cherry Post Drive, between Camilla Road and Corsair Road in Ward 7.

Half of global GDP is reliant on nature, and if it collapses, you can forget about those retirement plans or landing that dream job after university.<br/><br/> So what are you doing about it? Yes, you. Because while it may be easier to palm this off on government bureaucracies, the UN or environmental activists, this is not someone else's problem to fix.<br/><br/> Our ability to save life as we know it really comes down to the choices each one of us makes - particularly those of us who have the luxury to choose - about what we consume; the house we buy, the food we eat, or the way we travel.<br/><br/> UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, speaking in Montreal, passionately exhorted governments and businesses to do the right thing by committing to plans to set aside 30 per cent of their land by 2030 to protect nature, and find ways to sustainably extract natural resources.<br/><br/> But we all know that we cannot rely on them to do the right thing. Not because they are intrinsically bad (they are just a collection of humans, after all), but because they are wired for short term survival - the next election, the next quarter - and this is a long-term game.<br/><br/>Ontario's recently passed Bill 23, is a perfect example of this misalignment. Ostensibly designed to tackle the very real problem of affordable housing in the province, the legislation's gutting of Conservation Authorities in the midst of a planetary crisis, is akin to lighting a match in the middle of a forest fire.<br/><br/> Already, even before Bill 23, the province was flagrantly ignoring its own conservation guidelines. In the town of Collingwood, for example, developers are being allowed to build luxury homes on the last intact coastal wetland on south Georgian Bay. It's a rare biodiversity hot spot, home to endemic and threatened species, designated as \"provincially significant,\" and is situated on a major floodplain.<br/><br/> Yet somehow, more tennis courts, parking lots, boat slips and million-dollar condos are thought to be more urgently required.<br/><br/> Neighbouring Quebec is no better. While the province announced on Dec. 6 that it would invest $650 million to meet its 30 by 30 goals - which is to be applauded - it has overseen the extinction of several boreal caribou herds in logging areas. In two pitiful cases, the remnants of herds have been \"caged\" like zoo animals to avoid complete extirpation.<br/><br/>Quebec has an opportunity to save another endangered but still viable herd, the Pipmuacan, living in an old growth forest north of Saguenay, that is slated for logging. While Ottawa has threatened to intervene, the province has countered that saving the caribou will cost logging jobs.<br/><br/> It all reminds me of my daughter's favourite book when she was little - \"The Lorax\" by Dr. Seuss. A repentant Once-Ler, reduced to living in a barren wasteland after cutting down every last Truffula tree, tells a young boy: \"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\"<br/><br/> Andrea Mandel-Campbell is the founder of the sustainable adventure travel company, karibu adventures. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2022121766516524</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:673T-SNK1-F197-54PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Thursday, Aug. 24, 2023, 21 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Cherry Post Drive, between Camilla Road and Corsair Road in Ward 7.

(SPOD or the Company) has provided an update on the 2023 Phase I surface exploration program for its 100% owned NORTH NIPIGON NIEMI PROJECT in the Georgia Lake Pegmatite Field, Ontario. Spod Lithium sampled 1.507% Li2O and continues to expand the mineralized area on the Niemi Block near (MDI</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Phase I program is designed to target spodumene bearing pegmatite bodies on our expansive land package in the heart of the prolific Georgia Lake Pegmatite Field. The program covers the Niemi Block, North Nipigon Block A and North Nipigon Block C (Figure 1). The program will continue to evaluate the historically underexplored Block B, Block C and Block A east of Rock Tech Lithiums Georgia Lake deposit. Detailed mapping and sampling of the Parole Lake area will also be prioritized to determine the source of the spodumene bearing boulders. A total of 107 surface grab samples have been collected to date and submitted to the Actlabs facility in Thunder Bay, ON.</p><p>Chris Cooper, Spod Lithiums CEO commented: The North Nipigon Niemi Project is beginning to show its real potential with 1.5% Li2O sampled on trend with Imagine Lithiums Jackpot Pegmatite and a new discovery of 0.54% Li2O in the Parole Lake area. Our bedrock stripping and sampling program for the Niemi Pegmatite is scheduled to begin in August and will provide a better understanding of the spodumene bearing pegmatite in this area. The discovery of a second lithium bearing boulder 100 m from a historic showing in the Parole Lake area is encouraging and our field crews are working to identify the source of the boulders. We will continue to focus on the Parole Lake area, the underexplored Block B and the northern extend of Block A, east of Rock Tech Lithiums Georgia Lake Deposit.</p><p>The North Nipigon Niemi Project is underlain by Archean metasediments and granites, along with Keweenawan age diabase. Pegmatites in the region occur close to and within the granitic plutons. The Project is contiguous with RockTech Lithiums Georgia Lake Project and Imagine Lithiums Jackpot Lithium Project. RockTechs Project contains a NI43-101 compliant indicated resource of 10.6 Mt at 0.88% Li20 and a NI43-101 compliant inferred resource of 4.2 Mt of 1.00% Li2O (MRE Source: Technical Report, NI 43-101, Pre-Feasibility Study, Georgia Lake, effective October 1, 2022). There are numerous other known pegmatite occurrences in the region as shown in Figure 1.</p><p>Figure 1 shows the North Nipigon Niemi Project with Rock Tech and Imagine Lithiums developing deposits.</p><p>Assay results have been returned for the first series of 107 surface grab samples collected from the Project (Table 1). The Niemi Block continues to deliver lithium results on trend with Imagine Lithiums Jackpot Zone that returned 1.5% Li2O from sample 475539 (Table 1). This sample was collected approximately 40 m south of sample 269006 which was collected during a site visit in the fall of 2022 and returned 0.38% Li2O. Overburden stripping of this pegmatite is on schedule to commence in the fall of 2023 (Figure 2).</p><p>Table 1 Summary of lithium results from the initial prospecting program on the property. //st Sample Easting Northing Area Li (ppm) Li2O (%) Cs (ppm) Ta (ppm) Be (ppm) Ba (ppm) 475539 434345 5461301 Niemi Pegmatite 7000 1.507 22.9 8.1 760 20 475550 433272 5473382 Parole Lake (AFRI 20000019444) 4020 0.866 87.3 25.2 126 15 475551 433272 5473382 Parole Lake (AFRI 20000019444) 1920 0.413 49.1 49 315 20 475577 433184 5473319 Parole Lake - New Boulder 2500 0.538 97.2 23.4 13 141</p><p>Figure 2 shows the Niemi Project samples with Imagine Lithiums Jackpot Project to the west.</p><p>The North Nipigon Block A prospecting program continues to develop a lithium target on the northern edge of Parole Lake where confirmation sampling of a spodumene rich boulder returned 0.866% Li2O and 0.413% Li2O from sample 475550 and 475551, respectively (Table 1).

Others were on the receiving end of bad news.<br/><br/> \"The RCMP called me this morning to say they went to see our house and it was burned down and they couldn't find the pets there,\" Katherine Tarateski told The Canadian Press on Monday. <br/><br/> Tarateski said she was with her husband Nick and their young daughter Mia at a family gathering on Sunday when they heard about the approaching fires and rushed back to their home in Hammonds Plains to save their dog and cat. But when they arrived police had already blocked their street.<br/><br/> \"The house can be rebuilt,\" she said. \"But my pets ... I'm just devastated. It's hard.\"<br/><br/> Through a dark haze of smoke, sometimes with fires burning along the side of the roads, approximately 16,000 people were forced to leave their homes amid multiple evacuation orders.<br/><br/> By early afternoon, Nova Scotia's Department of Natural Resources confirmed the wildfire covered about eight square kilometres and the wind had gusted from the north up to 40 kilometres per hour, making its progress dangerous and unpredictable. The evacuation orders, meanwhile, applied to an area of approximately 75 square kilometres, within about a 30-minute drive of Halifax.<br/><br/> At a Monday afternoon briefing at Emergency Management Office headquarters in Dartmouth provincial officials said that the wildfire had, at that point, burned 788 hectares.<br/><br/> \"We can only imagine the fear that you're feeling, the uncertainty you're feeling about when you will be able to return back to your home, what you may be returning to,\" said Nova Scotia premier Tim Houston.<br/><br/> \"But know that the Bluenoser spirit is alive and well in this province, and your friends and neighbours will be there to support you in every way that they can.\"<br/><br/> \"We will get through this. We will get through this together.\"<br/><br/> Houston said that the province would provide $500 to every household required to evacuate because of the Tantallon fires and those further southwest in Shelburne County, with funding to be administered through the Canadian Red Cross. <br/><br/> Volunteer firefighter Brett Tetanish fought back tears as he described arriving late Sunday at a house fire in the Westwood subdivision, the scene where the first fires were reported around 3 p.m.<br/><br/> \"There were fires on both sides of the road, structures on fire. There were cars abandoned and burnt in the middle of the road,\" he said while outside the command post.<br/><br/> Tetanish, a fire captain who has a full-time job as an electrician, said the wildfire was the worst he has seen in 32 years of firefighting. \"My body is sore. My joints are sore, my back is sore and I think the rest of my crew feels much the same,\" he said.<br/><br/> Ken Charsley, who has lived in the Westwood Hills subdivision for 23 years, said that by the time he had to leave his home on Sunday at 4 p.m., the sky was \"just black behind us.\"<br/><br/> The 74-year-old resident said the need for an evacuation order was obvious.<br/><br/> \"I was born and raised in northern Ontario's (Sudbury area), and when you see fire you get out,\" he said in an interview Monday. \"If you're not going to stay and fight it, leave.\"<br/><br/> Halifax Mayor Mike Savage declared a state of emergency for the region, giving the municipality access to contingency funds and powers to battle the fire.<br/><br/> During a briefing, Halifax Deputy Fire Chief David Meldrum said the extent of the fire and the damage it has done so far is unclear.<br/><br/> He said 100 firefighters and 30 vehicles had been deployed overnight to fight the fire, along with a number of water bombers - including some flown in from Newfoundland - and helicopters from the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resource and Renewables.<br/><br/> With no rain in the forecast, Meldrum said it could take the rest of the week to subdue the flames. \"We have a lot of work to do today, this week - for many days,\" he said. \"Residents must be prepared to remain out of their homes for several days at least.\"<br/><br/> The provincial ministry was flying aerial surveys to determine the extent of the fire.<br/><br/> \"This time of year is important,\" said Meldrum. \"This is a spring fire. Firefighters always hope to get through spring. We come out of winter and the ground cover is dry, it's brown, the vegetation hasn't taken on much hydration.<br/><br/> \"We believe that climate change contributes to volatility,\" he said. \"We're seeing more severe storms than we've seen before. Winds are very important to us. We're seeing wind action that exacerbates fires, and certainly long dry spells are becoming more common in many regions.\"<br/><br/> Temperatures had dropped Monday, and the wind had receded somewhat, shifting direction so the fire was moving back on itself, a small bit of good news, said Meldrum. As of Monday afternoon, the fire's perimeter had not expanded since the previous night, said provincial officials - a small piece of good news for crews fighting to contain the blaze. <br/><br/> But he characterized the fire as \"uncontrolled\" and said, with residents relocated, firefighters were prioritizing protecting homes and buildings still threatened by the fire. <br/><br/> \"Traditionally, we want to get hose lines around the entire perimeter of a fire and have what's called a wet hose line around the perimeter. This is a big perimeter.\"<br/><br/> At the same time as wildfires burned outside of Halifax, Nova Scotia fire crews were also battling another, larger wildfire in Shelburne County, in the southwestern part of the province.<br/><br/> Provincial officials said the uncontrolled wildfire in the remote area around Barrington Lake had nearly tripled in size to 2,296 hectares by Monday morning, propelled by high winds and high temperatures.<br/><br/> Evacuation orders were also in place for several communities in that area along with highway closures. Monday afternoon, officials estimated 400 people and counting had been evacuated from the region of the fire.<br/><br/> \"The forecast is not favourable,\" said Scott Tingley of Nova Scotia's Department of Natural Resources. \"We have a dry weather forecast for the week, no significant rain and still some wind.\"<br/><br/> He said although the Tantallon fire had stabilized for the time being, the Shelburne County fire was still going to pose a challenge for fire crews.<br/><br/> \"We have a tough week ahead yet,\" he said.<br/><br/> Meanwhile, about 400 homes in southwestern New Brunswick had been evacuated because of forest fires that began Sunday after an all-terrain vehicle burst into flames. Mayor Brad Henderson of Saint Andrews, N.B., said the fires were burning near the towns of Bocabec and Chamcook, and that flames have destroyed one home.<br/><br/> With files from Michael Tutton and Michael MacDonald at The Canadian Press<br/><br/> Steve McKinley is a Halifax-based reporter for the Star.

Others were on the receiving end of bad news.<br/><br/> \"The RCMP called me this morning to say they went to see our house and it was burned down and they couldn't find the pets there,\" Katherine Tarateski told The Canadian Press on Monday. <br/><br/> Tarateski said she was with her husband Nick and their young daughter Mia at a family gathering on Sunday when they heard about the approaching fires and rushed back to their home in Hammonds Plains to save their dog and cat. But when they arrived police had already blocked their street.<br/><br/> \"The house can be rebuilt,\" she said. \"But my pets ... I'm just devastated. It's hard.\"<br/><br/> Through a dark haze of smoke, sometimes with fires burning along the side of the roads, approximately 16,000 people were forced to leave their homes amid multiple evacuation orders.<br/><br/> By early afternoon, Nova Scotia's Department of Natural Resources confirmed the wildfire covered about eight square kilometres and the wind had gusted from the north up to 40 kilometres per hour, making its progress dangerous and unpredictable. The evacuation orders, meanwhile, applied to an area of approximately 75 square kilometres, within about a 30-minute drive of Halifax.<br/><br/> At a Monday afternoon briefing at Emergency Management Office headquarters in Dartmouth provincial officials said that the wildfire had, at that point, burned 788 hectares.<br/><br/> \"We can only imagine the fear that you're feeling, the uncertainty you're feeling about when you will be able to return back to your home, what you may be returning to,\" said Nova Scotia premier Tim Houston.<br/><br/> \"But know that the Bluenoser spirit is alive and well in this province, and your friends and neighbours will be there to support you in every way that they can.\"<br/><br/> \"We will get through this. We will get through this together.\"<br/><br/> Houston said that the province would provide $500 to every household required to evacuate because of the Tantallon fires and those further southwest in Shelburne County, with funding to be administered through the Canadian Red Cross. <br/><br/> Volunteer firefighter Brett Tetanish fought back tears as he described arriving late Sunday at a house fire in the Westwood subdivision, the scene where the first fires were reported around 3 p.m.<br/><br/> \"There were fires on both sides of the road, structures on fire. There were cars abandoned and burnt in the middle of the road,\" he said while outside the command post.<br/><br/> Tetanish, a fire captain who has a full-time job as an electrician, said the wildfire was the worst he has seen in 32 years of firefighting. \"My body is sore. My joints are sore, my back is sore and I think the rest of my crew feels much the same,\" he said.<br/><br/> Ken Charsley, who has lived in the Westwood Hills subdivision for 23 years, said that by the time he had to leave his home on Sunday at 4 p.m., the sky was \"just black behind us.\"<br/><br/> The 74-year-old resident said the need for an evacuation order was obvious.<br/><br/> \"I was born and raised in northern Ontario's (Sudbury area), and when you see fire you get out,\" he said in an interview Monday. \"If you're not going to stay and fight it, leave.\"<br/><br/> Halifax Mayor Mike Savage declared a state of emergency for the region, giving the municipality access to contingency funds and powers to battle the fire.<br/><br/> During a briefing, Halifax Deputy Fire Chief David Meldrum said the extent of the fire and the damage it has done so far is unclear.<br/><br/> He said 100 firefighters and 30 vehicles had been deployed overnight to fight the fire, along with a number of water bombers - including some flown in from Newfoundland - and helicopters from the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resource and Renewables.<br/><br/> With no rain in the forecast, Meldrum said it could take the rest of the week to subdue the flames. \"We have a lot of work to do today, this week - for many days,\" he said. \"Residents must be prepared to remain out of their homes for several days at least.\"<br/><br/> The provincial ministry was flying aerial surveys to determine the extent of the fire.<br/><br/> \"This time of year is important,\" said Meldrum. \"This is a spring fire. Firefighters always hope to get through spring. We come out of winter and the ground cover is dry, it's brown, the vegetation hasn't taken on much hydration.<br/><br/> \"We believe that climate change contributes to volatility,\" he said. \"We're seeing more severe storms than we've seen before. Winds are very important to us. We're seeing wind action that exacerbates fires, and certainly long dry spells are becoming more common in many regions.\"<br/><br/> Temperatures had dropped Monday, and the wind had receded somewhat, shifting direction so the fire was moving back on itself, a small bit of good news, said Meldrum. As of Monday afternoon, the fire's perimeter had not expanded since the previous night, said provincial officials - a small piece of good news for crews fighting to contain the blaze. <br/><br/> But he characterized the fire as \"uncontrolled\" and said, with residents relocated, firefighters were prioritizing protecting homes and buildings still threatened by the fire. <br/><br/> \"Traditionally, we want to get hose lines around the entire perimeter of a fire and have what's called a wet hose line around the perimeter.

As of Oct. 18, the province has 201 active fires with six having started in the previous two days. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Though two of the four fires in the Port Alberni area are no longer burning, four in Strathcona, and four between Gold River and Zeballos remain. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tarek Ayache, air quality meteorologist with the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, said that the smoke across Vancouver Island is largely due to the forest fires burning south of the border. </p><p>\u201cThis year is really unusual. We've had this prolonged dry weather that has prolonged the wildfire season as well,\u201d said Ayache. \u201cThere's still fires that are intensely burning, mainly south of the border, but also in the province.\u201d </p><p>BC Wildfire Services tweeted on Oct. 17, \u201cSmoke from 26 active fires in the Fraser Zone, combined with smoke from Washington State, has negatively impacted air quality and visibility throughout most of the Coastal Fire Centre, particularly in the Fraser Valley.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo at this point [afternoon of Oct.17], the smoke is starting to clear. And we expect the gradual clearing today and into tomorrow. But maybe expect a few lingering impacts at the southern tip of the island well into the middle of the week,\u201d said Ayache. </p><p>A Smokey Skies Bulletin writes that people with pre-existing health conditions, respiratory infections, older adults, pregnant women, infants, children and sensitive individuals are more likely to be impacted by the smoke. </p><p>A fire along Herber River, close to Gold River, started on Sept. 6 and was caused by lightning. In the four days leading up to Oct. 18 the fire grew from 352 hectares to 358 hectares and continues to remain in the status of \u2018out of control\u2019. The Coastal Fire Centre said there is a crew of 10 on the fire for the next five to six days. They will then reassess the situation. </p><p>Another fire, at Oktwanch River, ignited on Sept. 1 and remained at 41 hectares in the last 4 days.  </p><p>Sharon Parsey, administrative assistant at Gold River Secondary, says that the school is managing the smoke by closing doors, windows, and intake vents so that it doesn\u2019t enter the building. </p><p>\u201cIt comes and goes. Some days are fine. Other days are quite smoky,\u201d said Parsey. \u201cWe just have to make sure that things are closed up or otherwise the school does fill up with the smell of smoke.\u201d </p><p>Marsha Maquinna, Nuu-chah-nulth education worker at Ray Watkins Elementary School in Gold River, said that the current situation has been quite a concern, and they\u2019ve been reassuring students that they are safe. </p><p>Students with asthma have been impacted by the smoke. Maquinna said depending on how severe their asthma is, some students have remained at home in their effort to stay indoors to avoid the smoke. </p><p>The school had to cancel their Terry Fox run numerous times because of the smoke, but were able to complete the event on a day in mid-October when the smoke lifted. </p><p>\u201cWe're hoping for rain soon,\u201d said Maquinna. \u201cIt looks like it's gonna be coming on Friday.\u201d </p><p>Ayache said that by the end of the week it is expected that there will be a major change in the weather bringing rain and wind, which will help to clear the smoke. </p><p>-30- </p><p>At over 10 hectares, the Heather Lake blaze in E.C.

Half of global GDP is reliant on nature, and if it collapses, you can forget about those retirement plans or landing that dream job after university.</p><p>So what are you doing about it? Yes, you. Because while it may be easier to palm this off on government bureaucracies, the UN or environmental activists, this is not someone else's problem to fix.</p><p>Our ability to save life as we know it really comes down to the choices each one of us makes - particularly those of us who have the luxury to choose - about what we consume; the house we buy, the food we eat, or the way we travel.</p><p>UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, speaking in Montreal, passionately exhorted governments and businesses to do the right thing by committing to plans to set aside 30 per cent of their land by 2030 to protect nature, and find ways to sustainably extract natural resources.</p><p>But we all know that we cannot rely on them to do the right thing. Not because they are intrinsically bad (they are just a collection of humans, after all), but because they are wired for short term survival - the next election, the next quarter - and this is a long-term game.</p><p>Ontario's recently passed Bill 23, is a perfect example of this misalignment. Ostensibly designed to tackle the very real problem of affordable housing in the province, the legislation's gutting of Conservation Authorities in the midst of a planetary crisis, is akin to lighting a match in the middle of a forest fire.</p><p>Already, even before Bill 23, the province was flagrantly ignoring its own conservation guidelines. In the town of Collingwood, for example, developers are being allowed to build luxury homes on the last intact coastal wetland on south Georgian Bay. It's a rare biodiversity hot spot, home to endemic and threatened species, designated as \"provincially significant,\" and is situated on a major floodplain.</p><p>Yet somehow, more tennis courts, parking lots, boat slips and million-dollar condos are thought to be more urgently required.</p><p>Neighbouring Quebec is no better. While the province announced on Dec. 6 that it would invest $650 million to meet its 30 by 30 goals - which is to be applauded - it has overseen the extinction of several boreal caribou herds in logging areas. In two pitiful cases, the remnants of herds have been \"caged\" like zoo animals to avoid complete extirpation.</p><p>Quebec has an opportunity to save another endangered but still viable herd, the Pipmuacan, living in an old growth forest north of Saguenay, that is slated for logging. While Ottawa has threatened to intervene, the province has countered that saving the caribou will cost logging jobs.</p><p>It all reminds me of my daughter's favourite book when she was little - \"The Lorax\" by Dr. Seuss. A repentant Once-Ler, reduced to living in a barren wasteland after cutting down every last Truffula tree, tells a young boy: \"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\"</p><p>Andrea Mandel-Campbell is the founder of the sustainable adventure travel company, karibu adventures.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20221217TTA2022121766516524</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:673T-8FK1-JDV5-F50J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

All First Mining staff and contractors have been demobilized from the Project and are safe and accounted for, and at this point there is no damage to infrastructure at the Springpole camp. The Company is monitoring the situation closely and will provide timely updates on any material developments to the situation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First Mining would like to thank the MNRF firefighters and our air service partners who played a critical role in demobilizing personnel from site safely and efficiently.</p><p>About First Mining Gold Corp.</p><p>First Mining is a Canadian gold developer focused on the development and permitting of the Springpole Gold Project\u00a0in northwestern Ontario.\u00a0Springpole\u00a0is one of the largest undeveloped gold projects in Canada. The results of a positive Pre-Feasibility Study for the Springpole Gold Project were announced by First Mining in January 2021, and permitting activities are on-going with submission of an\u00a0Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\")\u00a0for the project targeted for 2021.

There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Forward-looking statements reflect the beliefs, opinions and projections on the date the statements are made and are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by the respective parties, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties and contingencies. Such factors include, without limitation the Company's business, operations and financial condition potentially being materially adversely affected by the outbreak of epidemics, pandemics or other health crises, such as COVID-19, and by reactions by government and private actors to such outbreaks; risks to employee health and safety as a result of the outbreak of epidemics, pandemics or other health crises, such as COVID-19, that may result in a slowdown or temporary suspension of operations at some or all of the Company's mineral properties as well as its head office;\u00a0fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, silver, base metals or certain other commodities; fluctuations in the currency markets (such as the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar); changes in national and local government, legislation, taxation, controls, regulations and political or economic developments; risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining (including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins and flooding); the presence of laws and regulations that may impose restrictions on mining; employee relations; relationships with and claims by local communities, indigenous populations and other stakeholders; availability and increasing costs associated with mining inputs and labour; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; title to properties; and the additional risks described in the Company's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities under the Company's SEDAR profile at\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>, and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 40-F filed with the SEC on EDGAR.</p><p>First Mining cautions that the foregoing list of factors that may affect future results is not exhaustive. When relying on our forward-looking statements to make decisions with respect to First Mining, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events.

This development is in no way unruly or capricious but more of the slow paced development to which Fernie is accustomed.</p><p>There is a significant NIMBY outcry against this development by a vocal minority which I feel is unfair and unfounded. This property has been a development opportunity since being mercilessly logged/clear cut in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s, now there is a responsible developer with Fernie area experience ready to take on the challenge and I believe it should be allowed. There are significant protections in the proposal with park zoning and allowance for public access protecting over 300 acres. In addition environmentally sensitive areas like Lizard Creek will be fully protected from any form of development. The goal of protecting a significant portion of the land will address the concerns of wildlife movement and make the land more attractive to people who would wish to build there and appreciate a low density park like setting.</p><p>The naysayers and the NIMBY contingent would and do characterize the development a a virtual environmental catastrophy. In fact the low density proposal with substantial protected land Will facilitate wildlife movement as they filter through the park like development giving pleasure to home owners and public alike.</p><p>The very fact that this proposal includes a new access to Hwy 3 from FAR is almost a reason in and of itself for it to move forward. I am sure you are aware of the issues surrounding this.</p><p>I feel issues the naysayers would bring forward like affordable housing are red herring issues that are not viable in this setting. There is of course a need but it is not viable on these lands.</p><p>The amount of tax and utility revenues a development of this nature can produce is an overall benefit to the community and surrounding area. The amount of employment produced is not to be overlooked. The idea that some how rich people will be lining their pockets from this as is suggested in the misinformation campaign by the naysayers is untrue, their pockets are already lined. The very fact is that these Lands could be responsibly developed creating economic benefit. Recreational home and upscale permanent homes pay significant taxes and spawn cottage industry within the community. Property care and management coupled with all aspects of maintenence are opportunities for local business entrepreneurs. Recreational homes are not a liability but rather an asset to a community paying taxes and using few services wile creating employment.</p><p>I hope you have taken time to read my submission and are not overly swayed by the vocal minority however vehement their opposition assertions. I believe the silent majority is simply OK with this.</p><p>Willard Ripley, Fernie Re:the rezoning of the Galloway Lands Directors of the RDEK:I wrote last year when the rezoning that was initially proposed presented little more than a \u201cback of the envelope\u201d plan. I attach a copy of that letter. I have attended the open house and the initial public meeting on Zoom. I note that the current plan is much more detailed and does, to some extent, address some of the concerns I had last year.</p><p>The new plan does address fire protection with the addition of a hydrant system however the road system still has dead end streets with no secondary escape routes. With climate change we have to recognize that the prospect of a forest fire is increasingly likely. In such a scenario we must note those people housed in the dead end streets would have a much diminished chance of escape and survival.</p><p>My second concern is for the wildlife corridor that will be effectively blocked by this development. To quote my earlier letter, \u2018I do not believe enough attention is being paid to the wildlife corridors that contribute so much to the quality of life in the Elk Valley. In recent articles and letters in the Globe and Mail, Canmore is the \u201ccanary in the coal mine\u201d. With maximum development in every possible direction here is no room left for wildlife. To quote Joni Mitchell, \u201cThey paved paradise and put up a parking lot\u201d\u2019.</p><p>We have heard from numerous experts of the value and fragility of Lizard Creek as a major spawning ground for West-slope Cutthroat Trout. Several experts have made presentations documenting the importance of the creek to the local ecosystem. It was disappointing to hear that the biologists who presented the plan for the development spent very little time at the site and did not consult with local experts of which there are many. This failure seriously diminishes the value of their report.</p><p>In closing, I will again refer to my earlier letter; \u201cI would like to remind the directors that they are elected to act in the best interests of the present and future residents of this beautiful area. I would respectively ask that no rezoning be approved. I also ask that the directors ask of themselves, if this project goes ahead will they look back upon it in 15 or 20 years and take pride in their legacy? Finally I would like to remind the directors that there is another option on the table. That being the proposal to expand the Mount Fernie Provincial Park. Obviously this is an option I would prefer, I would also suggest that such a legacy would be far more worthy of pride.</p><p>I would posit that there is no pressing need for this development. The Cedars is still building out, the RCR is expanding and we expect there will be development on the ridge above Ridgemont. I question the wisdom of sacrificing this creek and corridor for no good reason David Bird, Fernie</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FREPRS-news20230427PQEA0003530939</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FREPRS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:683T-MWF1-JD2C-J0DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438278</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1017\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

For Howard, bringing a child into such a world felt not only irresponsible but perverse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'd look at my daughter in the morning,\" she recalls, \"and think, 'She's sick. She has caught climate change.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Almost as bad as the guilt were the feelings of sadness, helplessness and isolation. When Howard shared her thoughts with colleagues, they told her she was catastrophizing. But, she wondered, can one really be catastrophizing if the catastrophe itself is real?</p><p>\"My colleagues would look at me as though I were the one misunderstanding the situation,\" she says. \"When you're with people who haven't yet tweaked to the dangers of climate change, you can feel incredibly lonely.\" In desperation, she sought professional help. \"I called a couple of counsellors,\" she recalls, \"but they didn't know what to do with me either.\"</p><p>Howard was suffering from climate anxiety, which researchers have studied since at least 2007. Much like climate change itself, the condition can seem abstract, unless you're one of the millions of Canadians who've experienced it firsthand.</p><p>Today, discussions of climate anxiety are starting to move into the mainstream. In a landmark report earlier this year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change flagged deteriorating mental health as a consequence of environmental degradation. And cases are mounting.</p><p>A survey of 10,000 young people in 10 countries, reported in the journal <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nature</emphasis>, found that two in three respondents are experiencing elevated levels of climate-related fear and sadness - a phenomenon that is most acute in regions plagued by extreme weather.</p><p>Yet climate anxiety poses a problem for clinicians, since it expresses itself in wildly diverse ways. Symptoms can include depression, panic attacks, irritability, insomnia, substance abuse and suicidal ideation. The condition can also be difficult to diagnose because the grief itself is often ambiguous: when one experiences climate anxiety, Howard explains, one is mourning a future that hasn't yet arrived.</p><p>People with climate anxiety often don't know where to turn, says Wayne Gray, a registered social worker who provides counselling through Maple - a Canadian company that offers virtual health care. Although the condition can be damaging, Gray explains, it is often sub-acute. It frequently expresses itself as low-level, omnipresent dread, which undermines well-being without triggering a full-blown crisis. What do you do with feelings like that? Go to the emergency room? Put yourself on a months-long wait list for therapy that may cost $250 a session?</p><p>Because the treatments are mostly psychotherapeutic - rather than pharmacological - they aren't normally covered by provincial health insurance. That's why Gray recommends online therapy, which can cost less than half the price of in-person sessions.</p><p>\"For climate anxiety, many people have found virtual therapy to be helpful,\" he says. \"If there's nothing else the technology has given us, it's given us access.\"</p><p>Arguably, though, it's given us much more.</p><p>Cassandra Cornacchia is a registered social worker who offers counselling via several organizations, including Inkblot Therapy, a Canadian company that provides digital-first mental-health care. She argues that, for many people, online treatment is not only a workable care model but an ideal one.</p><p>Some of its generalized benefits - geographic accessibility, short wait times - are particularly salient for people with eco-anxiety. \"With online care, you can usually be connected to a therapist within one or two days,\" says Cornacchia. \"This is especially helpful if you have anxiety resulting from a sudden event - a forest fire, a flood or a frightening announcement on the news.\"</p><p>Moreover, people in rural communities, who are most vulnerable to climatic events and yet geographically far from the urban centres where many therapists work, can benefit from ease of access.</p><p>Another advantage of virtual therapy is the sheer abundance of options. Climate anxiety, Cornacchia says, is best addressed through a variety of therapeutic modalities - cognitive behavioural therapy to manage challenging thoughts, dialectical therapy to make peace with flux, mindfulness to live more fully in the present - each well suited to some people but poorly suited to others. When geographic proximity is no longer a limiting factor, clients can choose therapists whose approach best matches their needs.</p><p>For Cornacchia, one of the biggest perks of online therapy is that people can do it almost anywhere. Her practice is heavily based in mindfulness and eco-therapy, modalities that help people reconnect with nature. By engaging with the natural realm, she says, clients can discover that, although the world may be ailing, it's far from spoiled. What better place to have this realization than in the outdoors itself? \"People can do therapy from their favourite park or their backyard or the beach,\" says Cornacchia, \"anywhere they can get an internet connection.\"</p><p>Therapy, of course, isn't the only path to well-being.</p><p>After her brush with climate anxiety, Howard found respite in activism. She became a delegate to the Canadian Medical Association council, where she put forth a motion to support research into the health effects of the tarsands. The experience left Howard feeling better - less helpless and ready for the next challenge. \"I told myself, 'You're not going to solve the whole problem, but you can do your part,'\" she says.</p><p>Since then, Howard has devoted about 50 per cent of her working hours to advocacy. As a member (and past president) of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, she helped lobby both the Canadian Medical Association to divest from fossil fuels and the federal government to phase out coal power, something it has now committed to do. As co-chair of advocacy for the World Health Organization's Civil Society Working Group on Climate Change and Health, she has lobbied for an international coal phase out, citing medical literature about the respiratory effects of air pollution on young people.</p><p>She also speaks publicly about the mental health consequences of climate change - the sadness, anxiety, and guilt - and how people might channel those feelings into political engagement. Her social and professional network now includes leading climate activists in Europe, Latin America, the Canadian North, and the United Kingdom, where she is currently doing a master's degree in public policy. \"I picture all of us standing apart but together,\" she says. Anxiety has become a spur to action - and a means of building community.</p><p>Cornacchia says that enhanced social connections are one of the best antidotes to the isolation of climate grief. This is yet another way that online forums can help. She remembers hosting a group session for Wellness Together Canada, a service that provides free mental-health support via peer-to-peer networks. On one occasion, there were attendees in every province, from British Columbia, where the forest-fire season keeps intensifying, to Newfoundland, where wind and rain seems fiercer than ever before. The meeting reminded Cornacchia that, although we may feel isolated in our grief, we live under the same sky. \"It was beautiful,\" she says of the experience. \"There was a deep sense of common humanity.\"</p><p>Simon Lewsen writes about technology for MaRS.

Higher earnings were also due to higher levels of inflation in Australia, which positively impacted earnings in Canadian Utilities' International Natural Gas Distribution segment, and continued strong performance from our Structures and Neltume segments.</p><p>IFRS earnings attributable to Class I and Class II Shares were $52 million in the third quarter of 2021, $2 million lower compared to 2020. Earnings attributable to Class I and Class II Shares include timing adjustments related to rate-regulated activities, unrealized gains or losses on mark-to-market forward and swap commodity contracts, one-time gains and losses, impairments, and items that are not in the normal course of business or a result of day-to-day operations. These items are not included in adjusted earnings. </p><p>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>ATCO Structures </p><p> Completed work on the LNG Canada Cedar Valley Lodge project, a joint venture with Bird Construction and the Haisla Nation.
