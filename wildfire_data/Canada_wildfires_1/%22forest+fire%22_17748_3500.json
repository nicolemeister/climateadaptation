(the customer), the Tennessee Department of Agriculture of the State of Tennessee (acting in an advisory capacity), Easy Energy Systems, Inc. (EES), Digital Utilities Ventures, Inc. (DUTV), and Easy Energy Finance, Inc. (EEF).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Background:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Easy Energy Systems (the supplier) and Unaka Forest Products, Inc. (the customer) have discussed a relationship in which the supplier will provide equipment to the customer. The parties of this LOI agree to work together to obtain funding (the funding) to demonstrate the successful operation and commercial benefit at a Unaka Forest Products, Inc. site. Funding will be sought in the form of grants, investor funding, or from the sale of the Easy Energy Climate Tokens by EEF.</p><p>The equipment is estimated to cost $82 million and will be manufactured by the wholly owned Easy Modular Manufacturing entity of DUTV. The equipment is estimated to have a final per day capacity to process up to 250 dry tons of wood residues into liquid sugar, clean bio-fuels, biochar, and a negative carbon coal additive, clean renewable aviation fuel and clean carbon negative low-cost electricity. In the process the equipment will sequester tens of thousands of tons of CO2 per installation, and this process will make available additionally valuable carbon credits.</p><p>In the event that the equipment is financed by the Easy Energy Climate Tokens, the system will be owned by Easy Energy Finance via its Easy Energy Climate Token Holders and leased to Unaka Forest Products, Inc., or a sub operating entity that Unaka Forest Products, Inc. as a part owner thereof. If it is leased, then the buyers of the Easy Energy Climate Token will be engaged in a revenue share agreement whereby net operating profits of the operating plant will be shared with the investors who put up the capital as per a yet to be executed revenue share agreement.</p><p>Equipment Description:</p><p>The system will start at a 50 ton per day capacity but the complete final system will process up to 250 dry tons of waste wood per day. The system will be comprised of various modular sections including: //st 1. An auto segmentation system that can be located in remote areas, pre-processing the wood waste into a liquid sugar and other valuable byproducts; 2. A fuel generation system that converts the liquid sugars and other by products into a clean burning fuel that can be used for aviation, logging trucks, ocean going ships, or electrical generators; 3. An electrical generation system that utilizes the clean fuel to create low carbon electricity; 4. A carbon sequestration unit that sequesters large amount of CO 2 and creates a valuable soil enhancing biochar; and 5. A soil microbe module that converts any waste leave or green bio-mass into a liquid microbe fertilizer that will replace 1/3 of the petroleum-based fertilizer used on Ag crops. Additionally, this soil microbe will reduce the amount of agricultural irrigation needed by 25%.</p><p>Equipment Operation:</p><p>The auto-segmentation preprocessing portion will dry and grind the wood chips while converting them into liquid sugar and many other valuable products. It is envisioned that there will be a few sets of these 6 modular sections deployed in different sawmills or even remote forest clearings.</p><p>These units will convert the waste wood into a valuable condensed liquid sugar that can then be trucked to a central site processing unit located at one of the Unaka Forest Products, Inc. installations. If in a remote mountain clearing, the condensed liquid sugar may even be transported via a large temporary flexible hose (see photo) to a nearby highway. From there, it can then be trucked to the chosen Unaka Forest Products, Inc. central site installation for further processing.</p><p>This central site will then have the required fermentation tanks and clean up modules needed to convert the incoming sugars and other products into electricity. It is estimated this one 250 ton per day final processing plant will provide up to 7.3 megawatts of clean renewable low-to- even carbon negative electricity. The goal of this partnership is to demonstrate that the waste tree produces carbon negative electricity due to the ability of the system to sequester thousands of tons of C02 each year in the form of the valuable soil enhancing biochar.</p><p>As part of the proposed project, the parties will work together so that the demonstration plant described above can be fully audited by a third party Licensed Auditor to validate both potential RINS credits and also its low to negative carbon electricity generation capabilities.</p><p>The end goal of the system is to demonstrate to the world the ability to convert forest waste bio-mass into distributed carbon negative electricity for providing local or main grid electrical needs to help provide additional distributed electricity such as charging electrical cars - even if the waste wood is located in a remote mountain forest location. The additional goal of the project is to also utilize the plant to demonstrate the ability to make low carbon aviation fuel.</p><p>Project Steps:</p><p>Depending on the amount of funding obtained, the project may or may not be completed in steps with the results of each step to then further validate the need to proceed to the next step.</p><p>1. Validation</p><p>Validation of ESI Modular technology in converting various forms of waste materials located at Unaka Forest Products, Inc. into a liquid sugar. This initial module (of approximately 6 modules) will be placed at one of the Unaka Forest Product, Inc.s locations and operated to create and demonstrate the ability of approximately 50 tons per day of waste wood to be converted into a fully fermentable liquid sugar. If economics permit, this liquid sugar may either be trucked or rail car backed to the Easy Energy Systems, Inc. own module demonstration plant, sold to a closer bio-fuel conversion plant or a combination thereof.</p><p>Estimated stage 1 cost: $10 million //st</p><p>1. 1. Installation</p><p>The complete Modular Liquid Sugar to bio-fuel plant will be located at one of the Unaka Forest Products, Inc.s central locations to then duplicate the converting of the condensed liquid sugar into clean biofuels. It will first be built as a 1 million gallon per year plant (size needed for 50 ton per day) but will have the ability to be expanded in future to an approximately 5 million gallons per year (size needed for 250 ton per day).</p><p>Estimated Cost: $12 million //st</p><p>1. 1. Electrical Generator Addition</p><p>The Modular Electrical Generator section of the plant will be added. This section will demonstrate the successful conversion of the bio-fuels into clean electricity. The first step of this section will be to install about 1 megawatt of electrical generation capacity. This unit will then have many economic and carbon level tests performed. Economics of the final system will be determined and modeled.</p><p>Estimated Cost: $2 million //st</p><p>1. 1. Second Location</p><p>A Second complete 50-ton Modular Waste wood to Liquid Sugar Module (similar to Modules in Step 1) will be located in a remote Mountain Clearing to demonstrate the successful conversion of waste wood from a remote forest fire or waste dead wood that could cause a forest fire to be removed and converted into a condensed liquid sugar and piped via large rubber hose to a nearby road. It is envisioned that this stage could have occurred at any stage and likely funded via a forest fire prevention grant. Nonetheless, it will process an additional 50 ton per day, with this stage demonstrating it is possible to perform such activity in a remote forest clearing and transport out the valuable liquid sugar via a large flexible hose.</p><p>Estimated Cost: $6 million //st</p><p>1. 1. Green Biomass Module Addition</p><p>A green leaf and biomass module will be added to convert the piles of leaves and green bio- mass (otherwise left to rot and creating greenhouse gas emissions) into valuable liquid microbial fertilizer. It is estimated that each one of these modules will generate additionally over $15 million dollars in revenue. Each unit will provide 1/3 of the fertilizer needed for 500,000 acres. These units will help solve the USA and Global fertilizer problems. It is envisioned a fertilizer production grant be used to finance much of this module.</p><p>Estimated Cost: $1 million //st</p><p>1. 1. Additional Carbon Sequestration Modules</p><p>Additional Carbon Sequestration modules will be installed to the combined Biofuel / electrical generation facility. The goal of these will be to demonstrate the ability to remove virtually all existing carbon emissions from both the fermentation section and the electrical generation section. This will only be done if government or other payments reward removing all carbon generated and thus it increased profitability of entire project.</p><p>Estimated Cost: $5 million //st</p><p>1. 1. Biofuel Modules</p><p>Modules will be added to further demonstrate the ability to take the bio-fuels created from the bio-fuels section and further refine it into an approved low carbon aviation fuel certified for use in aircraft. It is envisioned that such a module will be inviting a partnership with a major airline.</p><p>Estimate Cost: $5 million</p><p>8. Central Biofuel Expansion</p><p>The size of the Central bio-fuels plant will be expanded to handle the full bio fuels output from up to 250 tons of wood per day which would be about 5 million gallons per year. This would be an expansion of the 1 million gallon per day pant described in step 8.</p><p>Estimated Cost: $15 million //st</p><p>1. 1. Electrical Generation Expansion Addition</p><p>After seeing the financial and carbon level results from the above, the aviation/ electrical generation, or both will be expanded to allow it to produce the full output from the 250 tons per day of bio-mass into the best financial results model electrical or aviation fuel. This may mean producing additional electricity for the Unaka Forest Products, Inc.s plants and their neighbors, or it may even mean generating low to negative electricity for the power grid. Alternatively, it may mean producing additional aviation or other bio-fuels. Current Projected Financial Models indicate a projected possible cost per kwh of fewer than 4 cents per kwh.</p><p>Estimated Cost: $11 million //st</p><p>1. 1. Plant Expansion Location</p><p>A decision will be made to expand the waste wood processing of 100 tons completed above by adding a single 150 ton per day waste wood to liquid sugar processing plant or three separate 50 ton per day modular plants. The end goal being to add the additional waste wood preprocessing needed so the full 250 ton per day of waste wood is being processed into valuable products with maximum carbon sequestration occurring.</p><p>Estimated Cost: $15 million</p><p>Total Estimated Cost of All Steps: $82 million</p><p>Estimated costs for a second duplicate all at one time complete system: $70 million</p><p>Financial Objectives:</p><p>The financial objective of this system is to demonstrate that the capital cost of the second duplicate system would pay for itself in 8 years or less while simultaneously reducing the spread of forest fires, creating low to negative carbon electricity, and low to negative carbon aviation fuel while at the same time creating bio char, valuable liquid microbial fertilizer for the region and even a bio coal additive that could be added to traditional coal fired power plants to reduce their emissions and meet the Paris accords.</p><p>Because the patented modular technology maximizes the value creation from the waste wood, the objective of this demonstration plant is to prove and validate that future duplications would able to be achieved with no government supports or carbon capture payments and thus fully sustainable despite the changing political arena.</p><p>If such related carbon capture, RINS or other government support payments were paid, the goal is for the system to pay for the capital cost in 6 years or less which would then be a very profitable enterprise for the financial community to then fund to further duplicate and multiply all across the world.</p><p>This non-binding letter of intent is being done to signify the intent of the parties to work together to obtain OUTSIDE THIRD-PARTY Grant or investor Financing for the defined project. NOTHING in this document obligates any of the signors to provide further financial support to the project. This may change as the project further materializes but shall be agreed to separately in the future. Any party may terminate this letter of intent at anytime by simply giving the other parties written notice. All parties understand that Separate Mutual NDAs may be needed to exchange appropriate additional confidential information.</p><p>The parties agree that the contents of this letter of intent may be utilized by one or more of the various parties to generate public, grant and investor support for this exciting demonstration project.</p><p>Tennessee Department of Agriculture</p><p>The Tennessee Department of Agriculture is a signor of this agreement to demonstrate that the department supports the concept of the goals of this demonstration project but has not yet agreed to provide ANY monetary support. Nonetheless, it will make time available (as it sees appropriate) to help facilitate the success of this project so as to make it able to be duplicated to support the goals of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture throughout Tennessee and to possible set an example for the world.</p><p>About Digital Utilities Ventures Inc.:</p><p>Digital Utilities Ventures, Inc. is working to become a formidable presence in the green solutions marketplace.

The Town of Gravenhurst posted a release updating the rating Monday, May 17. Extreme caution must be taken with all open flames, says the fire department. Small fires are permitted in most rural areas of Muskoka, keeping in mind that no daytime burning is allowed, according to the fire department. People are reminded that they must have adequate tools and water to extinguish the fire if the need arises, and the fire should be attended at all times. The Muskoka fire danger rating is determined using the fire weather index, an internationally used method for determining the risk of fires in open air. It uses factors such as the relative humidity, temperature, previous 24-hour rain amount, wind directions and wind speed in combination with the forest fuel type and loads to determine the risk of the forest to certain fire types. From this calculation, the forest fire danger rating is made in consultation with the fire chiefs of the six area municipalities and the Ministry of Natural Resources.

It symbolizes all your humanitarian efforts in trying to serve, which is what Lions is all about, internationally as well as in our own communities,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cAs Lions we believe that new ideas and perspectives will move our organization into the second century of service. That\u2019s where we want to be, and promote global ideas of acceptance and cooperation.\u201d </p><p>According to Lions International, a maximum of 35 Ambassador of Goodwill awards are given out worldwide each year. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only two that I know of  in Newfoundland who have received it. One was Corinne Tulk in Stephenville who received it a couple of years ago,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cI\u2019ve got 30 plus years in Lions, and I\u2019ve always tried to put Lions first and foremost in my life. Even though I\u2019ve worked, I\u2019ve still put Lions in the forefront.\u201d </p><p>Clarke said she was humbled and surprised by the award. </p><p>\u201cOf all the things I could have ever envisioned in my life, I could never have imagined I would be awarded the Ambassador of Goodwill,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cIt\u2019s the highest award that anybody could ever receive as an individual with Lions International, and to be awarded it, I still can\u2019t believe it, even over a month later. I was just dumbfounded and one of the great stories I have in my life is winning that award. It has meant so much.\u201d </p><p>The award was given out during the District N3 Convention in North Point on Oct. 23, well before the good work helping with Hurricane Fiona relief efforts by the Lions Club in Port aux Basques. The award went to Clarke strictly because of the dedication she has shown over the three decades. </p><p>\u201cIn the past five or six years now, I\u2019ve helped create 15 clubs in our district, new Lions Clubs, and out of these have been the Conne River Lions Club which, when you\u2019re talking about diversity, is our first ever First Nations club,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cI started the Rainbow Cyber Lions Club in Stephenville. We started that one and brought in new clubs in Labrador. We started a campus club in Corner Brook, so when we talk about diversity and inclusion, that\u2019s one of the things I\u2019ve always tried to promote.\u201d </p><p>Clarke came from a family who was dedicated to serving their community, so deciding to join the Lions years ago was a natural fit for her. </p><p>\u201cLions, to me, was the ideal symbol of helping your community. The idea of giving back, and I grew up in a family where Mom and Dad were big into serving their community in Isle Aux Morts. Dad used to be on the schoolboard, on the church, anything that needed to be done in the lodge, and Mom has been volunteering all of her life, so it was a norm for me to follow suit and Lions, to me, was the greatest way I could have the biggest impact,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cLions is international, so when you talk about serving, you\u2019re not just serving your own community. The difference we make is global. Whether it\u2019s the forest fire that happened in Fort McMurray, the tsunami that hit overseas, sending glasses to foreign countries where people have never been able to see until they\u2019ve worn a pair of glasses, the impact Lions make is phenomenal. One of my greatest achievements in life was the day I became a Lion.\u201d </p><p>Clarke said her experiences with the Lions Club have allowed her to form cherished memories. </p><p>\u201cYou can get those \u2018a-ha\u2019 moments, and I\u2019ve had many with Lions. I remember we had a house that burned down in this area, and it was a couple of days before Christmas, and I remember going out and this family had two small kids. I walked in with a hamper from the Lions Club and a cheque to help them through Christmas. That\u2019s when you realize you make a difference,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cWhat better way could we help serve than to be there to help our fellow neighbours? I will be a Lion until the day I cannot be a Lion, until the day I die. I will always have Lions in my heart.\u201d </p><p>Clarke believes she has been able to achieve so much because of the great people who volunteer alongside her. </p><p>\u201cYou surround yourself with great people and great leaders, and because of that, it certainly impacts what you do. When we were doing all the relief efforts for Hurricane Fiona, when you surround yourself with people who want to make a difference and are committed to helping others, then when you see them succeed, you succeed. I\u2019ve had a lot of people that have helped me, mentored me, coached me, provided leadership over the years, and I am what I am today because of the great mentors I\u2019ve had. Whether it be from work or from Lions, everybody has been stepping stones to get me to where I am today.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-0dd81aa4c5684a89996be5964d927c0f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:672Y-TRS1-JBVR-3077-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"882\"/><timeReceived>08:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 12, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>LIONS CLUBS INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813400CC</classCode><className>CIVIC &amp; SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009P27</classCode><className>STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DQK8</classCode><className>DIVERSITY &amp; INCLUSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001196</classCode><className>NATIVE AMERICANS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS171</classCode><className>NEWFOUNDLAND &amp; LABRADOR, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of June 8 ...</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What we are watching in Canada ...</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The battle against hundreds of wildfires continues, as almost every jurisdiction in Canada remains under either heat or air quality warnings from the federal government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The day after what was supposed to be national Clean Air Day, dozens of alerts remain in place for unseasonable heat or smoky air quality that kept millions of Canadians coughing and squinting. And forecasts suggest that air quality risks for the GTA, the Niagara region and southwestern Ontario will only increase through the end of the week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wednesday saw one of Canada's worst days in history for air quality. </p><p>Environment Canada's air quality health index listed Ottawa and Gatineau, Que., as the worst in Canada on Wednesday, with a very high risk warning. The agency dropped the special air quality statements for those areas early Thursday morning.</p><p>The eastern United States is also seeing devastating effects from wildfire smoke drifting south from Canada, with cities like New York and Washington, D.C., issuing air quality warnings of their own.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke on the phone with U.S. President Joe Biden about the issue on Wednesday. Both leaders agreed the situation pointed to the urgency of addressing climate change. </p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre database showed Wednesday afternoon that 440 fires were burning in nine provinces and two territories. More than half were considered out of control.</p><p>The amount of land burned surpassed the 40,000-square-kilometre mark Wednesday, making the 2023 fire season Canada's fourth-worst on record before the summer has even officially begun.</p><p>At the current pace of burning, the all-time record is expected to be surpassed by next week.</p><p>---</p><p>Also this ...</p><p>Internal emails from the agency tasked with regulating the price of patented drugs in Canada shows discord and division was sparked by a letter from the health minister, culminating in an indefinite pause on major drug-price reforms and several resignations.</p><p>Emails released to the House of Commons committee on health suggest some on the regulator's board believed the crisis that followed the minister's letter threatened the very survival of the agency.</p><p>\"We are experiencing a significant conflict that must be resolved to ensure the survival, integrity and proposer conduct of business for the (Patented Medicine Prices Review Board),\" former acting chair Melanie Bourassa Forcier wrote to the board members on Dec. 4, 2022.</p><p>She resigned from her post the next day. </p><p>The emails show the conflict began last November, when the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board was in the process of consulting on the finer points of recently adopted rules that would drastically change how drug prices are set in Canada.</p><p>Innovative Medicines Canada, a pharmaceutical lobby group, requested a meeting to talk about its concerns on Nov. 18.</p><p>Ten days later, Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos wrote to the acting chair and suggested the process be paused to give drug companies, patient groups, provincial ministers and himself more time to understand the changes.</p><p>\"I respectfully ask that the board consider pausing the consultation process, so as to work collaboratively, with all stakeholders, to understand fully the short and long-term impacts of the proposed new guidelines,\" Duclos wrote. </p><p>The letter was received with surprise by the arm's-length agency, which until that point had thought the minister was on board with its plan, and kicked off an intense 10-day-long argument that ended in the suspension of the new rules. </p><p>---</p><p>What we are watching in the U.S. ...</p><p>WASHINGTON _ U.S. President Joe Biden has invited thousands of LGBTQ+ individuals to celebrate Pride Month in a high-profile show of support at a time when the community feels under attack like never before and the White House has little recourse to beat back a flood state-level legislation against them.</p><p>Biden was announcing new initiatives to protect LGBTQ+ communities from attacks, help youth with mental health resources and homelessness and counter book bans, White House officials said.</p><p>The White House was closely monitoring air quality due to hazardous smoke from Canadian wildfires to determine whether to proceed with plans for a Thursday night picnic featuring food, games, face painting and photos. Queen HD the DJ was handling the music; singer Betty Who was on tap to perform.</p><p>Karine Jean-Pierre, the first openly gay White House press secretary, said Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and their spouses are strong supporters of the LGBTQ+ community and think that having a celebration is an important way to \"lift up'' their accomplishments and contributions.</p><p>She said LGBTQ+ people need to know that Biden \"has their back'' and \"will continue to fight for them. And that's the message that we want to make sure that gets out there.''</p><p>The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest advocacy organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer individuals, earlier this week declared a state of emergency for LGBTQ+ individuals in the United States and released a guidebook outlining laws it deems discriminatory in each state.</p><p>Just a few days into June's Pride Month, the campaign said it acted in response to an \"unprecedented and dangerous'' spike in discriminatory laws sweeping statehouses this year, with more than 525 anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced and more than 70 signed into law so far _ more than double last year's number.</p><p>Biden was announcing that the Department of Homeland Security, working with the Justice and Health and Human Services departments, will partner with LGBTQ+ community organizations to provide safety resources and training to help thwart violent attacks.</p><p>Separately, HHS and the Department of Housing and Urban Development will provide resources to help LGBTQ+ young people with mental health needs, support in foster care and homelessness.</p><p>---</p><p>What we are watching in the rest of the world ...</p><p>ROME _ Pope Francis awoke Thursday after a good first night in the hospital following a three-hour operation to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair a hernia in his abdominal wall, problems that developed following previous surgeries.</p><p>Dr. Sergio Alfieri, director of abdominal and endocrine sciences at Rome's Gemelli hospital, said Wednesday's operation was successful and there were no complications or other pathologies discovered. Alfieri, who also removed part of Francis' colon in 2021, told an evening press conference that the pope was awake, alert and even joking.</p><p>\"When will we do the third one?'' he quoted Francis as saying.</p><p>The pontiff was expected to remain in the 10th floor papal suite at Gemelli for several days, and all papal audiences were cancelled through June 18. The Vatican was expected to provide a medical update later Thursday.</p><p>The operation was scheduled after Francis had complained about increasing bouts of pain and intestinal blockages. After going to Gemelli on Tuesday for checks, Francis was admitted Wednesday following his general audience and underwent the procedure a short time later.</p><p>The surgery was likely scheduled now to give Francis plenty of time to recover before embarking on planned travel later this summer: an Aug. 2-6 trip to Portugal for World Youth Day, and an Aug. 31-Sept. 4 trip to Mongolia.</p><p>During the operation, doctors removed adhesions, or internal scarring, on the intestine that had caused a partial blockage. Alfieri revealed that in addition to the 2021 colon surgery, Francis had undergone previous abdominal surgeries sometime before 2013 in his native Argentina, which had also caused scarring.</p><p>To repair the hernia that had formed over a previous scar, a prosthetic mesh was placed in the abdominal wall, Alfieri said. He added that the pope was suffering from no other pathologies, that the tissue removed was benign and that after he recovers, he should be fine.</p><p>A feared protrusion, or bulging of the intestine through the hernia tear, was apparently not found.</p><p>---</p><p>On this day in 1866 ...</p><p>The first meeting of the Canadian Parliament was held in Ottawa. The meeting was held in the Parliament buildings, which were still unfinished. Construction on the complex had begun in 1857, when Queen Victoria chose Ottawa to be the national capital, and would not finish until 1877.</p><p>---</p><p>In entertainment ...</p><p>TORONTO _ When Roger Reeves was named the winner of this year's Griffin Poetry Prize on Wednesday night, his head fell to his hands and his mind went blank. </p><p>The Austin, Texas-based writer was awarded the $130,000 honour at a ceremony in Toronto for his collection \"Best Barbarian,\" which jurors praised for charting \"ruptures and violences enacted across time and space \u2014 particularly against Black humanity.\"</p><p>It took a beat for thoughts to return to Reeves after he heard his book's name called out, he said. But when they did, he thought of his people.</p><p>\"This is for my people. For my people, and for my people over the centuries, people that have fought, that have bled, that have worked, and people that have danced, that have enjoyed,\" he said in a brief interview after the ceremony. </p><p>\"I think the first thing that I would say is this is always for our people: for our people that had helped us get here.\"</p><p>Reeves is also the recipient of a Whiting Award and a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship.</p><p>The other shortlisted works, which each receive $10,000, are \"The Hurting Kind\" by Ada Lim\u00f3n, \"The Threshold\" by Egyptian-Canadian Iman Mersal and translated by Robyn Creswell, \"Exculpatory Lilies\" by British Columbia-based writer Susan Musgrave and \"Time Is a Mother\" by Ocean Vuong.</p><p>Award organizers said this year's three judges each read 602 books of poetry, including 54 translations from 20 languages, submitted by 229 publishers from 20 different countries.</p><p>---</p><p>Did you see this?</p><p>ATLIN, B.C. _ A man who helped return a 140-year-old Tlingit robe to the British Columbia First Nation where it was created says it's as if the regalia called out to its people and they are bringing it home.</p><p>The intricately woven Chilkat robe, made of mountain goat wool and yellow cedar bark, was purchased by the Taku River Tlingit First Nation in northwestern B.C. for almost $40,000 after it went up for sale online by a Toronto-based auction house last year.</p><p>The robe arrived in Whitehorse Wednesday and will travel 175 kilometres south to the First Nation's traditional territory in Atlin, B.C., where it's expected to go on display and may be used in future ceremonies.</p><p>While the community celebrates the return of a piece of its heritage, the First Nation said Indigenous people should not be forced to buy back regalia that was stolen from them.</p><p>It's calling on the federal government to take action to prevent similar situations in the future.</p><p>Tlingit elder and master carver Wayne Carlick said his heart \"probably exploded'' when the robe's close connection to his community was confirmed after he saw it online.</p><p>As an artist and residential school survivor, Carlick said looking at the robe and understanding the history it represents makes him emotional.</p><p>\"I think about when I got home from residential school, I didn't see any art, I didn't see any language, I didn't see any dancing or singing. People were suffering and really hurting and there was no art,'' he said in an interview from the airport in Vancouver.</p><p>\"It took a long time before I started seeing First Nation's art, West Coast First Nation's art, and so it took a long time to get to this point.''</p><p>Carlick said getting the robe back is a chance for the younger generation to see art in a way he couldn't at their age, and to learn about the nation's history and resilience.</p><p>---</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 8, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-1cf25c3889124bbe96a8f4d418c20848</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DP-GFS1-JBVR-3030-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1976\"/><timeReceived>04:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 8, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Officials reopened roads and a major bridge in the region. <br/> But the mayor of nearby Aigialeias, Dimitris Kalogeropoulos, called the fire 'an immense catastrophe'. <br/> 'There has not yet been an official assessment of the damage, but around 10 houses in the area of Ziria have burnt down, as well as farming sheds and stables \u2014 which is a lot for the residents of the region who make their living from agriculture,' he told the ANA news agency. <br/> The fire broke out early Saturday near Patras,in the Peloponnese, about 210 kilometres (130 miles) west of Athens, and officials evacuated five villages and a seaside town. Eight people were hospitalised with burns and respiratory problems. <br/> Aigialeias' town hall provided emergency accommodation for villagers who fled their homes. <br/> 'We've been through hell,' one resident of Ziria, Giorgos Alexopoulos, told AFP. 'We were scared we would lose everything in the flames.' <br/> The seaside resort of Loggos was also evacuated, emergency services sending nearly 100 residents and tourists to the nearby city of Aigio. <br/> The local newspaper, the Patras Times, reported that flames had destroyed around 30 houses, farming sheds and stables in the villages of Ziria, Kamares, Achaias and Labiri. Local olive groves were also destroyed in the fire, it added. <br/><br/>- 60 forest fires in 24 hours - <br/><br/>Civil Protection Minister Michalis Chrisochoidis, who visited the scene on Sunday, said the situation had improved since Saturday. <br/> 'A hundred properties have been saved thanks to the firefighters' battle against the flames,' he said. 'We remain cautious and will support our citizens affected by this fire.' <br/> On Saturday, officials closed a motorway in the region as well as the Rio-Antirrio bridge across the Gulf of Corinth connecting the Peloponnese and mainland Greece, ANA reported, but they were reopened Sunday. <br/> Hospitals in Patras and Aigio were put on alert, as well as the coastguard. <br/> According to the civil protection agency, 60 forest fires have broken out over the past 24 hours, although most were quickly brought under control. <br/> On Sunday, 67 firefighters using 20 vehicles were battling a fresh fire that broke out on Rhodes, in the Pandanassa region, helped by three water-carrying planes and four helicopters. <br/> The EU's European Forest Fire Information System said 13,511 hectares (334 acres) had been burnt Sunday. <br/>Greece is hit by forest fires every summer, but experts have warned that global warming increases both their frequency and intensity. <br/> The country has been in the grip of a new heat wave since Friday, with temperatures hovering between 42 and 44 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit), weather forecasters say. <br/> Several days ago, a fire ravaged Mount

Planes and helicopters made runs to dump water on the burning hills.</p><p>Rain starting to fall in the area was also expected to help. Residents in two towns near the inferno had been ordered on Sunday to stay indoors but they were allowed out by the early hours of Monday.</p><p>Authorities are investigating the causes of the fire.</p><p>Forest fires are a recurring threat in Spain, like in much of southern Europe, every summer. At least half a dozen wildfires were fought over the weekend, including one in eastern Spain's Albacete province that was only brought under control after burning over 2,500 hectares.</p><p>__</p><p>AP reporter Aritz Parra in Madrid contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-0147b8b0a2297c2d48138699a24f789b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6378-GH61-DY9S-T4NC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"265\"/><timeReceived>04:53 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 26, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Now, the plan is to address all fire risks and preserve the forested property as a recreation space where families can enjoy the outdoors, she said.</p><p>Phase One of the project\u2014a collaborative effort between Midway, the Community Forest, and Vaagen Fibre Canada \u2014 is expected to get underway in the coming days, Feist said.</p><p>Before any new amenities are constructed, crews will undertake fuel mitigation to keep any fires that spark in the region from spreading. These efforts will include establishing a fire break on the south side of the river to protect nearby homes, removing any dead trees and brush from the property that could fuel a spreading blaze, and reducing the canopy density, she explained.</p><p>Feist noted that fire safety continues to be a priority for Midway. She remembers several fires in recent years just south of the nearby Cana-da-U.S border that sparked serious concern and this subsequent clean-up on the Midway side.</p><p>\u201cIf the winds had really whipped up and started coming to the north, we could have been in a really bad situation,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fire fuel that needs to be addressed so we\u2019re just going to clean it up\u201d and implement safety measures.</p><p>Once the fire risk is under control, Phase Two of the project can begin:improving recreational opportunities on the property.</p><p>The plan, Feist explained, is to construct new trails for biking and hiking that will connect to existing ones in the adjacent Community Forest. Council, she said, has discussed several other amenities for the property including a free disc golf course, a gazebo where families can gather and trail users can rest, and a mountain bike track for kids.</p><p>Feist added that graded sledding runs are also in the works\u2014although this won\u2019t be anything new for locals.

Kalmakoff</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Special to the Grand Forks Gazette</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">***************</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Doukhobor Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood at Grand Forks is probably best historically known for its religious pacifism, large brick communal homes, and once-vast fruit orchards. Less recognized, but also important, are the many agricultural and industrial enterprises it established. Last week we started examining the Doukhobor agro-industrial complex created west of the city from 1909 to 1939, and its contribution to the growth and development of the Kettle Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sawmill</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 1909, the Community erected a sawmill with which to manufacture rough lumber for building their homes and barns. Operated for the Doukhobors' own use, it was a small portable sawmill with a capacity of 10,000 board-feet per day, powered by a self-propelled steam engine. There was no planer.</p><p>It was originally located below Village No. 5 (Hremakin village) near Saddle Mountain along present-day York Road. Logs cut along the north bank of the Kettle River and south foot of Saddle Mountain were brought to the mill on horse-drawn dollies or sleighs (in winter).</p><p>When the supply of logs was exhausted in one place, the sawmill was moved to another location. By 1918, it was relocated north adjacent the Community brickworks. There, it milled logs cut from the west and north foot of Saddle Mountain, east foot of Eagle and Hardy Mountains, and south foot of Spencer Hill.</p><p>During this time, the Grand Forks Community also maintained commercial logging, pole-cutting and sawmill camps at Cedar Creek on the North Fork (1923-1925), Myers Creek near Midway (1924-1927) and Nelse Creek near Rock Creek (1926).</p><p>In 1927, the Community sawmill operation was greatly expanded and relocated along July Creek at Village No. 10 (Horkoff village) near present-day Gibbs Creek Road. It operated as a 35,000 board-feet-per-day facility and manufactured lumber for commercial sale from the Community's timber lots along July Creek. Much of the output was shipped south to the United States. It produced upwards of two million board-feet annually and had an adjacent planning mill, pole-making operation and box factory.</p><p>After 12 years of operation, having survived an arson attempt in August 1931 and the July Creek Forest Fire of August 1934, it was destroyed by incendiarism in October 1939 at a loss of $30,000.</p><p>Flour Mill</p><p>In 1910, the Community established a stone grist mill to grind their wheat into flour. Operated for their own use, it had a capacity of 100 bushels of flour per day. Beside it stood a 10,000-bushel granary for storing wheat prior to milling. It was located beside Village No. 5 (Kootnikoff village).</p><p>The Doukhobor flour-milling process can be described as follows: a pair of large millstones was used as the grinding mechanism. The bottom or bed stone was fixed into position, while the upper or runner stone rotated above it. Motive power from a stationary steam engine was directed to the runner stone by a shaft which went through its middle and turned it. Wheat was fed from a chute above between the stones, where it was ground into flour collected in a hopper below. The distance between millstones could be adjusted to vary flour coarseness. The bread made of this flour was dark but very healthy.</p><p>In 1917, the production of linseed oil was started at the flour mill. Flax or linseed was mechanically pressed to produce cooking oil. A seed-cleaning plant was also added during this period.</p><p>In 1930, the Community flour mill was shut down. Six years later, in 1936, an arson attempt wiped out surrounding buildings, but the flour mill building itself survived because of its laminated wood. Another arson attempt in May 1946 destroyed a barn and implement shed but the mill remained undamaged.</p><p>Beginning in 1962, the flour mill was retrofitted as an electric hammer mill by the Doukhobor Milling Heritage Society and reopened in May 1964. The new, modern process created a cleaner, more refined product and could handle a higher volume of wheat processing - up to 200 pounds an hour. It was sold throughout the Kootenay-Boundary as the famous Pride of the Valley flour.</p><p>Today the flour mill still stands on Mill Road, named after it. It is jointly managed by the Doukhobor Milling Heritage Society and Boundary Museum Society and continues to mill grain on demand.</p><p>Fruit Packing Houses</p><p>In order to process fruit from their orchards as they came into bearing, the Community built a large packing house in 1912. Located at Village No. 3 (Vanjoff village) along present-day Hardy Mountain Road, it was a two-storey, 100-by 30-foot wood-frame structure with concrete basement and gable roof. It had a fruit box-making plant on the second floor.</p><p>Large and small fruit grown in the colony arrived by wagonload to the packing house. There, it was received, unloaded, and weighed. It was then turned out on tables, graded and sorted, culling the bruised, spoilt or small fruit aside, and packed into boxes. The packed fruit was stored in the basement until shipment. It was shipped from the adjacent Great Northern VV&amp;E Phoenix Branch at Copper Junction.</p><p>The packing houses also processed Community-grown vegetables for outside markets, which were grown in massive quantities. In 1912 alone, the Community sold 8,000 100-pound sacks of potatoes from Grand Forks.</p><p>By 1919, the Community's orchards were coming into full bearing and a second fruit packing house was built. Located south of the Community brickworks at the corner of present-day Reservoir and Canning Roads, it was a two-storey, 100-by 60-foot wood-frame structure with elevator lifts, concrete basement and monitor-style roof. As there was no adjacent railway, fruit packs were hauled to the Community warehouses in Columbia Flats for shipping.</p><p>By 1920, the Community packing houses were shipping 120-130 railcar-loads of fruit annually \u2013 apples, pears, plums and prunes as well as strawberries, raspberries, currants and gooseberries \u2013 to outside markets. This included 50 carloads of Italian prunes alone.</p><p>Tomato Cannery</p><p>In August 1912, the Doukhobors installed a small fruit and vegetable cannery at Grand Forks for their own use. Then in 1924, the Community erected a large, commercial-scale tomato canning plant beside their Community flour mill. It was the first cannery established at Grand Forks.</p><p>Operated as the Kootenay-Columbia Preserving Works, large volumes of tomatoes harvested from the Community fields were brought to the plant, where they were cleaned and blanched in large copper kettles filled with boiling water, then plunged into smaller copper pots filled with cold water, then finally poured into sterilized 28-ounce cans, topped with water and sealed. Sold under the K.C. Brand label, they were marketed across Western Canada. It operated until 1936, when it was destroyed by arson.</p><p>Fruit Evaporator</p><p>In 1924, the Community erected a commercial-scale fruit evaporating plant beside their flour mill \u2013 the first permanent facility of its kind at Grand Forks. Small fruit and berries picked from the Community fields were brought to the plant. Once dehydrated, fruit was preserved at one-tenth of its original weight. In its first year of operation, some 12,000 pounds of small fruit and berries was dehydrated into 1,200 pounds of dried fruit. The dried fruit could be stored for extended lengths of time without spoilage.</p><p>Most of the dehydrated fruit was sent to the Kootenay-Columbia Preserving Works jam factory in Brilliant. Once it arrived, it was soaked in water for several hours, after which it returned to practically its original state with all its colour and nutrients retained. It was then processed into jam. The plant operated until 1936, when it was destroyed by incendiarism.</p><p>Jam Factory</p><p>As early as 1912 and again in 1923-24 and 1927-28, the Community proposed building a jam factory at Grand Forks to serve its orchards there. However, each time, the Community elected instead to focus on developing and expanding its Brilliant jam factory. It was not until 1935 that the Doukhobors established a local jammery \u2013 the first ever in Grand Forks.</p><p>In spring 1935, the existing fruit packing house near the brick factory was retrofitted as a jam plant. A brick veneer was added to the building exterior. Twelve steam-activated jam-making kettles, ordered from England, were installed on the upper floor. Fruit and vegetable canning equipment was also ordered. It had a production capacity of 12 tons of jam per day.</p><p>Adjacent to the north, a two-storey, brick 40-by 36-foot boiler house with concrete foundation and monitor-style roof was built to supply steam power to the jam plant. A 30-foot high water tower was erected nearby to supply water to the boilers. An adjacent wood lot was stocked with cordwood, slabs and board ends from the Community sawmill to fire the boilers.</p><p>Over the first two weeks of August 1935, considerable quantities of strawberries, raspberries, cherries and other small fruit arrived at the new plant from the Community fields and from other Grand Forks fruit growers under contract. It was sorted and stored in the basement of the jam plant.</p><p>When production began, the fruit was brought to the main floor, where it was cleaned, peeled, de-cored/de-stoned, then cut into pieces and/or crushed. It was then taken to the second floor, where equal portions of fruit pulp and sugar were placed in each large copper kettle and cooked for 15 minutes while continually stirred. Once cooked, the kettles were emptied into smaller copper pots and wheeled over to long cooling trays filled with cold water, in which they were placed. As the jam cooled, it received a final skimming, and was then ladled by hand into sterilized cans and sealed.</p><p>The jammery operated roughly 10 days, producing 194,250 pounds of jam. However, on Aug. 17, 1935, the jam plant building burned to the ground in an incendiary blaze. It was a devastating blow to the Community with $100,000 in losses, including $40,000 of jam that was not shipped to market because of a delay in receiving jam tin labels from the printer. The arsonists were never brought to justice.</p><p>The jam factory boiler house still stands, having been converted, along with adjacent former Community buildings, into a family home in 1979. It is located on Canning Road, named after the jam factory.</p><p>Warehouses</p><p>Railway facilities played an important role in Community operations, both for receiving incoming goods and supplies purchased from Eastern Canadian manufacturers, and for shipping outgoing agricultural and industrial commodities (bricks, lumber products, fruit and preserves) to market. This required the establishment of Community warehouses for storing goods before their internal distribution or outside export, as the case was.</p><p>In circa 1912, the Community built a two-storey, 45 by 60 foot warehouse near the Great Northern Weston station in Columbia Flats, near present-day Northfork Franklin Road. It was used for the shipping of produce to points on the Great Northern VV&amp;E line. In about 1923, it was sold following the dismantling of the Weston station yards.</p><p>In 1912-13, the Community built a two-storey brick 75 by 50 foot warehouse with concrete basement and elevator lift near the Canadian Pacific west end station in Columbia Flats on present-day Donaldson Avenue. The basement was used for fruit cold storage, the main floor for storing dry goods, while the upper floor was divided into living quarters and offices for the Community branch manager. In 1927, the main floor was converted into a retail store open to the public.</p><p>The Community store warehouse operated for 27 years. In 1940, it was purchased by Peter S. Polonicoff and run as Polonicoff's Store until its closure in 1984. Today the building stands in good structural condition and has been converted into two heritage-style apartments.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In July 1936, the Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood Ltd. declared bankruptcy during the height of the Great Depression. In June 1937 and May 1938 it was placed under receivership by creditors who foreclosed upon the company and its property valuated at $4,000,000 for a total debt of $360,580.64. Thus ended the largest agro-industrial enterprise ever undertaken in the Boundary and the largest experiment in communal living ever attempted in North America.</p><p>Enduring to this day is the Doukhobor example of bringing forth the bounty of the land, with the help of fertile valley soil and a moderate climate, fueled by the desire to work together in community towards a common purpose. The Doukhobors' contribution to the early agricultural and industrial growth and development of Grand Forks deserves to be recognized and acknowledged.</p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Trail Daily Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRAILD-news20230617PTR4483246</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRAILD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68GS-SWG1-JD2C-J3PY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2127\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Rob Lasson says it appears the bus was crossing the Trans-Canada Highway, heading south on Highway 5, when it was struck Thursday morning.</p><p>He declined to speculate on the cause or circumstances of the crash, but said the investigation continues and criminal charges are a possibility.</p><p>---</p><p>Also this ...</p><p>People in parts of Alberta and British Columbia are returning home after wildfire evacuation orders were lifted Thursday.</p><p>Thanks to recent rain and favourable winds, roughly 2,000 residents from Tumbler Ridge, B.C., were allowed to return home.</p><p>An evacuation order was also lifted for the town of Edson, Alta., and surrounding area, allowing more than 8,000 to return.</p><p>The ending of the order in Alberta comes six days after flames jumped fireguards outside the town 200 kilometres west of Edmonton and forced residents to get out.</p><p>A statement on Edson's website says residents should remain ready to leave with four hours\u2019 notice, and an evacuation alert status will remain in place.</p><p>Federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair says many people in Alberta, B.C. and Quebec have been able to return home, but thousands remain displaced due to fires across the country.</p><p>Blair says rain and cooler weather have helped improve the fire situation significantly in the Maritimes and parts of Quebec, but that\u2019s not the case everywhere.</p><p>\u201cThe hot, dry and windy conditions in parts of Western Canada and in Ontario are exacerbating an already dangerous set of circumstances, and we know the peak of the wildfire season may still be several weeks away,\u201d he said Thursday.</p><p>As of Thursday afternoon, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre was reporting 446 active fires, of which 217 are out of control. The centre was reporting 127 fires in Quebec, 83 in Alberta, 70 in British Columbia and 56 in Ontario.</p><p>---</p><p>And this too ... </p><p>Canada's top court will deliver the final word Friday on whether the pact between Canada and the United States to control the flow of asylum seekers violates their fundamental rights.</p><p>The Safe Third Country Agreement, which came into effect in 2004, recognizes Canada and the U.S. as safe places for potential refugees to seek protection.</p><p>Under the agreement, refugees must seek asylum in the first of the two countries they land in, making it illegal to cross the border and seek asylum in the other country.</p><p>Opponents of the treaty asked the top court to declare that the legislation underpinning the pact violates the right to life, liberty and security of the person, saying the U.S. is not actually safe for many asylum seekers.</p><p>The Canadian government argued to Supreme Court justices that returnees have access to fair asylum and detention processes south of the border.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Joe Biden agreed to expand the treaty in March so that it would apply along all 8,900 kilometres of the shared border, not just at official crossings. </p><p>Before then, a loophole allowed asylum seekers who arrived between official points of entry along the land border to make claims in Canada despite having arrived in the U.S. first. </p><p>Opponents of the pact have said it runs counter to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, because returning people to the U.S. exposes them to risks in the form of detention and other rights violations.</p><p>The Supreme Court's decision will finally put to rest the long-standing legal battle first launched by several refugee claimants in Federal Court in 2007.</p><p>The Canadian Council for Refugees, the Canadian Council of Churches and Amnesty International also participated in the proceedings as public interest parties.</p><p>---</p><p>What we are watching in the U.S. ...</p><p>MINNEAPOLIS _ The findings of a two-year investigation of the Minneapolis Police Department, prompted by the death of George Floyd, are expected to be announced Friday by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland.</p><p>The Department of Justice on Thursday announced a news conference \"on a civil rights matter'' was scheduled for Friday morning at the federal courthouse in Minneapolis. Justice Department and city officials declined to confirm about whether they will announce findings of that police department investigation.</p><p>A Justice Department advisory said Garland will be joined by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Police Chief Brian O'Hara and others. A link to a Justice Department public webinar scheduled for Friday afternoon has the heading: \"DOJ Presentation for MPD Investigative Findings.''</p><p>The \"pattern or practice'' investigation was launched in April 2021, a day after former officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, was convicted of murder and manslaughter in the May 25, 2020, killing of Floyd, who was Black.</p><p>Floyd repeatedly said he couldn't breathe before going limp as Chauvin knelt on his neck for 9 1/2 minutes.</p><p>The killing was recorded by a bystander and sparked months of mass protests as part of a broader national reckoning over racial injustice.</p><p>The federal investigation concerns whether the Minneapolis Police Department engaged in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional or unlawful policing. Such investigations typically look at the use of force by officers, including force used during protests, and whether the department engages in discriminatory practices. The investigation also was expected to assess the way the department handled misconduct allegations and how it held officers accountable.</p><p>A similar investigation by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights led to a \"court-enforceable settlement agreement'' to address the long list of problems identified in the report, with input from residents, officers, city staff and others. Frey and state Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero signed the agreement in March.</p><p>The state investigation, which concluded in April 2022, found \"significant racial disparities with respect to officers' use of force, traffic stops, searches, citations, and arrests.'' And it criticized \"an organizational culture where some officers and supervisors use racist, misogynistic, and disrespectful language with impunity.''</p><p>---</p><p>What we are watching in the rest of the world ...</p><p>ROME _ Pope Francis on Friday was discharged from the Rome hospital where he had abdominal surgery nine days earlier to repair a hernia and remove painful scarring, with his surgeon saying the pontiff is now \"better than before'' the hospitalization.</p><p>Francis, 86, left through Gemelli Polyclinic's main exit in a wheelchair, smiling and waving and saying \"thanks'' to a crowd of well-wishers, then stood up so he could get into the small Vatican car awaiting him. In the brief distance before he could reach the white Fiat 500, reporters thrust microphones practically at his face, and the pontiff seemed to bat them away, good-naturedly. </p><p>\"The pope is well. He's better than before,'' Dr. Sergio Alfieri, the surgeon who did the three-hour operation on June 7 told reporters as the pope was driven away.</p><p>Instead of going straight back to the Vatican, Francis stopped to pray for 10 minutes before an icon of the Virgin Mary at the famous St. Mary Major Basilica, where he often stops by after trips abroad to give thanks. Francis stayed in his wheelchair as he prayed. He also went there to pray after his discharge on April 2 from the same hospital following treatment for bronchitis.</p><p>Several people in the crowd outside wept as he left and headed for the Holy See hotel, where he lives on Vatican City grounds.</p><p>Hours after the surgery, Alfieri said that the scarring, which had resulted from previous abdominal surgeries, had been increasingly causing the pope pain. There was also risk of an intestinal blockage, if adhesions, or scar tissue, weren't removed, according to the doctors.</p><p>No complications occurred during the surgery or while the pope was convalescing in Gemelli's 10th-floor apartment reserved exclusively for hospitalization of pontiffs, according to the pope's medical staff.</p><p>---</p><p>On this day in 1894 ...</p><p>The \"Edmonton Bulletin'' reported there could be oil in Alberta.</p><p>---</p><p>In entertainment ...</p><p>NEW YORK _ Gloria Estefan sang a medley of her hits, Post Malone sang one of his forgotten gems, Teddy Riley swayed to New Jack Swing and Jeff Lynne rocked out to \"Mr. Blue Sky'' at the Songwriters Hall of Fame induction ceremony Thursday night.</p><p>The gala at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City celebrated a diverse group of songwriters, with Broadway represented by lyricist Tim Rice, pop from Glen Ballard and a Nashville twang from Liz Rose. Each inductee spoke about how important music was to them growing up and how it connected them to the past and future.</p><p>\"To those fans that have found in my music what I found in the music of the life-changing songwriters that nourished my soul throughout my life, I thank you for that privilege,'' said Estefan, the first Hispanic woman to be inducted. \"And I can assure you that it is just as magical from the other side of the song.''</p><p>Lynne, of the prog-rock Electric Light Orchestra, who worked with the Travelling Wilburys and Tom Petty, was the first to be honoured, with guitarist Joe Walsh introducing his friend as a \"a one-man Renaissance artist'' and playing ELO's \"Don't Bring Me Down.''</p><p>Rose recalled being a single, working mom with three children who turned to songwriting in her late 30s. She co-wrote many songs with Taylor Swift beginning when the singer-songwriter was 14, including \"You Belong with Me,'' \"Teardrops on My Guitar'' and \"White Horse.'' Rose doesn't sing or play an instrument and thanked all the artists.</p><p>\"The cool thing about songwriting is that you get to hang out with your friends and you get to have therapy and you get to cry and drink wine and eat Cheez-Its,'' Rose said. \"I just love to dig in and just see that song come out at the end of the session. There's just nothing like it.''</p><p>Broadway star Heather Headley introduced Rice and sang \"I Don't Know How to Love Him'' from \"Jesus Christ Superstar,'' the musical he wrote with Andrew Lloyd Webber. Rice, who is already in the hall, was honoured with the Johnny Mercer Award, the highest honour bestowed by the event.</p><p>Miles Frost, another Broadway star from the Michael Jackson musical \"MJ,'' helped introduce Ballard, who helped write and produce Alanis Morissette's monster 1995 album \"Jagged Little Pill'' and was involved in the recording and writing of several Jackson albums, including \"Thriller,'' \"Bad'' and \"Dangerous.''</p><p>Doug E. Fresh and Keith Sweat inducted Riley, the singer, songwriter and producer credited with creating New Jack Swing, which fuses hip-hop, R&amp;B, dance and pop, and its top anthems such as Bobby Brown's \"My Prerogative.'' The trio did a medley of hits that included \"I Want Her,'' \"No Diggity'' and \"Rump Shaker.''</p><p>The Songwriters Hall of Fame was established in 1969 to honour those creating popular music. A songwriter with a notable catalogue of songs qualifies for induction 20 years after the first commercial release of a song.</p><p>Some already in the hall include Carole King, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, Elton John and Bernie Taupin, Brian Wilson, James Taylor, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Lionel Richie, Bill Withers, Neil Diamond and Phil Collins.</p><p>---</p><p>Did you see this?</p><p>A Canadian study suggests an association between household use of gas stoves and asthma in some kids, but that depends on multiple factors.</p><p>Like other recent studies on the issue, the results were inconsistent in the research published last week in the Canadian Journal of Public Health.</p><p>Study co-author and respirologist Doctor Padmaja Subbarao says 5.5 per cent of children living in Toronto homes with an electric stove were diagnosed with asthma by age five but that jumped to just over 10 per cent for kids whose families use a gas stove.</p><p>She says the numbers were likely higher in Toronto compared to Vancouver because of climate differences that allow people in the West Coast city to open windows, even in winter, providing natural ventilation from pollutants.</p><p>They include carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, which are emitted by gas stoves and can potentially irritate the lungs.</p><p>An analysis of studies published last year suggested 12.7 per cent of childhood asthma cases in the United States are associated with the appliance. </p><p>But experts say genetics and the lack of a hood fan that ventilates toxins to the outside could be among the contributing factors.</p><p>---</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 16, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-9573c1f5c8ad4cdeb141e7904f8e65f9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68GD-7Y11-JBVR-3495-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2212\"/><timeReceived>04:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 16, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Start or finish by casting your line in one of the numerous local lakes and rivers for a fresh catch that will be perfectly prepared over the evening campfire or camp stove.</p><p>Nights are perfect for cosying up around a campfire, or gas fire ring where summer fire bans persist, enjoying a starry sky distinct from anything you'll see when surrounded by city lights.</p><p>From 100 Mile House in the south through to Williams Lake, Quesnel and Wells farther north, you're spoiled for choice when it comes to camping options \u2013 everything from a mountain park with all the amenities to more rustic away-from-it-all options.</p><p>Whether you have a must-visit destination in mind, or are looking for a little inspiration, start with a look at Explore Cariboo's interactive camping page and map, where you can search by destination, site type, or amenities like \"trails\" or \"fishing lakes.\" Click on the icon and you'll receive a detailed description of the area, amenities and contact information.</p><p>If only planning every camping trip was this easy!</p><p>Don't forget the bikes</p><p>Cooler fall temperatures also offer so many options for exploring.

Other nearby destinations include the Quesnel Museum and Archives, whose exhibits explore the region's rich and diverse history, and the fully operational blacksmith shop and sawmill at the Antique Machinery Park in South Quesnel, open during special events or by appointment outside of peak times.</p><p>Heading south, the Xatsull Heritage Village welcomes visitors through mid-October. Located along the mighty Fraser River, the award-winning site invites you to explore the history of the Secw\u00e9pemc Nation and their traditional way of life through tours, activities and teepee accommodation.

The report presented data collected between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2019, and provided year-over-year comparisons to the last five years using previously-collected data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report states that the QVC saw 12,209 visitors walk through its door in 2019, a significant increase from 2017 (up 40 per cent) and 2018 (up 21 per cent) -years in which visitation suffered due to forest fires throughout the region - but a decrease in visitation from recent non-forest fire years 2014 (down seven per cent, 2015 (down 10 per cent) and 2016 (down four per cent).</p><p>According to the report, visitation to Quesnel in 2019 was up from 2018's numbers in both visitors from within and outside of the country.</p><p>The highest number of visitors to the Quesnel community are coming from within B.C. A recorded 2,728 individuals in 2019 were visitors from within the province, a 25-per-cent increase from 2018 and an overall increase from each of the previous five years listed in the report.</p><p>Visitors from Alberta represented the most dramatic increase in visitor origin from 2018, with an increase of 106 per cent in 2019; however, when compared to the non-forest fire years in the report (2014-2016), the increase was still lower, by an average of minus-32 per cent.</p><p>The majority of visitors from outside of Canada in 2019 were found to be coming from Europe; however, the largest incline when compared to the previous year were visitors hailing from the U.S. and Mexico, which saw an 88-per-cent increase.</p><p>The report also shows the number of \"Same Day\" visitors, individuals who visited Quesnel but did not stay overnight, rose by 15 per cent in 2019 when compared to the previous year. When compared to all five years recorded in the report, Same Day visits were up by an average of plus-31 per cent.</p><p>The report tracked the amount of nights visitors spent in Quesnel and found that aside from the steady rise in Same Day visitors, overnight and multi-day visits were down, with a few exceptions.</p><p>\"With the exception of Same Day visitors, we saw declines in all areas of duration of stay when comparing previous years' stats to 2019, with the only exceptions being in one-week stays in 2014, one-day stays in 2017 and 14-plus-day stays in 2016 and 2017,\" according to the report.</p><p>The report states visitor requests for information increased in almost all tracked categories in 2019 when compared to the previous two years, with the exceptions being Accommodation and Adventure Recreation. Accommodation requests saw a 20-per-cent drop when compared to 2018 and a 32-per-cent drop from 2017, while Adventure Tourism requests saw a slight three-per-cent decrease in 2019 when compared to 2018.</p><p>Visitor information request categories which saw the largest increase in 2019 from 2018 were Transportation, which saw a 198-per-cent rise in requests, and First Nations, which increased by 85 per cent.</p><p>The categories which saw the most total overall requests in 2019 were Maps/Directions with 3,369 total requests a 25-per-cent increase from 2018, Attractions with 1,622 requests a 12-per-cent increase from 2018 and Site Facilities with 1,532 requests a four-per-cent increase from 2018.</p><p>According to the report, requests for information regarding the casino and museum have shown a positive increase in each of the last five years, with the museum receiving the greatest increase in requests.</p><p>With regards to information requests for places of interest in the surrounding community, the report found that Bowron Lake saw an increase of 47 per cent in requests, while Barkerville saw an increase of 18 per cent in 2019.</p><p>While the number of requests regarding Bowron Lake and Barkerville were up in 2019, they were down when compared to recent non-forest fire years.</p><p>\"Compared to previous, non-forest fire years, 2019's numbers were not as high as we would like to see,\" according to the report. \"We saw declines averaging minus-34 per cent for Bowron Lake when comparing 2019 to 2014, 2015 and 2016.

William (Bill) Bickle and his brother Frank passed through in 1907, but it wasn\u2019t until 1910 that a man named Mike Gallagher built a cabin at the west end of Francois Lake.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gallagher worked on the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. Every spring, he left his homestead and walked out to Houston in search of employment. In the fall, he returned home with a wheelbarrow full of supplies \u2013 enough, he hoped, to last the winter.</p><p>The first store at Nadina, if it could be called that, was established by a man named Mosher in 1913. His stock was limited to a few axe handles, some rice, and flour, so most people looked elsewhere for supplies. All that changed in 1918, though, when Frank Gale and his family arrived and took up residence.</p><p>Frank bought furs from local trappers and established a trading post on the lakeshore. When that structure burnt down, he built a new home and store on a hillside above the lake\u2019s south shore.</p><p>The Gale store became the nucleus of a new community. More settlers arrived, enough to support a school, a dance hall, and a post office. By 1927, Frank was advertising in the Burns Lake newspaper, making regular trips to the village for supplies, and even ferry passengers up and down Francois Lake in what the Observer newspaper described as a \u201cspeed boat.\u201d He also had a scow, and used it to transport everything from supplies to Mike Touhy\u2019s threshing machine.</p><p>The Gales were a hospitable lot. A man named Tom Thompson (no relation to the Group of Seven painter) maintained what passed for roads in the Nadina area. One winter\u2019s night, when the temperature dipped to -60 Fahrenheit, he sought refuge at the Gale store.</p><p>Frank\u2019s father, an eccentric fellow known to all as \u201cOld Man Gale,\u201d gave Thompson a room in the store. The road worker remarked later that while the bedsheets were clean, Old Man Gale did not provide his lodger with any blankets. Thompson almost froze to death. It was, he said, so cold in the building the following morning that his host cooked had to wear mitts while cooking breakfast.</p><p>The community at Nadina continued to grow. Settlers eventually got around to building a bridge at the west end of Francois Lake, but the lake itself was the most reliable transportation route. By March 15, 1928, there were so many boats using the west end of Francois Lake between April and December that Frank urged the Burns Lake Board of Trade to lobby for the establishment of several wharves in the area. At least one senior level of government felt the request was warranted, because a new government wharf was built not far from the Gale store.</p><p>The fledgling community narrowly escaped disaster in June 1932, when a forest fire swept through the area, but residents from as far away as Wistaria came to the rescue.</p><p>\u201cDistrict Forester Parlow and Forest Ranger Pedley put in a strenuous time fighting the Owen Lake fire when it swept into the Nadina River settlement,\u201d Sidney Godwin wrote in the Observer, Burns Lake\u2019s weekly newspaper. \u201cMr. Parlow came in to Burns Lake at the week end exhausted from unremitting toil and lack of sleep. He is loud in his praise of the Wistaria residents, including Arthur Shelford and Pete Kerr, who came for many miles and offered their cooperation in the fight to save Frank Gale\u2019s store buildings and stock, and the Nadina settlement. Had it not been for their timely arrival, willing work, and direction of the wind, the Nadina River settlement would have been completely wiped out.\u201d</p><p>Nadina survived the fire, but not the Great Depression. Desperate for work, many residents moved away. The post office closed, and eventually the store and school did, too. Frank Gale and his family were among the last to leave; they sold their property to a man named Carl Osborne and moved to Victoria. Their former home and store burned to the ground on November 8, 1947, and were not rebuilt.</p><p>Today, Frank Gale\u2019s stone chimney and a few pilings in Francois Lake (vestiges of the government wharf) mark the site of what was once the thriving community of Nadina. Both are visible from Ootsa-Nadina Road, which was swept by wildfire again in 2018.</p><p>\u00a9 2021 Michael Riis-Christianson and the Lakes District Museum Society Michael Riis-Christianson and the Lakes District Museum Society</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BURNSL-news20220921PPMA0002996825</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BURNSL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66F9-YY31-JD2C-J3G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438230</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Hole GR23-03 represents the highest mineralized intercept to date in the H1 Zone, which remains open at depth and along strike.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights //st * GR23-03 intersected 1.82% Ni over 4.60 metres, including 5.75% Ni over 0.60 metres at a depth of 330 metres below surface * The 4.60 metre interval includes 0.95 g/t Pd and 0.40 g/t Pt, with a subinterval of 3.85 g/t Pd and 1.68 g/t Pt over 0.60 metres * This intercept represents the thickest, highest nickel sulphide tenor mineralization intersected to date in the H1 Zone * The H1 Zone remains open at depth and along strike * Visible gold was intersected 250 metres below surface, with assays of 49.1 g/t over 0.30 metres</p><p>Tom Meyer, Archer's President and CEO, commented: \"We are excited by the extension of the higher grade H1 Zone at depth and the opportunity to further grow the resource base with improving nickel grades. This portion of the H1 Zone has seen little drilling given the previous focus on the larger H3 Zone. The continuity of the higher nickel tenors over larger widths in H1 has positive implications for potentially expanding the resource and improving our understanding of the mineralizing event that led to the formation of this exciting nickel discovery\".</p><p>Jack Gauthier, VP Exploration, commented: \"The mineralization was higher grade and more extensive than anything we have seen in the H1 Zone to date. Furthermore, in addition to this zone being wide open at depth, this hole is more than 200 metres away from the next nearest hole which leaves open the possibility of materially growing the size of the H1 Zone.\"</p><p>Figure 1 shows the plan view of the drilling targets relative to the surface projection of H3 and H1 Zones that comprise the Grasset mineral resource. The high-grade H3 Zone contains the bulk of the mineral resource and was the focus of previous drilling campaigns.</p><p>Drill holes GR23-03 and GR23-04 were recently completed and assays have been received for a portion of GR23-03 (Table 1). GR23-04 was completed to a depth of 886 metres having crosscut both contacts of the main ultramafic rock units without any obvious visible massive sulphide mineralisation, however, disseminated sulphides were observed over the expected intersection of the H3 and H1 Zones. Assays for GR23-03 and GR23-04 are currently pending.</p><p>Hole GR23-05 was paused after 558 metres due to the forest fire evacuation order issued by the province of Quebec (see news release dated June 5, 2023).Hole GR23-05 is designed to test the vertical extension of the most prospective area of H3 at a depth of 1,000 metres below surface and is anticipated to intersect H1 at a vertical depth of approximately 1,200 metres.</p><p>Table 1:Summary of Assay Results Hole GR23-03 //st</p><p>From To Length Ni Cu Co Pt Pd Hole-ID</p><p>(m) (m) (m) (%) (%) (%) ( g/t ) ( g/t ) GR23-03 399.0 404.2 5.20 0.35 0.03 0.01 0.07 0.15 and 404.2 408.8 4.60 1.82 0.22 0.04 0.40 0.95 incl. 408.2 408.8 0.60 5.75 0.24 0.13 1.68 3.85</p><p>All lengths are downhole lengths and true widths are expected to be greater than or equal to 60-70% of downhole lengths.</p><p>As outlined in the Company's press release on May 11, 2023, the objective of hole GR23-03 was to test for an extension of the nickel mineralization southeast of the current resource, approximately 200 metres beneath historical hole GR-14-38, which intercepted 0.51% nickel over 4.51 metres, including 0.80% nickel over 1.07 metres in the H1 mineralized horizon (Figure 2).</p><p>The only other completed hole in the area is GR12-09, approximately 110 meters to the east of GR14-38.

(CSE: RCHR) (the \"Company\" or \"Archer Exploration\") is pleased to provide an update on its ongoing 2023 nickel sulphide exploration program at its 100% owned Grasset project, located in the northern Abitibi Greenstone Belt of Quebec, Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recent drilling has focused on testing for immediate extensions of the Grasset Nickel Deposit. Hole GR23-03 represents the highest mineralized intercept to date in the H1 Zone, which remains open at depth and along strike.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights</p><p> GR23-03 intersected 1.82% Ni over 4.60 metres, including 5.75% Ni over 0.60 metres at a depth of 330 metres below surfaceThe 4.60 metre interval includes 0.95 g/t Pd and 0.40 g/t Pt, with a subinterval of 3.85 g/t Pd and 1.68 g/t Pt over 0.60 metresThis intercept represents the thickest, highest nickel sulphide tenor mineralization intersected to date in the H1 ZoneThe H1 Zone remains open at depth and along strikeVisible gold was intersected 250 metres below surface, with assays of 49.1 g/t over 0.30 metres</p><p>Tom Meyer, Archer's President and CEO, commented: \"We are excited by the extension of the higher grade H1 Zone at depth and the opportunity to further grow the resource base with improving nickel grades. This portion of the H1 Zone has seen little drilling given the previous focus on the larger H3 Zone. The continuity of the higher nickel tenors over larger widths in H1 has positive implications for potentially expanding the resource and improving our understanding of the mineralizing event that led to the formation of this exciting nickel discovery\".</p><p>Jack Gauthier, VP Exploration, commented: \"The mineralization was higher grade and more extensive than anything we have seen in the H1 Zone to date. Furthermore, in addition to this zone being wide open at depth, this hole is more than 200 metres away from the next nearest hole which leaves open the possibility of materially growing the size of the H1 Zone.\"</p><p>Figure 1 shows the plan view of the drilling targets relative to the surface projection of H3 and H1 Zones that comprise the Grasset mineral resource. The high-grade H3 Zone contains the bulk of the mineral resource and was the focus of previous drilling campaigns.</p><p>Drill holes GR23-03 and GR23-04 were recently completed and assays have been received for a portion of GR23-03 (Table 1). GR23-04 was completed to a depth of 886 metres having crosscut both contacts of the main ultramafic rock units without any obvious visible massive sulphide mineralisation, however, disseminated sulphides were observed over the expected intersection of the H3 and H1 Zones. Assays for GR23-03 and GR23-04 are currently pending.</p><p>Hole GR23-05 was paused after 558 metres due to the forest fire evacuation order issued by the province of Quebec (see news release dated June 5, 2023).Hole GR23-05 is designed to test the vertical extension of the most prospective area of H3 at a depth of 1,000 metres below surface and is anticipated to intersect H1 at a vertical depth of approximately 1,200 metres.</p><p>Table 1:Summary of Assay Results Hole GR23-03</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"9\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hole-ID</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">From (m)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">To (m)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Length (m)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Ni (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Cu (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">Co (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">Pt (g/t)</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">Pd (g/t)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">GR23-03</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">399.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">404.2</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">5.20</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.35</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.03</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.01</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">0.07</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">0.15</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">and</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">404.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">408.8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">4.60</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">1.82</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.22</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.04</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">0.40</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">0.95</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">incl.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">408.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">408.8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.60</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">5.75</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.24</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.13</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">1.68</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">3.85</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>All lengths are downhole lengths and true widths are expected to be greater than or equal to 60-70% of downhole lengths.</p><p>As outlined in the Company's press release on May 11, 2023, the objective of hole GR23-03 was to test for an extension of the nickel mineralization southeast of the current resource, approximately 200 metres beneath historical hole GR-14-38, which intercepted 0.51% nickel over 4.51 metres, including 0.80% nickel over 1.07 metres in the H1 mineralized horizon (Figure 2).</p><p>The only other completed hole in the area is GR12-09, approximately 110 meters to the east of GR14-38.

William (Bill) Bickle and his brother Frank passed through in 1907, but it wasn't until 1910 that a man named Mike Gallagher built a cabin at the west end of Francois Lake.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gallagher worked on the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. Every spring, he left his homestead and walked out to Houston in search of employment. In the fall, he returned home with a wheelbarrow full of supplies \u2013 enough, he hoped, to last the winter.</p><p>The first store at Nadina, if it could be called that, was established by a man named Mosher in 1913. His stock was limited to a few axe handles, some rice, and flour, so most people looked elsewhere for supplies. All that changed in 1918, though, when Frank Gale and his family arrived and took up residence.</p><p>Frank bought furs from local trappers and established a trading post on the lakeshore. When that structure burnt down, he built a new home and store on a hillside above the lake's south shore.</p><p>The Gale store became the nucleus of a new community. More settlers arrived, enough to support a school, a dance hall, and a post office. By 1927, Frank was advertising in the Burns Lake newspaper, making regular trips to the village for supplies, and even ferry passengers up and down Francois Lake in what the Observer newspaper described as a \"speed boat.\" He also had a scow, and used it to transport everything from supplies to Mike Touhy's threshing machine.</p><p>The Gales were a hospitable lot. A man named Tom Thompson (no relation to the Group of Seven painter) maintained what passed for roads in the Nadina area. One winter's night, when the temperature dipped to -60 Fahrenheit, he sought refuge at the Gale store.</p><p>Frank's father, an eccentric fellow known to all as \"Old Man Gale,\" gave Thompson a room in the store. The road worker remarked later that while the bedsheets were clean, Old Man Gale did not provide his lodger with any blankets. Thompson almost froze to death. It was, he said, so cold in the building the following morning that his host cooked had to wear mitts while cooking breakfast.</p><p>The community at Nadina continued to grow. Settlers eventually got around to building a bridge at the west end of Francois Lake, but the lake itself was the most reliable transportation route. By March 15, 1928, there were so many boats using the west end of Francois Lake between April and December that Frank urged the Burns Lake Board of Trade to lobby for the establishment of several wharves in the area. At least one senior level of government felt the request was warranted, because a new government wharf was built not far from the Gale store.</p><p>The fledgling community narrowly escaped disaster in June 1932, when a forest fire swept through the area, but residents from as far away as Wistaria came to the rescue.</p><p>\"District Forester Parlow and Forest Ranger Pedley put in a strenuous time fighting the Owen Lake fire when it swept into the Nadina River settlement,\" Sidney Godwin wrote in the Observer, Burns Lake's weekly newspaper. \"Mr. Parlow came in to Burns Lake at the week end exhausted from unremitting toil and lack of sleep. He is loud in his praise of the Wistaria residents, including Arthur Shelford and Pete Kerr, who came for many miles and offered their cooperation in the fight to save Frank Gale's store buildings and stock, and the Nadina settlement. Had it not been for their timely arrival, willing work, and direction of the wind, the Nadina River settlement would have been completely wiped out.\"</p><p>Nadina survived the fire, but not the Great Depression. Desperate for work, many residents moved away. The post office closed, and eventually the store and school did, too. Frank Gale and his family were among the last to leave; they sold their property to a man named Carl Osborne and moved to Victoria. Their former home and store burned to the ground on November 8, 1947, and were not rebuilt.</p><p>Today, Frank Gale's stone chimney and a few pilings in Francois Lake (vestiges of the government wharf) mark the site of what was once the thriving community of Nadina. Both are visible from Ootsa-Nadina Road, which was swept by wildfire again in 2018.</p><p>\u00a9 2021 Michael Riis-Christianson and the Lakes District Museum Society</p><p>Copyright 2022 Burns Lake Lakes District News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BURNSL-news20220921PLD4374255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BURNSL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66F9-YY31-JD2C-J3CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438230</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Kalmakoff</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Doukhobor Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood at Grand Forks is probably best historically known for its religious pacifism, large brick communal homes, and once-vast fruit orchards. Less recognized, but also important, are the many agricultural and industrial enterprises it established. Last week we started examining the Doukhobor agro-industrial complex created west of the city from 1909 to 1939, and its contribution to the growth and development of the Kettle Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sawmill In 1909, the Community erected a sawmill with which to manufacture rough lumber for building their homes and barns. Operated for the Doukhobors\u2019 own use, it was a small portable sawmill with a capacity of 10,000 board-feet per day, powered by a self-propelled steam engine. There was no planer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was originally located below Village No. 5 (Hremakin village) near Saddle Mountain along present-day York Road. Logs cut along the north bank of the Kettle River and south foot of Saddle Mountain were brought to the mill on horse-drawn dollies or sleighs (in winter).</p><p>When the supply of logs was exhausted in one place, the sawmill was moved to another location. By 1918, it was relocated north adjacent the Community brickworks. There, it milled logs cut from the west and north foot of Saddle Mountain, east foot of Eagle and Hardy Mountains, and south foot of Spencer Hill.</p><p>During this time, the Grand Forks Community also maintained commercial logging, pole-cutting and sawmill camps at Cedar Creek on the North Fork (1923-1925), Myers Creek near Midway (1924-1927) and Nelse Creek near Rock Creek (1926).</p><p>In 1927, the Community sawmill operation was greatly expanded and relocated along July Creek at Village No. 10 (Horkoff village) near present-day Gibbs Creek Road. It operated as a 35,000 board-feet-per-day facility and manufactured lumber for commercial sale from the Community\u2019s timber lots along July Creek. Much of the output was shipped south to the United States. It produced upwards of two million board-feet annually and had an adjacent planning mill, pole-making operation and box factory.</p><p>After 12 years of operation, having survived an arson attempt in August 1931 and the July Creek Forest Fire of August 1934, it was destroyed by incendiarism in October 1939 at a loss of $30,000.</p><p>Flour Mill In 1910, the Community established a stone grist mill to grind their wheat into flour. Operated for their own use, it had a capacity of 100 bushels of flour per day. Beside it stood a 10,000-bushel granary for storing wheat prior to milling. It was located beside Village No. 5 (Kootnikoff village).</p><p>The Doukhobor flour-milling process can be described as follows:a pair of large millstones was used as the grinding mechanism. The bottom or bed stone was fixed into position, while the upper or runner stone rotated above it. Motive power from a stationary steam engine was directed to the runner stone by a shaft which went through its middle and turned it. Wheat was fed from a chute above between the stones, where it was ground into flour collected in a hopper below. The distance between millstones could be adjusted to vary flour coarseness. The bread made of this flour was dark but very healthy.</p><p>In 1917, the production of linseed oil was started at the flour mill. Flax or linseed was mechanically pressed to produce cooking oil. A seed-cleaning plant was also added during this period.</p><p>In 1930, the Community flour mill was shut down. Six years later, in 1936, an arson attempt wiped out surrounding buildings, but the flour mill building itself survived because of its laminated wood. Another arson attempt in May 1946 destroyed a barn and implement shed but the mill remained undamaged.</p><p>Beginning in 1962, the flour mill was retrofitted as an electric hammer mill by the Doukhobor Milling Heritage Society and reopened in May 1964. The new, modern process created a cleaner, more refined product and could handle a higher volume of wheat processing up to 200 pounds an hour. It was sold throughout the Kootenay-Boundary as the famous Pride of the Valley flour.</p><p>Today the flour mill still stands on Mill Road, named after it. It is jointly managed by the Doukhobor Milling Heritage Society and Boundary Museum Society and continues to mill grain on demand.</p><p>Fruit Packing Houses In order to process fruit from their orchards as they came into bearing, the Community built a large packing house in 1912. Located at Village No. 3 (Vanjoff village) along present-day Hardy Mountain Road, it was a two-storey, 100-by 30-foot wood-frame structure with concrete basement and gable roof. It had a fruit box-making plant on the second floor.</p><p>Large and small fruit grown in the colony arrived by wagonload to the packing house. There, it was received, unloaded, and weighed. It was then turned out on tables, graded and sorted, culling the bruised, spoilt or small fruit aside, and packed into boxes. The packed fruit was stored in the basement until shipment. It was shipped from the adjacent Great Northern VV&amp;E Phoenix Branch at Copper Junction.</p><p>The packing houses also processed Community-grown vegetables for outside markets, which were grown in massive quantities. In 1912 alone, the Community sold 8,000 100-pound sacks of potatoes from Grand Forks.</p><p>By 1919, the Community\u2019s orchards were coming into full bearing and a second fruit packing house was built. Located south of the Community brickworks at the corner of present-day Reservoir and Canning Roads, it was a two-storey, 100-by 60-foot wood-frame structure with elevator lifts, concrete basement and monitor-style roof. As there was no adjacent railway, fruit packs were hauled to the Community warehouses in Columbia Flats for shipping.</p><p>By 1920, the Community packing houses were shipping 120-130 railcar-loads of fruit annually \u2013 apples, pears, plums and prunes as well as strawberries, raspberries, currants and gooseberries \u2013 to outside markets. This included 50 carloads of Italian prunes alone.</p><p>Tomato Cannery In August 1912, the Doukhobors installed a small fruit and vegetable cannery at Grand Forks for their own use. Then in 1924, the Community erected a large, commercial-scale tomato canning plant beside their Community flour mill. It was the first cannery established at Grand Forks.</p><p>Operated as the Kootenay-Columbia Preserving Works, large volumes of tomatoes harvested from the Community fields were brought to the plant, where they were cleaned and blanched in large copper kettles filled with boiling water, then plunged into smaller copper pots filled with cold water, then finally poured into sterilized 28-ounce cans, topped with water and sealed. Sold under the K.C. Brand label, they were marketed across Western Canada. It operated until 1936, when it was destroyed by arson.</p><p>Fruit Evaporator In 1924, the Community erected a commercial-scale fruit evaporating plant beside their flour mill \u2013 the first permanent facility of its kind at Grand Forks. Small fruit and berries picked from the Community fields were brought to the plant. Once dehydrated, fruit was preserved at one-tenth of its original weight. In its first year of operation, some 12,000 pounds of small fruit and berries was dehydrated into 1,200 pounds of dried fruit. The dried fruit could be stored for extended lengths of time without spoilage.</p><p>Most of the dehydrated fruit was sent to the Kootenay-Columbia Preserving Works jam factory in Brilliant. Once it arrived, it was soaked in water for several hours, after which it returned to practically its original state with all its colour and nutrients retained. It was then processed into jam. The plant operated until 1936, when it was destroyed by incendiarism.</p><p>Jam Factory As early as 1912 and again in 1923-24 and 1927-28, the Community proposed building a jam factory at Grand Forks to serve its orchards there. However, each time, the Community elected instead to focus on developing and expanding its Brilliant jam factory. It was not until 1935 that the Doukhobors established a local jammery \u2013 the first ever in Grand Forks.</p><p>In spring 1935, the existing fruit packing house near the brick factory was retrofitted as a jam plant. A brick veneer was added to the building exterior. Twelve steam-activated jam-making kettles, ordered from England, were installed on the upper floor. Fruit and vegetable canning equipment was also ordered. It had a production capacity of 12 tons of jam per day.</p><p>Adjacent to the north, a two-storey, brick 40-by 36-foot boiler house with concrete foundation and monitor-style roof was built to supply steam power to the jam plant. A 30-foot high water tower was erected nearby to supply water to the boilers. An adjacent wood lot was stocked with cordwood, slabs and board ends from the Community sawmill to fire the boilers.</p><p>Over the first two weeks of August 1935, considerable quantities of strawberries, raspberries, cherries and other small fruit arrived at the new plant from the Community fields and from other Grand Forks fruit growers under contract. It was sorted and stored in the basement of the jam plant.</p><p>When production began, the fruit was brought to the main floor, where it was cleaned, peeled, de-cored/de-stoned, then cut into pieces and/or crushed. It was then taken to the second floor, where equal portions of fruit pulp and sugar were placed in each large copper kettle and cooked for 15 minutes while continually stirred. Once cooked, the kettles were emptied into smaller copper pots and wheeled over to long cooling trays filled with cold water, in which they were placed. As the jam cooled, it received a final skimming, and was then ladled by hand into sterilized cans and sealed.</p><p>The jammery operated roughly 10 days, producing 194,250 pounds of jam. However, on Aug. 17, 1935, the jam plant building burned to the ground in an incendiary blaze. It was a devastating blow to the Community with $100,000 in losses, including $40,000 of jam that was not shipped to market because of a delay in receiving jam tin labels from the printer. The arsonists were never brought to justice.</p><p>The jam factory boiler house still stands, having been converted, along with adjacent former Community buildings, into a family home in 1979. It is located on Canning Road, named after the jam factory.</p><p>Warehouses Railway facilities played an important role in Community operations, both for receiving incoming goods and supplies purchased from Eastern Canadian manufacturers, and for shipping outgoing agricultural and industrial commodities (bricks, lumber products, fruit and preserves) to market. This required the establishment of Community warehouses for storing goods before their internal distribution or outside export, as the case was.</p><p>In circa 1912, the Community built a two-storey, 45 by 60 foot warehouse near the Great Northern Weston station in Columbia Flats, near present-day Northfork Franklin Road. It was used for the shipping of produce to points on the Great Northern VV&amp;E line. In about 1923, it was sold following the dismantling of the Weston station yards.</p><p>In 1912-13, the Community built a two-storey brick 75 by 50 foot warehouse with concrete basement and elevator lift near the Canadian Pacific west end station in Columbia Flats on present-day Donaldson Avenue. The basement was used for fruit cold storage, the main floor for storing dry goods, while the upper floor was divided into living quarters and offices for the Community branch manager. In 1927, the main floor was converted into a retail store open to the public.</p><p>The Community store warehouse operated for 27 years. In 1940, it was purchased by Peter S. Polonicoff and run as Polonicoff \u2019s Store until its closure in 1984. Today the building stands in good structural condition and has been converted into two heritage-style apartments.</p><p>Conclusion In July 1936, the Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood Ltd.declared bankruptcy during the height of the Great Depression. In June 1937 and May 1938 it was placed under receivership by creditors who foreclosed upon the company and its property valuated at $4,000,000 for a total debt of $360,580.64. Thus ended the largest agro-industrial enterprise ever undertaken in the Boundary and the largest experiment in communal living ever attempted in North America.</p><p>Enduring to this day is the Doukhobor example of bringing forth the bounty of the land, with the help of fertile valley soil and a moderate climate, fueled by the desire to work together in community towards a common purpose.

(CSE: CAVU) (FSE: 8NQ) (\"CAVU\" or the \"Company\"), reports that approximately 250 meters has been drilled in 3 holes on the Hopper Copper-Gold Project in Yukon prior to a temporary pause in drilling due to a posed safety risk to personnel from a forest fire in the area. The crew has been temporarily moved to Whitehorse, Yukon and the Company expects the drilling program to commence shortly after receiving clearance from the local authorities. The Hopper Property is in the traditional territory of the Champagne Aishihik First Nations.  </p><p><br/>Highlights: 250 meters of diamond drilling has been completed The EM anomaly that was targeted with hole 1 - 3 is associated with semi-massive sulphidesFirst skarn horizon was intersected from 57 to 66.8m in hole HOP21-DDH-01 The Franklin skarn in hole 1 is mineralized over 5.8m ( &lt;1% to 20% copper sulphides1) The Franklin skarn in hole 1 contains up to 8% copper sulphides over approximately 2m from 63.5 - 65.5m \"We are nearing the completion of the first three holes in the Franklin skarn,\" stated Jaap Verbaas, CEO of CAVU. \"On the evening of July 17, one of our crew spotted a forest fire in the vicinity of our camp. After we assessed the size and risk posed by the fire to our crew, the decision was made to move our personnel to Whitehorse. The fire has so far not affected CAVU's personnel, camp, or equipment. Neither CAVU personnel nor the Company's contractors were involved in starting the fire and the Company is working with local authorities to identify its source and origin. Drilling activities have been temporarily paused as we wait for approval and guidance from the Yukon Fire department to resume our drilling program safely. We are currently on standby and eager to get back to site.\"  <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/7764/90689_d68e4c57b40eba16_001full.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/7764/90689_d68e4c57b40eba16_001full.jpg</url><br/>Figure 1.

After we assessed the size and risk posed by the fire to our crew, the decision was made to move our personnel to Whitehorse. The fire has so far not affected CAVU's personnel, camp, or equipment. Neither CAVU personnel nor the Company's contractors were involved in starting the fire and the Company is working with local authorities to identify its source and origin. Drilling activities have been temporarily paused as we wait for approval and guidance from the Yukon Fire department to resume our drilling program safely. We are currently on standby and eager to get back to site.\"</p><p>Figure 1.

I am truly at a loss for words over the devastation wreaked on our beautiful town of Lytton, as well as the tragic loss of life. People across the province are heartbroken for residents of Lytton who have lost everything.</p><p>I have spent the past few weeks traveling around the Fraser-Nicola region, and amidst the feelings of loss and grief, I was also met with an incredible feeling of hope when I saw how British Columbians and Canadians have come together to support those in need. The incredible work of our firefighters, emergency responders, local officials, and of course our many volunteers cannot be understated.</p><p>Many of our local farmers who have been working the land for generations have offered invaluable insight for our recovery, and will be an essential voice at the table for future forest fire prevention. Our region is also blessed to be home to many knowledgeable First Nations communities who have called this land home for thousands of years. Their local wisdom and guidance have been critical for our local efforts. In our time of need, it is their tireless advocacy and actions that are keeping us safe and readying us for the difficult recovery process.</p><p>As your MLA, I will continue to engage with local leaders across the region to hear their concerns and ensure the province offers Lytton and all rural communities the support they need to stay protected and make a full recovery.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASHCCJ-news20210715PPIA0002010117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASHCCJ2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6350-M6K1-F0HF-854M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"285\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

In the village of Bemposta, residents used garden hoses to spray their lawns and roofs in hopes they could save them from the raging wall of red flames that approached through the wooden hills late Wednesday.</p><p>\u201cIt began spreading towards that way, the wind was blowing that way towards the mountain,\u201d said 88-year-old Antonio Carmo Pereira, while pointing to the flames on the outskirts of his village. \u201cIn a few minutes I couldn\u2019t see anything, just smoke.\"</p><p>\u201c(It\u2019s) dangerous, yes. It\u2019s surrounding all the houses,\u201d he said. \u201cI am afraid, but where can I go? Jump into a water tank? Let me stay here and look.\u201d</p><p>More than 800 firefighters were still fighting blazes in the Leiria district, where Bemposta is located, on Thursday.</p><p>Temperatures in the interior of the Atlantic country were forecast to hit 44 C (111 F) as hot, dry air blown in from Africa lingers over the western edge of the Iberian Peninsula. In June, 96% of Portugal was classified as being in either in \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d drought. </p><p>The hot air and parched ground, combined with strong winds, has created the perfect cocktail for severe wildfires.</p><p>Portuguese Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa's government on Thursday extended a state of alert for wildfires until Sunday due to high temperatures. The week-long alert was originally to run until Friday. The Portuguese government has temporarily barred public access to forests deemed to be at special risk, banned the use of farm machinery and outlawed fireworks.</p><p>Costa said firefighters had to respond to 200 different blazes Wednesday and pleaded for his fellow citizens to take extra care when in the countryside.</p><p>\u201cMore than ever, we are the ones who must be extremely careful,\u201d Costa said. \u201cFrom a small act of carelessness a great tragedy can be born.\u201d</p><p>About 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) have been scorched this week in Portugal, according to the Civil Protection Agency. About 865 people had to evacuate their homes over the past week, although many had returned by Thursday. More than 30 homes and other buildings have been damaged.</p><p>Civil Protection commander Andr\u00e9 Fernandes said 160 people, including at least 70 firefighters, have been injured so far, but there are no confirmed fatalities from the fires in Portugal. Four people, including two firefighters, were seriously injured. Portugal has improved its fire safety since wildfires killed more than 100 people in 2017.</p><p>The European Union has urged member states to prepare for wildfires this summer as the continent faces another extreme weather shift that scientists say is being triggered by climate change.</p><p>In central Hungary, firefighters discovered a body Thursday where a small forest fire had burned overnight. It was found buried under the collapsed roof of a burned farmhouse near the village of Soltszentimre.</p><p>Spain was still combating a fire started by a lightning strike on Monday in the west-central Las Hurdes area that has consumed about 3,500 hectares (8,600 acres). Temperatures in many parts of Spain have been topping the 40 C (104 F) mark for several days and are expected to stay high until next week.</p><p>In France, two fires raged out of control in the region around Bordeaux in southwest France for a third consecutive day, despite the efforts of 1,000 firefighters and water-dumping planes to contain them.</p><p>The fires have destroyed more than 3,850 hectares (9,500 acres) of forest and grassland, the regional emergency said. It said firefighters struggled to contain the fire because of high winds and the difficulty of accessing the heart of the fires. More than 6,000 people have been evacuated from French campgrounds and villages in recent days.</p><p>___</p><p>Joseph Wilson reported from Barcelona, Spain.

The effects of climate change have even forced the relocation of the British Parliament to Newcastle and the American government to Alaska. But then the Blink occurs - a name given to the sudden disappearance of the Sun. This truly does seem like the end of things. But then, just as quickly as the Sun left, it comes back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Obviously some very powerful forces are at work, which the global brain trusts take to calling Galaxias. It seems the removal of the Sun is a message that's been sent to us, though the meaning of that message is obscure and the nature of Earth's response much debated by the scientific bureaucracies in China and the West.</p><p>This makes Stephen Baxter's new novel a bit talky in places, but the focus on a trio of friends and the backdrop of speculative \"hard\" SF on a grand scale combine to make \"Galaxias\" an engaging enough cosmic mystery story, with an ending that opens up in a big way.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lost in Time</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By A.G. Riddle</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Head of Zeus, 416 pages, $33.95</emphasis></p><p>Even for veteran SF readers used to creative new ways of dealing with crime - like convicts having their memories wiped, or transported to penal colonies on other planets - the idea of criminals being sent back in time hundreds of millions of years so that they can fight it out with dinosaurs in an alternative Earth timeline may seem a bit of a stretch.</p><p>Nevertheless, that's the premise here as Sam Anderson, one of the scientists who developed the patented Absolom time-travel technology, is convicted of the murder of a colleague he'd been dating and then jettisoned to dinosaur-land. As he struggles to survive Triassic Park, his daughter Adeline tries to figure out who framed him back here on Earth Prime, while also working with the other Absolom scientists to develop a machine that can bring her dad back.</p><p>\"Lost in Time\" is obviously high-concept Hollywood fluff, but if you're looking for a bubble-gum page-turner with lots of silly action, cliff-hangers, and plot twists it's hard to beat a time-travel murder mystery with dinosaurs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Station Eternity</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By Mur Lafferty</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ace, 464 pages, $23.00</emphasis></p><p>Mallory Viridian isn't the kind of person you want to get too close to. She's the carrier of a weird kind of \"murder virus,\" which means that wherever she goes someone nearby ends up being killed.</p><p>Such a fatal penumbra leads Mallory to become a mystery writer. She's also the perfect host for a new series by Mur Lafferty (\"The Midsolar Murders\"), of which \"Station Eternity\" is the first volume.</p><p>Aware of her dangerous condition, Mallory takes a lonely, and lowly, job at the sentient space station Eternity, where she is one of only a few humans on board. She figures this should keep the death rate manageable, but her plans for self-quarantine go out the window when a shuttle of visitors arrives at Eternity, with many of its passengers already dead. It seems murder has followed Mallory into space. Now, as the bodies start to pile up, she's in charge of finding out what's going on.</p><p>It's a good mystery, presented in a lighthearted way, but the real treats here are the fascinating aliens, including a swarm of wasp-like creatures called the Sundry and a race of rock creatures known as Gneiss. Luckily for Mallory they seem to like her, as she'll need all the help she can get.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tomorrow's Parties: Life in the Anthropocene</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ed. by Jonathan Strahan</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MIT Press, 215 pages, $25.95</emphasis></p><p>In recent years, perhaps feeling that established literary genres aren't already vague enough, some people have adopted the term \"speculative fiction\" as an alternative to \"science fiction.\" Whatever the new label's merits, it's fair to say that some SF is more geared toward an imaginative sort of forecasting of what the future might actually have in store, which is the direction taken by the stories collected in the series of anthologies put out by MIT Press that started out as Twelve Tomorrows and of which Tomorrow's Parties is the latest instalment.</p><p>Despite the subtitle here, Tomorrow's Parties isn't just what's come to be called CliFi (climate-change SF). The effects of climate disaster are included, and an introductory interview with CliFi master Kim Stanley Robinson addresses the real challenge of the Anthropocene, but otherwise what we get is just a great lineup of stories that survey the wide range of concerns that today's SF writers have about the future.

These airports also support essential air services including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response.</p><p>The Minister of Rural Economic Development, the Honourable Gudie Hutchings, on behalf of the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, today announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at local and regional airports in Newfoundland and Labrador.</p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program, three airports in Newfoundland and Labrador will receive over $1.4 million for safety-related projects and equipment that will help maintainsafe airport operations for passengers, crews and airport workers. The airports receiving funding are:</p><p>Deer Lake</p><p> $205,000 to purchase a grader</p><p>Gander</p><p> $205,000 to purchase a grader</p><p>Stephenville</p><p> $205,000 to purchase a grader</p><p>This funding is in addition to the more than $8 million announced under the program in May 2021 to support safety-related projects at the Churchill Falls, Deer Lake, Gander, and Stephenville airports.</p><p>Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over$1.2 billion for 1,215 projects at 199 local, regional and National Airports System airports across the country. Funded projects include runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles and installing wildlife control fencing.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"Local and regional airports play an integral role in Canada's transportation system and are important hubs for the communities they serve. This funding will help ensure continued safe and reliable airport operations for residents, many of whom depend on their local airport not only for personal and business travel, but also for community resupply of essential goods as well as access to routine and emergency medical care in larger centres.\"</p><p>The Honourable Gudie HutchingsMinister of Rural Economic Development</p><p>\"The pandemic highlighted the important role Canada's local and regional airports play in our country's economy, and in sustaining the social and economic well-being of our communities. In addition to supporting personal travel, local and regional airports are key connectors for business, health care, social services, and emerging resource development sectors. These investments will improve access to safe, reliable and efficient air transportation options, and will help us deliver our commitment to build safer, healthier and stronger communities as Canada recovers from the pandemic.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar AlghabraMinister of Transport</p><p>Quick Facts</p><p> $205,000 to purchase a grader</p><p>Associated Link</p><p> $205,000 to purchase a grader</p><p>Transport Canada is online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tc.gc.ca\">www.tc.gc.ca</url>.

The caller said that the giant cedar on First Street near Jubilee was going to be cut down as the developer\u2019s arborist claims it\u2019s hollow inside. The new tree bylaw allows for large trees to be removed if they are considered hazardous.</p><p>If in fact it is actually hollow, I don\u2019t believe that necessarily constitutes a danger. The lifeblood of a tree flows through the cambium which is in the outside layer just inside the bark.</p><p>Bamboo,which can be stronger than steel, is hollow. In many parts of the world bamboo is used for scaffolding for tall building construction. One of the largest trees in Western Australia is the red tingle. The inside of these trees is more flammable than the outside and after a forest fire all that often remains is the shell of the trunk plus the canopy. I went inside one that resembled a cathedral with a black, vaulted ceiling. They continue to thrive for decades.</p><p>The cedar on First has already been topped so there is no chance of it blowing over. It will just require selective pruning periodically to manage the weight on the lateral limbs.</p><p>Before developers start to build they like a clean slate. All vegetation and soil are removed. When the building nears completion, if you are curious as to where the gardens will go, just watch where all the construction rubble gets dumped. That will be the garden. I\u2019ve observed this numerous times and once again after the condo was built on Second Street a few years ago. The landscaper was planting maple trees directly on top of chunks of asphalt and concrete in about 10 inches of soil. After taking photos I questioned whether he felt those trees would prosper. He seemed perplexed and insulted that I would question his planting technique. He thought briefly, smiled and then cordially replied. \u201cDon\u2019t worry sir, I\u2019m only planting trees with short roots.\u201d According to Peter Dinter, on his CBC gardening program, the average lifespan for newly planted trees in harsh urban environments is eight years.</p><p>The elderly are very vulnerable in our culture. Be it trees, buildings or people. The future of this magnificent arboreal giant should be respectfully safeguarded. Alas, I fear that it will be gone by the time I return to Duncan.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.

Education and awareness campaigns may be effective in reducing the discharge of fireworks.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Saturday, June 10, 2023, 17 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> (NEW: JUNE, 5, 2023) Atwater Avenue between Cawthra Road and Alexandra Avenue in Ward 1<br/><br/> Cherry Post Drive, between Camilla Road and Corsair Road in Ward 7.

No casualties have been reported so far from the blaze, which has consumed a total of 1,260 hectares so far. <br/>A local man was under investigation for accidentally starting the fire when a metal part of his trailer touched the road, sending off sparks that ignited the dried vegetation. <br/>To limit such risks in eastern France, police said on Saturday they were banning entry to all but residents in most forests in the Bas-Rhin region near the German border. <br/>Meanwhile in the southwestern Gironde region around Bordeaux, a huge fire that had flared on Tuesday was under control after rain fell overnight, a senior official said. <br/>'The night was favourable to us, since as you know, we had rain and very little wind. The fire is now contained,' Ronan Leaustic, deputy prefect of Arcachon commune, told reporters on Sunday. <br/>He added that 8,000 residents forced to evacuate could now return home. <br/>There was further relief after a fire in the eastern department of Jura that destroyed over 1,000 hecatres was brought under control. <br/>- Lower temperatures, rain forecast - <br/>Arnaud Mendousse, of Gironde fire and rescue, said earlier there had been between 10 and 30 mm of rain in the region but on 'terrain that is extremely dry'. <br/>'We know that this offers a respite but does not signify an end to the fight. We know that if it does not rain in the next 48 to 72 hours the risk will increase considerably.' <br/>He said the humidity level has gone up and the temperature was relatively low at around 25 degrees Celsius, (77 degrees Fahrenheit) but warned: 'The fire is not completely out and the soil remains extremely hot.' <br/>Meteo France was forecasting lower temperatures and rain and thunderstorms for most of the country on Sunday. <br/>In the northwest, in the legendary Broceliande forest in region of Brittany \u2014 where King Arthur roamed and where wildfires are normally rare \u2014 a fire was contained after rain fell overnight, but remained under watch after devastating 400 hectares, officials said. <br/>EU members including Germany, Poland, Austria and Romania have sent reinforcement to France to help battle blazes and several water-bombing planes from the European Union fleet have also joined firefighting efforts. <br/>burs/raz/har <br/><url

The gist of the story was that more powerful storms are here to stay and the power grid needs an upgrade. Just in case you think this is hyperbole, consider that, since 2000, the number of major system disturbances has octupled,  the number of disturbances that led to a loss of 100 MW or more has quadrupled; and the number of disturbances affecting 100,000 or more customers has also quadrupled. And this is not because consumers are using so much more electricity. But instead, operating conditions have changed but the electrical grid has not. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The AP's reporters quoted many experts who said that the power grid needed more investment on transmission and distribution assets. Well, that might help, for sure. But looking at that record, its variability and upward trend, maybe the question should be: should more money go to the power grid? What have the power grid owners and operators been doing for the last two decades to prepare for events predicted decades ago? </p><p>If power costs keep rising while reliability issues remain, customers who need digitally reliable power may choose to forgo utility solutions and invest in self generation and storage. The declining cost of renewables and batteries make that transition even easier from a financial perspective. Will distributed reliability become cheaper than grid reliability? What we're really asking here, \"Is long distance power transmission even feasible through vast, fire prone areas.?\" When the electrical grid was originally designed and built this wasn't a problem. It would be an imprudent utility that was committed to rebuilding its transmission lines every year only to have them burned down again in a forest fire.  </p><p>This leads us to the politically charged question of energy equity. Do we as a society continue to permit or encourage wealthier individuals and corporations, those who can afford to put in expensive self generation and power storage equipment, to do so?  Who gets left in the dark, the cold or the heat in summer--obviously those who can't afford to make significant behind the meter investments. </p><p>These conversations about grid reliability are also occurring against a backdrop of the \"electrify everything\" movement starting obviously with the transportation sector. This means even greater demands on the grid from increasing numbers of electric vehicle owners. Lengthy power outages, if they occur, will now also begin to jeopardize transportation as vehicle batteries can't recharge. We're facing a paradox with respect to grid based electric power. As a society we want to electrify as many sectors of the economy as possible for human health and other environmental benefits. However, we can't \"electrify everything\" with a power grid that is increasingly unreliable. </p><p>There was an old slogan from the environmental movement, \"small is beautiful.\" We think this may have to be adopted as the new mantra for power transmission designers. Vast sections of the country are becoming increasingly inhospitable for relatively fragile power transmission systems due to wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes and the line. And yes we can bury all these lines at enormous expense. But perhaps we should begin to entertain the alternative, namely that locally produced power, moving relatively short distances can enhance reliability without an undue cost burden. </p><p>By Leonard Hyman and William Tilles for Oilprice.com </p><p>COMTEX_405702173/2559/2022-04-14T09:57:52</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BAYSTR-405702173</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BAYSTR2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6575-1X81-JC7J-41JR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">476185</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><timeReceived>9:57 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Comtex News Network, Inc.

Police are still looking for some of the perpetrators.</p><p>Cyprus</p><p>Four dead in massive forest fire</p><p>Cyprus search crews discovered four charred bodies outside a fire-swept mountain village on Sunday in what the interior minister called the \"most destructive\" blaze in the eastern Mediterranean island nation's history. Interior Minister Nicos Nouris said Civil Defense volunteers discovered the remains just outside the village of Odou on the southern edge of the Troodos mountain range. The blaze, which began Saturday outside the village of Arakapas, spread quickly amid strong winds and forced the evacuation of at least eight mountain villages, destroying homes and scorching 55 square kilometres of pine forest and orchards.</p><p>United Kingdom</p><p>England eyes end to mask requirements</p><p>England may soon abandon legal requirements for wearing masks, a government minister said Sunday as the nation waits for U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce plans for easing COVID-19 measures. Johnson is expected in the next few days to update England on \"freedom day\" - the plan to scrap the remaining restrictions on business and social interaction on July 19. British media widely reported that many requirements, including mask wearing, would also end. Some doctors have expressed concern about further easing of restrictions as infection rates rise, largely because of the more transmissible Delta variant.</p><p>News services</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-news20210705TRK2021070561456653</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:632S-JC71-F197-506W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"288\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Interior Minister Nicos Nouris said Civil Defense volunteers discovered the remains just outside the village of Odou on the southern edge of the Troodos mountain range. The blaze, which began Saturday outside the village of Arakapas, spread quickly amid strong winds and forced the evacuation of at least eight mountain villages, destroying homes and scorching 55 square kilometres of pine forest and orchards.</p><p>United Kingdom</p><p>England eyes end to mask requirements</p><p>England may soon abandon legal requirements for wearing masks, a government minister said Sunday as the nation waits for U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce plans for easing COVID-19 measures. Johnson is expected in the next few days to update England on \"freedom day\" - the plan to scrap the remaining restrictions on business and social interaction on July 19. British media widely reported that many requirements, including mask wearing, would also end. Some doctors have expressed concern about further easing of restrictions as infection rates rise, largely because of the more transmissible Delta variant.</p><p>News services</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-news20210705TPE2021070561456950</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:632S-JC71-F197-504D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"288\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 5, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRL9</classCode><className>FACE MASK MANDATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

Last year, the village received almost 90 mm.</p><p>Many parts of the province had an extremely dry May. After seeing its driest March on record this year, Kelowna just experienced its driest May to date as well.</p><p>That month, the city only saw 3.5 mm of rain. Typically it would get 40.2 mm.</p><p>Erven said the rest of June for Nakusp will be a rollercoaster of warm and cool weather, with temperatures heating up locally by July and August to above normal.</p><p>Weather Network chief meteorologist Chris Scott said B.C. could be at a high risk for forest fires this summer. However, he predicts the northern parts of the province could have higher-than-normal levels of precipitation.</p><p>Regardless, June is typically the wettest month in this part of Canada, he noted, and if that pattern continues this year it will help diminish the forest fire risk for the summer.</p><p>While flowers are blooming in Nakusp, the surrounding peaks are still cloaked in white. In Glacier National Park at the Fidelity weather station (1,905 metres elevation), the snowpack depth was 253 centimetres on June 1.
