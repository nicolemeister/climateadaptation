After years of his government's uncontrolled spending, massive deficits and accumulated debt, we now have his carbon tax. While countries like China, Russia, India and others continue to burn fossil fuels unabated, Trudeau punishes Canadians financially in an effort to reduce Canada's minuscule carbon pollution. I guess he believes \"the right things\" include pushing most Canadians further toward poverty.</p><p><br/><br/> When the next federal election comes around in 2025, I think Mr. Trudeau will find out average Canadians are also thinking about what's best for them now and in the future. He will find out those thoughts don't include continuing with a self-serving, ethics challenged, corrupt, fiscally incompetent, silver-spoon-sucking Justin Trudeau. Never mind a walk in the snow, the nearest exit will do just fine.<br/><br/> Cameron Stringer, Hamilton<br/><br/> Poilievre continues<br/><br/> to mislead Canadians<br/><br/> Why are people against the carbon levy? One word: Poilievre. He has misled Canadians from Day 1 on this policy. He would never tell Canadians that if he was to \"axe the tax\" they would have less money in their pockets in spite of the fact that four out of five Canadians find themselves benefiting financially from the Liberals' \"cash for carbon\" rebate. This policy is all about our changing climate, which Pierre Poilievre and his Conservative peers can't seem to bring themselves to acknowledge, in spite of the fact that an early forest fire season and prairie drought are already upon us. Polling is currently against the Liberals and so premiers are licking their chops looking for votes, climate change be damned. How pathetic and cynical. Where is Poilievre on climate change, corporate profits and high interest rates when it comes to affordability? Nowhere to be found. He chooses to play politics and take money out of Canadians' pockets; money put there by the Liberals \"cash for carbon\" rebate. Not a leader for difficult times.<br/><br/> Don Courtnage, Ancaster<br/><br/> Get tough on criminals<br/><br/> Re: Rise in vehicle thefts: How well-organized thieves exploit tech to steal cars (Feb. 20)<br/><br/> The situation is out of control. These bandits are more brazen than ever before and can score vast sums of money for their efforts without serious repercussions. They get caught, get out on bail and steal more vehicles.<br/><br/> First off, our legal system has to change. No more Mr. Nice Guy. When caught, these criminals should be incarcerated (no bail, please) until the issue is settled in court. Clean up the court backlog. <br/><br/> There is technology out there to speed things up. There will be those who strongly oppose this based on Charter rights. What about the rights of all the victims? Take it one step further. Make them pay for their lodgings and court expenses. Confiscate all their assets as collateral. Premier Doug Ford wants to build more jails. I like it.<br/><br/> A lot of stolen vehicles exit Canada via shipping container to offshore destinations. Why aren't the contents scrutinized more? With all this \"heat\" applied, sooner or later this illegal undertaking will crumble. This proposal can also be used in drug and human trafficking cases as well. Time to roll up our sleeves and get tough.<br/><br/> Sinclair Tyios, Burlington<br/><br/> Downtown is a mess<br/><br/> Re: 19-year-old dead after brazen daytime shooting in downtown Hamilton (March 6)<br/><br/> So Mayor Andrea Horwath was \"shocked\" at the deadly lunch-hour shooting a block from city hall. Perhaps Ms. Horwath should get out of her faux-marble tower more often and walk the increasingly mean streets of downtown Hamilton.<br/><br/> It's a mess down there and the increasing incidents of violence, homelessness and drug use indicate things aren't getting any better any time soon.<br/><br/> The alcoves along the facade of the Fairclough building are havens for encampments and the reek of urine and garbage is sickening. To put it bluntly, madame mayor, your city is really beginning to stink.<br/><br/> Doug Foley, Hamilton<br/><br/> Workers should be able to get by without OT<br/><br/> Re: Cyberattack preventing overtime pay to City of Hamilton workers, say unions (March 12)<br/><br/> What a selfish comment and attitude by the union representing city workers regarding overtime pay. The city is not responsible for the cyberattack to its system and is trying to resolve the situation. <br/><br/> City workers are not paid minimum wages and should be able to survive without overtime  pay until such time as the situation is corrected. Simple solution: bank the overtime hours for now and you will be able to collect these overtime wages at a future date. The city has indicated that all payments owed will be reconciled at some point.<br/><br/> Kaz Matecki, Stoney Creek<br/><br/> Spend money on<br/><br/> housing, not LRT<br/><br/> Re: Metrolinx applies to expropriate 28 properties for Hamilton LRT (March 11)<br/><br/> It is hard to believe that during a time when people are finding it hard to find affordable housing we are eliminating it. Until the housing crisis in this city has improved, the last thing we should be doing is spending money on a light rail system that we don't need.<br/><br/> It seems like now that city council has made living in tents acceptable and normal they have forgotten about the homeless. This council needs to stop spending money senselessly and concentrate on curing the dire issues at hand, get people out of tents and not put more into them.<br/><br/> Diana MacKenzie, Hamilton<br/><br/> We need to ditch<br/><br/> plastic containers<br/><br/> If glass and metal, including aluminum, are 100 per cent recyclable and plastic can only be recycled three times, how come everything is now packaged in plastic? Even vegetable-based plastic can only be broken down by a special process, otherwise it's just the same as all other plastic polluting the environment forever.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Irene Hough, Hamilton <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2024031670938872</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BJV-BYV1-JDV5-F31V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"993\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

As more than 150 forest fires raged across the province, most of the community\u2019s residents had to evacuate due to the approaching flames.</p><p>The intensity of the blaze, which grounded water bombers, prompted Legault to warn that the village would be lost.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we lost control,\" Legault said on June 5. \"We are going to be obliged to let Clova burn.\" </p><p>Unbeknownst to the premier, the battle to save Clova was far from over.</p><p>Vincent was among a team of nine or so citizens who stayed behind to protect Clova, watering the edges of homes and roads for two consecutive nights, sometimes until 4:30 in the morning. At first their equipment was limited to an \"obsolete\" decades-old pump from the local fire department; later, a number of Quebec businesses stepped up with donations of water tanks, pumps and other modern equipment.</p><p>Quebec\u2019s forest fire protection agency corrected Legault shortly after he issued his warning, noting its firefighters were still battling the flames on the ground and by helicopter, even when its planes couldn\u2019t fly. </p><p>As the flames came within two kilometres of Clova, Vincent said his team had an evacuation plan in place, and he maintains the crisis \"looked worse from the outside.\" He said that by the time Legault said the town was burning down and he started getting panicked calls from residents who had evacuated, the worst had already passed.</p><p>\u00c9ric Chagnon, a city councillor for the city of La Tuque, whose sector includes Clova, said it was unfortunate that Legault wasn\u2019t better informed on the current conditions. </p><p>\u201cWhen you see a premier say, \u2018we\u2019re going to have to abandon Clova to save other places,\u2019 I didn\u2019t find that very respectful for the people who are there,\u201d he said in a recent interview.</p><p>Chagnon said that while the hamlet officially has just 36 residents, there are usually 100 to 200 people in town staying in the many cottages or working in the forest industry. There are also outdoor outfitters that offer fishing, hunting and snowmobile excursions to the many visiting tourists.</p><p>\"There\u2019s a lot of tourists, a lot of economy that circulates there.\u201d</p><p>Chagnon, who helped bring water tanks to Clova during the fires, says he feels the province needs to learn to better prepare so that villagers aren\u2019t \u201cleft to manage themselves\u201d during a fire.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not normal in a country like Quebec or Canada that we have an army, that we have a whole bunch of people, and that they aren\u2019t trained to go fight fires or help people during painful situations like this,\u201d he said. </p><p>He said that while the unprecedented fire situation was caused by an unusual combination of hot and dry weather, high winds and lightning strikes, it\u2019s clear that climate change means such extreme conditions are happening more frequently. </p><p>While none of Clova\u2019s primary residences were burned, several people lost their cottages, a situation Vincent said could have been avoided had the townspeople been given more resources. </p><p>\u201cThere are people who lost chalets because we weren\u2019t equipped to be able to help or do anything,\u201d he said. </p><p>The fires were also hard on the forest industry and on tourism operators, who had to shut down during their high season.</p><p>Olivier Brossard, owner of Caesar's North Camps in Clova, said that while he was lucky not to lose any cabins to the flames, the fires and the rules prohibiting forest activities meant he lost most of his income for the lucrative month of June.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve just been through two years of COVID where we had a very low occupancy in tourism, then we had these fires that hit us,\u201d he said in a phone interview, adding he and other outfitters hope to get help from the province.</p><p>Now, when Brossard flies his planes over the forest, he can see destroyed cottages and charred woodland.

It has grown into a planetwide event, known as World Rivers Day, held on the fourth Sunday of every September.

He was told it was. That time it was the clutch.  </p><p>\u201cIt was also warranty work and it is still out of service,\u201d Councillor John Epps said.  </p><p>Mayor Murphy said when the clutch imploded in the chamber, she was concerned. At that time, she said vehicles were called lemons for a reason.   \u201cI said at the time I hoped it wasn\u2019t a foreshadowing,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it was really smart to buy that extended warranty knowing now what we didn\u2019t necessarily know when we took ownership of it.\u201d </p><p>Coun. Patrick asked about the timeline to get it fixed. He was told the truck was in the garage for the whole time.   \u201cThe rad is in today,\u201d he said.  </p><p>Coun. Epps said he was told about the rad being broken by a ratepayer before he heard about it from the municipality.  </p><p>This is the second major issue for the truck, which was purchased new last year. The clutch went down on the truck after only 3,000 kilometres of township use. As a result, council decided to purchase an extended warranty for the vehicle at a previous meeting. </p><p> * * * * *  </p><p>Zadow Road tender awarded to McCrea Excavating </p><p>Eganville \u2013 Bonnechere Valley Township received three bids for work on Zadow Road with the lowest tender awarded to McCrea Excavating of Pembroke  </p><p>The successful tender was for $916,098.91. Other tenders were from Bonnechere Excavating at $1.132 million and Walsh Contracting and Equipment Rentals for $1.4 million. Council awarded the tender last Tuesday afternoon.  </p><p>Mayor Jennifer Murphy said it was her understanding eight contractors came to the site visit and she mused that only three submitted a tender. Works Superintendent Jason Zohr said there were six who came to the site visit, which was mandatory.  </p><p>\u201cOut of curiosity with pricing and everything else these days, it is curious to know who is coming to the site visit and actually tendering,\u201d she said.  </p><p>The project was under the engineer\u2019s estimate of $1.181 million.  </p><p>The work consists of road rehabilitation and drainage improvements. The work is being done from Silver Lake Road to Ruby Road, a distance of approximately 2.3 kilometres.  </p><p>Work on Zadow Road was supposed to be done in 2023 but was held over and expanded for 2024. </p><p>The report from the engineering firm looking at the tenders noted the bids varied by 54 percent with the tender price varying by approximately one percent to the engineer\u2019s estimate.  </p><p>* * * * * *  </p><p>Ditch Clean Up </p><p>Eganville \u2013 Ditch clean up days in Bonnechere Valley will be on April 20 and April 27, allowing township residents to assist in the clean up of ditches and take the bag for free to the waste site.  </p><p>\u201cI already have one bag,\u201d said Mayor Jennifer Murphy.  </p><p>Works Superintendent Jason Zohr said it is surprising how many residents go around and take part.  </p><p>\u201cIt is an early spring too,\u201d said Councillor Brent Patrick. </p><p>\u201cAnd the ditches are dry, which is so unusual,\u201d said the mayor.  </p><p>\u201cWe have been staring at the litter since Christmas,\u201d said Councillor John Epps.  </p><p> Bags can be dropped off at the Sand Road site. </p><p>* * * * * * *  </p><p>Fire Calls Are UpEganville \u2013 Fire calls continue to be up for Bonnechere Valley. \u201cSince I tabled my report, we have had three more calls,\u201d Fire Chief Darryl Wagner said at council last Tuesday afternoon. \u201cOne grass fire last night, one today.\u201dThe department is now up to 20 calls in 2024, with two being in April. \u201cIt is really bad,\u201d Mayor Jennifer Murphy said. The township is in a Level One fire ban.   \u201cIf this continues, we may be in a Level Two and it may hold all summer,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have had no snow, no rain, so you are almost in the April, May, June timeframe,\u201d the mayor said. The chief said they have signs up. \u201cWe try to do whatever we can,\u201d he said. Last year the department saw more calls than any previous year. </p><p>* * * * * * * </p><p>Restructuring Bonnechere Valley Fire DepartmentEganville \u2013 There is no more station one and station two for the Bonnechere Valley Fire Department, but it is just the Bonnechere Valley Fire Department. \u201cThere is no more station designation, reason being, most of the firefighters, with the exception of one, are in closer proximity to Eganville than Foymount,\u201d Chief Darryl Wagner told council last Tuesday afternoon. There are hopes there will be more recruits coming to the Foymount area.\u201cOnce the paramedics are out, all the training will be done here,\u201d he said, referring to the Eganville fire hall.The chief said this is part of restructuring the department. Recruiting is ongoing and there are people coming forward, he said.\u201cWe have had two new hires,\u201d he said. As well, the Junior Firefighters program has been a hit and a recent article in the Leader led to another member. \u201cWe have seven, six showed up last Wednesday,\u201d he said. At the job fair last week at Opeongo High School there was a lot of interest, he said.  </p><p>* * * * * * *  </p><p>Chief Building Official OptionEganville \u2013 Chief Building Official (CBO) Darryl Wagner told Bonnechere Valley council he will be at Opeongo High School on April 24 to speak about the job and hopefully interest students in this career path.He said several area CBOs will speak to the high school students about the requirements and path to become a CBO. \u201cThat is good, I like that, real life experience,\u201d Mayor Jennifer Murphy said. Councillor Brent Patrick said giving an option is a good thing for high school students. \u201cIt is the pathway to get to the CBO spot,\u201d he said.  </p><p>* * * * * * </p><p>MNRF Fire Crews Down Eganville \u2013 Bonnechere Valley firefighters may be called to help out more as Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) Fire Crews are short staffed.\u201cThey are short 50 crews, with that they are short 50 crew bosses,\u201d BV Fire Chief Darryl Wagner told council last Tuesday. \u201cSo, they will be relying on municipalities a little more.\u201dLast year they were short staffed which is why the restrictions went on, he said. Municipalities were recently made aware the MNRF fire crews are short staffed in 2024 as well. \u201cThey may expand the restricted fire zone,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say because the fires are expanding and moving, they may expand the fire zone,\u201d the chief said. When the municipality is asked to come in it becomes more lucrative, he added. However, usually the MNRF tries to handle situations in its delegated authority.\u201cFor the most part they are trying to manage it themselves,\u201d he said.As far as forest fire danger, it may be a bad year, the chief said. \u201cThey are predicting another year like last year.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20194aaa61a74462904d2e7035843c25</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BST-FJW1-DY9S-T161-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1154\"/><timeReceived>04:58 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 12, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D17D</classCode><className>NEWS BRIEFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921100JQ</classCode><className>MAYORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>ST0008XZ6</classCode><className>CONTRACT AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001404</classCode><className>PRODUCT WARRANTIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N237300CC</classCode><className>ROAD &amp; BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

With El Ni\u00f1o expected to bring a warmer, drier winter to the Prairies, water is expected to be a top issue municipalities and governments will be grappling with next year. </p><p>\"We've been talking to our members and I think 2024 is shaping up to be about water, and forest fire too. Our members feel it,\" Rural Municipalities of Alberta (RMA) president Paul McLaughlin said during a ministerial forum at an RMA conference on Nov. 9. </p><p>\"This is potentially a very serious issue for next year. We saw a very severe drought this year, and if we have a warm, dry winter, like is expected, we know that we will be in a very serious situation next year as well,\" said Rebecca Schulz, minister of environment and protected areas. </p><p>Schulz said her department is currently collecting information and doing engagements with municipalities and irrigation districts to develop plans for drought and emergency management. The government will also be looking at \"big picture\" water management issues in the province like incentivizing water conservation and water infrastructure plans, she said. </p><p>Alberta's agricultural areas have been running long-term moisture deficits over the last three years, according to the agriculture and irrigation ministry.  </p><p>\"Most of the Southern, Central and parts of the North East Regions are estimated to have a three-year period, in aggregate, this dry less than once in 50 years,\" the agricultural moisture situation update said. For the special areas region and adjacent parts of southern Alberta, the moisture deficit is equivalent to losing an entire year of precipitation in the last three years. </p><p>Among the many audience members who voiced concerns about drought and water management during the ministerial Q &amp; A was Tony Bruder, a councillor from the Municipal District of Pincher Creek, which has been under an extreme water restriction since Aug. 16. Bruder said his M.D. has had to haul in water for its hamlets and villages, at a cost of up to $8,000 per day. </p><p>RJ Sigurdson, minister of agriculture and irrigation, said there will likely be declines in water levels in reservoirs across the province next year, not just at the Oldman Dam that Pincher Creek relies on, and that the province will need a \"very strategic plan\" to deal with the water deficits. </p><p>\"We need to be proactive next year,\" Sigurdson said, with the understanding that there will be less water in reserves than there was this season and the province will have to act on water conservation. </p><p>\"It's going to be critical. Not just for municipalities, but it's definitely going to be critical for agriculture as well,\" he said. </p><p>As of early October, 21 communities in Alberta had declared agricultural disasters because of dry conditions in 2023. The majority of affected communities were in southern parts of the province. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-cab176698c7b4aaf93a4ce0d7b8aa6e9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69N7-YJ31-JBVR-33W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"493\"/><timeReceived>11:36 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 16, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Was it the minister? I doubt it. Was it the assistant deputy minister? We just don't know. Was it a five-minute review, a five-week review? There's nothing to tell us about the robustness of the review.\" </p><p>New Brunswick has an abundance of pristine lakes, streams and rivers, and the strategy was designed to manage and protect them. The other broad goals included educating people about water, protecting drinking water, preserving and enhancing ecosystem health and reporting progress. </p><p>\"New Brunswickers are lucky we have such wonderful, plentiful water resources as opposed to other places,\" Gingras said. \"Water is one of our most precious resources and without it, we are done for.\" </p><p>In response to her criticisms, the Department of Environment and Local Government issued a statement last week. </p><p>Spokesperson Clarissa Andersen said the department was dedicated to protecting New Brunswick's water and that it was working to fulfill the commitments in the document. </p><p>She said over the past two years, more than $4.4 million from the province's Environmental Trust Fund has supported watershed groups, universities and other partners on projects related to freshwater management. </p><p>She said progress over the past two years included: educational materials created to inform water well owners on how to care for and test the quality of their private wells; a new requirement that big industry provide an annual water usage report before they get a permit to operate; four new protected wellfields designated in 2023 in \u00cele-de-Lam\u00e8que, Miramichi, Memramcook and the Rivi\u00e8re-Verte community in Edmundston; and educational materials and signs about cyanobacteria and how to safely enjoy recreational waters installed near 150 rivers and lakes. </p><p>But among the 34 action items listed in the first version, less than half, 14, have been completed, with 12 others in progress. </p><p>Gingras was concerned that the province had changed the wording of several of the commitments made in the original water plan, which she said makes them easier to hit but much less effective. </p><p>As an example, the original version promised to create regulations to designate coastal protected areas under the Clean Water Act. In the latest report, the government changed the wording of this target, committing instead to \"exploring options for improved management of coastal areas.\" </p><p>Gingras said the initial plan, with its clear and definable goal, had been changed to a vague exploration. </p><p>Meanwhile, the province's commitment to release annual progress reports has been changed to \"periodic\" reports. It had only released two annual reports over the last five years, she noted. </p><p>A commitment to amending watercourse and wetland alteration permits (commonly called wawa permits) to coastal wetlands less than one acre in size has been changed and no longer mentions the permits. </p><p>A conservation plan meant to address households and industries during times of drought has been changed and does not mention households or industries anymore. Instead, it's been replaced with establishing \"a drought index and public advisory reporting system to better inform local governments and the public when water conservation strategies should be implemented.\" </p><p>And a comprehensive plan to reduce blue-algae blooms over the long-term has been replaced with a public education campaign on cyanobacteria and a commitment to more research in the area. </p><p>The executive director also wondered why two provincial government reports over the last few years that cited the negative impacts of agriculture, timber operations, municipal developments and pharmaceuticals on water quality were not mentioned in the latest update. </p><p>\"After this internal review, they say there's nothing new that needs to be done and they're doing everything fine,\" Gingras said. \"That was very odd to me because in some of their own reports they've identified stressors on water, such as pharmaceuticals, the effect of forest fires and climate change.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-4ccc70fb5dce4ce4b37b9418cda91705</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BCH-5H81-DY9S-T112-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><timeReceived>10:59 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 19, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">BRETT FORESTER (NEWSCASTER):<br/><br/>   WE DON'T KNOW WHEN WE'RE GOING BACK.<br/>WE DON'T KNOW -- DO WE STICK AROUND HERE?<br/>HOW DO YOU MAKE PLANS WHAT YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE, AND YOU'RE KIND OF SITTING AROUND WAITING.</p><p><br/>YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.<br/>IT'S HARD TO GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION, WHAT IS ACCURATE INFORMATION AT THIS TIME.<br/>   BRETT: IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK SINCE THOUSANDS OF JASPER RESIDENTS AND TOURISTS WERE FORCED TO EVACUATE THE TOWN.<br/>DAYS LATER, THE WILDFIRE SWEPT THROUGH, DESTROYING A THIRD OF THE COMMUNITY.<br/>CREWS HAVE SINCE EXTINGUISHED ALL OF THE FLAMES WITHIN THE TOWN.<br/>BUT THE BLAZE CONTINUES TO BURN NEARBY IN JASPER NATIONAL PARK AND HOT TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE FORECAST.<br/>THERE IS NO DATE SET FOR RESIDENTS TO RETURN HOME.<br/>BUT OFFICIALS HAVE LAID OUT THE CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.<br/>JOE URIE IS THE OWNER OF JASPER TOUR COMPANY.<br/>HE JOINS US FROM HINTON, ALBERTA, AND HELLO, AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.<br/>   HI, BRETT, THANKS FOR HAVING ME.<br/>   BRETT: WHERE ARE YOU NOW AND WHAT IS THE WEATHER LOOKING LIKE IN THE PARK?<br/>   I AM SITTING DIRECTLY OUTSIDE THE COMMAND CENTRE FOR THE JASPER WILDFIRE COMPLEX.<br/>HINTON IS JUST ABOUT 20-ODD-K FROM THE ACTUAL BOUNDARY OF THE PARK, AND MYSELF, I HAVE FOUND MYSELF HOME 1 KILOMETRE FROM THE PARK ITSELF.<br/>SO STRANGE THAT IT TOOK ME 1200 KILOMETRES TO GET WHERE I AM NOW TO WHERE WE ARE EVACUATED NOW, AND I AM 50K FROM HOME AND CAN'T GET THERE.<br/>   HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?<br/>   I'M GOOD.<br/>I'M GOOD.<br/>THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT.<br/>THEY'RE MY FRIENDS, MY FAMILY, MY NEIGHBORHOODS.<br/>THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THIS AND THE REALITY IS THIS IS ALL STILL VERY, VERY SURREAL.<br/>IT'S NOT UNTIL THEY SEE THE ACTUAL DAMAGE ITSELF, I THINK, THAT IT WILL REALLY SINK HOME.<br/>WE'VE SEEN THE SAME IMAGES YOU'VE SEEN, AND LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, IT'S STILL JUST SOMETHING ON TELEVISION.<br/>SO I THINK THE WORST IS STILL TO COME FOR MOST PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED.<br/>   BRETT: IT'S A DIFFICULT SITUATION TO EVEN FATHOM.<br/>I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A TOWN HALL IN CALGARY YESTERDAY.<br/>WHAT DID YOU HEAR FROM OFFICIALS?<br/>WHAT IS THE LATEST?<br/>   YEAH, IT WAS ONLINE, AS WELL.<br/>SO ANYBODY WHO HAD THE ABILITY TO PUT EARS ON IT COULD HEAR, AND ALSO ASK SOME QUESTIONS.<br/>THERE WERE SOME GOOD THINGS THAT CAME OF IT JUST IN TERMS OF GETTING INFORMATION OUT THERE.<br/>THERE'S A LOT OF PERTINENT QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO ASK OR WANTED TO ANSWERS TO AND HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO.<br/>THERE'S -- WE HAVE A PRESENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.<br/>A LOT OF US HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO ASK EACH OTHER QUESTIONS IN THE HOPES THAT SOMEONE CAN GET ANSWERS.<br/>WE DID GET SOME ANSWERS FROM THE TOWN HALL ON THAT.<br/>THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT ARE STILL A LITTLE BIT VAGUE AND I THINK IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER IN ORDER IN TERMS OF WHAT FIRE COMMAND HAS TO HAVE.<br/>LIKE, AS SUGGESTED THE CRITERION BEFORE WE CAN GO HOME.<br/>FOR SOME QUESTIONS, THERE WASN'T BE ANSWERS FOR A WHILE.<br/>   WHEN YOU CAN RETURN HOME STILL DOES SEEM TO BE ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS.<br/>HOW DOES IT FEEL NOT KNOWING WHEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN?<br/>   I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST QUESTION FOR EVERYBODY.<br/>AND THIS SORT OF FEELING THAT YOU'RE IN LIMBO.<br/>IT'S -- IT ADDS TO THE SURREAL NATURE OF THE WHOLE THING.<br/>THERE WAS ONE QUESTION THAT I ACTUALLY ASKED -- I ASKED PROBABLY 10.<br/>BUT THEY UTILIZED ONE OF MINE, AND IT WAS SIMPLY WHERE IS A LIST THAT SOMEBODY COULD PUT THEIR NAME ON THAT WHEN THE MOMENT IS RIGHT -- AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT GETTING CIVILIANS' HANDS INTO SOMETHING THAT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS DUE TO TOXIC LEVELS.<br/>BUT A SIMPLE LIST THAT PEOPLE COULD PUT THEIR NAME ON THAT SAYS WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT, WE CAN SWEEP STREETS, WE CAN MUCK OFF SIDEWALKS.<br/>IF THERE WAS SIMPLY A LIST LIKE THAT THAT EXISTS THAT PEOPLE COULD PUT THEIR NAMES ON, RIGHT THEN AND THERE, THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE SITTING ON THEIR HANDS ANYMORE, AND THAT WOULD BE REASSURING TO THEM.<br/>BUT WE DIDN'T GET AN ANSWER FOR THAT.<br/>   BRETT: JOE, I HOPE YOU COULD TAKE ME BACK TO LAST WEEK ON THE DAY THE EVACUATION ORDER WENT OUT.<br/>WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR YOU AT THAT TIME?<br/>   WELL, I WAS ACTUALLY PRESENT WHEN THE -- WHAT THEY CALL THE NORTH FIRE IGNITED AT THE TRANSFER STATION.<br/>I WAS DOING A TOUR WITH GUESTS -- INTERNATIONAL GUESTS.<br/>AND THAT QUICKLY ESCALATED.<br/>I HAD MADE AN ATTEMPT TO PUT IT OUT MYSELF.<br/>AND I MANAGED TO PROTECT ONE POWER POLE.<br/>BUT AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME, FIRE HAD CREPT ABOUT 20 FEET AWAY AND FOUND SOME LADDER FUEL AND IGNITED A TREE.<br/>   BRETT: WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN THAT WAS HAPPENING?<br/>   JUST TO GET THE FIRE OUT.<br/>LIKE, WHEN IT FIRST STARTED, I WAS SITTING IN A VEHICLE WITH MY GUESTS LOOKING FOR COYOTES, AND THE FIRE BEGINS.<br/>AND I THINK ANYBODY WHO RUN DOWN THERE LIKE I DID AND I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH DISPATCH AT THE EXACT SAME TIME TRYING TO GET HELP OUT THERE, AND INITIALLY I WANTED THE BONFIRE-SIZED FIRE PUT OUT.<br/>BY THE TIME THEY CAME THERE, AND I HAD CONTAINED THE BONFIRE SIZE AROUND THE POWER POLE, IT HAD THEN SPREAD AND GONE UP A TREE AND IT WAS JUST THAT FAST.<br/>IF ANYONE WHO HAS EVER EXPERIENCED FOREST FIRE, AND I WORKED FIGHTING FOREST FIRES IN 1985 FOR 5 MONTHS, AND THIS -- AND CONDITIONS LIKE WE ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW, WHEN A FIRE WANTS TO TRIAL, WHEN A FIRE BECOMES ITS OWN WEATHER MAKER WHICH THE SOUTH FIRE CERTAINLY DID, AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO STOP A MONSTER LIKE THAT.<br/>VERY QUICKLY, I WENT BACK IN THE VEHICLE, AND MY GUESTS WERE WOW, WE SEEN THIS ON TV.<br/>AND I TOLD THEM VERY QUICKLY, I THINK WE GOT TO GO BACK TO TOWN AND YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED TO LEAVE.<br/>THIS IS NOT GOING TO GO WELL, AND SURE ENOUGH, TWO HOURS LATER, THE ORDER TO EVACUATE CAME.<br/>   BRETT: JOE, THE NEXT QUESTION IS A DIFFICULT ONE AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE.<br/>HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE LOSS THAT THE COMMUNITY IS GRIEVING RIGHT NOW?<br/>   IT'S BEYOND EPIC.<br/>I MEAN, AT THE MOMENT, IT'S EVERYTHING.<br/>IT'S EVERYTHING UNTIL WE CAN GET HOME.<br/>I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER AND WE NEED TO STRESS THAT 70% OF THE TOWN IS STILL STANDING.<br/>AND THAT 70% INCLUDES A GREAT MAJORITY OF THE HOTEL ROOMS, IT ALSO INCLUDES A GREAT MAJORITY OF THE RESTAURANTS AND PUBS AND GIFT SHOPS, AND YOU NAME IT.<br/>THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT WHILE 30% OF OUR TOWN IS GONE AND THOSE ARE LARGELY THE HOMES, WE WILL BE BACK AND WE'LL BE BACK SHORTLY, AND WE JUST WANT PEOPLE TO REMEMBER THAT WE'RE STILL HERE AND TO COME AND VISIT US.<br/>THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW NARRATIVE WHEN THEY DO.<br/>BUT THAT'S SUPER IMPORTANT.<br/>A COUPLE OTHER THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS THAT I DON'T WANT TO BE -- I DON'T WANT OUR TOWN TO BE A POLITICAL FOOTBALL FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT TO KICK AROUND AND POINT FINGERS AT EACH OTHER WITH AND I ALSO DON'T WANT TO BECOME YESTERDAY'S NEWS.<br/>BECAUSE AS WE KNOW, PEOPLE WILL MOVE ON FROM A CRISIS LIKE THIS.<br/>THE SECOND A NEW CRISIS BEGINS.<br/>AND THEN THE SUPPORTS TO REBUILD OUR TOWN WILL BECOME THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO GET.<br/>   BRETT: WHAT DOES YOUR COMMUNITY NEED TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING?<br/>   WHETHER IT BE --<br/>   ALL EYES -- GO AHEAD.<br/>   BRETT: WHETHER IT BE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT, OR ANYONE ELSE, WHAT WOULD MOST ASSIST YOU RIGHT NOW?<br/>   WELL, RIGHT NOW, WHAT WOULD MOST ASSIST EVERYBODY IS JUST SOME ANSWERS.<br/>CONTINUED ROOFS OVER OUR HEADS.<br/>FOOD IN OUR MOUTHS.<br/>THE IDEA THAT WE KNOW THAT OUR CHILDREN CAN REGISTER AND GO TO SCHOOL.<br/>IF NOT JASPER, SOMEWHERE CLOSE BY.<br/>OR ZOOM.<br/>AND THEN THAT WE HAVE THEIR 100% SUPPORT ON A REBUILD.<br/>THAT INCLUDES FEDERAL MINES AND MONEY, PROVINCIAL MINES AND -- FEDERAL MINDS AND MONEY.<br/>PROVINCIAL MINDS AND MONEY.<br/>INDIGENOUS MINDS AND MONEY BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE CHASED OUT OF THIS PLACE BY ANOTHER FIRE CALLED CANADA A LONG TIME AGO.<br/>THEY NEED TO BE BACK ON THE LANDSCAPE.<br/>THE MANAGERS THAT CONTROL THIS CAN UTILIZE SOME OF THE KNOWLEDGE THEY USED TO USE IN THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS NOW JASPER NATIONAL PARK.<br/>WE NEED EVERYBODY COULD BE ON THE EXACT SAME PAGE WHEN THE TIME TO REBUILD COMES ABOUT.<br/>AND HOPEFULLY, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES.<br/>THAT'S HUMAN NATURE.<br/>BUT AT LEAST WE CAN MITIGATE SOME OF THE MISTAKES THAT WE MADE IN THE PAST IF WE'RE ALL STILL ON THE SAME PAGE.<br/>   JOE URIE IS THE OWNER OF JASPER TOUR COMPANY.<br/>I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME TODAY.<br/>   THANKS FOR HAVING ME, AND STAY STRONG, JASPER.<br/>   BRETT: TIME NOW TO GET TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO THE WILDFIRE THREAT IN JASPER NATIONAL PARK.<br/>ADAM VAN KOEVERDEN IS THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE FEDERAL MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND HE JOINS ME NOW.<br/>HELLO, AND WELCOME TO POWER &amp; POLITICS.<br/>   THANKS, BRETT.<br/>NICE TO BE HERE.<br/>   BRETT: RESIDENTS OF JASPER HAVE BEEN FORCED OUT OF THEIR HOMES FOR A WEEK.<br/>NOW THAT THE FIRE IS OUT IN THE TOWNSITE, WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE PLANS FOR THEIR REENTRY?<br/>   WELL, THANK YOU, AND FIRST, I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT A DIFFICULT TIME THIS HAS BEEN FOR ALL OF THE RESIDENTS OF JASPER AND I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK FIRST RESPONDERS AND FIREFIGHTERS, ALL PARKS CANADA STAFF.<br/>I WOULD LIKE TO THANK WILDFIRES ALBERTA, AND THE TOWN OF JASPER, MAYOR IRELAND, FOR BEING EXTRAORDINARY LEADERS AT THIS TIME.<br/>IT'S BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT.<br/>WE'RE GOING TO DO A STAGED SAFE REENTRY OF THE TOWN NOW THAT ALL OF THE FIRES ARE OUT IN THE TOWN.<br/>THERE CONTINUES TO BE OVER 400 CREWS ON THE GROUND AND THOSE ARE ALL FIREFIGHTERS FROM ONTARIO, FROM ALBERTA, FROM PARKS CANADA, FROM BRITISH COLUMBIA, AND I JUST WANT TO THANK THEM ALL FOR THEIR EXTRAORDINARY WORK.<br/>ALL OF THE EVACUATION PLANS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE YEARS AGO.<br/>ALL OF THE BUFFER ZONES THAT WERE CREATED.<br/>ALL OF THE PREP.<br/>AND ALL OF THE MITIGATION EFFORTS MEAN THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS NATURAL DISASTER DID NOT RESULT IN ANY INJURIES OR LOSS OF LIFE, AND THAT'S THE MAIN THING, BRETT, IS THAT PEOPLE -- WE CAN REBUILD A TOWN.<br/>WE CAN REBUILD OUR HOMES.<br/>BUT PEOPLE WERE NOT HARMED IN THIS FIRE WHICH IS NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE, AND ALL THANKS TO THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS OF FIRST RESPONDERS AND PEOPLE DOING THAT PLANNING.<br/>   BRETT: YOU MENTIONED THE PHASED REENTRY.<br/>YOU DIDN'T MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THE TIMELINE.<br/>CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT THE TIMELINE?<br/>   WELL, FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT NEEDS TO BE SAFE.<br/>YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S A FIRE, THERE IS A LOT OF SORT OF CHEMICALS AND THINGS THAT BURN AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS SAFE.<br/>SO I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANY TIMELINES BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANY PERSONALLY.<br/>BUT IT'S AN ASAP, AN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, ONLY WHEN AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE.<br/>AND YOU KNOW, I THINK, EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT PHASED REENTRY SO PEOPLE REMAIN SAFE AND SECURE.<br/>   IN THE MEANTIME, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, PEOPLE STILL HAVE QUESTIONS.<br/>WHAT OTHER SUPPORT IS THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDING TO SOME OF THESE EVACUEES WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN LIMBO?<br/>   YEAH, THANK YOU.<br/>THERE ARE A LOT OF SUPPORTS AVAILABLE THROUGH BOTH THE PROVINCIAL AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.<br/>CANADA IS MATCHING ALL DONATIONS TO THE RED CROSS FOR THOSE WHO ARE ACCESSING THOSE SERVICES.<br/>THE TOWN OF JASPER HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL.<br/>I JUST WANT TO AGAIN ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT A GREAT LEADER MAYOR IRELAND HAS BEEN.<br/>THE COLLABORATION REALLY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY STRONGER BETWEEN THE PROVINCE, THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA, PARKS CANADA, WILDFIRES ALBERTA, THE TOWN OF JASPER.<br/>AND YOU KNOW, THERE PROBABLY ISN'T A MORE FIRE-SAFE TOWN OR COMMUNITY THAN JASPER.<br/>THE FIRE SMART PROGRAM WAS ACTUALLY STARTED IN JASPER.<br/>SO I THINK THE RESIDENTS, YOU KNOW, ARE ACTUALLY FAR MORE -- THEY'RE EXPERTS IN THIS BECAUSE THEY'VE ALL BEEN BRIEFED.<br/>THEY'VE ALL BEEN EDUCATED AND THAT PUBLIC AWARENESS PROGRAM FROM EVERYTHING FROM WHAT TO PACK, HOW TO BE PREPARED FOR EMERGENCIES, WHAT THE EVACUATION PLANS WERE, WHAT THE ROUTES WERE -- THOSE WERE ALL DONE IN ADVANCE.<br/>AND THAT'S WHY THE TOWN OF JASPER WAS ABLE TO EVACUATE IN JUST 5 HOURS.<br/>SO UNFORTUNATELY THE REENTRY WILL TAKE LONGER THAN 5 HOURS.<br/>BUT JASPERITES ARE WELL AWARE OF THE RISKS INVOLVED OF GOING BACK IN TOO EARLY.<br/>SO OUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH THEM.<br/>BUT ALSO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS ARE WITH THEM.<br/>AND THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION ONLINE.<br/>AND TO CANADIANS COAST TO COAST TO COAST WHO WOULD LIKE TO HELP OUT A LITTLE BIT, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS MATCHING DONATIONS TO THE CANADIAN RED CROSS AT THIS TIME.<br/>   YOU REFERENCED MAYOR OF JASPER RICHARD IRELAND'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE TOWN'S PREPAREDNESS.<br/>I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE PARK'S PREPAREDNESS.<br/>HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT THE PARK WAS AS PREPARED AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN FOR THIS FIRE?<br/>   WELL, I AM 100% CONFIDENT THAT PARKS CANADA STAFF DID AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB AND SO IS MAYOR IRELAND.<br/>HE STATED THAT BOTH PARKS CANADA STAFF AND THE TOWN WERE PREPARED AND THEY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE PREPARED AND THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND ALL INSTITUTIONS.<br/>LIKE PARKS CANADA COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY STRONGER.<br/>SO I THANK THE MAYOR OF JASPER FOR THAT COMMENT.<br/>BUT ALSO FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK THAT WENT INTO ENSURING THAT THAT IS TRUE.<br/>YOU KNOW IT REALLY WAS THE RESULT ARE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY INTENSITY OF THE BLAZE, WEEKS OF EXTREME HEAT, AND STRONG WINDS THAT RESULTED IN AN UNPRECEDENTED FIRE.<br/>BUT IT WAS ALL THE MITIGATION EFFORTS -- ALL OF THE PUBLIC AWARENESS, ALL OF THAT EDUCATION, ALL OF THOSE BUFFER ZONES AND THE THINNING OF THAT FOREST THAT RESULTED IN A FIRE THAT DIDN'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON HUMAN LIFE AND SAFETY.<br/>YOU KNOW, THIS IS A REAL TRAGEDY.<br/>JASPER IS A BEAUTIFUL TOWN.<br/>BUT PARKS CANADA STAFF WERE ALSO FIGHTING THESE FIRES WHILE THEIR OWN HOMES WERE BURNING.<br/>SO YOU KNOW EVERYBODY THAT CONTRIBUTED IN ANY BIG OR SMALL WAY IS A HERO.<br/>I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR ALL OF THAT EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT AND WORK.<br/>YOU KNOW, HOUSES AND COMMUNITIES CAN BE REBUILT.<br/>   BRETT: THE GOVERNMENT WAS WARNED, THOUGH -- THIS IS FROM THE 2022 JASPER PARKS MANAGEMENT PLAN.<br/>IT SAYS, QUOTE, A MOUNTAIN PINE BEETLE INFESTATION HAS BROUGHT SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO FORESTS IN ALBERTA.<br/>INCLUDING JASPER NATIONAL PARK WITH CONSEQUENCES FOR WILDFIRE RISK, PUBLIC SAFETY, INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT, AND LONG-TERM FOREST SUCCESSION.<br/>SOME CRITICS HAVE CITED THIS PASSAGE TO SUGGEST MORE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO REDUCE FIRE HAZARDS IN THAT AREA.<br/>WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE CRITICS?<br/>   WELL, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CRITICISM AND ALSO A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT HOW WILDFIRES ARE BEING STARTED AND WHY THEY'RE STRONGER AND WORSE THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN.<br/>I DON'T THINK IT'S A COINCIDENCE THAT THE HOTTEST DAY EVER ON RECORD ON PLANET EARTH WAS THE SAME DAY THAT THE JASPER WILDFIRE --<br/>   THAT MAY BE TRUE.<br/>BUT I'M ASKING ABOUT THE PARK MANAGEMENT PLAN WHICH IDENTIFIED THIS RISK --<br/>   THE PARKS -- YEAH, THE PARKS MANAGEMENT PLAN WITH RESPECT TO PINE BEETLES WAS WELL IN ADVANCE AND A LOT OF THINGS CHANGED AT THAT TIME.<br/>THE PARK MANAGEMENT PLAN DID CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THE PINE BEETLE INFESTATION, AND THAT'S WHY THE THINNING OF THE FOREST, THE BUFFER ZONES, AND NEWER EVACUATION ROUTES AND STRONGER MITIGATION EFFORTS WERE UNDERTAKEN.<br/>IT'S THESE EFFORTS THAT RESULTED -- AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THAT WASN'T JUST A PARKS CANADA EFFORT, THE WILDFIRES ALBERTA EFFORT.<br/>I WANT TO THANK THE PREMIER OFALBERTA FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND AGENCIES COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY STRONGER.<br/>I WANT TO THANK THE INCIDENT COMMAND CENTRE AT PARKS CANADA BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE PREPARATIONS -- THOSE WARNINGS THAT YOU REFERENCED RESULTED IN A LOT OF CHANGES.<br/>THAT RESULTED IN A LOT OF MODIFICATION, INCREASED FUNDING, INCREASED AWARENESS EFFORTS, INCREASED SCIENCE, INCREASED MEASUREMENTS.<br/>ALL OF THOSE THINGS WERE UNDERTAKEN TO ENSURE THAT FIRES LIKE THIS CAN BE MITIGATED.<br/>SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T BE STOPPED.<br/>YOU KNOW, THE FIRE WAS MOVING AT 15 METRES PER MINUTE.<br/>THERE WAS AN OVER 100-METRE-HIGH CROWN ON SOME OF THESE WILDFIRES.<br/>AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT MEANS THAT A LOT OF THE WATERBOMBERS WERE COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE.<br/>THE SPEED AT WHICH THIS FIRE PROPAGATED AND THE INTENSITY IN WHICH IT BURNED MEANT THAT A LOT OF TRADITIONAL FIREFIGHTING TECHNIQUES AND METHODS WERE NOT EFFECTIVE.<br/>BUT WHAT WERE EFFECTIVE WERE ALL OF THE EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE REMAINED SAFE.<br/>THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.<br/>ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AND ACKNOWLEDGING ALSO THAT 70% OF JASPER WAS SAVED FROM THIS WILDFIRE IS, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING TO ACKNOWLEDGE, PERHAPS NOT CELEBRATE THIS EARLY, BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE EFFORTS AND THOSE WARNINGS WERE HEEDED AND THAT INFORMATION WAS WELL USED.<br/>AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT -- UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF DOING GOOD ECOLOGICAL SCIENCE, GOOD CONSERVATION, AND REALLY GOOD PREPARATION EFFORTS AND MITIGATION EFFORTS WERE UNDERTAKEN.<br/>   BRETT: JUST TO BE CLEAR, IN YOUR VIEW, EVERYTHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN RESPONSE TO THESE WARNINGS WAS DONE TO MITIGATE THE FIRE?<br/>THAT'S YOUR POSITION?<br/>   ABSOLUTELY, BRETT.<br/>I WANT TO UNDERSCORE AGAIN THAT THIS WAS A REAL TRAGEDY.<br/>BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROPERTY DAMAGE.<br/>AND IT'S REALLY AN EMOTIONAL TIME -- FOR ANYBODY WHO VISITED JASPER, YOU KNOW HOW BEAUTIFUL AND UNIQUE THIS PLACE IS.<br/>BUT EVERY REQUEST MADE OF THE FEDERAL AND THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT WAS MET.<br/>EVERYTHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO MITIGATE THIS FIRE HAS BEEN DONE.<br/>WE NEED TO DO MORE.<br/>WE CERTAINLY NEED TO DO MORE BECAUSE THESE FIRES ARE BURNING HOTTER, MORE FREQUENTLY, AND LONGER.<br/>WE EVEN SAW, YOU KNOW, EMBERS UNDER -- I SAW REPORTS OF EMBERS UNDER SNOW ALL WINTER IN SOME PLACES.<br/>THIS IS REALLY UNPRECEDENTED, YOU KNOW.<br/>WE'RE IN AN ERA NOW OF REALLY DIFFICULT-TO-DEAL-WITH-EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS THAT ARE HAVING A GREATER IMPACT ON OUR LIVELIHOODS, OUR ECONOMIES AND OUR VERY LIVES.<br/>SO WE NEED TO DO MORE.<br/>NOT JUST TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM SAFETY, BUT WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT HOW FORESTS ARE REACTING TO THE CHANGING CLIMATE THAT WE'RE ALL EXPERIENCING.<br/>   BRETT: WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.<br/>THAT IS ADAM VAN KOEVERDEN, PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE.<br/>THANK YOU, SIR.<br/>   THANK YOU,

Environment Canada expects the smoke to persist into the weekend.<br/><br/> The Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks now forecasts the air quality index for Friday to be 3, which is in the low risk range, after Peterborough had recordings in the high risk range every day from Sunday night to Wednesday.<br/><br/> Environment Canada and Peterborough Public Health continue to urge Peterborough city and county residents to avoid outdoor activities and stay inside, especially if feeling unwell.<br/><br/> Due to the poor air quality, the city extended the operating hours this week for the One Roof Community Centre, operated out of St. John's Anglican Church at 99 Brock St. in downtown Peterborough.<br/><br/> The centre is operating from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. until at least Friday to provide relief for anyone in need. A meal program is offered there between 1 and 2 p.m. daily.<br/><br/> The air quality has led to cancellation of some outdoor events in the Peterborough area, including a tailgate party planned for prior to Thursday night's Peterborough Lakers season home opener and some soccer games.<br/><br/> The Peterborough Baseball Association has continued with scheduled games this week while the Peterborough City Soccer Association cancelled its Tuesday and Wednesday games.<br/><br/> The Peterborough Victoria Northumberland and Clarington Catholic District School Board hosted recess and physical education classes inside on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the air quality and was also reviewing class trips and other extracurricular activities on a day by day basis.<br/><br/>  Outdoor activity in the Catholic schools resumed \"with caution\" on Thursday.<br/><br/> Conditions in Peterborough and the Kawarthas were exasperated by three somewhat nearby forest fires: a 43.7-hectare forest fire at Centennial Lake in the Madawaska area and two in northeastern Algonquin Park. <br/><br/> Those fires started on the weekend and are now listed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry as either being under control or held.<br/><br/> Algonquin Park 6 was discovered at 18 hectares in size at 3:54 p.m. on Saturday and Algonquin Park 7 was 2.1 hectares and discovered at 4:06 p.m. that same day. Both fires are in the northeast portion of the park, southeast of Lake Travers. <br/><br/> By 3:55 p.m. on Monday, Algonquin Park 6 had grown to 30 hectares, while Algonquin Park 7 stayed at 2.1 hectares, according to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services. After initially being classified as \"not in control,\" by 8 a.m. on Tuesday the fires had been classified as \"being held\" at their current size. At 8 a.m. on Wednesday, the wildfires had not grown but were active and \"being held.\" At 8 a.m. on Thursday, there was no change in the status of the fires.<br/><br/> Air conditions had improved enough in parts of Eastern Ontario and parts of northeastern Ontario that Environment Canada lifted a number special air quality statements on Thursday, including for Barry's Bay, Killaloe, Smiths Falls, Perth, eastern Lanark County, Renfrew, Arnprior, Calabogie, Petawawa, Pembroke, Cobden, Brockville, Prescott, Cornwall, Ganonoque and Charleston Lake.<br/><br/> with files from Kim Good, Torstar <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2023060968133994</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DX-JBM1-JDV5-F531-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"581\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 9, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Control &amp;

Environment Canada expects the smoke to persist into the weekend.</p><p>The Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks now forecasts the air quality index for Friday to be 3, which is in the low risk range, after Peterborough had recordings in the high risk range every day from Sunday night to Wednesday.</p><p>Environment Canada and Peterborough Public Health continue to urge Peterborough city and county residents to avoid outdoor activities and stay inside, especially if feeling unwell.</p><p>Due to the poor air quality, the city extended the operating hours this week for the One Roof Community Centre, operated out of St. John's Anglican Church at 99 Brock St. in downtown Peterborough.</p><p>The centre is operating from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. until at least Friday to provide relief for anyone in need. A meal program is offered there between 1 and 2 p.m. daily.</p><p>The air quality has led to cancellation of some outdoor events in the Peterborough area, including a tailgate party planned for prior to Thursday night's Peterborough Lakers season home opener and some soccer games.</p><p>The Peterborough Baseball Association has continued with scheduled games this week while the Peterborough City Soccer Association cancelled its Tuesday and Wednesday games.</p><p>The Peterborough Victoria Northumberland and Clarington Catholic District School Board hosted recess and physical education classes inside on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the air quality and was also reviewing class trips and other extracurricular activities on a day by day basis.</p><p>Outdoor activity in the Catholic schools resumed \"with caution\" on Thursday.</p><p>Conditions in Peterborough and the Kawarthas were exasperated by three somewhat nearby forest fires: a 43.7-hectare forest fire at Centennial Lake in the Madawaska area and two in northeastern Algonquin Park.</p><p>Those fires started on the weekend and are now listed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry as either being under control or held.</p><p>Algonquin Park 6 was discovered at 18 hectares in size at 3:54 p.m. on Saturday and Algonquin Park 7 was 2.1 hectares and discovered at 4:06 p.m. that same day. Both fires are in the northeast portion of the park, southeast of Lake Travers.</p><p>By 3:55 p.m. on Monday, Algonquin Park 6 had grown to 30 hectares, while Algonquin Park 7 stayed at 2.1 hectares, according to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services. After initially being classified as \"not in control,\" by 8 a.m. on Tuesday the fires had been classified as \"being held\" at their current size. At 8 a.m. on Wednesday, the wildfires had not grown but were active and \"being held.\" At 8 a.m. on Thursday, there was no change in the status of the fires.</p><p>Air conditions had improved enough in parts of Eastern Ontario and parts of northeastern Ontario that Environment Canada lifted a number special air quality statements on Thursday, including for Barry's Bay, Killaloe, Smiths Falls, Perth, eastern Lanark County, Renfrew, Arnprior, Calabogie, Petawawa, Pembroke, Cobden, Brockville, Prescott, Cornwall, Ganonoque and Charleston Lake.</p><p>with files from Kim Good, Torstar</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-news20230609TPE2023060968133994</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DX-1VT1-F197-5494-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"577\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 9, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Physical Education Classes</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUQ1RTdBMDEzRDFCNDM4RDg2OUUwQkEwNTYzREUyNjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUZEQjQzQjY5NDRGNEVCNUIwMEZBMjAzMjQxRjRENEQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

It has been closed off to the public with roads shuttered since the end of the week.</p><p>There are likely buildings that have been damaged in the zone and authorities provided a number for property owners to call to check.</p><p>Dufour said it was important to make a distinction that \"out-of-control\" shouldn't be a signal the situation is like recent major wildfires in Australia or California.</p><p>Instead, firefighters are working to move the blaze in a certain direction, but were not in a position to bring it under control, Dufour explained.</p><p>Firefighters have made several targeted strikes to protect strategic points like bridges, outfitters and the Peribonka IV plant.</p><p>Maxence Huard-Lefebvre, a spokesman for Hydro-Quebec, said the fire had reached within just over one kilometre of the installation, but a sprinkler system set up Saturday and a change in winds were ushering the flames north.</p><p>Huard-Lefebvre added officials are keeping watch, but the installation is well protected against fire, built into the rock and partially underground.</p><p>\"There would be no impact on the power station even if the entire forest burned in the area,\" Huard-Lefebvre said. </p><p>The site has been dormant in anticipation of the fire and emptied of combustible materials just in case.</p><p>SOPFEU firefighters might be spending the night at the plant - which indicates the situation is under control near the plant, Huard-Lefebvre said.</p><p>There were at least 18 forest fires in the province, causing smog and hazy smoke in various parts of the province.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 21, 2020.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-3ba117ae131043cfbf7eb54344774300</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6066-18N1-JBVR-322W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"591\"/><timeReceived>05:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 21, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As of press time Monday, there were 77 fires in total burning in the Southeast Fire Centre (SEFC), a jump of over 25 over the weekend. Eighteen of the fires listed by the SEFC form an arc around the northern part of the Valley Voice readership area, sweeping from north and east of the Arrow Lakes to north along Trout Lake, then completing the arc along the northeast shore of Kootenay lake. All but a handful are spot fires burning up in the high country. </p><p>The largest of those is the 709-hectare Hamill Creek fire northeast of Lardeau.  </p><p>More than a dozen new fires are also burning in the southern half of the region, including an eight-hectare wildfire north of Lemon Creek. That .8-hectare fire, on Ringrose Creek, was listed as \u2018being held\u2019 by BC Wildfire Service crews. A small fire was discovered on Goat Mountain above New Denver on Monday night about 7:30, listed on the BCWS website as the Mount Carpenter fire. A spot fire was also burning near Cove Creek in Valhalla Provincial Park. An older fire caused by humans above McDonald Creek near Burton is listed as \u2018being held\u2019 by BC Wildfire Service officials.  </p><p>Smoke from fires surrounding the region is reducing air quality, prompting periodic advisories from Environment Canada from Nakusp to Nelson.  </p><p>Fire bans remain in effect across British Columbia, where about 418 fires were active at press time.

At least two of the fires are not contained and several more are under ongoing assessment. The biggest threat to Indigenous communities in the region is smoke. This year alone, 1.1 million hectares of land have burned, according to the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency. </p><p>The Lac La Ronge Indian Band is a Woodland Cree First Nation comprised of 7,835 members, with a further 4,680 people living across the communities at Grandmother\u2019s Bay, Sucker River, Little Red River, La Ronge, Stanley Mission, and Kitsaki. The band controls 43,302 hectares of land. </p><p>Across Canada, wildfires continue to be of ongoing concern; 10 million hectares of land have been affected, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-295682ef40b542b09ce116bd09ec24b6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68S3-6DJ1-DY9S-T396-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"273\"/><timeReceived>02:55 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 21, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX001196</classCode><className>NATIVE AMERICANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X7K</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N624230EG</classCode><className>DISASTER &amp; EMERGENCY AGENCIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS177</classCode><className>SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

There was heavy smoke throughout the town and forest fire prevention teams were doing trenchwork in the area to protect it. Residents were relocated to Senneterre, about 90 kilometres south of the community.</p><p>In the North Shore community of Sept-\u00celes, where a state of emergency was declared Friday morning, an evacuation order for residents of certain sectors of town remained in place. It was the same story in the nearby Innu community of Mani-Utenam, where 1,500 residents belonging to the Uashat Mak Mani-utenam First Nation have been relocated.</p><p>The two wildfires threatening the area remained largely stable and did not progress much overnight. Sept-\u00celes Mayor Steeve Beaupr\u00e9 said no new evacuations were planned, but residents of one sector remained on alert. About 5,000 people were forced from their homes as a precaution in the city about 890 kilometres northeast of Montreal.</p><p>Meanwhile, members of the Anishinaabe community of Lac-Simon in the Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue region also had to evacuate on Saturday. Community members relocated to Val-d'Or due to poor air quality in the community. Public health officials in the region declared a confinement as of 6 p.m. until 9 a.m., asking residents to stay indoors and keep windows closed.</p><p>Quebec forest fire prevention organization SOPFEU reports there are 134 active fires in the province, including about 20 that are priorities because they threaten residences or infrastructure.</p><p>\"Our weather experts are announcing the same type of weather over the next few days,\" said M\u00e9lanie Morin, a spokeswoman for SOPFEU.</p><p>\"There may be some rain coming in on Tuesday or Wednesday, that's still pretty far away, (so) we're taking it one day at a time, but that is when we may get a bit of a relief from Mother Nature.\"</p><p>Federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair confirmed Saturday the federal government had approved a request from Quebec seeking military assistance, and Canadian Forces troops will be providing firefighting resources and help with wildfire response planning and coordination.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office said Premier Legault spoke to him on the phone Saturday and that Legault thanked Trudeau for the rapid deployment of the troops.</p><p>Trudeau also spoke to local leaders in some of the province\u2019s most hard-hit communities.</p><p>About 100 soldiers were expected Saturday in the region, according to Employment Minister Kateri Champagne Jourdain, who is also the minister responsible for the C\u00f4te-Nord region. Another 100 soldiers were expected on Sunday, she told a briefing.</p><p>Meanwhile there was good news for the residents of Chapais, another northern Quebec town, where the local mayor said residents can return home later after being forced to evacuate on Wednesday evening.</p><p>Isabelle Lessard's announcement was met with applause from residents of the town about 715 kilometres northeast of Montreal.</p><p>\"The fact that the fire has not gotten bigger also shows that what has been done (to stop spread) is effective,\" Lessard said, but added residents shouldn't let their guard down and must abide by provincial notices.</p><p>This week, the province asked people to stay out of forests and banned open fires in or near forests across the province.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 3, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-d57188d063334da9a2d2e7fee27118fe</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CV-KM11-JBVR-30J1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><timeReceived>07:42 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 3, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">CATHERINE CULLEN (NEWSCASTER):<br/><br/>   CATHERINE: THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS OPENED APPLICATIONS FOR A NEW FUND WORTH HALF A BILLION DOLLARS TODAY TO HELP COMMUNITIES COPE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE.<br/>IT'S MEANT TO HELP MUNICIPALITIES BECOME MORE RESILIENT TO EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS LIKE FLOODING AND FIRES.<br/>NOW WE OFTEN HEAR YOU TALKING ABOUT THE URGENCY OF THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE.</p><p><br/>TODAY'S INITIATIVE WAS ANNOUNCED IN 2022.<br/>APPLICATIONS ONLY OPENING UP TODAY.<br/>OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME FOR THAT MONEY TO ACTUALLY GET OUT THE DOOR AND HELP THE COMMUNITY WHO NEED IT.<br/>HOW SATISFIED ARE YOU WITH THE PACE YOU'RE OPERATING AT?<br/>   WELL, THE FIRST THING I SHOULD SAY IS THAT TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF $530 MILLION INVESTMENT WITH THE FEDERATION OF CANADIAN MUNICIPALITIES IS THE FIRST EVER DEDICATED FUND FOR ADAPTATION WITH MUNICIPALITIES.<br/>NOW OUR GOVERNMENT HASN'T -- WE HAVE NOT WAITED FOR THIS TO START INVESTING IN ADAPTATION MEASURES.<br/>WE HAVE INVESTED NORTH OF $6 BILLION ALREADY SINCE 2017 IN PROJECTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO HELP COMMUNITIES BE BETTER PREPARED TO FACE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.<br/>BUT THIS ONE IS REALLY DEDICATED FOR MUNICIPALITIES WITH THE FCM.<br/>AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THIS PARTNERSHIP.<br/>IT WILL HELP SUPPORT ABOUT 1400 PROJECTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.<br/>BOTH IN TERMS OF BUILDING CAPACITY BUT ACTUAL PROJECTS IN THE MUNICIPALITIES AND COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.<br/>   CATHERINE: YOU TALK ABOUT THE BILLIONS YOU'VE INVESTED.<br/>BUT AN ANALYSIS BY THE FEDERATION OF MUNICIPALITIES ALONG WITH THE  INSURANCE BUREAU OF CANADA -- I KNOW YOU NOW THIS NUMBER WELL -- $3.5 BILLION A YEAR TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE.<br/>HOW WELL ARE YOU DOING MEETING THE NEED WHEN IT'S A SCALE THAT LARGE?<br/>   OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT ALL FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.<br/>BUT RIGHTLY SO, WE NEED TO INVEST MORE IN ADAPTATION AND BEING BETTER PREPARED TO FACE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.<br/>THE FEDERATION OF CANADIAN MUNICIPALITIES SAID THEY WOULD NEED ABOUT $10 BILLION.<br/>WE'VE ALREADY INVESTED -- WITH TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT, WE'RE NORTH OF 7 BILLION.<br/>SO WE UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO DO MORE.<br/>AND I WILL CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE THAT WE DO MORE TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES WHETHER IT'S BEING BETTER PREPARED TO FACE THE IMPACTS OF FLOODING, HEAT WAVES, HURRICANES, AND OBVIOUSLY FOREST FIRES, CERTAINLY, SOMETHING WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE ACROSS THE COUNTRY.<br/>   CATHERINE: OBVIOUSLY THE DISCUSSION AROUND THE CARBON TAX IS ONE OF THE DOMINANT ISSUES IN YOUR FILE.<br/>AND LAST WEEK WE HAD THE PBO ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HIS OFFICE MADE WHAT HE CALLED AN INADVERTENT ERROR IN THE CARBON PRICING REPORTS INCLUDING THE INDUSTRIAL PRICE.<br/>HE SAYS WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE NEW NUMBERS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BUT THAT ULTIMATELY IT SHOULDN'T ALTER THE OVERALL CONCLUSIONS.<br/>HE IS STEADFAST ABOUT THAT POINT.<br/>DO YOU ACCEPT THAT ANALYSIS?<br/>   I DON'T.<br/>I MEAN I'VE HEARD THE PARLIAMENTARY BUDGET OFFICER SAY OFTEN IN THE PAST THAT WE SHOULD WAIT TO HAVE ANALYSIS BEFORE MAKING CONCLUSIONS.<br/>AND HE'S DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THAT.<br/>HE IS SAYING, WELL, WE MADE A MISTAKE IN OUR LAST ANALYSIS -- AND I SHOULD POINT OUT THEY DIDN'T EXACTLY COME CLEAN, LET'S BE HONEST HERE.<br/>WE THANK YOU AN UPDATE ON THEIR WEBSITE ON APRIL 17TH.<br/>THEY DIDN'T PUBLISH ANYTHING.<br/>THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION.<br/>WE HAD TO FIND IT AND NOW HE'S SEEING, WELL, WE MADE A MISTAKE WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANY ANALYSIS, I'M CONFIDENT THAT IT WON'T CHANGE OUR CONCLUSION.<br/>I MEAN, I THINK THAT THE PARLIAMENTARY BUDGET OFFICER IS A VERY IMPORTANT INSTITUTION IN OUR PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM.<br/>AND AS SUCH, THEY SHOULD BE HELD, AS WE ARE, AS POLITICIANS, TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS.<br/>AND I THINK CANADIANS EXPECT THAT FROM THE PBO AND I THINK PARLIAMENTARIANS EXPECT THAT, AS WELL.<br/>   CATHERINE: HE'S NOT DRAWING A CONCLUSION IN THE SENSE HE'S NOT OFFERING UP A NEW NUMBER.<br/>BUT HE'S SAYING IF I LOOK AT THE SCALE HERE, BASED ON THE FACTS, YOU KNOW, INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS ARE EXEMPT ABOUT 80% FOR THE BIG EMITTERS.<br/>IT'S ONLY 20% OF THE TOP EMISSIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE CARBON TAX.<br/>LOOKING AT THE SCALE, HE SAYS, IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO CHANGE THINGS.<br/>CAN YOU POINT TO ANYTHING TO SAY THAT HE'S GETTING IT WRONG, MINISTER?<br/>   WELL, THERE ARE A LOT OF SHORTCUTS THERE.<br/>AND ESTIMATION AND BACK OF THE ENVELOPE.<br/>I SINCERELY HOPE THAT'S NOT THE PARLIAMENTARY BUDGET OFFICER RUNS HIS OFFICE AND THAT THE ANALYSIS THAT WILL BE DONE --<br/>   SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE WORRIED IT IS, MINISTER.<br/>YOU STOPPED SHORT OF SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE FAITH IN HIM.<br/>I HAVEN'T HEARD ONCE YOU SAY YOU DO IN THE QUESTIONS ASKED BY REPORTERS TODAY.<br/>   NO, I HAVEN'T SAID THAT.<br/>BUT I THINK THE ANALYSIS AND THE CONCLUSIONS AND THE STATEMENT BY THE PBO SHOULD BE RIGOROUS AND THEY SHOULD BE BASED ON SOLID ANALYSIS AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT.<br/>WE DON'T HAVE SOLID ANALYSIS, AND IN FACT, WHAT THE PBO HAS SAID HAS BEEN CONTRADICTED BY A NUMBER OF -- MORE THAN 300 ECONOMISTS IN CANADA.<br/>INCLUDING ONE OF THEM WHO WON THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR HIS WORK ON CARBON PRICING.<br/>IT'S BEEN -- IT'S BEEN DISPUTED BY INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATIONS OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT.<br/>SO I THINK IF I WAS THE PARLIAMENTARY BUDGET OFFICER I WOULD BE CAREFUL, I GUESS, IS WHAT I'M SAYING BY JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS.<br/>LET'S LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS, AND MY DEPARTMENT IS HAPPY TO WORK WITH HIM, AND PROVIDE HIM WITH ALL OF THE INFORMATION HE NEEDS, SHOWING WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT.<br/>   CATHERINE: MINISTER, YOU SAY BE CAREFUL.<br/>YOU WON'T SAY YOU DO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN HIM, DO YOU THINK HE'S DONE HIS JOB PROPERLY ON THIS ISSUE?<br/>   I...<br/>I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED RECENTLY IS BELOW THE STANDARD THAT I WOULD EXPECT FROM THE PARLIAMENTARY BUDGET OFFICER AND THAT MANY CANADIANS AND PARLIAMENTARIANS WOULD EXPECT.<br/>   CATHERINE: HE POINTED OUT ON THIS PROGRAM THAT NO ONE ELSE NOTICED.<br/>IF IT WAS SUCH A BIG MISTAKE, HE SAYS THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.<br/>ALL SORTS OF FOLKS HAVE COMBED THROUGH THEM.<br/>HOW BIG A MISTAKE CAN BE IF ULTIMATELY THE PBO IS FIRST PICKED UP ON THE PROBLEM.<br/>   THAT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE SOMEONE WHO IS TRYING TO DEFEND AN ERROR AND MISTAKE THEY MADE THAN SOMEONE SAYING HERE IS RIGOROUS ANALYSIS THAT I'M PRESENTING TO YOU AND THAT I'M STANDING BY.<br/>THAT IS HOW IT APPEARS TO ME.<br/>AND ONE THING WE SHOULDN'T LOSE SIGHT OF IS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE COST OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE FIRST PART OF THE INTERVIEW, THE PARLIAMENTARY BUDGET OFFICER ADMITS HIMSELF THAT HIS ANALYSIS DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS ON CANADIANS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH ARE NOW -- THEY'VE INCREASED TENFOLD IN THE LAST DECADE.<br/>IT WAS $200 MILLION TEN YEARS AGO.<br/>IT'S 2 BILLION NOW.<br/>AND LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE FOREST FIRE, IT WILL BE NORTH OF $3 BILLION.<br/>THAT'S NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT IN HIS ANALYSIS, AND HE'S HAVE BEEN WE CLEAR ABOUT THAT.<br/>   MINISTER, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ASK YOU THIS:  DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ONCE THE NUMBERS ARE CORRECTED AND NOW THAT THIS ERROR HAS BEEN BROUGHT OUT IN THE OPEN, IS THIS GOING TO CHANGE ANYBODY'S MIND AT THE END OF THE DAY ON THE ISSUE OF THE CARBON TAX?<br/>   WELL, I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE INFORMED DEBATE ON THESE IMPORTANT THINGS AND NOW THAT THE PBO CAME OUT AND SAID THAT HE MADE A MISTAKE, I'M HOPING -- I'M NOT HOLDING MY BREATH.<br/>BUT I'M HOPING THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF CANADA WHO HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR THE LAST YEAR BASED ON THE ERRONEOUS FINDINGS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY BUDGET OFFICER ON CARBON PRICING THAT THEY TOO WILL ADMIT THEY MADE A MISTAKE.<br/>ONE CAN ALWAYS HOPE.<br/>   CATHERINE: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CONSERVATIVES, BECAUSE YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE MARK HOLLAND, I WAS IN QUESTION PERIOD WHEN YOU WERE TRYING TO CLAP BACK AGAINST THEM AS THE KIDS WOULD SAY, AND MARK HOLLAND WAS UP, AND YOU WERE UP SAYING MATH IS HARD WHEN THE CONSERVATIVES TALK ABOUT THIS SUMMER HOLIDAY FROM THE CARBON TAX THAT THEIR NUMBERS DON'T, IN YOUR WORDS MAKE ANY SENSE.<br/>MR. HOLLAND GOT UP AND TALKED ABOUT HOW LONG A PERSON HAVE TO BE ON A ROAD TRIP STUCK IN THE CAR.<br/>I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT CLIP IS GETTING A LOT OF PICKUP ONLINE AND A LOT OF VOTERS THINK THAT THE LIBERALS ARE TAKING A STAND AGAINST SUMMER ROAD TRIPS.<br/>WHAT DOES IT SAY THAT CANADIANS THINK ABOUT YOUR GOVERNMENT THAT YOU WOULD REALLY TAKE A POSITION LIKE THAT?<br/>   IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF CANADA AND PIERRE POILIEVRE DOING DISINFORMATION WITH CANADIANS.<br/>I WAS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WHEN MINISTER HOLLAND SPOKE.<br/>AND THE REALITY IS THAT THE SAVINGS THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF CANADA IS CLAIMING BASED ON THIS TAX BREAK THAT WOULD COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WE CAN GET BACK TO THAT.<br/>IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THOSE SAVINGS, YOU WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE -- AND LAST WEEK WE WERE SAYING BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS 37,000 KILOMETRES.<br/>SO THAT'S -- ALMOST TWO ROUND TRIPS -- A ROUND TRIP FROM THE NORTH POLE TO THE SOUTH POLE.<br/>   I'M ASKING A MORE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION, MINISTER.<br/>IF PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS AND YOU GUYS WOULD COME OUT AGAINST ROAD TRIPS, DOES IT TELL YOU YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WHERE CANADIANS THINK -- AT LEAST SOME CANADIANS THINK YOUR GOVERNMENT'S VALUES ARE, THEY THINK YOU WOULD TAKE A POSITION LIKE THIS?<br/>   UNFORTUNATELY, CATHERINE, WE LIVE IN A TIME NOW, AND IT'S TRUE IN CANADA AND IT'S TRUE OF MANY PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE FACTS DON'T MATTER.<br/>WHERE THE TRUTH DOESN'T MATTER.<br/>AND WHEN -- WHERE SOME POLITICIANS -- IT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE WITH THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF CANADA BELIEVE THEY CAN SAY ANYTHING, EVEN IF IT'S A LIE, EVEN IF IT'S MISLEADING, EVEN IF IT'S MISINFORMATION WITH CANADIANS AND GET AWAY WITH IT.<br/>IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY WE SEE THE WAVE OF POPULISM.<br/>IT'S NOT HAPPENING HERE.<br/>YOU SEE IT SOUTH OF THE BORDER, SEEING IT IN SOUTH AMERICA, AND NO ONE IS IMMUNE TO THAT.<br/>I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT PEOPLE TAKE THE TIME TO GO BEYOND THE BUMPER STICKER PHRASE AND WHAT'S BEING OFFERED BY THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF CANADA AND LOOK A LITTLE BIT UNDER THE HOOD.<br/>   CATHERINE: OKAY.<br/>I GET YOU THERE, UNDER THE HOOD.<br/>ROAD TRIP.<br/>I SEE WHAT YOU DID, MINISTER.<br/>WE'RE OUT OF TIME, AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS THE LAST ROAD TRIP PUN FOR TODAY.<br/>MINISTER STEVEN GUILBEAULT.<br/>MOSCOW IS WARNING OF SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES IF UKRAINE WEAPONS PROVIDED BY THE UNITED STATES TO STRIKE INSIDE RUSSIA.<br/>UP NEXT, HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER AND NOBEL PRIZE WINNER ON HOW REAL THIS THREAT IS.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCBCT-PP2406037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCBCT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C5Y-0DM1-F0BD-C03B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487018</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Cyprus Electricity Authority officials said they hope to have power restored to at least seven villages by Monday evening.</p><p>Search crews on Sunday discovered the bodies of four people who are believed to be Egyptian laborers outside the village of Orou on the southern edge of Cyprus\u2019 main Troodos mountain range. </p><p>The men, ages 22 to 29, had gone missing Saturday afternoon when the fire began outside the nearby village of Arakapas and spread quickly amid strong winds.</p><p>Officials said the four tried to flee the fire along a dirt mountain track, but their small truck veered off the road and fell down an embankment. They tried to flee on foot, but didn\u2019t make it.</p><p>Trade Union PEO has asked for a full investigation into the laborers' deaths as well as their work safety conditions.</p><p>President Nicos Anastasiades called the fire \u201can unprecedented tragedy\u201d for Cyprus except for the destruction wreaked by a 1974 war that split the island along ethnic lines after Turkey invaded in response to a coup aimed at union with Greece. </p><p>Some area residents who lost their homes and property to the fire wept as they described seeing a lifetime\u2019s worth of labor going up in flames. People were allowed back to their homes after their villages were declared safe.</p><p>Anastasiades, who toured the fire-hit villages on Sunday, pledged immediate government help to farmers and homeowners who lost crops and property and the families of those who perished in the fire. </p><p>Crews are already assessing the damage so that fire-afflicted residents can receive the first compensation packages later this week.</p><p>Anastasiades on Monday opened up a bank account for private contributions to help those who lost their homes and livelihoods.</p><p>Police spokesman Christos Andreou told The Associated Press that a 67-year-old man is being investigated on arson charges. He said \u201cmore than one witness\u201d had seen the man leave his orchard shortly before a fire broke out there. A court ordered that he remain in custody for eight days.</p><p>Fire crews had been joined by police officers, soldiers, Civil Defense and Wildlife Service staff as well as many members of the public who volunteered to help. Authorities said more than 70 fire engines, 14 bulldozers and numerous water tankers were mobilized, while a National Guard drone provided eyes overhead to locate new fire fronts.</p><p>A total of nine Cypriot firefighting aircraft, and police and National Guard helicopters were deployed.

The chief said he was starting to see a level of anxiety among residents, who had been encouraged to stay inside and close their windows because of the smoke.</p><p>\"Some couldn't even run air exchangers or air conditioners because they could still smell the smoke, so we have to think of the health of the people,\" he said.</p><p>The evacuation order was shaped by an incident earlier this month when Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault told a news conference that Mistissini was preparing to evacuate - a claim that was quickly contradicted by Petawabno.</p><p>The Canadian Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-news20230624TNI2023062468282481</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68J3-KCB1-F197-5486-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"216\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Sajjan, issued the following statement:</p><p>\"Every day, Canadian firefighters put themselves in danger to help protect and save lives in their communities. Firefighters' National Memorial Day is an annual commemorative day to reflect on the bravery and dedication of firefighters nationwide. The flags at half-mast across Canada today are a somber reminder of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, and a way to honour fallen firefighters and their legacy.</p><p>This is an exceptional year to express our gratitude to firefighters. As we continue to witness the worst and most destructive wildfire season in Canada's history, our heroic firefighters have been at the forefront working tirelessly for months to keep Canadians safe. They are being challenged every day, battling the ongoing flames that have burned millions of hectares across the country.</p><p>Additionally, I would like to recognize our courageous volunteer and international firefighters who have joined the front lines to support the ongoing efforts to suppress the wildfires. Your admirable sacrifice to keep our communities safe during these devastating events is appreciated by all Canadians.</p><p>I would also like to commend the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre's vital work for coordinating resource and information sharing, and providing daily situational reports with national and international partners. </p><p>As climate change contributes to increasingly frequent and severe disasters, including wildfires, it is even more important to recognize the sacrifices of those who are on the front lines, especially during the record-breaking wildfire season that Canada is experiencing this year.</p><p>Today, on Firefighters' National Memorial Day, I urge you all to take a moment and reflect on the courageous acts performed by Canadian, volunteer, and international firefighters across our nation, and to honour those who have lost their lives in the line of duty.</p><p>On behalf of the Government of Canada, I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to all of our firefighters.\"</p><p>SOURCE  Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada</p><p> View original content: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2023/10/c6865.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2023/10/c6865.html</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNW-20230910C6865</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:694S-4T61-DYRK-D001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"402\"/><timeReceived>10:30 AM Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CNW Group</copyright><publicationName>Canada NewsWire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 10, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Fueled by powerful seasonal winds coming off the Mediterranean, the fire had spread across 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) of forest by Tuesday morning, according to the Var regional administration.</p><p>Some 6,000 people were evacuated from homes and a dozen campgrounds while others were locked down in a holiday center for Air France employees. At least 22 people suffered from smoke inhalation or minor fire-related injuries and two firefighters were among the injured, officials said.</p><p>Macron, who has been vacationing in a nearby coastal fortress, visited the fire zone on Tuesday.</p><p>\u201cThe worst has been avoided,\u201d Macron said, praising the efforts of over 900 firefighters and the deployment of 11 water-dumping planes. </p><p>The destroyed landscape is \"absolutely terrible in terms of biodiversity and of natural heritage ... but lives have been protected,\" he said.</p><p>Water-dumping planes and emergency helicopters zipped back and forth Tuesday over hills lined with chestnut, pine and oak trees. Images shared online by firefighters showed black plumes of smoke leaping across thickets of trees as the flames darted across dry brush.</p><p>Carlo Zaglia, spokesman for the region\u2019s firefighters, described \u201ca violent fire\u201d raging in the low mountain range of the Maures, making it \u201cvery difficult for firefighters to reach the trees and battle the fire.\u201d</p><p>One evacuee told France-Bleu that smoke enveloped his car as he returned to his campsite and he barely had time to grab his baby daughter's milk and basic belongings before fleeing. Another told BFM television about escaping as his hotel caught fire. </p><p>Local authorities closed roads, blocked access to forests and urged caution. Officials warned that the fire risk would remain very high through Wednesday because of hot, dry weather. Temperatures have reached 40 degrees C (104 F) in recent days.</p><p>Such extreme weather is expected happen more frequently as the planet is warming. Climate scientists say there's little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving extreme events, such as heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods and storms.</p><p>Intense heat and wildfires have also struck other Mediterranean countries in recent weeks, with fires killing at least 75 people in Algeria and 16 in Turkey. </p><p>In Greece on Tuesday, hundreds of firefighters backed by water-dropping planes were battling a large forest fire that forced the evacuation of a nursing home and several villages northwest of Athens. Hundreds of wildfires have burned across Greece t his month, fueled by the country\u2019s longest and most severe heat wave in decades. </p><p>Also Tuesday, Israeli firefighters worked for a third consecutive day to contain a wildfire that has consumed a large swath of forest west of Jerusalem.</p><p>Worsening drought and heat \u2014 linked to climate change \u2014 have also fueled wildfires this summer in the western United States and in Russia\u2019s northern Siberia region.</p><p>___</p><p>Charlton contributed from Paris.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow all AP stories on climate change developments at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-5f16e1fe10d9b8c14dd16a83a39da30c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63CY-TCN1-JBVR-309P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"616\"/><timeReceived>01:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 17, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It's fueling demand for new solutions, and now a Quebec space robotics company is using AI to help track flames and predict wildfire growth. CTV's Angela Mackenzie explains.</p><p>ANGELA MACKENZIE (Reporter): It has been the worst Canadian wildfire season on record, leaving authorities searching for new ways to better manage forest fires in the future.</p><p>KATRINA ALBERT (Lux Aerobot President &amp; Co-Founder): Here we have the balloon.</p><p>MACKENZIE: Katrina Albert says her Quebec startup, Lux Aerobot has developed the perfect solution.</p><p>ALBERT: We build and operate high-altitude platforms for earth observation.</p><p>MACKENZIE: Balloons like this one filled with helium or launched into the stratosphere 20 kilometers high. Powered by Ai and equipped with thermal cameras, Albert says they can stay in the air for days, taking high-resolution images. The technology not only detects wildfires, but can predict how they'll grow over time, and that data can then be instantly shared with authorities on the ground.</p><p>ALBERT: Preventing the fires from expanding and then potentially damaging infrastructure, and obviously have an impact on the population. But also you prevent them from emitting CO2.</p><p>MACKENZIE: Those fires also affected air quality in cities far from the flames.</p><p>OLIVER LUNDQVIST (Sopfeu Director): It's a season like we couldn't even have imagined.</p><p>MACKENZIE: Forest fire, prevention agencies like Quebec's Sopfeu tend to use costly options to get images of remote fires. They send planes and rely heavily on satellites.</p><p>LUNDQVIST: We really only get one or two images per day, and then as soon as you have cloud cover then that's not even that useful.</p><p>MACKENZIE: Sopfeu is planning to conduct field tests with the company next year. The founders recently made their pitch on the show Dragons Den, striking a deal with well known entrepreneur Robert Herjavec, who agreed to invest $500,000. And while wildfires are perhaps the most obvious application for Lux Aerobot, the company says it has potential to help in all sorts of situations, especially those related to climate change. Everything from surveying floods, to monitoring coastal erosion, and helping with Arctic security.</p><p>ALBERT: Investing in new innovation that will help us address these challenges that are to come.</p><p>MACKENZIE: Challenges they hope to rise above.

Prosecutors allege Par\u00e9 deliberately ignited a fire or explosion \"on several occasions\" in a forest between July 8 and Tuesday. A second arson charge is in connection with a fire at a fishing cabin around May 31 that was not owned by the accused.</p><p>Provincial police say they are trying to determine whether the fires allegedly started by Par\u00e9 were connected to the major wildfires near Chibougamau, located 450 kilometres northwest of Quebec City, that led to the evacuation of its 7,500 residents in June. </p><p>\"The investigation isn't over, we still have to see if there's a link to the principle forest fires that burned in the Chibougamau area,\" Sgt. Hugues Beaulieu said in an interview Friday. \"There's a lot of work to do, but for the moment we were able to recommend two charges.\"</p><p>Beaulieu said the case started with the investigation into the fishing cabin fire, during which police found evidence that led them to Thursday's arrest. Along the way, Beaulieu said, police were assisted by behaviour analysis experts, criminal profilers, and forensic psychologists.</p><p>Chibougamau Mayor Manon Cyr says she was relieved when she learned of Par\u00e9's arrest. In an interview Friday, the mayor said the fires that Par\u00e9 is accused of starting were unrelated to the two massive wildfires that forced the evacuation of the town in June. </p><p>\"We'll see what's said in court on this,\" Cyr said. \"But the big fires that caused the evacuation were caused by lightning.\"</p><p>However, Par\u00e9 is accused of deliberately starting fires at a time when the government had temporarily banned open-air fires and forbade people from entering the forests. </p><p>Chibougamau was evacuated on June 6 for about one week because of wildfires and poor air quality.</p><p>Quebec had an unprecedented forest fire season this year, with almost 15,000 square kilometres burned.</p><p>The force's major crimes unit is handling the investigation, Beaulieu said.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 8, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-9825b2adb85d445c815da10096ee222d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:694H-SS81-DY9S-T0K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"372\"/><timeReceived>02:36 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 8, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations. However, the risk is relatively low overall.</p><p>The Trozzo wildfire started on July 9, 2021, and burned 5,992 hectares within the Lemon Creek, Trozzo Creek, Winlaw Creek and Grohman Creek drainages, about eight kilometres from Winlaw. The fire forced hundreds of people out of their homes for several days as flames spread quickly in the record summer heatwave.</p><p>While no homes or structures were destroyed, a risk assessment was done this fall because of how the fire burned upstream and uphill from residential areas \u2013 increasing the danger posed by flooding or debris events. Forest fires can affect how well the soil absorbs water, while the loss of vegetation can undermine or weaken steeper slopes. That can make mud and debris slides more likely.</p><p>Heavily burned areas can create problems for water quality as well, and the report recommends the creation of a regular water testing program for the area.</p><p>\u201cWater quality could be affected by modified run-off conditions including changes to turbidity, biological contamination, flows (quantity and timing), and metal concentrations,\u201d it says. \u201cIt is recommended that a suitable water quality testing program be established on Lemon Creek, Trozzo Creek, and Winlaw Creek to assess and evaluate water quality.\u201d</p><p>The good news is the fire didn\u2019t burn as hot as feared in many areas, reducing the possible problems.</p><p>\u201cThe overall burn severity within the Lemon Creek and Winlaw Creek drainages is low,\u201d states the report. \u201cIt is unlikely that flooding will occur over these fans due only to post wildfire effects.\u201d</p><p>However, the authors go on to say that \u201cit is possible that landslides will occur in the [Lemon Creek drainage] and [Winlaw Creek drainage] that could result in temporary blockages of the creeks resulting in debris floods.\u201d</p><p>Trozzo concerns Of greater risk of problems is Trozzo Creek, which had higher overall burn severity (30 per cent moderate and 10 per cent high) than Lemon Creek (six per cent moderate, two per cent high) or Winlaw Creek (12 per cent moderate, two per cent high).</p><p>It had more highly-burned tributaries on steep slopes that could cause blockages. While that\u2019s a concern to keep an eye on, the problems will likely be more than five kilometres upstream from the creek\u2019s fan.</p><p>\u201cThe likelihood of flooding and/or debris floods is considered low to moderate,\u201d the report says, though it notes culverts along Highway 6 (especially Winlaw Creek), forest service roads in the high country, and some houses in the fan areas could be affected. It recommends backcountry roads, bridges and drainage infrastructure be regularly inspected and have an increased maintenance schedule.</p><p>The report also recommends against harvesting wood from the burned areas, a common practice after a forest fire.</p><p>\u201cSalvage harvesting of burned areas has the potential to increase the associated hazards and risks associated with flooding and landslides,\u201d it says. \u201cIt is recommended that no salvage harvesting take place within the drainages where there is a Moderate or High likelihood of post wildfire landslide or flooding hazards.\u201d</p><p>Electronic copies of the report should be sent to residents along the affected creeks.</p><p>And during freshet and heavy rainstorms, \u201cresidents should be diligent with regards to work/travel adjacent to the local creeks and be aware of any sudden changes to creek flows\u2026\u201d it says. \u201cResidents should familiarize themselves with the creeks, their location relative to the creeks, and where damages would be sustained if flooding were to occur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf changes are observed, they should be reported promptly to Emergency Management BC,\u201d it adds.</p><p>Valley Voice</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARLNWS-news20220310HZQA0002505970</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARLNWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64YT-WH61-JD2C-J25P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438269</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"689\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.
