(\"CNER\" or the \"Company\"), a publicly traded pioneer in mobile, modular waste-to-energy systems, unveiled a decentralized microgrid platform for AI computing and crypto mining powered by the Company's bioReactor. Lab and field-tested on wood residues and a cattle manure stream, the decentralized system can supply approximately 1 GWh of net, dispatchable electricity-creating a local, scalable baseload without waiting years for centralized micro nuclear power generation.</p><p>\"AI and High-Performance Computing (\"HPC\") need reliable, price-certain power now,\" said Gary Bartholomew, Chairman &amp;CEO. \"Our containerized bioreactors turn various biomass and residuals into watts at the source-solving grid constraints while cleaning up two of the hardest waste streams on the planet.\"</p><p>Waste to Watts-and Carbon Removal</p><p>Each factory-built 40 container (stackable or mobile) converts biowaste into three value streams: * Syngas electricity/heat for behind-the-meter microgrids or export; * Biochar for durable carbon sequestration and soil performance; * Biocarbon, high-grade and specialty carbon replacement products * Soil amendment additives supporting soil pH, reducing invasive species in reclaimed lands, and post forest fire</p><p>Excess biochar blended with bio-stimulants is structured for high-quality carbon removal credits targeting enterprise buyers seeking verifiable offsets. Leading technology companies have publicly committed to purchasing durable carbon removal; bioEnergy's products are being prepared for that market.</p><p>A parallel wood-waste pathway delivers comparable output subject to residue availability, enabling a blended, redundant power supply for 24/7 operations.</p><p>Why It Matters for AI/HPC &amp;Industrial Campuses * Speed: containerized deployment and rapid commissioning - months, not years. * Low Cost of Operations: Operating cost for power generation is 5-10% of micro-nuclear power generation * Resilience: on-site fuel and islandable microgrid architecture. * Decarbonization: methane avoidance, diesel/grid displacement, and permanent carbon storage in biochar. * Waste: No waste stream produced from power production * Economics: stacked value from power, certified products, and potential carbon-removal credits.</p><p>Availability - bioEnergy is engaging hyperscalers, colocation providers, and industrial operators for co-location pilots and long-term offtake structures now (power-as-a-service or utility JVs). Typical micro-grid configurations are available from 1.5 MWh to 1 GWh.

The invitation gives a six point explanation of what an OCP is. My intention here is to focus on the last two words of the sixth point:climate change. I am not focusing on how to prevent or minimize climate change; too many of the world\u2019s \u201cDrill Baby Drill\u201d politicians have made such a mockery of the 1.5\u00b0 global warming ceiling that a 2\u00b0 or even a 2.5\u00b0 limit may now be exceeded. With greater frequency of weather extremes all but inevitable, what could we, as a community, do in anticipation of the resulting emergencies?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We may get helpful information about what to expect from a visit to Heritage Park Museum\u2019s \u201cHeat and Hope:Global Climate Change, Local Consequences\u201d exhibit, but we cannot look back and learn from the ways we dealt with nature\u2019s tantrums the last time we experienced climate change. Climate change has no history; that is a problem. How can we plan for the unknown?</p><p>What if our region were to experience a fire season worse than what the Prairie provinces are experiencing this year? Should our OCP contain a policy calling on the city to meet with local hotels to determine our emergency shelter capacity for regional fire refugees? The city could write a plan for emergency shelter space allocation as an alternative to having fire refugees from this region flown to distant cities. Along these lines, how about a policy calling on the city to meet with local farmers to explore our capacity to provide shelter for farm animals caught in a forest fire evacuation zone?</p><p>What if the Highway 16 transportation corridor were blocked for an extended period by an unspecified natural catastrophe? Should an OCP policy call on the city to meet with local supermarkets to develop an emergency ration distribution plan, a scheme to ensure that everyone in town has assured access to basic needs until our transportation infrastructure is restored? What if our electricity supply were to be interrupted for an extended period? Should our OCP include a policy calling on the city to identify and secure minimal electricity supply capacity to serve the community in an emergency? What if \u2026?</p><p>The city is looking at a 20-year horizon for its climate adaptation strategies. Should we worry that, looking back from the year 2050, some OCP climate change adaption strategies adopted in 2025 should now be dismissed for being silly? Would that matter? On the other hand, if a 2025 OCP climate change adaption strategy should be proven to have been a factor in just one life having been saved, that would be cause for celebration.</p><p>We can learn a valuable lesson from the recent Kerr County, Texas, catastrophe. The US weather service had issued rain storm warnings for the region, but these warnings never reached Kerr County\u2019s residents. The Guadalupe River torrent killed over 100 people. It can be argued, however, that the cause of these tragic deaths was not a torrential flood; the cause was the absence of an effective warning system to alert Kerr County residents in time to allow them to flee to higher ground before the Guadalupe River\u2019s floodwaters reached their community.</p><p>The OCP review\u2019s philosophical objective should be a resolve to protect Terrace from ever becoming Canada\u2019s own Kerr County with its deadly \u201cflash flood alley\u201d.</p><p>Andr\u00e9 Carrel is a retired public sector administrator living in Terrace, B.C.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TERSTN-news20250731PSWA0004862993</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TERSTN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCY-J4K3-RXT0-722Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438220</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"571\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

The Squamish Chief joined a tour at local apiary Bee Wild to learn how one woman is changing the way we think about bees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Creating something \u2018bee-autiful\u2019 can give you a buzz (maybe that\u2019s \u2018punny\u2019), but it\u2019s quite literally how an apiary in Paradise Valley came about.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bee Wild is a family-oriented apiary, located at 4311 Paradise Valley Road, that actively works with nature in a reciprocal way, in order to remain self-sufficient. In other words, it works with what is known as a permaculture system, or regenerative farming, so that wildlife and biodiversity can thrive.</p><p>The Squamish Chief joined one of the apiary\u2019s Bee Adventure tours on Aug. 15 to discover more about Bee Wild\u2019s methods, and to capture some \u2018bee-roll\u2019 for visuals (ok, let\u2019s stop that now.)</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been a passion of mine to make something beautiful out of the land [and] I really was passionate about making [Paradise Valley] a beautiful place. Just through [wildlife] interactions out here and seeing the world come to life\u2026 I thought, \u2018Why not try beekeeping as another way I can interact with the world around me, and as a way that gives back to the land as well?\u2019\u201d Bee Wild founder and apiarist AnnaMarie Rutishauser told The Squamish Chief.</p><p>Rutishauser showed the tour group her permaculture-based garden, explaining how the native wildflowers, plants, and trees all worked together, and how she had wanted to re-create these interactions in nature.</p><p>She said the growth of flowers and fruit naturally attracted bees and pollinators, so bee-keeping seemed a logical step forward in conserving the beauty of the land.</p><p>Rutishauser also showed the group the bees, which were collected on each frame of the hives (each honeycomb frame takes between two and four weeks for the worker bees to fill), using a blower to create smoke and air pressure, so that the bees would move safely towards the bottom of the hive. She explained the smell of the smoke made the bees instinctively gather around their honey to protect it, as if defending it from a forest fire, and minimizing contact with humans upon inspection or honey harvesting.</p><p>She said bees typically begin to build their hives around May, and their honey is harvested through to September. It typically takes 12 bees to produce one teaspoon of honey.</p><p>Rutishauser explained the process of starting a bee colony to The Squamish Chief. She said bees can be bought as packages from New Zealand and shipped over. You place your bees in a hive body you have created, and the honeycomb frames can be bought ready-made to accommodate the bees\u2019 honey cell and wax production. Their production expands over time, depending on how they thrive in the environment that you provide, until you can split the hives and raise \u201clocally mated\u201d queen bees.</p><p>Rutishauser said an aspiration for Bee Wild is to become a more self-sustainable apiary over time. More immediately, she hopes that one of the hives, which is currently without a queen bee, will produce its own \u201clocally mated\u201d queen.</p><p>She explained that queen bees, which can live for up to three to five years, are the only bee that mates with the drones\u2014the fewer male bees, which are identifiable by their distinguishable black or brown colour, and are slightly larger in size\u2014and that she can produce over 3,000 eggs per day.</p><p>Her eggs are fed royal jelly\u2014a nutrient-rich secretion produced by worker bees\u2014and the first egg to hatch becomes the new queen.</p><p>Rutishauser said that Bee Wild started with two hives, and to date, it now has 11, with around 30,000 bees per hive. Only the honey from the top tier of the hives is harvested, which is the surplus amount. This surplus honey accounts for around 10 to 20% overall, meaning the bees have enough food to survive.</p><p>The tour ended with a honey-tasting session; the group was able to dip teaspoons in a jar of the harvested honey (harvested on a separate occasion), to sample.</p><p>Rutishauser has been beekeeping for over four years now. Originally from Vancouver Island, she said she relocated to Squamish in 2008 to raise her family and to create a home where they felt they could thrive in nature, and learn about the impact of their daily actions.</p><p>She said she wants to keep expanding tours in the Sea to Sky Corridor to help people have a similar experience; to have them interact in a way that also makes them aware of their day-to-day actions in nature.</p><p>Bee Wild produces and sells raw, unfiltered, and unpasteurized honey that is \u201ctrue to nature,\u201d according to their website. On the website, folks may also book a Bee Adventure Tour, and /or a Honey Tour Experience this summer. Updates about the apiary and their tours are also on Facebook and Instagram.\u00a0</p><p>General inquiries may be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:beewildparadisevalley@gmail.com\">beewildparadisevalley@gmail.com</email></p><p>Ina Pace is The Squamish Chief's Local Journalism Initiative (LJI) reporter.</p><p>This reporting was produced through the\u2002LJI, which supports original civic journalism across Canada.</p><p>The Squamish Business Beat was developed in response to local demand for more business-focused news.

While this means veteran firefighters can get compensation for previous exposure to toxic substances, it also left the provincial government scrambling to protect the fire rangers on the job today.</p><p>Their solution: buffs.</p><p>The safety bulletin says the MNR is still studying exposure levels and appropriate protection and brought in the buffs as an interim measure on a \"nonmandatory, opt-in basis.\"</p><p>But introducing new personal protective equipment (PPE) has cleaved a culture clash between veterans, many of whom don't consider forest fire smoke to be dangerous, and a new generation of wildfire fighters who are more likely to want respiratory protection.</p><p>Both groups appear to agree on one thing: like cotton masks during COVID, the buffs are totally ineffective.</p><p>\"Nobody wears them other than the odd rookie,\" said Noah Freedman, a crew leader with 10 seasons experience fighting wildfires. \"You don't have to be a PhD to understand they don't do anything.\"</p><p>They don't have a good seal, they get dirty \"instantaneously\" and they're hot, making it hard to breathe, said Freedman, who is also vice-president of the wildland firefighter's union, OPSEU Local 703.</p><p>Meanwhile, a rookie fire ranger working in northwestern Ontario says half his crew members wear one but no crew bosses or supervisors do.</p><p>\"People don't take it very seriously,\" said the fire ranger, whom the Star agreed not to name because they aren't permitted to speak with the media. \"They say the safety briefings are just propaganda. Smoke is par for the course. It's what you sign up for.\"</p><p>\"Of course, I don't agree,\" they added. \"When I'm on the fire line, if I'm not wearing it, I can feel it in my lungs. My nose gets stuffy.</p><p>\"I highly doubt they are filtering out the worst stuff,\" said the fire ranger. \"But something's better than nothing.\"</p><p>In response to questions about the buff, Maria Votsis, spokesperson for Natural Resources Minister Mike Harris Jr. sent a statement saying the introduction of the buffs this year was not liked to the newly-won cancer coverage for firefighters.</p><p>\"The narrative suggested in your questions ... that the sole motivation behind the addition of masks to FireRanger's PPE is because they now have WSIB presumptive coverage for several cancers, linked to smoke exposure, is an irresponsible narrative and blatantly untrue,\" she wrote.</p><p>\"We are proud to be recognized as leaders in wildland firefighting safety, ensuring FireRanger teams are equipped with specialized equipment to keep them safe on the job,\" she wrote, adding that the buffs \"provide a measure of respiratory protection in the field.\" </p><p>Wildfire fighting presents unique challenges for determining the best way to protect workers, said Sandra Dorman, a professor in the Faculty of Health at Laurentian University and the director of the Centre for Research in Occupational Safety and Health.</p><p>Dorman, who has been studying forest firefighter health and safety at the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the MNR since 2007, says you can't just issue the same oxygen tank and full-mask respirator that municipal fire departments use.</p><p>Fire rangers spend entire days on the fire line and would quickly run out of oxygen. The extra weight would encumber the small helicopters that ferry people and equipment in and out of fires. The mask, some argue, would provide a false sense of security and get fire rangers into dangerous situations they never would have been in if they were breathing without assistance.</p><p>But perhaps worst of all, the respirators would exacerbate the already intense heat fire rangers encounter, increasing the likelihood of heat stroke, trading one health hazard for another.</p><p>\"It's another layer of heat entrapment,\" she said. \"I don't think anyone questions anymore the health effects of smoke. But this is a complex problem to solve.\"</p><p>Unlike B.C. wildfire fighters, who leave the fire overnight, Ontario's fire rangers camp for up to two weeks at remote fires, because there is no way in or out except by helicopter. This means fire fighters in B.C. get recovery time away from smoke, she said, while in Ontario, they're exposed 24 hours a day, which affects their bodies' ability to bounce back.</p><p>This season, Dorman is gathering data from air quality monitors that will be carried by fire rangers, positioned on the fire line and in base camp to help the MNR determine the best way to mitigate the effects of smoke.</p><p>\"How can we reduce exposure?\" she asked. \"What can we do at night in the tent to help recovery?\"</p><p>Previous studies Dorman carried out on Ontario wildland firefighters found they had increased inflammation in their airways due to smoke exposure and their lung volume was reduced at the end of a season.</p><p>\"They're absolutely getting exposed to too much,\" she said. \"The question is how can we gather information to better protect them in the future?\"</p><p>B.C. started issuing buffs with the rationale that anything is better than nothing, Dorman said.</p><p>Until Ontario is able to determine exactly what the levels of exposure are, and where respite might be found, the buffs act as a placeholder that indicates to fire rangers that more change is coming.</p><p>\"I'm not going to defend the buff. But I'm also not going to throw it in the garbage can,\" she said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025071376080541</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G82-7KS3-RRRH-11BS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1044\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Certain types of beetles seek out fires because trees are more susceptible to infestation, and birds such as the black-backed woodpecker soon follow to feed on the larvae, DeVink said.</p><p>Some mammals benefit because \"the influx of nutrients into the soil after a fire and the regeneration of grass and young vegetation creates a lot of forage and a lot of food for herbivores like rabbits and a lot of the ungulates: the deer, the moose and the elk,\" DeVink said.</p><p/><p>Large\u00a0animals like bears and deer are usually able to flee active fires, but newborns are particularly vulnerable this year because of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/heart-early-wildfire-season-humans-1.7560852#:~:text=On%20the%20Canadian%20Prairies%20this,of%20148%20by%20this%20time\">unusually early wildfire season</url>, said Iga Stasiak, a wildlife health specialist with the Ministry of Environment.</p><p>\"At this time of year, many species are giving birth, so younger animals, nestling birds or animals that may be less mobile, may be unable to escape the fire,\" Stasiak said.</p><p>That's what worried Ovide Michel when he and a group of firefighters in Pelican Narrows found a moose calf wandering alone near a highway about two weeks ago.\u00a0</p><p>\"He was on the road for two days and I thought the mother would find it,\" said Michel, the mayor of the Village of Pelican Narrows.\u00a0</p><p>The group decided to rescue the calf, but realized they couldn't keep it and released it back in the area. They continued watching over it, but after two days the calf was gone.</p><p>\"I'm hoping the mother came back and found it,\" Michel said.</p><p>It was a similar situation during the wildfire fight in the La Ronge area. Last week, Lac La Ronge Indian Band Chief Tammy Cook-Searson posted on social media that firefighters rescued a fawn that was wandering around a fireguard alone at night.\u00a0</p><p>\"The fawn was safely released to the wild, by conservation officers, in the vicinity it was rescued,\" Cook-Searson said in the post.</p><p/><p>The Ministry of Environment recommends people leaving young animals alone because it's not always certain they were abandoned, Stasiak said, adding that moose and deer in particular leave their young hidden in brush or grass throughout the day to protect them from predators.</p><p>\"People may feel those animals are orphaned, but usually the mother is nearby and they have the best chance of survival with the mother,\" Stasiak said.</p><p>Both experts said more research is needed to understand the long-term effects of wildfire on the boreal forest and its inhabitants.</p><p>\"Wildfire disturbance is a natural part of our ecosystem, but what we're seeing is more intense fires, greater frequencies of fire and hotter drier weather,\" Stasiak said.</p><p>\"This is a relatively new area that we're going to need to examine as the intensity and the frequency of these fires continues to increase with climate change.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Up-to-date info on active fires, smoke and related topics\u00a0is available at these sources:</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadasaskatchewanhowwildfiresaffectborealforestwildlife17562491</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2G-YFM3-RSXG-209N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

While this means veteran firefighters can get compensation for previous exposure to toxic substances, it also left the provincial government scrambling to protect the fire rangers on the job today.</p><p>Their solution: buffs.</p><p>The safety bulletin says the MNR is still studying exposure levels and appropriate protection and brought in the buffs as an interim measure on a \"nonmandatory, opt-in basis.\"</p><p>But introducing new personal protective equipment (PPE) has cleaved a culture clash between veterans, many of whom don't consider forest fire smoke to be dangerous, and a new generation of wildfire fighters who are more likely to want respiratory protection.</p><p>Both groups appear to agree on one thing: like cotton masks during COVID, the buffs are totally ineffective.</p><p>\"Nobody wears them other than the odd rookie,\" said Noah Freedman, a crew leader with 10 seasons experience fighting wildfires. \"You don't have to be a PhD to understand they don't do anything.\"</p><p>They don't have a good seal, they get dirty \"instantaneously\" and they're hot, making it hard to breathe, said Freedman, who is also vice-president of the wildland firefighter's union, OPSEU Local 703.</p><p>Meanwhile, a rookie fire ranger working in northwestern Ontario says half his crew members wear one but no crew bosses or supervisors do.</p><p>\"People don't take it very seriously,\" said the fire ranger, whom the Star agreed not to name because they aren't permitted to speak with the media. \"They say the safety briefings are just propaganda. Smoke is par for the course. It's what you sign up for.\"</p><p>\"Of course, I don't agree,\" they added. \"When I'm on the fire line, if I'm not wearing it, I can feel it in my lungs. My nose gets stuffy.</p><p>\"I highly doubt they are filtering out the worst stuff,\" said the fire ranger. \"But something's better than nothing.\"</p><p>In response to questions about the buff, Maria Votsis, spokesperson for Natural Resources Minister Mike Harris Jr. sent a statement saying the introduction of the buffs this year was not liked to the newly-won cancer coverage for firefighters.</p><p>\"The narrative suggested in your questions ... that the sole motivation behind the addition of masks to FireRanger's PPE is because they now have WSIB presumptive coverage for several cancers, linked to smoke exposure, is an irresponsible narrative and blatantly untrue,\" she wrote.</p><p>\"We are proud to be recognized as leaders in wildland firefighting safety, ensuring FireRanger teams are equipped with specialized equipment to keep them safe on the job,\" she wrote, adding that the buffs \"provide a measure of respiratory protection in the field.\" </p><p>Wildfire fighting presents unique challenges for determining the best way to protect workers, said Sandra Dorman, a professor in the Faculty of Health at Laurentian University and the director of the Centre for Research in Occupational Safety and Health.</p><p>Dorman, who has been studying forest firefighter health and safety at the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the MNR since 2007, says you can't just issue the same oxygen tank and full-mask respirator that municipal fire departments use.</p><p>Fire rangers spend entire days on the fire line and would quickly run out of oxygen. The extra weight would encumber the small helicopters that ferry people and equipment in and out of fires. The mask, some argue, would provide a false sense of security and get fire rangers into dangerous situations they never would have been in if they were breathing without assistance.</p><p>But perhaps worst of all, the respirators would exacerbate the already intense heat fire rangers encounter, increasing the likelihood of heat stroke, trading one health hazard for another.</p><p>\"It's another layer of heat entrapment,\" she said. \"I don't think anyone questions anymore the health effects of smoke. But this is a complex problem to solve.\"</p><p>Unlike B.C. wildfire fighters, who leave the fire overnight, Ontario's fire rangers camp for up to two weeks at remote fires, because there is no way in or out except by helicopter. This means fire fighters in B.C. get recovery time away from smoke, she said, while in Ontario, they're exposed 24 hours a day, which affects their bodies' ability to bounce back.</p><p>This season, Dorman is gathering data from air quality monitors that will be carried by fire rangers, positioned on the fire line and in base camp to help the MNR determine the best way to mitigate the effects of smoke.</p><p>\"How can we reduce exposure?\" she asked. \"What can we do at night in the tent to help recovery?\"</p><p>Previous studies Dorman carried out on Ontario wildland firefighters found they had increased inflammation in their airways due to smoke exposure and their lung volume was reduced at the end of a season.</p><p>\"They're absolutely getting exposed to too much,\" she said. \"The question is how can we gather information to better protect them in the future?\"</p><p>B.C. started issuing buffs with the rationale that anything is better than nothing, Dorman said.</p><p>Until Ontario is able to determine exactly what the levels of exposure are, and where respite might be found, the buffs act as a placeholder that indicates to fire rangers that more change is coming.</p><p>\"I'm not going to defend the buff. But I'm also not going to throw it in the garbage can,\" she said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WELTRI-2025071376080517</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WELTRI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G82-7KS3-RRRH-11D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433814</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1044\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Welland Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Welland Tribune (Ontario) Online</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 13, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

His 25 years of experience in fighting fires comes in handy, giving him a keen eye for features on a building or the surrounding landscape which may catch fire.</p><p>\u201cYour house isn\u2019t going to burn down because of a forest fire \u2013 your house is going to burn down from the embers thrown by a forest fire,\u201d he said.</p><p>In particular, Funk urges residents to make sure any gaps leading into their attic or deck are protected. A home\u2019s soffit \u2013 the material underneath the edge of the roof \u2013 often has holes or vents which embers can blow into, according to Funk. Once that happens, it\u2019s only a matter of time before an ember enters the attic and sets the top floor of a home ablaze \u2013 resulting in a structural fire that volunteer forces like the Blue River Volunteer Fire Department are not equipped to fight.</p><p>\u201cI always start at the top [during assessments], and what\u2019s on your roof,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can all fight ground fires, but once a fire gets in the attic, it\u2019s up top\u2026 it\u2019s a different type of fire.\u201d</p><p>Other common culprits include outdoor furniture and the space underneath a raised deck, Funk added. He suggests taking outdoor cushions inside after using them, and says three-millimeter wire mesh can be applied behind or over the lattice underneath decks to prevent embers from getting underneath. Wooden decks should also be kept hydrated, meaning owners should paint or stain them, he added.</p><p>Landscaping is another important tactic to protect homes during wildfires, according to Funk. Residents don\u2019t have to fall all the trees in their yard, but they should take care to remove any branches or long grasses within a five-foot radius from their home. Additionally, trees should be pruned to about six feet (two meters) above the ground, to ensure dead or low-hanging branches do not catch fire and serve as a pathway to light up the whole tree.</p><p>Blue River residents can request a FireSmart assessment for free from the Regional District, allowing Funk to visit their property and make recommendations on how to improve a home\u2019s chance of surviving a wildfire. According to him, a home with good FireSmart practices in place has about a 92 per cent chance of surviving a fire, even if neighbouring homes burn.</p><p>Funk said communities in the regional district are typically receptive to his FireSmart recommendations, and added that B.C. residents can learn more about FireSmart at <url normalizedValue=\"https://firesmartbc.ca/\">https://firesmartbc.ca/</url>.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about preventing loss,\u201d Funk said. \u201cThe assessments are about just saving people\u2019s homes from burning.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-98b52013e3f141c896033f8e977f1c24</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FYH-9RH3-RWG3-748R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"471\"/><timeReceived>12:36 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 2, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSY2</classCode><className>DISASTER RISK REDUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DLPN</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DR7Y</classCode><className>HOUSEWARES &amp; FURNISHINGS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Pine Barrens sit between Philadelphia and the Atlantic coast, a region with quick-draining sandy soil and trees with still-developing leaves where winds can kick up, drying out the forest floor.</p><p>The fire service said the smoke is expected to linger until the next significant rainfall.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-b41effee3e9d8765b1f38f37b106914a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FP2-B983-S1Y5-J112-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"217\"/><timeReceived>03:23 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 28, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Residents were at a \"high risk\" Thursday morning, but by around 2:40 p.m., the air quality health index had dipped to a low risk.</p><p>A week of heat warnings and stifling humidity did not helped air quality, but temperatures tumbled into the low 20s Thursday giving the city some relief. </p><p>IQAir, a Swiss air technology company, ranked Toronto as having the second-worst air quality among major global cities early Thursday, trailing only Kinshasa of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>At the time, conditions were \"unhealthy for sensitive groups,\" the company said, adding that the air was being choked by PM2.5 particles, a pollutant commonly found in wildfire smoke. </p><p>PM2.5 is especially dangerous because these particles are so small they can be absorbed into your bloodstream when you breathe, IQAir said.</p><p>Shortly before 10 a.m., the PM2.5 concentration in Toronto was 12.6 times more than the World Health Organization's guideline.</p><p>The Greenwood and Danforth Avenue area and the Beaches neighbourhood were hit the hardest, according to the company. </p><p>Environment Canada forecast for Toronto</p><p>Kicking off August, Friday will bring sunshine with a high of 24 C during the day and clear skies at night with a low of 13 C.</p><p>Heading into the weekend, Saturday is also forecasted to bring sunshine throughout the day and clear skies at night. There will be a high of 27 C and low of 16 C.</p><p>Sunday will see much of the same weather with sunny skies, a clear evening, a high of 29 C and a low of 16 C.</p><p>How to protect yourself from smoky air</p><p>You might have mild, common symptoms related to Thursday's smoky skies like eye, nose and throat irritation, headaches or a mild cough, Environment Canada said. More serious symptoms like wheezing, chest pains or a severe cough are less common and mean you should stop outdoor activities, the agency added, noting anyone having a medical emergency should seek immediate medical help. </p><p>When you're indoors, keep your windows and doors closed as much as possible to keep smoky air out, the agency said, but you should prioritize keeping cool when there is extreme heat and poor air quality at the same time.</p><p>You can also protect indoor air from wildfire smoke by using an air filter in your ventilation system or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine particles. </p><p>You can also try moving to public spaces with better ventilation, such as Toronto's six \"Cleaner Air\" spaces:</p><p>City Hall, open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays</p><p>Metro Hall, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays</p><p>North York Civic Centre, open from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on weekdays, and from 8 to 6 p.m. on weekends and holidays</p><p>Scarborough Civic Centre, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays</p><p>York Civic Centre, open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays</p><p>East York Civic Centre, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays</p><p>You can reduce your exposure to fine particles in the outdoor smoke by wearing a well-fitting, respirator-type mask, like a NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent respirator, the agency said.</p><p>With files from </p><p>Anastasia Blosser </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2025080176237422</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GD3-P9C3-RTG5-115K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

The Sakitawak\u00a0IPCA would have relied on local knowledge to establish sustainable forest management practices.</p><p>A \"fur block\" is a defined area in which approved trappers are allowed to harvest fur. The designation does not trigger extra forest management or protection measures.</p><p/><p>Acting \u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse Mayor Vince Ahenakew said the Muskeg fire that he estimates burned about 90 per cent of the N-14 Fur Block this summer is worse than the blaze\u00a0that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/some-wildfire-evacuees-in-saskatoon-set-to-return-home-1.6853537\">tore through it\u00a0two years ago</url>. The area is home to vulnerable species including the woodland caribou.</p><p>\"A lot of [animals] are having their young right now, little rabbits, the moose and bears,\" Ahenakew said.\u00a0</p><p>\"You kind of feel sorry for them, as well for the people that are suffering from these fires. There seems to be no end in sight. There's dry, dry, dry weather and wind every single day.\"</p><p>The provincial government could not confirm how much land in N-14 Fur Block burned so far this year. Dale Barks, an ecologist with the Ministry of Environment, said aerial surveys could be done this fall.</p><p>\"Once the fires are\u00a0kind of dissipated, we can see how much is burned [and] we get an assessment of what's left after the fire,\" Barks said.</p><p>Forests ecosystems have adapted to wildfire cycles, which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/how-wildfires-affect-boreal-forest-wildlife-1.7562491\">help\u00a0regeneration\u00a0and provide diverse habitats in various stages of growth</url>. But the benefits aren't always a comfort for people who rely on the land, Barks said.</p><p>\"Once the forest fire moves through ... there's really not a whole lot to do unless that trapper can find patches of habitat elsewhere in the trap line that haven't been disturbed.\"</p><p>Wildfires in the province have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/newsinteractives/features/wildfires-tracker-canada\">burned more than 2 million hectares of land</url> so far this year.\u00a0The Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency (SPSA) said 942,173\u00a0hectares were burned during last year's wildfire season. That's\u00a0just behind the 1,722,610\u00a0hectares burned in 2015 and the 1,868,695\u00a0hectares burned in 2023.\u00a0</p><p>Patrick said climate change is rapidly changing the ecosystem and severity of wildfires.</p><p>\"We need to put some serious thoughts into planning and planning in advance,\" Patrick said. \"We know this is going to happen ...This is our new normal.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadasaskatchewanwildfirestrappingsaskatchewan17588732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GB0-8453-RS62-01HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"531\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

It is especially dangerous because these particles are so small they can be absorbed into your bloodstream when you breathe, IQAir said.</p><p>The PM2.5 concentration in Toronto is 12.2 times more than the World Health Organization's guideline.</p><p>The Greenwood and Danforth Avenue area and the Beaches neighbourhood are getting hit the hardest, according to the company. </p><p>Environment Canada is recommending that children and elderly people should reduce or reschedule any arduous outdoor activities. Others should only do so if they're experiencing symptoms such as coughing or throat irritation.</p><p>Here's what you need to know about the weather in the days to come.</p><p>Environment Canada forecast for Toronto</p><p>There is a 60 per cent chance of rain Thursday afternoon with a daytime high of 23 C. The showers should clear up by the evening where cloudy periods will help drop temperatures to a cool 14 C. </p><p>Kicking off the month of August, Friday will bring sunshine with a high of 24 C during the day and clear skies at night with a low of 15 C.</p><p>Heading into the weekend, Saturday is also forecast to bring sunshine throughout the day and clear skies at night. There will be a high of 27 C and low of 13 C.</p><p>Sunday will see much of the same weather with sunny skies, a clear evening, a high of 29 C and a low of 15 C.</p><p>Monday will have a mix of sun and cloud and a daytime high of 28 C. There will be cloudy periods at night with a low of 16 C.</p><p>How to keep cool</p><p>When in doubt, just drink water. Environment Canada says people should be trying to stay hydrated even before feeling they're thirsty as well as closing the blinds or shades while indoors. </p><p>People should schedule outdoor activities for the coolest part of the day, the agency added, encouraging everyone to limit direct sun exposure and to wear light, baggy clothing with a wide-brimmed hat.</p><p>The city does have an interactive map to show all of the free places, such as community centres, pools, and libraries, that people can go to get relief. </p><p>What are the symptoms of heat-related illness?</p><p>People should watch out for early signs of heat exhaustion, which include headache, nausea, dizziness, thirst, dark urine and intense fatigue, according to Environment Canada. If you think you may be experiencing symptoms of heat exhaustion, take a break to drink water and move to a cool space, the agency said.</p><p>Heat stroke is a medical emergency and signs can include red and hot skin, dizziness, nausea, confusion and a change in consciousness, Environment Canada added. If you suspect a person might have heat stroke, call 911 and try to cool them down.</p><p>Extreme heat events mean you should check on older adults, people who live alone and other at-risk people in-person or over the phone multiple times per day, Environment Canada urged.</p><p>With files from Anastasia Blosser. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025073176230094</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCW-R403-S2G1-811N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"671\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

This is Part I.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New documents reveal the Department of Justice and Public Safety believed door-to-door notification and a Sentinel system alert were enough during a raging forest fire that forced several hundred people from their homes in May 2023, which is why it didn\u2019t issue an Alert Ready emergency message.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The forest fire started on May 28, 2023, when an ATV caught fire in the woods off South Glenelg Road in Chamcook, just outside Saint Andrews. Firefighters and emergency officials went door-to-door and issued a notice through the town\u2019s subscription-based Sentinel system.  At the time, the town was in the process of moving away from the Sentinel system, which was designed for Saint Andrews proper, not surrounding areas like Bocabec and Chamcook, where the fire was quickly spreading due to high winds, dry conditions and hot temperatures.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Alert Ready system \u2013 designed to broadcast emergency messages through televisions, radios and cell phones \u2013 was never used.\u00a0</p><p>In response to questions by reporters, the public safety minister at the time said the fire did not meet the criteria.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt has to meet the criteria of the national Alert Ready system and unfortunately this one didn\u2019t,\u201d Kris Austin said, according to a transcript of his response.\u00a0</p><p>Austin said at the time he asked about why one wasn\u2019t issued, adding \u201cI am going to follow back with the department to dig in a little deeper on that eligibility and ensure it is being utilized the way it\u2019s supposed to be utilized.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>On the Alert Ready website, however, examples are provided for the use of the system. Under the table Alert Types, there is a section for fire.\u00a0</p><p>It categorizes them into four categories: industrial fire, urban fire, wildfire and forest fire. Each has a small blurb for what the alert could be used for. In the case of Bocabec and Chamcook, a relatively rural area, it would have fallen under either wildfire or forest fire, but most likely forest fire.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA forest fire is a wildfire or prescribed fire that is burning in a forested areas, grass or alpine/tundra vegetation and poses a threat to human safety,.\u201d said the Alert Ready website.\u00a0</p><p>The forced evacuation in the Saint Andrews area lasted several days, threatening both homes and people. There were roughly 200 people evacuated, according to the Saint Andrews Fire Department.\u00a0</p><p>There was a significant response from the Department of Natural Resources, NB RCMP, the Department of Justice and Public Safety and NB Emergency Measures, as well as several fire departments from Charlotte County, including Saint Andrews.</p><p>Kyle Leavitt, the director of the New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization (EMO), said in the early hours of the forest fire that the agency was ready to help coordinate the situation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe base everything off what we describe as the four pillars of emergency management:, mitigation, prevention, preparation, response and then recovery,\u201d he said, speaking with The Courier. \u201cSo, really, when we get into that response cycle, we\u2019re going through set steps within our crew and everything moves along.\u201d</p><p>He confirmed that the decision to evacuate residents was made locally.</p><p>\u2018We didn\u2019t have enough information\u2019\u00a0</p><p>Email exchanges obtained through a Right to Information and Protection of Privacy Act request showed the province felt it didn\u2019t have enough information to issue an Alert Ready notification.\u00a0</p><p>An early email from Matt Steeves to several employees in the Department of Justice and Public Safety, in response to a media request from Global News, said the website shows what the system could be used for, but isn\u2019t criteria.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAs an aside, the Alert Ready website describes the type of alerts that should be considered for broadcasting but it does not state any criteria to do so,\u201d it reads. \u201cThe criteria is situation dependent and the decision made by the local government with either the RCMP and NB Emergency Measures Organization in support by sending in the Alert.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>No criteria was ever released from the department and none was included in the documents.\u00a0</p><p>An email from Andrew Easton, with the Department of Justice and Public Safety, in a response to a request from Global News, said that the department \u201cneeded to provide a factual basis of what happened to ensure we explain what did happen,\u201d on whether Austin mis-spoke about the criteria.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was asked this by the Premier as well, and explained that an alert has to tell the public what to do about the risk and we didn\u2019t have enough detail from the scene to explain that (i.e., it\u2019s a bad idea to tell people to evacuate to the west if you are east of the fire).\u00a0</p><p>There was also confusion about the town\u2019s use of Sentinel, an alert-based system that people have to subscribe to. At the time, officials from the town said it was transitioning away from that software.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlso: I need to understand details of what was done by the town re: alerting using sentinel,\u201d said another email from Andrew Easton to EMO\u2019s Kyle Leavitt, Geoffrey Downey, Cathy Mallet and Judy Desalliers. \u201cThis \u2018had to remove one of the broadcast messages right before the fire limiting it\u2019s reach\u2019 seems to suggest it was not used.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI understood it was and that it was determined by our REMC (regional emergency measures coordinator) and Ops (operations) staff at the time that the combination of local alerting and door-to-door resulted in a determination an Alert Ready wasn\u2019t needed,\u201d the email said.\u00a0</p><p>It also suggested the town never asked for the Alert Ready system to be used, but Bocabec \u2013 and the area where the fire was located \u2013 was still under the jurisdiction of the Department of Local Government.\u00a0</p><p>Saint Andrews Mayor Brad Henderson said he was never contacted by the province to issue an Alert Ready message.  \u201cThere was no official that ever called me that evening to say, \u2018What do you think?\u2019\u201d he said in an interview with The Courier. \u201cI will say that when it was time to tell people to return home, I was consulted then, but the night of, there was no consultation whatsoever, as far as I know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Henderson said he couldn\u2019t speak to whether Fire Chief Kevin Theriault was consulted on an alert, but was told the chief did notify the province before even leaving the fire station.\u00a0</p><p>He explained it was at least 24 hours after the fire started before anyone from the province communicated with the town about the situation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe decision to evacuate all those homes was (made) by the people that were out in the field,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThere was no office in Fredericton that reviewed it. There was nothing like that because there was a little bit of a concern at the time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He said there was no explanation to the town of how the Alert Ready system worked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, there was no call like, \u2018Hey, do you need an emergency alert? Do you need anything like that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no process in place where anyone ever reached out to offer us any assistance. So, we had to take it in our own hands and figure it out the way that we could.\u201d</p><p>He explained the town used every platform it had available to it for messaging, including social media, adding he felt like the direction to go to the W.C. O\u2019Neill Arena was clear enough to be included in an Alert Ready message \u2013 even if the fire was moving rapidly and unpredictably.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we had hundreds and hundreds of people come to the arena to offer rooms,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cEverybody in the area certainly knew what we were doing, but I think the key lesson here is do we have to call the province and tell them when they\u2019re supposed to use their own emergency alert system? I don\u2019t have access to the emergency alert system. If I did, would I have used it? Yes, I would have.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Leavitt said the department felt that the town\u2019s dissemination of information was enough, reiterating the fire would have had to have met the national criteria.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause of the intrusive nature of it, it really has to meet the criteria that there is an immediate danger \u2013 an imminent threat to life and limb,\u201d Leavitt said. in an interview. \u201cSo, it has to meet that criteria. That\u2019s why the local officials and authorities on the ground are best positioned to make that call. Once they determine (if) this meets that criteria, then we need to know where the zone is and we need to know what needs to be told to the listeners of the alert or the warning.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Henderson is adamant that communication with the province never happened.\u00a0</p><p>Kevin Quigley is a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax who specializes in risk governance and critical infrastructure protection, focusing in particular on public sector responses to rare and high impact events.</p><p>Firefighers continue to put out hot spots for weeks after the blaze was considered under patrol.</p><p>Quigley said these situations in the moment are often complex \u2013 but there can be fears of overreacting and underreacting.\u00a0</p><p>He said minutes, even seconds, count in emergency situations.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThese things have to be done and there is a human dimension to it,\u201d he said in an interview with The Courier. \u201cSomeone actually has to make a decision to do it, and they need to have the confidence and the authority to do it and to do it quickly. There has to be some level of decentralized decision making in terms of doing things, you know, quickly and rapidly and whatnot.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He recounted another notable incident without the use of Alert Ready in British Columbia.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere was an off-shore earthquake off the coast of British Columbia,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was concern that it would create some sort of tsunami effect and it took 45 minutes for the British Columbia Emergency Measures Organization to issue a warning.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The earthquake happened off Vancouver Island in January 2018. Emergency Management B.C., according to reporting from CBC, used text messages, first responders, sirens and door-knocking to warn people to go to higher ground.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere was no tsunami, though, but what was particularly revealing about it was that Washington state had issued a release in six minutes, so they didn\u2019t really have a get-out-jail-free card, because the obvious question was, why could Washington state do it in six minutes?\u201d</p><p>Another example\u00a0</p><p>There is one other significantly notable instance of the Alert Ready system not being used in an active shooter situation, leading to ultimately fatal consequences. \u00a0</p><p>In April 2020, a gunman killed 22 people in several Nova Scotia communities before being shot and killed by police in Enfield. He was driving a mock RCMP cruiser and dressed as an RCMP officer.\u00a0</p><p>The families of several victims said in media interviews and a class-action lawsuit that the Alert Ready system could have saved lives.\u00a0</p><p>In Nova Scotia, the RCMP do not have authority or jurisdiction to issue emergency alerts. All requests must go through the province\u2019s Emergency Management Office.\u00a0</p><p>Testimony during a public inquiry into the massacre revealed issuing one \u201cdidn\u2019t cross their minds.\u201d The RCMP also relied on X (formerly Twitter) as its main form of communication.\u00a0</p><p>Back in the Saint Andrews area, a significant amount of personnel fought the forest fire for roughly eight days. The fire was considered under control on June 5 but was still being patrolled about a month later.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know how bad this fire was going to get,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThere was a point in the evening where it was so dark that they had to back off and almost just be responsive in case someone called that it was close to their house.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Crews from the Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development also battled the blaze, working to save homes and people. Video footage shows fire personnel working on hot spots, washing down the black earth that was left behind.\u00a0</p><p>Henderson said he has thought a lot about the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d in the months following the fire.</p><p>He said one couple told him after they thought they heard \u201csomething\u201d at the door but weren\u2019t sure and slept in their house that night \u2013 unaware of the risk surrounding their home.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, an emergency alert probably would have been good if they had a way to get that through to them,\u201d Henderson said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-613037c49c9846d2bba53fb631d4ffb2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DX9-GNB3-RTNB-6433-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2016\"/><timeReceived>12:09 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 16, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Of those, eight were located in the Red Lake fire management area.</p><p>\"Presently, there are 35 active fires in the Northwest Region,\" Chris Marchand, fire information officer with Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services (AFFES), said in an email to CBC News on Monday afternoon.</p><p>Of those 35 fires, 13 were listed as not under control, two were being held, six under control, and 14 being observed. Ten fires had been called out over the previous 24 hours, Marchand stated.</p><p>\"Recent lightning is suspected to be a contributing factor in these new fire starts,\" he said. \"In pockets where drought conditions may be lingering in the soil, fires can emerge days later after a lighting strike when surface conditions eventually dry out.\"</p><p>Marchand said with recent lightning in the past few days and more unsettled weather expected in the coming days, they expect to see\u00a0new fires.</p><p>FireRanger crews had made \"excellent progress\" with the most recent fires, however, thanks in part to higher relative humidity and recent rainfall in the northwest.</p><p>Meanwhile, crews continue to work on Red Lake 12, which is located near Deer Lake and Sandy Lake First Nations.</p><p>The fire is more than 195,000 hectares in size, and not under control, but due to recent rainfall, fire behaviour was low, AFFES said.</p><p>Twenty-three crews are assigned to the fire, with support from helicopters.</p><p>Elsewhere, Sioux Lookout 18, which is burning near Cat Lake First Nation, is about 23,600 hectares and not under control. It's showing \"minimal fire behaviour,\" AFFES said.</p><p>AFFES is also reminding people to keep fire prevention in mind during the Canada Day holiday by keeping campfires small, sheltered from wind, and a safe distance from surrounding vegetation.</p><p>And anyone planning on setting off fireworks during the holiday is advised to do so in an area that's free of flammable materials\u00a0- such as over a lake or gravel\u00a0- and to have fire suppression equipment on-hand. When the fireworks show is over, people are advised to check the area for any hot residue and put it out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadathunderbaywildfireupdatenorthwest17574353</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G5B-CBX3-RSX0-R1S1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"372\"/><timeReceived>6:38 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

People with heart or lung problems need to be extra careful since they're more prone to complications.\u00a0</p><p>Scientific literature shows that when there is more air pollution, there are more deaths from heart disease and stroke, and more people with respiratory problems who have to go to the hospital. In addition, regular exposure to high levels of air pollution can increase the risk of certain types of cancer.\u00a0</p><p>\"This is a serious health concern because exposure is somewhat involuntary \u2014 we don't really have a choice about breathing,\" P\u00e9trin-Desrosiers said. \"And when there are episodes of increased concentration of air pollutants in the atmosphere, it can have harmful short- and long-term effects on the body,\" P\u00e9trin-Desrosiers.\u00a0</p><p>In Quebec, air pollution causes 4,000 premature deaths per year, according to a 2021 Health Canada report. This results in costs of more than $30 billion per year for the Quebec health-care system, the document states.</p><p>\"That's significant,\" says Dr. P\u00e9trin-Desrosiers. \"And part of that is related to smog episodes caused by forest fire smoke, but it's also because our air quality standards are less strict than those recommended by the World Health Organization, particularly for fine particles.\"</p><p>People are advised to avoid strenuous exercise during smog episodes, as well as limit time outdoors and close windows when inside. \u00a0</p><p>Properly fitted N95 masks can also help, especially for people with asthma or other chronic conditions.\u00a0</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 16, 2025.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>The Canadian Press's health content is funded through a partnership with the Canadian Medical Association.

The invitation gives a six point explanation of what an OCP is. My intention here is to focus on the last two words of the sixth point: climate change. I am not focusing on how to prevent or minimize climate change; too many of the world's \"Drill Baby Drill\" politicians have made such a mockery of the 1.5\u00b0 global warming ceiling that a 2\u00b0 or even a 2.5\u00b0 limit may now be exceeded. With greater frequency of weather extremes all but inevitable, what could we, as a community, do in anticipation of the resulting emergencies?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We may get helpful information about what to expect from a visit to Heritage Park Museum's \"Heat and Hope: Global Climate Change, Local Consequences\" exhibit, but we cannot look back and learn from the ways we dealt with nature's tantrums the last time we experienced climate change. Climate change has no history; that is a problem. How can we plan for the unknown?</p><p>What if our region were to experience a fire season worse than what the Prairie provinces are experiencing this year? Should our OCP contain a policy calling on the city to meet with local hotels to determine our emergency shelter capacity for regional fire refugees? The city could write a plan for emergency shelter space allocation as an alternative to having fire refugees from this region flown to distant cities. Along these lines, how about a policy calling on the city to meet with local farmers to explore our capacity to provide shelter for farm animals caught in a forest fire evacuation zone?</p><p>What if the Highway 16 transportation corridor were blocked for an extended period by an unspecified natural catastrophe? Should an OCP policy call on the city to meet with local supermarkets to develop an emergency ration distribution plan, a scheme to ensure that everyone in town has assured access to basic needs until our transportation infrastructure is restored? What if our electricity supply were to be interrupted for an extended period? Should our OCP include a policy calling on the city to identify and secure minimal electricity supply capacity to serve the community in an emergency? What if \u2026?</p><p>The city is looking at a 20-year horizon for its climate adaptation strategies. Should we worry that, looking back from the year 2050, some OCP climate change adaption strategies adopted in 2025 should now be dismissed for being silly? Would that matter? On the other hand, if a 2025 OCP climate change adaption strategy should be proven to have been a factor in just one life having been saved, that would be cause for celebration.</p><p>We can learn a valuable lesson from the recent Kerr County, Texas, catastrophe. The US weather service had issued rain storm warnings for the region, but these warnings never reached Kerr County's residents. The Guadalupe River torrent killed over 100 people. It can be argued, however, that the cause of these tragic deaths was not a torrential flood; the cause was the absence of an effective warning system to alert Kerr County residents in time to allow them to flee to higher ground before the Guadalupe River's floodwaters reached their community.</p><p>The OCP review's philosophical objective should be a resolve to protect Terrace from ever becoming Canada's own Kerr County with its deadly \"flash flood alley\".</p><p>Andr\u00e9 Carrel is a retired public sector administrator living in Terrace, B.C.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Terrace Standard</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TERSTN-news20250721PTA4745787</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TERSTN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G9T-TFP3-RRJF-84CF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438220</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"577\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

That range included from the Manitoba border east through Red Lake, Ear Falls, Sioux Lookout and Savant Lake. Another pocket further north includes Wunnumin Lake, Nibinamik, Kasabonika Lake, Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug, Mishkeegogamang and all the way to Fort Severn and the Hudson Bay coast.</p><p>The difference between the air quality warnings and special statements is how severely the air quality has deteriorated, said Steven Flisfeder, a meteorologist with Environment Canada.</p><p>\u201cThe warning \u2026 near the Manitoba border is for areas where we are seeing much, much higher concentrations of forest fire smoke leading to much more deteriorated air quality as a result,\u201d Flisfeder told Newswatch in an interview.</p><p>\u201cAreas further east that are in the special air quality statements, there's still high concentrations of smoke, just not as quite as severe as those closer to the Manitoba border \u2014 at least not currently.\u201d</p><p>The deterioration in air quality is due to dozens of wildfires burning, not only in Ontario, but to the west as well. As of Sunday evening, the Ministry of Natural Resources was reporting 47 active fires in Northwestern Ontario alone.</p><p>That sheer amount of smoke, combined with a bunch of other atmospheric conditions, makes it difficult to do specific long-term air quality forecasting, Flisfeder said, as it remains a \u201cvery dynamic day-to-day kind of forecast.\u201d However, he said, the areas currently under an air quality warning likely won\u2019t see much of a reprieve any time soon.</p><p>\u201cAs it stands now, we have the highest confidence with the areas near the Manitoba border that they will remain in at least an air quality statement, but likely an air quality warning, given the higher concentrations of smoke for those areas,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEverywhere outside of that warning area, the smoke will be shifting north and south and may be reduced given the incoming precipitation.\u201d</p><p>Even if the alerts subside, he added, it may not be for long.</p><p>\u201cAll that being said, the wildfire activity is still ongoing, so even if the air quality statements are ended, there's a very high likelihood that, in a day or two or later this week, they could be reissued as the situation warrants.\u201d</p><p>The weather office\u2019s alerts reminded that, while everyone is affected by poor air quality, certain people are more susceptible to its effects, including those aged 65 and older, those who are pregnant, infants and young children, people with an existing illness or chronic health condition and people who work outdoors.</p><p>\u201cThere are certainly people who are more susceptible to those kinds of conditions,\u201d Flisfeder said.</p><p>\u201cSo, making sure that you're taking precautions, limiting your time outdoors as much as possible, and keeping doors and windows closed so that you're not increasing your exposure when you are inside.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a6f89127972147c791b2c6aa11932d14</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G9Y-WF23-RRT4-R3J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"582\"/><timeReceived>01:16 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 21, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to Ontario's Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services (AFFES) agency, the fire at Baldhead Lake, about 200 kilometres north of the city, was declared out before it had grown more than one hectare in size. The fire, which had been reported on Monday night, was the only new incident that day, although nearly a dozen fires raged elsewhere in Northwestern Ontario, the provincial fire agency said. </p><p>Of those, three were classified as being not under control. As of Tuesday, more than 100 fires across the province had burned over nearly 390 square kilometres since fire season began on April 1, compared to a fraction of that amount for the same period in 2024. To date, the 10-year average over the same period is 114 fires and about 150 square kilometres burned. The largest current wildfire in the province remains Kenora No. 20, which was pegged late Monday at about 310 square kilometres. The fire, located about 40 km west of Kenora, was being attacked by ground crews and helicopters equipped to dump water, the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services agency said. \"Cloud cover and smoke in the area have helped limit fire behaviour,\" the agency said in an update. A provincial restricted fire zone remained in effect for an area roughly between Atikokan and the Manitoba border. According to Environment Canada, little or no rain is in the forecast for much of NorthwesternOntario. Meanwhile on Tuesday, the province said it was \"re-introducing\" legislation to reduce the risk from wildfire as well as oil and gas wells. A modernization of the Forest Fires Prevention Act would include \"new requirements for wildland fire management plans, and stricter penalties for those who don't follow wildland fire laws to reduce the risk of unwanted human-caused fires,\" a provincial news release said. Last week, the Ministry of Natural Resources said the budget for fighting \"emergency\" wildfires had not been cut; for this season, it has a \"start-up\" allocation of $135 million. \"The ministry can receive a top-up to its allocation to cover the costs of wildland fire response for the fiscal year,\" a ministry spokesman said. NDP MPP Lise Vaugeois (Thunder Bay-Superior North) said questions remain about the provincial firefighting department's \"base budget, which covers non-emergency matters like the maintenance of fire bases. \"What they need to explain is why over the last two budget cycles they've cut the base budget for wildland firefighting, when the firefighters themselves have told us they're understaffed and under- resourced,\" Vaugeois said in email. \"Already this year, wildfires are up and communities are being evacuated,\" Vaugeois added. The ministry didn't respond when The Chronicle-Journal asked about the base budget for provincial firefighting. Vaugeois also said the province continues to renege on an earlier commitment to make the provincial \"fire ranger\" classification on par with professional and volunteer firefighters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-f82f3431e2eb439790a8dd5d97c2c59b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FXF-FV33-RT55-84HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"527\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 28, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

You can vote Liberal and save the nation or kiss the Canada you love goodbye.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"In a crisis,\" said Carney on the campaign trail, \"Canadians come together to tackle challenges.\" The Liberal party drew a contrast between Pollievre's divisiveness and Carney's commitment to finding common ground.</p><p>It's understandable why people are relieved the version of far-right politics embodied by Pollievre lost the election. But the notion that Carney's election win resolved the crisis of politics in Canada is dangerously mistaken.</p><p>Carney the candidate offered a message that all Canadians would benefit from unity in the face of Trump. By contrast, Carney the prime minister is looking to increase corporate profits by ramping up resource exploitation, stockpiling military hardware, attacking Indigenous sovereignty and slashing social programs.</p><p>The \"Building Canada Act,\" for example, passed by Parliament last month, enables the federal government to ignore certain laws and regulations while rapidly approving new resource extraction projects. Fast-tracking corporate interests in the name of making Canada an \"energy superpower\" requires stamping out Indigenous rights vested in treaties, enshrined in Canadian law, and recognized by the Supreme Court.</p><p>Approving new oil, gas, and mining infrastructure while sidestepping laws protecting species at risk and bypassing regulations designed to limit ecological harm means that even Canada's modest commitments to addressing climate change will soon go up like so much forest fire smoke.</p><p>Carney's pledge of massive new military spending - hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming decade - is problematic on its own terms. While Israel commits genocide in Gaza, Russia occupies parts of Ukraine, and the U.S. bombs Iran, Carney is mapping a strategy based on cutting humanitarian support and buying new military gear.</p><p>Where will the billions for new guns and submarines come from? In large part, it would appear, from gutting the federal public service. Carney has instructed cabinet to find \"ambitious savings\" across departments to cover annual spending cuts of $25 billion. According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, we can expect the Liberal austerity program to defund First Nations, veteran supports, newcomer supports, international aid, science and research, and a host of other programs that working-class Canadians rely on.</p><p>In the 1990s, the Liberal party of Jean Chr\u00e9tien imposed brutal austerity on the public sector. Many of those cuts, from funding for social housing to provincial transfers supporting health and education, have never been restored. Carney's drive to establish a leaner, meaner nation is pressing politics in Canada once again to a generational crossroads.</p><p>At this point, Indigenous communities are leading the fightback. Nine First Nations have launched a court challenge against the \"Building Canada Act.\" Indigenous youth protested outside a meeting the prime minister threw together with First Nations leaders last week. Roman Kataquapit, a Young Peoples' Council member from Attawapiskat, promises the Indigenous youth movement \"will grow across Canada. We're the generation to make change.\"</p><p>Canadians who are committed to Indigenous rights, ecological sustainability in the face of climate crisis, and social justice in Canada and around the world cannot wait until the next election to challenge Carney's direction. The Carney crisis is now.</p><p>Imagine the power of an emergent coalition resisting Carney's agenda comprised of Indigenous communities, labour unions and community organizations. A force this large and deeply rooted could not only halt Carney's plans, but chart a different future based on Indigenous sovereignty, worker organizing, strengthening ecological protection, improving social programs and supporting social justice worldwide.</p><p>More and more people who cast ballots for Carney's Liberals are suffering from buyer's remorse. I offer them a gentle reminder: Who you voted for in April is irrelevant to the question of how you act as the Carney crisis unfolds.</p><p>James Cairns is a professor in the Department</p><p> of Indigenous Studies, Law and Social Justice </p><p>at Wilfrid Laurier University. His book \"In Crisis, On Crisis: Essays in Troubled Times\" (Wolsak &amp; Wynn) was published in June. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2025072676183108</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GBT-W533-RW6C-23PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.
