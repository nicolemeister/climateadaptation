The majority are in the north. Sri Nan National Park in Nan was the hardest devastated by forest fires last year, accounting for approximately 71.95% of the total forest area, he said.</p><p>He stated that steps to avoid forest fires have been put in place in close collaboration with national park officials and people in order to reduce the number of hotspots in northern woods. He emphasised that the procedures require financial backing.</p><p>Over 2,201 Hotspots Reported Throughout Northern Thailand</p><p>According to him, the ministry, the Board of Investment, and the Ministry of Finance have studied the matter and come up with a policy to provide a 200% tax reduction to any company that provides financial support to the project. The National Environment Board will receive the proposal today.</p><p>'We need a massive budget to combat forest fires.' A delayed budget may cause problems, thus we have proposed raising funds to support our efforts. 'The money will go to local communities and forest officials to control hotspots,' he added, adding that participating businesses should receive more than simply plaudits in return.</p><p>The ministry launched a Centre for Air Pollution Mitigation (CAPM) on Wednesday, providing information on haze pollution via its Facebook page, including daily Facebook Live briefings at 2 p.m.</p><p>The change is also in response to changes in the air quality index, which raises the safe level of PM2.5 from 50 microgrammes per cubic metre to 37.5/cu mec.</p><p>pm2.5 haze northern Thailand</p><p>PM2.5 Haze Problem in Northern Thailand</p><p>Haze is a regular environmental hazard in northern Thailand, particularly during the dry season, which lasts from late November to April. The haze is mostly created by agricultural activities, such as clearing land for crops by burning fields and woods. This method is known as 'slash-and-burn agriculture.'</p><p>The following are the main points concerning the haze in northern Thailand:</p><p>Burning Practises:</p><p>To clear fields, many farmers in northern Thailand utilise fire, which is a cost-effective method of preparing land for planting. Uncontrolled burning, on the other hand, can cause extensive smoke and air pollution.</p><p>Impact on Air Quality:</p><p>The haze causes poor air quality, which can have major health consequences, particularly for people with respiratory difficulties. It also reduces visibility, which has an impact on transportation and tourism in the region.</p><p>Cross-Border Effects:</p><p>The smog problem is not limited to Thailand. It frequently affects neighbouring nations such as Laos and Myanmar. This has resulted in regional debates and collaborative initiatives to address the issue.</p><p>Government Actions:</p><p>To address the issue, the Thai government has implemented restrictions on burning practises, strengthened law enforcement to combat illicit burning, and public awareness efforts. However, considering the pervasive extent of the problem, enforcement can be difficult.</p><p>Alternative Practices:</p><p>Some efforts have been undertaken to promote alternative, sustainable agricultural practises other than slash-and-burn. These practises try to lessen environmental effect while preserving local communities' livelihoods.</p><p>Environmental Concerns:</p><p>Haze can contribute to deforestation and other environmental difficulties in addition to air pollution. It has the potential to intensify forest fires and endanger biodiversity.</p><p>Efforts in northern Thailand to control haze involve a combination of regulatory measures, community engagement, and regional cooperation. These initiatives aim to lessen the harmful impact on public health, the environment, and the economy while also providing long-term solutions for local communities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIRAI-CHIANGRAITIMES271020230001046</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIRAI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69GY-VX91-F00C-60TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472526</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"756\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CTN News - Chiangrai Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Chiang Rai Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 27, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>META PLATFORMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS516210 MEDIA STREAMING DIST SVCS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND OTHER MEDIA NETWORKS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7374 COMPUTER PROCESSING &amp;

In Ontario and Quebec, where lakes are plentiful, the bulk of the work is done with water, either mixed with foam and dropped from aircraft, or pumped from lakes and rivers into hoses that are manned by firefighters on the ground.</p><p>In drier places, such as British Columbia, there's a greater use of fire retardant \u2014 which is placed around the fire's edge \u2014 and preventive burning to strip an area of vegetation that acts as fuel, he said.</p><p>St\u00e9phane Caron, a spokesman for Quebec's forest fire prevention agency, known as SOPFEU, said that while tactics in fighting fires are consistent, the sheer number of fires in his province is forcing the agency to abandon its goal of extinguishing all fires below the 51st parallel.</p><p>\"There are far too many (fires) for us to do that, so at the moment our objective is really linked to the protection of communities, human lives and strategic infrastructure,\" he said in an interview this week. He said the agency's firefighting capacity is about 30 fires at a time. On Thursday, there were 133 fires in the province.</p><p>With resources in short supply, \"our goal isn't necessarily to go until the fire is extinguished, but to contain and hopefully control it to be able to go take care of another fire.\"</p><p>Caron said the first line of attack against a fire is the water bomber aircraft, which can carry about 6,000 litres of water and must pass every 10 to 12 minutes to be effective.</p><p>However, he said the aircraft can only help contain a fire. It's the firefighters on the ground who extinguish a blaze, not only above ground with hoses but underground as well. That is done using a tool known as a Pulaski, similar to an axe, to dig into spots where the fire is hiding beneath the surface.</p><p>The biggest challenge in the current situation, he said, is that fires are happening simultaneously in several provinces at once, straining resources that are usually shared between provinces and forcing agencies to look abroad for reinforcements.</p><p>Roger Collet, wildfire management officer with the New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources, says fire efforts start by finding a spot that provides a good escape route, and then attacking the fire on its flanks before moving to the head.</p><p>He said that while tactics haven't changed substantially in recent years, they're being constantly refined by improvements in the technology that helps predict and monitor fires. Drones, for example, offer a cheaper and easier way to keep tabs on a fire than helicopters. \"They're always tweaking the technology,\" he said.</p><p>The experts agree that when a fire is advancing, workers may have to fall back and focus on building defences to protect homes, businesses and critical infrastructure, such as communications towers. That can be done by using a bulldozer to raze a section of land and create a firebreak near the structures, or through a preventive burn of the vegetation.</p><p>Both Caron and Cowan say the main danger to firefighters is not being encircled by the fire, which is closely monitored, but rather injuries from falling trees, falls or heatstroke. The work is very demanding for firefighters, who have to contend with heat from the fires, mud and water, and difficult terrain.</p><p>\"You're walking through the bush, which is logs laying there and hills and rocks,\" he said. \"It's not like walking on a city block, I'll tell you, it's very demanding and it's hot.\"</p><p>He notes that a fire is not considered fully \"out\" until firefighters can walk all the way to the centre of a burned area and ensure there are no more hot spots that could reignite and start another fire.</p><p>Morgan Lowrie, The Canadian Press</p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230609PAB4480222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68F0-CP41-JD2C-J3VM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"807\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

About 11,400 people have already been forced from their homes in the area because of persistent and unpredictable wildfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Residents shouldn't expect to be able to return home before the middle of next week, Legault warned.</p><p>\"I want us all to be realistic so that we don't see things through rose-coloured glasses,\" the premier said. \"For the moment, we do not expect rain for the next few days.\"</p><p>Evacuation orders were issued Tuesday night for the northern Quebec town of Chibougamau and the nearby Cree community of Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou.</p><p>The premier said the northern Cree community of Mistissini, located 550 kilometres north of Montreal, would likely be evacuated on Wednesday, resulting in another 4,000 displaced people.</p><p>But later in the day, Mistissini Chief Michael Petawabano said his community remains safe and asked residents to wait for instructions from Cree officials. </p><p>\"I know it's hard sometimes, panic may set in, but we would really appreciate if you would wait for our reports,\" Petawabano said in a broadcast published on the community's Facebook page. \"Legault does not run our community.\"</p><p>He said community leaders are in contact with Quebec's forest fire prevention agency, SOPFEU, which is monitoring the fire.</p><p>Mistissini remains on alert he said, and the local clinic may consider moving some vulnerable people with health issues. He added that the school will close and he asked people to conserve gasoline and electricity because the fire has damaged a power line to the community.</p><p>The northern town of Chapais, Que., risked being evacuated again, and some parts of Senneterre, Que., were also threatened by the flames, Legault said.</p><p>Chapais Mayor Isabelle Lessard asked residents to be prepared to leave if the situation deteriorates, adding Wednesday that residents would be offered shelter in St-F\u00e9licien, Que., about 250 kilometres southeast. About 800 people from the town's southern sector were forced from their homes for five days last week.</p><p>On Tuesday, Chibougamau Mayor Manon Cyr told the town's roughly 7,500 residents to head to Roberval, Que. \u2014 about 250 kilometres away \u2014 if they didn't have friends or family elsewhere who could take them in. In Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou, about 800 people were ordered to leave and advised that shelter would be provided nearly 400 kilometres to the southeast, in Chicoutimi, Que.</p><p>In the Roberval area, residents used a Facebook page to find evacuees places to stay. Joanie Riendeau one of five volunteers running the page, said that by noon, there were only 40 people remaining at a temporary shelter in the Roberval arena, and that all of them had chosen to stay.</p><p>\"In less than 16 hours after the evacuation notice, everyone was able to have a comfortable space to settle in,\" she said in an interview. </p><p>While people's property remains at risk, she said there's been an outpouring of generosity from people in the area. \"What we've gained in this catastrophe is a sense of solidarity,\" she said.</p><p>One offer that stood out to her among the people offering up rooms in the homes to Chibougamau residents, was a man who offered space in his stable for 30 horses that had been brought from the evacuation zone. \"It's an enormous gift of generosity,\" Riendeau said.</p><p>Quebec's forest fire prevention agency said Wednesday more than 150 forest fires were burning and slightly under 100 of them were considered out of control. More than 457,000 hectares have burned so far this season, the most since the province started keeping records.</p><p>\"In the history of (the agency) \u2014 nearly 50 years \u2014 we've surpassed the worst year on record,\" Natural Resources Minister Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Blanchette-V\u00e9zina said. \"It's a situation that's unprecedented.\"</p><p>Luc Dugas, with Quebec's fire prevention service, said the situation is the worst he's seen in his 23 years at the agency, adding that the fire season was far from over. Firefighters were focused on protecting communities and infrastructure but eventually would have to stamp out fires in isolated areas, he said.</p><p>\"We're going to need help all summer long, that's for sure,\" Dugas said.</p><p>There were about 520 fire personnel on Wednesday fighting fires in the province, helped by about 150 members of the Canadian Armed Forces, Legault said. They could cover about 40 fires at a time, he added.</p><p>Legault said he hoped to have 1,200 firefighters on the ground in the coming weeks, drawing from firefighters in New Brunswick and France in the coming days. He said the province was negotiating with the United States, Portugal, Spain and Mexico for additional resources.</p><p>The premier said the wildfires on the province's north shore were under control, one day after residents of Sept-\u00celes, Que., were allowed to return home. As well, Legault said a Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec substation near Baie-Comeau, Que., was no longer under threat from fires. </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 7, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-df4841cdb59d4fcab9855ae0612aa82a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DP-GFS1-JBVR-30P9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"873\"/><timeReceived>06:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 7, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In the nation's capital, smog forced the closure of beaches and municipal pools, as well as the cancellation of a number of events, while Montreal today recorded the worst air quality in the entire world. CTV's Olivia O'Malley reports.</p><p>OLIVIA O'MALLEY (Reporter): Tourists hoping to get a picture with one of Montreal's most iconic landmarks are out of luck. The Olympic stadium can usually be seen from a distance. Today, it's hidden behind thick clouds of smog due to Quebec's wildfires.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Just burns the nose, burns the throat.</p><p>O'MALLEY: According to IQ Air, Montreal has the worst air quality among major cities around the world, followed by Tehran, Jakarta and Johannesburg. When air quality is this poor, Montreal public health says it's important to spend less time outside.</p><p>DR. DISONIE PENICAUD (Montreal Public Health): The best thing to do is to stay indoors, because there should be less pollution indoors if your windows and your doors are closed.</p><p>O'MALLEY: Stuart Barker expected to cross the finish line at the Mont-Tremblant half iron man today.</p><p>STUART BARKER (Triathlete): The first thing I did was I opened the blinds and I looked out the window, and I noticed that there was like a hazy glow over the mountains of Tremblant.</p><p>O'MALLEY: Shortly after, the race was cancelled due to smog, sending more than 3,000 athletes home, many who had travelled far to compete. The group Coopley World Triathlon in Montreal also cancelled its event, and Cote St. Luc closed its outdoor public pools due to smog. Laval, Longueil, Brassard and Montreal followed suit.

Larger and more frequent weather-related losses will continue to pressure property insurance prices higher in the near term,\" they said. <br/><br/> Historically, wildfire damage has been a lot less common than flooding, said Kathryn Bakos, director of climate finance and science at the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation. <br/><br/> But when it does happen, it tends to be significantly worse on average in terms of damage, she said. <br/><br/> The 2016 Fort McMurray fire is perhaps the best example of this - while flooding tends to account for a large chunk of losses every year, the Fort McMurray fire is the largest-ever insurance loss in the country, said Bakos, accounting for almost three quarters of total insured losses that year.<br/><br/> \"What climate change means in the medium and longer term is more extreme. So you're going to have more heat, dryness and less rain in the system, as well as more rain and storm surges,\" Bakos said.<br/><br/> Annual catastrophic insurable loss claims have risen as a result, she said.<br/><br/> As fire risks rise, insurers are increasingly taking communities' fire defences  into consideration for premiums, said Stewart. <br/><br/> No single event drives insurance premiums up, but overall trends do, said Stewart. Insurers price risk, and the risk of major weather events is rising, he said. <br/><br/> Prices have been rising faster in the Western provinces, said Stewart: \"Wildfires and floods are driving the premiums higher in the places where we're seeing these trends now.\"<br/><br/> In the U.S. some companies are deciding that it's just not worth the risk. Recently some major insurers stopped offering new policies in California and other states amid rising extreme weather trends. <br/><br/> The Canadian Press<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2023082668859682</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691J-8MY1-JDV5-F44P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"487\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.</p><p>ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW</p><p>See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.</p><p>You might be interested in</p><p>{{type}}</p><p>{{title}}</p><p>Dec 31, 1969</p><p>Comments</p><p>{{type}}</p><p>{{title}}</p><p>Dec 31, 1969</p><p>Comments</p><p>Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour.</p><p>For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.</p><p>Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.</p><p>People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.</p><p>Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.</p><p>Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.</p><p>If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.</p><p>Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.</p><p>If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.</p><p>Related Stories</p><p>Muskoka Fire Danger Rating 2023</p><p>Restricted Fire Zone order in effect June 1 for Muskoka, Parry Sound, Almaguin</p><p>Are you prepared in case of a wildfire Parry Sound-Muskoka?</p><p>2 forest fires in Algonquin Park continue 'not in control'</p><p>Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.</p><p>Reduce sources of indoor air pollution.

Larger and more frequent weather-related losses will continue to pressure property insurance prices higher in the near term,\" they said. <br/><br/> Historically, wildfire damage has been a lot less common than flooding, said Kathryn Bakos, director of climate finance and science at the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation. <br/><br/> But when it does happen, it tends to be significantly worse on average in terms of damage, she said. <br/><br/> \"When you have a wildfire event, you have catastrophic loss of the home,\" she said. <br/><br/> The 2016 Fort McMurray fire is perhaps the best example of this - while flooding tends to account for a large chunk of losses every year, the Fort McMurray fire is the largest-ever insurance loss in the country, said Bakos, accounting for almost three quarters of total insured losses that year.<br/><br/> \"What climate change means in the medium and longer term is more extreme. So you're going to have more heat, dryness and less rain in the system, as well as more rain and storm surges,\" Bakos said.<br/><br/> Annual catastrophic insurable loss claims have risen as a result, she said.<br/><br/> As fire risks rise, insurers are increasingly taking communities' fire defences  into consideration for premiums, said Stewart. <br/><br/> No single event drives insurance premiums up, but overall trends do, said Stewart. Insurers price risk, and the risk of major weather events is rising, he said. <br/><br/> Prices have been rising faster in the Western provinces, said Stewart: \"Wildfires and floods are driving the premiums higher in the places where we're seeing these trends now.\"<br/><br/> In the U.S. some companies are deciding that it's just not worth the risk. Recently some major insurers stopped offering new policies in California and other states amid rising extreme weather trends. <br/><br/> The Canadian Press<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2023082668859312</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691J-8MY1-JDV5-F3TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"502\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 26, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Insurance Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDM4MzQ2QUYzMTY0NDQzQTkxRDQwRUUzRUM5RDg0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURCMkIyODk4NDUwNDQ2NkE3RkQ0Qzg3RUVCOENGQUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTA3MzFBREE5RDkxNEIyNkExMzYyNTkwMEI4ODA2MTQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0Q0ODE3RjNBNDY5NEExNkJDRTQ2NUYwOTQyNDc0MUI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkE5N0U0RkQwM0VENDRCRjkzN0M3RjA1Qjg4OEJERDA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Property Damage</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTgwQTZCOUQxNzQ0NEM5MkJDNjYyNTY4NjMwQkM5Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDBDODI0OTUzNzQzNDA0MkExMkFBOTQ4NzcyREM1RjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

The technology also predicts where a blaze will spread, helping firefighters know where to send resources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moulay Akhloufi, a computer science\u00a0professor and head of the Perception, Robotics\u00a0and Intelligent Machines Laboratory, said it can help spot signs of a fire the human eye would miss.</p><p>\"It's very accurate. Some of the algorithms are able to get to more than 99 per cent\u00a0performance when we want to detect fires,\" he said.</p><p>After Canada's worst wildfire season on record, forestry and wildfire experts are turning to modelling and satellites as an increasingly important tool. While in early stages of development, some firefighters are already using\u00a0artificial intelligence to inform decisions on the ground.</p><p>\"We are using machine learning,\u00a0when and where appropriate, to do a better job managing wildfires,\" said wildfire expert Mike Flannigan, of\u00a0Thompson Rivers University.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's a very effective tool, though it's not a panacea. It's not going to solve all our problems.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Early detection</emphasis></p><p>Inside the Moncton lab, researchers are looking at how machine learning can help with both early detection of fires and modelling possible spread.\u00a0</p><p>The algorithm for spotting fires quickly analyzes data from different sources, including sensors on the ground and images from drones and satellites.</p><p>With those pictures, it rapidly scans pixel by pixel to search for smoke or flames - a level of precision beyond what the human eye could detect. If it spots something of concern, the algorithm then considers environmental conditions -\u00a0like heat and wind -\u00a0to determine if it's actually a fire.</p><p/><p>Akhloufi said they're working to build algorithms that adapt to different conditions, and with more satellites in the sky, the technology will be easier to use in Canada.</p><p>\"We use the data to train the algorithms, so they are able to detect these small pixels that show that there is some smoke or some fire starting,\" he said.</p><p>The team of engineers is also looking at how drones could be used to battle fires from the sky.</p><p>Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blais, a student researcher, said he's working to fine-tune an algorithm to pull off a \"swarm attack\" on a blaze.</p><p>\"So controlling thousands of drones at once is a complicated task for a human. For artificial intelligence, it's a lot more simple. So we train models and algorithms to solve that task,\" he said.</p><p/><p>Akhloufi said his team's fire-spread models will need more satellite data to be used in Canada. He said there's currently not enough information to make the models accurate enough to be used.</p><p>\"We just have to adapt to the geography where we want to work,\" he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First wildfire satellite</emphasis></p><p>The wildfire models and simulations often rely on data from hundreds of Earth-observation satellites.</p><p>A new tool for getting a view on the skies is in development. In 2029, the Canadian Space Agency plans to launch WildFireSat, the world's first purpose-built satellite for monitoring wildfires.</p><p>\"Whether using drones or UAVs\u00a0[unmanned aerial vehicles], or small satellites or ground-based cameras, they basically allow you to have a more hands-off approach when it comes to fire monitoring,\" said Morgan Crowley, a forest fire research scientist with Natural Resources Canada\u00a0who is part of the team working on the mission.\u00a0</p><p>\"That's extremely ideal when you have so many fires all happening at the same time across the country.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">WATCH </emphasis>|See artificial intelligence quickly detect fires:</p><p>The new satellite is designed to pass over during peak burn period, which is the later afternoon. Canada currently has little aerial observation data at that time. The images and data will be in the hands of decision-makers within half an hour.</p><p>Crowley said having more precise information will allow fire management teams to prepare for the next day and \"triage\" different fires.</p><p>\"You can't respond to every fire, nor should you, so being able to decide which ones are the most pressing, dangerous ones allows them to use their resources optimally,\" she said.</p><p>Climate experts say catastrophic fires are a trend that will likely continue into the future, creating a growing need for new tools for firefighters.</p><p>\"We can expect more fire in the future as we continue to warm, longer fire seasons, more lightning, warmer temperatures,\" Flannigan said.</p><p>\"Research we did 20 years ago suggested that eastern Canada would see more fires mid-century. After 2023, I'm starting to rethink that.

The age-old question pops up: \u201cWhat would you rescue if your home was on fire?\u201d Would it be the Scrabble board that carries memories of competitive game nights and alleged cheating? The cowbell your late mom used to ring so vigorously? Would it be the old rocking chair placed peacefully in the corner? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And worse: What happens after your happy place burns to the ground, leaving memories of long days on the lake and late nights by the fire in the rubble? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last summer, residents of Gun Lake, west of Lillooet, learned the answers they didn\u2019t want to know as they watched their homes burn in real time on social media. </p><p>Lightning is believed to have sparked the Downtown Lake fire on July 11, 2023. The fire burned out of control for weeks before a cold front caused flames to intensify resulting in the \u201cincredibly rare\u201d occurrence of a \u201cfire tornado\u201d forming over Gun Lake on Aug. 18. </p><p>In total, more than 40 properties were lost to the fire, some held in their respective families for generations, leaving families to sort through the ashes with another wildfire season fast approaching. </p><p>These are some of their stories. </p><p>Laura O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s family had their place on Gun Lake since 1978. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been going up there since I was a baby,\u201d she said.  \u201cWe go up there every long weekend, every summer, New Year\u2019s and Easter. It was my happy place.\u201d </p><p>O\u2019Keefe and her mom were at their happy place the night before they had to evacuate on July 31. </p><p>\u201cOur neighbour came pounding on the door at 10:30 p.m.,\u201d she says. \u201cWe evacuated over to the other side of the lake and we were watching it from there. We just took a few precious things. We left our beds ready to get back into, thinking that we would be coming back.\u201d </p><p>O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s home was lost forever in the fire tornado. </p><p>\u201cNot only did our trees burn, they were uprooted,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a really windy night. The wind just turned and brought the fire back to all of our places. It was like watching a Hollywood movie. I didn\u2019t watch it burn. My husband told me I had to turn it off. He said I didn\u2019t need to watch that.\u201d </p><p>The next morning, the first thing O\u2019Keeffe thought about was her mom\u2019s Scrabble game she had left behind. </p><p>\u201cI woke up and saw that my neighbours had sent a photo of them playing Scrabble into our chat. I immediately went online and tried to replace our Scrabble board,\u201d she says. \u201cWe played it all the time. It was my mom\u2019s from when she was young. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I left it behind. It was a strange thing to think after my first initial cry.\u201d </p><p>The family was faced with an impossible decision, and most of the things rescued had far more sentimental value than monetary worth. </p><p>\u201cOur place was like a museum full of stuff, but we had to leave most of it. It sounds stupid, but I saved board games that I knew were impossible to find now,\u201d says O\u2019Keeffe. \u201cMy dad was a firefighter. He had a fire alert bus from around the 1930s that he had bought at an auction. It was a big, heavy thing. I brought it home and I felt that it was ridiculous. We used to do paint nights up there, so I brought all of our paintings. We have a shared diary that we all write in; we brought that home. We brought home the kids\u2019 drawings that had been on the walls for years.\u201d </p><p>When O\u2019Keeffe was first allowed to return in September 2023, everything was gone. One of the only things that survived the disaster was a toy Tonka truck, parked amongst the rubble. </p><p>\u201cSome of my family chose not to come up that day,\u201d O\u2019Keeffe says. \u201cWe just looked at the debris. We sifted through some of the rubble to see if there was anything that we could salvage. I cried when I first saw the road towards our place where the burn started. When we got to our property, I was just kind of in shock.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say the family is now starting from scratch. </p><p>\u201cWhen you insure for the city, you don\u2019t think about insuring for trees, telephone poles, your water line and your septic system. That\u2019s not even a consideration in the city,\u201d says O\u2019Keeffe. \u201cYou expect a fire truck is going to arrive and save something. We have nothing left.\u201d </p><p>O\u2019Keeffe vows to do all she can to restore their home away from home, taking the reins from her 83-year-old mom. </p><p>But the recovery now consumes their lives. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exhausting and it takes all our time,\u201d says O\u2019Keeffe. \u201cEvery day, we talk about something to do with it. There are a lot of frustration and challenges. We have our ups and downs, but it feels like there are a lot more downs. We just have to take a deep breath and remind ourselves that it is not a war between each other.\u201d </p><p>O\u2019Keeffe gets emotional when she speaks about the little things that remind her of their loss. </p><p>\u201cI have just been driving around lately. I just see all the green and I know our place is just a bunch of scorched debris,\u201d she says.  \u201cI just think about the fact that I will never be able to hang a hammock in our trees again and look up into the sky.\u201d </p><p>Something as simple as a trip to an outdoor living store can serve as a reminder of the way of life that went up in flames. \u201cGoing into Canadian Tire brings me to tears,\u201d O\u2019Keeffe admits. \u201cI\u2019ll think about the things we need and used to have. It\u2019s crippling when we think about it. I am always surprised by how depressed I get when I go into those kinds of stores.\u201d </p><p>Nevertheless, life still prevails at the lake, and so does the O\u2019Keeffes\u2019 hope of having a home there again. </p><p>\u201cWe have heard that there are some chipmunks back up there, which is good to here,\u201d says Laura. \u201cGrief comes in waves and unexpected ways and is different for everyone. Some people dream about it nightly, some keep envisioning the house being engulfed in flames. Some haven\u2019t had a chance to grieve as they try to get on with recovery.\u201d </p><p>Families say their goals of a return to normality are being held back by red tape and ever-changing goalposts. </p><p>The B.C. government\u2019s Riparian Areas Protection Regulation requires an environmental assessment through a qualified environmental professional, which costs from $5,000 to $10,000, O\u2019Keeffe explains. </p><p>\u201cIn October 2023, 12 owners thought they were getting a head start on obtaining this, only to be halted by the government deciding to redefine the rules in the middle of it. Even if owners wanted to, they can\u2019t move forward until the government makes a decision,\u201d she says. </p><p>\u201cThere is no timeline as to when this will happen. Most burnt structure debris and many burnt \u2018danger\u2019 trees are in the riparian zone, and will require heavy equipment to remove, but machinery cannot go in without the assessment, and WorkSafe BC states that workers cannot go into an area where there are danger trees.\u201d </p><p>O\u2019Keeffe added she believes most people will not be able to afford to rebuild. </p><p>\u201cTo get to a blank slate could cost $75,000 to $100,000 before we even begin to rebuild,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of the hurdles include environmental testing, tree removal, hazardous materials testing, and then removal by qualified professionals, removal of all other debris, septic systems, hydro pole replacement, provincial and SLRD government regulations and permits, skyrocketing building costs, sourcing and hiring qualified professionals, material and labour force (including food and lodging), [and] replanting trees.\u201d </p><p>Laura\u2019s oldest friend, Wendi Harder, has a lifetime of memories at the lake. Her mom, dad and friends built the road to their property themselves. They were also famously the first family in the area to have a phone. </p><p>\u201cWe had a phone in the tree,\u201d laughs Harder. \u201cOur neighbour worked for [the phone company]. They strung a telephone wire through the trees and around the lake towards our house.\u201d </p><p>Harder had an ominous feeling things were about to change forever as she watched the fire grow on Aug. 1. Just before they were told to evacuate, she told her husband to go fishing with his friend. </p><p>\u201cI knew things were never going to be normal again,\u201d she says. </p><p>Harder\u2019s parents built their home with their bare hands. It was her mom\u2019s favourite place in the world. </p><p>\u201cMom turned 90 in August. The plan was that all the grandchildren would be there,\u201d says Harder. \u201cWe were going to have her 90th birthday party at Gun Lake on Aug. 6. By that time, we were evacuated.\u201d </p><p>Harder rescued a memento from the good times\u2014a cowbell her mom used to ring before dinner. </p><p>\u201cThe last time I rang it, Laura came running over with her plate and cutlery,\u201d Harder recalls. </p><p>She wanted to be the first to tell her elderly mother their place by the lake no longer existed.  \u201cWhen the fire hit, I sent a message to all of my friends not to call mum and ask her how she was doing,\u201d says Harder. \u201cShe still loved to go up there. They built the place. She put the roofing on the little cabin.\u201d </p><p>Her mom later returned to assess the damage. </p><p>\u201cShe saw the cabin as it is now. She was very stoic and sad,\u201d Harder says. \u201cEverything they had worked on for decades was gone. She wanted to rebuild. She wanted to get back there again.\u201d </p><p>Sadly, the beloved matriarch passed away at the beginning of this year. \u201cShe won\u2019t get to see the rebuild,\u201d says Harder.  \u201cShe was left with the memory of everything just gone.\u201d </p><p>Brenda Heikkinen was pregnant with her second son when they bought their cabin in 1999. Since then, her children have spent every summer by the lake. Little kids playing in the water quickly became grown-ups excited to spend time together as a family. </p><p>\u201cWe never had TV or internet there,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really great for the kids, even when they were older coming up. If I had known that was going to happen, I would have taken more stuff. I took nothing with me.\u201d </p><p>Some of Heikkinen\u2019s neighbours stayed until the bitter end.  \u201cThey were able to save their properties. They were up there until the end. They were able to get pumps,\u201d she says.  \u201cOne of them had had a video of the fire burning at both sides of him when he was trying to get out of there. It just took off so fast. \u201c </p><p>Heikkinen tearfully recounts the moment she found out her happy place was no more. \u201cI found out Aug. 2 from a close friend, with a picture, nothing left but burnt debris. </p><p>It was sickening and devastating,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was like losing a member of the family. Before that, I kept just saying to myself that I believe in miracles.\u201d </p><p>Heikkinen was planning to retire soon from her job of 42 years to her summer home. Now, she doesn\u2019t know if she can retire at all. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to retire, it\u2019s not like you have savings to rebuild a place,\u201d she says. \u201cThe debris is still on the ground. I have no power poles, no water pump, not even an outhouse. We are looking at getting a trailer. There is no way that I can build a place again.\u201d </p><p>Heikkinen has only been back once since the fire destroyed what was meant to be her idyllic escape from working life. </p><p>\u201cIt was a weird thing for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe picnic table behind the cabin was still standing, and a white, plastic chair. My white chair was still just sitting there.\u201d </p><p>As far as recovery efforts, Heikkinen shares her neighbours\u2019 frustration. </p><p>\u201cThe government has just told us what we can\u2019t do,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just give up.\u201d </p><p>Anna Earl feels like the rest of the world has forgotten about their community. </p><p>\u201cI am not bitter,\u201d she says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen to them. They weren\u2019t there and they didn\u2019t see it.\u201d </p><p>The British woman moved to Canada five years ago.  \u201cWe had only bought our property at Gun Lake two years before the fire,\u201d she says. \u201cWe bought it with the view for it to be our permanent home. It was going to be where we lived forever. We were in the process of renovating it ourselves. It was amazing and I was loving it. We had taken out a big loan.\u201d </p><p>Anna and her husband have travelled the world, but were ready to lay down their roots. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our happy place,\u201d she says. \u201cI have never been somewhere and felt that same kind of affinity towards it. I have travelled the world, but I just wanted to be there all of the time. It is the most beautiful place, and it just does something to me. When I arrive in the area, I just feel like I\u2019m at home. Losing the house was devastating.\u201d </p><p>The Aug. 18 fire tornado took their home, a sight they never thought they would see. \u201cThat was when our house went,\u201d Earl says. \u201cWe lived in Australia before, so we were very aware of fire as a force of nature. We knew that there were forest fires in Canada. You just never think that it\u2019s going to affect you.\u201d </p><p>The couple are now struggling to make ends meet, faced with the reality that you still have to pay a mortgage on a house even if it has burned down. </p><p>\u201cThankfully, our insurance will pay for us to rebuild,\u201d Earl says. \u201cHeartbreakingly, most of our neighbours are not in that position. Some people will just not be able to pay for it. Will their debris just lie on the ground?\u201d </p><p>When Earl returned to Gun Lake, it was to an apocalyptic scene. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s some twisted metal which was the roof. The glass in the windows has melted. There are pools of hardened liquid glass on the ground. Our barbecue is gone. There is nothing left of it. There is a metal bathtub and a fireplace remaining. Other than that, it\u2019s just ashes. It\u2019s like someone just erased the area. It was really eerie, the end of days.\u201d </p><p>Earl is haunted by an old rocking chair they left to burn. </p><p>\u201cYou never pack everything,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a beautiful old rocking chair in the house when we bought it. We miss silly things that don\u2019t make sense.\u201d </p><p>Coupled with the initial shock and dismay of losing it all, there are now doubts people will be allowed to rebuild their homes on the original sites. </p><p>\u201cAll of our houses were built right on the waterside because they were built so long ago. In modern times, you wouldn\u2019t be allowed to build there. Because all of our houses are in those zones, it looks like we will not be allowed to rebuild there,\u201d Earl explains. \u201cThey are very concerned about the environmental impact of rebuilding. If we are not allowed to build where we were, we will have to build on the other side of the road. The loss in value is huge. There are [BC Hydro] power lines in front of the lake. We would just be looking at power lines. Some days, it does feel kind of hopeless.\u201d </p><p>Jessica Chardon\u2019s property was the Gun Lake Yacht Club back in the 1930s/early 1940s. Her grandfather bought the property back in 1948, and three generations have been raised there since. At the time of the fire, it was her uncle\u2019s primary residence. </p><p>She remembers piling as much as they could possibly carry into her car, when the call to evacuate came. \u201cDuring pack-up the sound of the fire was like a freight train, and it was glowing red from above us,\u201d Chardon says. \u201cWe tried to get our sprinkler system working, [but] it had low pressure and wasn\u2019t working effectively.\u201d </p><p>Chardon\u2019s mom refused to leave her home. </p><p>\u201cShe wanted to try and organize the sprinkler system,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mom slept in her car overnight at a safe distance from the fire and returned to the property in the morning. The wildfire structure support personnel were on our property, and they got the sprinkler system working. Mom left mid-day Aug. 1 after the wildfire structure support personnel said they would be back to set up an efficient sprinkler system. The property burned at approximately 4 p.m. that same day.\u201d </p><p>All three historic cabins and their contents were reduced to ash. Two sheds containing family photos, family memorabilia and household goods were destroyed. Chardon\u2019s uncle is a sculptor, and all of his equipment burned. </p><p>Chardon says the SLRD has added to the confusion and grief. </p><p>\u201cThe clean-up process has been slow and overwhelming,\u201d she says. \u201cThere has been minimal government direction and financial assistance.\u201d </p><p>The family now worries they will never be allowed to move back home. </p><p>\u201cThe property has been deemed high-risk from the government-acquired geotechnical survey,\u201d Chardon says. \u201cThis will hamper rebuilding. The SLRD won\u2019t even allow an outhouse during cleanup process. No matter what happens, that beautiful piece of land will never be the same.\u201d </p><p>Pique reached out to the Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness, but did not receive a response in time for publication. </p><p>Chair of the SLRD, Jen Ford, says every homeowner is in a different situation. </p><p>\u201cOne of the things that our staff did well from the beginning was engage with the province, [and] with Red Cross to ensure that they could connect directly with the homeowners. Each property had unique circumstances,\u201d she said. \u201cTo go out with a blanket statement wouldn\u2019t have worked. Not every property had the same level of need in terms of what their insurance and rebuild looked like. Our staff called each and every homeowner separately so that we knew what they needed. We couldn\u2019t say that we gave the homeowners the same box of tools, because it didn\u2019t work that way.\u201d </p><p>Ford confirmed legislation has changed since some of the properties were originally built. </p><p>\u201cThere are a few properties that were built very, very close to the waterline. When legislation changes, that\u2019s just a fact,\u201d she says. \u201cThe waterline might also have changed. It happens in every community. It is challenging. Many of the properties up at Adams Lake [in B.C.'s Interior, which also saw a severe wildfire in 2023] are unable to rebuild what they originally had as they may have been built over the water. We are willing to work with those homeowners on a case-by-case basis.\u201d </p><p>As for the outhouses, the SLRD\u2019s chief administrative officer, Heather Paul, adds the regional district and province are in constant conversation. </p><p>\u201cThis conversation is one of those things that we are trying to bring up with the province,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the time, legislation is that it has to all be septic.\u201d </p><p>Ford stressed the SLRD is learning for the future as severe weather becomes a more regular part of life. </p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all for these climate events. These climate events are a reality,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can provide info as to real life experiences on the ground. We all have valuable experience to share with the province on what worked and what didn\u2019t work. Look at the community of Lytton\u2014they are still grappling with how to rebuild a town almost four years after it burned down. Unfortunately, we will see it again.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-357ee933764f44fe94f500124b0fbf3d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C8N-J421-DY9S-T27B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3057\"/><timeReceived>10:33 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 16, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CMB4</classCode><className>BOARD GAMES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CMB4</classCode><className>BOARD GAMES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The contest was played despite Environment Canada\u2019s Air Quality Health index for Calgary measuring between eight and 10 throughout the day.</p><p>The CFL and CFLPA have a policy that\u2019s been in place since 2019 that states on-field activities are to either be cancelled or ceased when the air-quality rating exceeds seven.</p><p>The CFLPA feels Monday\u2019s game shouldn\u2019t have been played due to a poor air-quality reading. The union says it twice informed the CFL in writing \u2014 before the opening kickoff and afterwards \u2014 that the contest shouldn\u2019t go ahead because of unsafe work conditions.</p><p>In its submission to the CFL after the opening kickoff, the CFLPA stated air-quality levels in Calgary were hazardous and posed a threat to the health and safety of players on the field. It asked the league to delay the game until such time as those levels dropped to seven or below.</p><p>The union also added if the game went ahead, it would bring the matter to the attention of Alberta\u2019s Occupational Health and Safety. The CFLPA says a complaint was filed and the OHS is now investigating the matter.</p><p>A game can start with an air-quality of seven so long as conditions aren\u2019t projected to worsen. But Environment Canada\u2019s AQI for northwest Calgary was still at nine four hours after kickoff.</p><p>Forest fire smoke drifted into Calgary overnight Saturday. Environ-ment Canada\u2019s air quality index at kickoff Monday read nine out of 10, or \u201chigh risk.\u201d</p><p>On Sunday, the CFL and union both monitored air-quality readings in Regina but the Saskatchewan Roughriders-Winnipeg Blue Bombers game went ahead as scheduled because conditions there improved.</p><p>\u201cThe bigger problem we have right now is the league is trying to change the policy,\u201d said Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA\u2019s executive director. \u201cThey\u2019ve informed us they won\u2019t be shutting games down until (an air-quality reading of) nine and that\u2019s unacceptable.</p><p>\u201cThese policies have been followed since 2019.\u201d</p><p>Poor air quality this year has resulted in a number of CFL teams moving their practices to indoor facilities. And in May, the Roughriders Green and White scrimmage was cancelled after two drives due to the poor air quality cause by smoke from wildfires.</p><p>\u201cBefore the Labour Day Classic in Calgary, beginning at noon, air quality readings were taken inside McMahon Stadium every 30 minutes until the conclusion of the game,\u201d said a CFL spokesman. \u201cEach of those readings was shared with the league office, the CFLPA and the two competing teams.</p><p>\u201cThis procedure is consistent with protocol for games where there has been a potential threat to air quality, as has been the case for a number of games this season. All readings taken during warm-ups and throughout the game were considered \u2018moderate.\u2019 As is the case with all matters, the CFL is happy to discuss all procedures and practices with our partners at the CFLPA.\u201d</p><p>The union and league are scheduled to meet Thursday in Vancouver. The meeting was scheduled before Monday\u2019s game but the issue of air quality has been moved to the top of the agenda.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230907RDA0003850137</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6943-DF21-F0HF-8027-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"552\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

This news has shifted the way people talk about the cost of climate change.   <br/><br/> The conversation has switched from the high cost of stopping global warming to the personal costs.<br/><br/> Consumers who haven't transitioned to more efficient options, such as solar panels and heat pumps, are seeing rising energy and electricity costs.<br/><br/> The trend of rising food costs will continue as crop production is affected by temperature shifts.<br/><br/> Future insurance costs seem daunting, if you will even be able to get insurance. Thousands of homes have been deemed uninsurable, and therefore unsellable, due to the risks of climate disasters.<br/><br/> As people in Nova Scotia, B.C. and Quebec are learning, it isn't just houses on flood plains or near forests insurance companies are refusing to cover. Many are simply in areas that lack the expensive defences against those risks.<br/><br/> Take a moment to reflect on what you're doing to protect yourself financially.<br/><br/> Are your behaviours climate-friendly? Maybe you're already reducing your use of plastic, reducing food waste and riding your bike more.<br/><br/> If you are, tell your friends why you're taking these actions. Talking about climate change is one of the most important things you can do.<br/><br/> But perhaps you're in the \"climate doomerism\" camp, feeling like it's too late to do anything, so why bother doing ordinary things like reducing waste or conserving energy?<br/><br/> Or, you might be in the \"You only live once\" camp and darned if you're going to change your lifestyle!<br/><br/> To quote Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General: \"The world needs climate action on all fronts - everything, everywhere, all at once.\"<br/><br/> I would add \"and everyone.\"<br/><br/> Perhaps it's time to embrace the theme of sacrifice - sacrificing a bit today for a better tomorrow and sacrificing for the common good.<br/><br/> We're all in this together, just like during COVID.<br/><br/> We can reframe how we think about climate change and embrace a more sustainable lifestyle.<br/><br/> Climate change is affecting your wallet. There are many simple things you can do to change your lifestyle that aren't onerous or expensive.<br/><br/> It doesn't mean you will always succeed. It's about progress, not perfection. One step at a time.<br/><br/> Join our discussion on Sept. 12, Ditch the Plastic In Your Life, at St. Andrew Anglican Church, 125 Wellington St. W, Alliston, 7 p.m. - 8:30 p.m.<br/><br/> Louise Montague is a member of Greys for Green in New Tecumseth. She is on a journey to reduce her carbon emissions and help others learn about sustainable living. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023082468842832</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691B-9G91-JDV5-F4GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"465\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

But government is also seeing more and more evacuations and access to accommodations is becoming increasingly difficult, she added.</p><p>\u201cWe need accommodations available to keep people safe and to house critical response personnel like firefighters and health care staff,\u201d she said. \u201cAt this time, we are strongly recommending that people with plans to travel to fire affected areas throughout the central interior and southeast in the coming days to cancel those plans. We need tourists and travellers to take this situation as seriously as the residents of these areas.\u201d</p><p>According to Ma, authorities have ordered 15,000 British Columbians to evacuate and 20,000 people are under evacuation alert.</p><p>Eby called the situation unpredictable right now and signalled that additional measures restricting travel might be coming.</p><p>\u201cIf (experts) advise us that they need an order for essential transportation only in those regions, then Minister May and her team and our government will not hesitate to issue those necessary orders.

Kurz noted that these figures represent preliminary estimates with final figures available in 2025. Total emissions from all other sectors totaled 670 megatonnes in 2021. These figures prompted Kurz to describe Canadian carbon emissions to be \u201coff the scale\u201d compared to previous years.</p><p>On 25 June, the Canadi-an Interagency Forest Fire Centre declared that the 2023 wildfire season has seen the largest burned area in Canada\u2019s recorded history. By the end of July, over 120,000 square-kilometres had been burned, nearly twice as much as the previous record of 71,060 in 1995.</p><p>The local wildfire season \u2014 already the worst on record based on hectares burned \u2014 continues unabated in British Columbia and elsewhere across Canada with August said to be the peak of the wildfire season.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CALCOU-news20230810PPOA0003787632</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CALCOU2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68X6-JMV1-F0HF-8232-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"471\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

This news has shifted the way people talk about the cost of climate change.   <br/><br/> The conversation has switched from the high cost of stopping global warming to the personal costs.<br/><br/> Consumers who haven't transitioned to more efficient options, such as solar panels and heat pumps, are seeing rising energy and electricity costs.<br/><br/> The trend of rising food costs will continue as crop production is affected by temperature shifts.<br/><br/> Future insurance costs seem daunting, if you will even be able to get insurance. Thousands of homes have been deemed uninsurable, and therefore unsellable, due to the risks of climate disasters.<br/><br/> As people in Nova Scotia, B.C. and Quebec are learning, it isn't just houses on flood plains or near forests insurance companies are refusing to cover. Many are simply in areas that lack the expensive defences against those risks.<br/><br/> Take a moment to reflect on what you're doing to protect yourself financially.<br/><br/> Are your behaviours climate-friendly? Maybe you're already reducing your use of plastic, reducing food waste and riding your bike more.<br/><br/> If you are, tell your friends why you're taking these actions. Talking about climate change is one of the most important things you can do.<br/><br/> But perhaps you're in the \"climate doomerism\" camp, feeling like it's too late to do anything, so why bother doing ordinary things like reducing waste or conserving energy?<br/><br/> Or, you might be in the \"You only live once\" camp and darned if you're going to change your lifestyle!<br/><br/> To quote Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General: \"The world needs climate action on all fronts - everything, everywhere, all at once.\"<br/><br/> I would add \"and everyone.\"<br/><br/> Perhaps it's time to embrace the theme of sacrifice - sacrificing a bit today for a better tomorrow and sacrificing for the common good.<br/><br/> We're all in this together, just like during COVID.<br/><br/> We can reframe how we think about climate change and embrace a more sustainable lifestyle.<br/><br/> Climate change is affecting your wallet. There are many simple things you can do to change your lifestyle that aren't onerous or expensive.<br/><br/> It doesn't mean you will always succeed. It's about progress, not perfection. One step at a time.<br/><br/> Join our discussion on Sept. 12, Ditch the Plastic In Your Life, at St. Andrew Anglican Church, 125 Wellington St. W, Alliston, 7 p.m. - 8:30 p.m.<br/><br/> Louise Montague is a member of Greys for Green in New Tecumseth. She is on a journey to reduce her carbon emissions and help others learn about sustainable living. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023082468842663</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691B-9G91-JDV5-F4GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"465\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

In partnership with North Salt Spring Waterworks District, Transition Salt Spring, Salt Spring Island Fire Rescue and the land's covenant holders, CARL and ecologist Ruth Waldick are looking at ways to improve the poorly managed forest around the watershed through human intervention \u2014 collecting ground-level scientific data and taking targeted action.</p><p>Cutting-edge forestry work does more than merely thin stands of trees; it includes improvements that augment natural processes of decay and regrowth, adding to native plant and animal species biodiversity. Boosting forest health will help secure water quality for generations, improving the riparian and wetlands areas that enhance water retention.</p><p>Robust soil and understory slow and help clean water as it travels through the watershed. And healthy forests have the additional benefit of being fire and drought resistant; CARL's work will help prevent a potentially catastrophic forest fire that could devastate homes and farms \u2014 and decimate the island's water supplies for years.</p><p>Staying out of the Maxwell Lake area is critical to preventing forest fires and maintaining water quality.

But government is also seeing more and more evacuations and access to accommodations is becoming increasingly difficult, she added.</p><p>\u201cWe need accommodations available to keep people safe and to house critical response personnel like firefighters and health care staff,\u201d she said. \u201cAt this time, we are strongly recommending that people with plans to travel to fire affected areas throughout the central interior and southeast in the coming days to cancel those plans.</p><p>We need tourists and travellers to take this situation as seriously as the residents of these areas.\u201d</p><p>According to Ma, authorities have ordered 15,000 British Columbians to evacuate and 20,000 people are under evacuation alert.</p><p>Eby called the situation unpredictable right now and signalled that additional measures restricting travel might be coming.</p><p>\u201cIf (experts) advise us that they need an order for essential transportation only in those regions, then Minister May and her team and our government will not hesitate to issue those necessary orders. Right now, they want us to be prepared to have those tools ready for when we need because this is a rapidly changing situation.\u201d</p><p>Cliff Chapman, director of provincial operations with BC Wildfire Service, said echoed Ma\u2019s appeal to be prepared and remain claim.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t about worrying,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about being prepared.\u201d</p><p>Ralston said government is continuously assessing resource needs. Chapman added that his agency will likely receive what he called 16 highly qualified individuals from Australia next week.</p><p>\u201cWe also have a request in (to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre) for an additional 200 firefighting resources,\u201d he said, adding that B.C. did not need a declaration of emergency to secure those resources.</p><p>But it is clear that today\u2019s declaration was to sent an important message about the seriousness of the situation, something Eby noted in his remarks.</p><p>\u201cIt communicates to people across the province the seriousness of the deteriorating situation we are facing,\u201d he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRAILD-news20230822PSXA0003811030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRAILD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:690S-5XM1-F0HF-844W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"512\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Haney Heritage Village &amp; Museum, perhaps fittingly next to a former forest-fire lookout . Central for speakers at the unveiling were the devastating wildfires, along with impassioned pleas to take care of the Earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like the first landmark unveiled at Marine Peace Park in Salmon Arm and the second in Chase Memorial Park, the beautiful P\u00edsell sculpture, which means \u2018trout\u2019 in Secwepemctsin, was created from rose granite.</p><p>A metal sculpture complete with viewing portals is part of the artistry, so people can look through and see significant locations and their Secw\u00e9pemc names.</p><p>The landmark was sculpted by Skwlax artisan Shayne D.</p><p>Hunt and David Jacob Harder as part of the Secw\u00e9pemc Landmarks Project.</p><p>The unveiling and dedication on Sept. 16 was also a fundraiser for wildfire evacuees, with donations to the Shuswap Community Foundation Emergency Response Fund encouraged.</p><p>Splatsin Elder Julianna Alexander, who gave the opening prayer in the Secw\u00e9pemc language, implored everyone to do their part to caretake the land.</p><p>She pointed to over-logging and how water is dependent on trees and the climate cycle. All living things exist in a cycle and the cycles are broken, she said.</p><p>\u201cWithout water we\u2019re nothing. And if we continue to do what we\u2019re doing, it will look like the Moon.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re all held responsible how we caretake the land and how we prevent damage to water and all our trees and plants and medicines.</p><p>\u201cI need to say that because right now we\u2019re real stressed and traumatized with all the fire. We\u2019re not the only ones affected by it,\u201d she told those gathered.</p><p>Bart Thomas, Neskonlith, also said caretaking is up to everybody.</p><p>\u201cAnybody who comes here to take, we\u2019ve got to give something back to make sure it stays that way.\u201d</p><p>Thomas gathered Elders for a song prior to the unveiling, while smudging was completed.</p><p>He encouraged people to visit the sacred place with their \u201cbest energies and best thoughts.\u201d</p><p>Artisan Shayne D. Hunt explained that when he designs a sculpture, he waits for the rock to tell him what it wants. This one was about transformation.</p><p>He said quietly he was one of the people who lost their home in the wildfire. \u201cThat fire came in and just took everything. So I say a lot of prayers for everybody that lost.</p><p>\u201cI think the fire itself is a way of cleansing, renewal, having faith again in our culture, in our traditions.\u201d</p><p>Libby Chisolm, project coordinator, MC\u2019d in place of Adams Lake councillor Shelley Witske, project lead, who was recovering following a vehicle accident.</p><p>Chisholm expressed much appreciation for all the Elders who made the Secw\u00e9pemc Landmarks Project what it is. She said it began a few years ago with an Elders meeting of the four surrounding First Nations where they shared their histories.</p><p>The placement of the landmarks and the story boards accompanying them are all guided by Elders.</p><p>Chisholm noted that the landmark signage is interactive, able to play the voices of Elders and recordings of the late Dr. Mary Thomas.</p><p>Elder Lucy William has been translating for the landmark signage and Donna Antoine has helped with translations.</p><p>Trina Antoine, project lead for Splatsin, said in the past her people managed the forests and would conduct controlled burns. Now all the fuel is sitting on the bottom of the forest floors.</p><p>She, too, urged people to respect the water, the land, the animals.</p><p>If people don\u2019t take care of Mother Earth, the Earth will give up on people, she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd everything will be cleansed. And she will do it. She will cleanse this land.

However, like many other regions around the world, Chiang Rai has also experienced wildfires.</p><p>Wildfires in Chiang Rai, as in other parts of Thailand and Southeast Asia, are often caused by a combination of natural and human factors. Dry weather conditions, high temperatures, low humidity, and accumulation of dry vegetation can all contribute to the risk of wildfires. Human activities such as slash-and-burn agriculture, illegal logging, and accidental fires can also spark wildfires in the region.</p><p>Wildfires in Chiang Rai can have detrimental impacts on the environment, including loss of biodiversity, destruction of habitats, and air pollution from smoke and ash. They can also pose risks to human health and safety, as well as damage property and infrastructure.</p><p>To mitigate and prevent wildfires in Chiang Rai and other regions, local authorities and communities undertake various measures, including firebreaks, controlled burns, and public awareness campaigns on fire prevention and forest conservation. Additionally, the Thai government enforces laws and regulations to curb illegal activities that may contribute to wildfires, such as unauthorized land clearing and logging.</p><p>Efforts are also made to promote sustainable land management practices, such as agroforestry and community-based forest management, to reduce the risk of wildfires and promote sustainable use of natural resources in Chiang Rai and other areas of Thailand.</p><p>It's important to note that wildfire occurrences can vary from year to year depending on weather patterns, climate conditions, and human activities, and it's crucial to continually monitor and manage the risks associated with wildfires to protect the environment and communities in Chiang Rai and other affected regions.</p><p>Thailand Seek Help From Neighbors to Reduce Transboundary Air Pollution</p><p>Annual Haze in Chiang Rai</p><p>Chiang Rai province is known to experience an annual haze, particularly during the dry season, which usually occurs from December to April. The haze is mainly caused by a combination of factors, including open burning of agricultural waste, forest fires, and emissions from vehicles and industries.</p><p>Agricultural burning, where farmers burn crop residues after harvesting, is a common practice in Chiang Rai and neighboring regions. This practice is used to clear fields quickly and prepare them for the next planting season. However, the smoke from these burnings, combined with other factors such as weather patterns and pollution from other sources, can contribute to the formation of haze and poor air quality.</p><p>In addition to agricultural burning, forest fires, both natural and human-induced, can also contribute to the haze in Chiang Rai. Forest fires can occur due to a variety of reasons, including dry conditions, illegal land clearing, and other human activities. Smoke and pollutants from these fires can be carried by wind, leading to haze in the region.</p><p>Emissions from vehicles and industries also contribute to the PM2.5 haze in Chiang Rai. As urbanization and industrialization increase, so does the number of vehicles and industrial activities, leading to higher emissions of pollutants into the air, which can worsen the haze situation.</p><p>The annual haze in Chiang Rai can have negative impacts on the environment, public health, and local economy. It can lead to reduced visibility, respiratory problems, and other health issues. Efforts are being made by the government and various stakeholders to address the issue, including stricter regulations on agricultural burning, forest fire prevention measures, and air pollution control measures. Public awareness campaigns and community involvement are also important in tackling the haze problem in Chiang Rai and promoting sustainable practices to reduce air pollution.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIRAI-CHIANGRAITIMES16042023000525</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIRAI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:681K-DYV1-JCH9-G063-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472526</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"821\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CTN News - Chiangrai Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Chiang Rai Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 16, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>Business &amp;

Haney Heritage Village &amp; Museum, perhaps fittingly next to a former forest-fire lookout . Central for speakers at the unveiling were the devastating wildfires, along with impassioned pleas to take care of the Earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like the first landmark unveiled at Marine Peace Park in Salmon Arm and the second in Chase Memorial Park, the beautiful P\u00edsell sculpture, which means \u2018trout\u2019 in Secwepemctsin, was created from rose granite.</p><p>A metal sculpture complete with viewing portals is part of the artistry, so people can look through and see significant locations and their Secw\u00e9pemc names.</p><p>The landmark was sculpted by Skwlax artisan Shayne D. Hunt and David Jacob Harder as part of the Secw\u00e9pemc Landmarks Project.</p><p>The unveiling and dedication on Sept. 16 was also a fundraiser for wildfire evacuees, with donations to the Shuswap Community Foundation Emergency Response Fund encouraged.</p><p>Splatsin Elder Julianna Alexander, who gave the opening prayer in the Secw\u00e9pemc language, implored everyone to do their part to caretake the land.</p><p>She pointed to over-logging and how water is dependent on trees and the climate cycle. All living things exist in a cycle and the cycles are broken, she said.</p><p>\u201cWithout water we\u2019re nothing. And if we continue to do what we\u2019re doing, it will look like the Moon.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re all held responsible how we caretake the land and how we prevent damage to water and all our trees and plants and medicines.</p><p>\u201cI need to say that because right now we\u2019re real stressed and traumatized with all the fire. We\u2019re not the only ones affected by it,\u201d she told those gathered.</p><p>Bart Thomas, Neskonlith, also said caretaking is up to everybody.</p><p>\u201cAnybody who comes here to take, we\u2019ve got to give something back to make sure it stays that way.\u201d</p><p>Thomas gathered Elders for a song prior to the unveiling, while smudging was completed.</p><p>He encouraged people to visit the sacred place with their \u201cbest energies and best thoughts.\u201d</p><p>Artisan Shayne D. Hunt explained that when he designs a sculpture, he waits for the rock to tell him what it wants. This one was about transformation.</p><p>He said quietly he was one of the people who lost their home in the wildfire. \u201cThat fire came in and just took everything. So I say a lot of prayers for everybody that lost.</p><p>\u201cI think the fire itself is a way of cleansing, renewal, having faith again in our culture, in our traditions.\u201d</p><p>Libby Chisolm, project coordinator, MC\u2019d in place of Adams Lake councillor Shelley Witske, project lead, who was recovering following a vehicle accident.</p><p>Chisholm expressed much appreciation for all the Elders who made the Secw\u00e9pemc Landmarks Project what it is. She said it began a few years ago with an Elders meeting of the four surrounding First Nations where they shared their histories.</p><p>The placement of the landmarks and the story boards accompanying them are all guided by Elders.</p><p>Chisholm noted that the landmark signage is interactive, able to play the voices of Elders and recordings of the late Dr. Mary Thomas.</p><p>Elder Lucy William has been translating for the landmark signage and Donna Antoine has helped with translations.</p><p>Trina Antoine, project lead for Splatsin, said in the past her people managed the forests and would conduct controlled burns. Now all the fuel is sitting on the bottom of the forest floors.</p><p>She, too, urged people to respect the water, the land, the animals.</p><p>If people don\u2019t take care of Mother Earth, the Earth will give up on people, she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd everything will be cleansed. And she will do it. She will cleanse this land. Make it whole again for her.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EAGLEV-news20230928PQBA0003903984</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EAGLEV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:698N-45R1-F0HF-80MB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438284</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

The islands have recorded below-average rainfall in recent years because of changing weather patterns impacted by climate change.</p><p>Although the blaze in the northeast of the island is not near the main tourist areas in the southwest, the regional government ordered the evacuation of a state-run hotel in the Teide volcano national park, in central Tenerife, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the fire zone. It was not immediately clear how many peope were staying at the hotel.</p><p>D\u00e1vila said that more than 12,000 people have been evacuated from their homes since the fire started Tuesday. The islands' emergency services said Sunday that 11,600 hectares (29,000 acres) of pine forest and scrubland had been burned.</p><p>No injuries have yet been reported, and D\u00e1vila said that thanks to the firefighters, no houses have been burned so far.</p><p>The fire, described as the worst in Tenerife in decades, is threatening 11 town areas flanking a steep and craggy mountain area. Access for firefighters is extremely difficult.</p><p>The emergency services said air quality in 19 town areas was not good and urged people to stay indoors when possible and wear masks outdoors.</p><p>More than 400 firefighters and soldiers have been deployed, as well as 23 water-carrying helicopters and planes. </p><p>Spain\u2019s mainland is bracing for another heat wave starting Sunday that will last until Thursday. Spain\u2019s state weather service said temperatures would gradually rise to hit 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in parts of the mainland Wednesday and Thursday.</p><p>On Tenerife, the agency predicted maximum temperatures averaging 30 C (86F) for the coming week. </p><p>According to the European Forest Fire Information System, Spain heads the list of EU countries affected by wildfires so far this year, with 75,000 hectares (185,000 acres) burned, ahead of Italy and Greece.</p><p>More than 2,000 people were evacuated in a wildfire on the nearby La Palma island last month that affected some 4,500 hectares (11,000 acres).</p><p>Spain accounted for almost 40% of the nearly 800,00 hectares (2 million acres) burned in the European Union in 2022, the EU agency said.</p><p>The seven Canary Islands are located off the northwest coast of Africa and southwest of mainland Spain.

It was alleged that the Tintagel wildfire near Burns Lake hit power lines.</p><p>Facebook posts from the village Friday afternoon (July 14) addressed two rumours that had been going around.</p><p>The first post, around 1:30 p.m., said there were no planned internet stoppages by Citywest or Telus and fire crews and favourable wind direction are keeping the fire away from the communication towers on Boer Mountain.</p><p>\u201cThere has been a significant miscommunication regarding internet service in the Lakes District. Stress and anxiety coupled with social media have created unnecessary panic and speculation regarding internet service.\u201d</p><p>It added that any posts on social media saying that power is going down at 2 p.m. were \u201cNOT TRUE.\u201d</p><p>The second post at 2 p.m. addressed the second rumour, not-ing that BC Hydro had no plans to cut power to Burns Lake on Friday and that fire crews have kept the Tintegal fires away from the hydro lines.</p><p>The village did remind people that good emergency preparedness planning involves keeping cash on you and keeping your gas tank full.</p><p>The Tintagel fire was 8,514 hectares late last week and burning out of control. First discovered on July 7, the Tintagel and Sheraton Creek fires merged.</p><p>Skeena-Bulkley Valley MP Taylor Bachrach said in a Facebook post that he\u2019s heard the rumours that \u201care flying about the possible loss of fibre optic connectivity in the northwest due to fires.\u201d</p><p>He said he just got off the phone with Citywest CEO where he was assured the risk to connectivity is not imminent, and that the company wasn\u2019t shutting off its system proactively.</p><p>The only risk, he said, is if a burning tree were to fall on the line, but the line has a \u201cdecent tree-free buffer so the risk is thought to be manageable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no need to stockpile gas or cash beyond what is normally reasonable. Please be considerate of your neighbours.\u201d</p><p>Citywest provides services in the region and in a Facebook post Friday morning it said the company is actively monitoring the forest fire situation.

But government is also seeing more and more evacuations and access to accommodations is becoming increasingly difficult, she added.</p><p>\"We need accommodations available to keep people safe and to house critical response personnel like firefighters and health care staff,\" she said. \"At this time, we are strongly recommending that people with plans to travel to fire affected areas throughout the central interior and southeast in the coming days to cancel those plans. We need tourists and travellers to take this situation as seriously as the residents of these areas.\"</p><p>According to Ma, authorities have ordered 15,000 British Columbians to evacuate and 20,000 people are under evacuation alert.</p><p>Eby called the situation unpredictable right now and signalled that additional measures restricting travel might be coming.</p><p>\"If (experts) advise us that they need an order for essential transportation only in those regions, then Minister May and her team and our government will not hesitate to issue those necessary orders.

It was alleged that the Tintagel wildfire near Burns Lake had hit power lines.</p><p>Facebook posts from the village Friday afternoon (July 14) addressed two ru-mours that had been going around.</p><p>The first post, around 1:30 p.m., said there were no planned internet stoppages by Citywest or Telus and fire crews and favourable wind direction are keeping the fire away from the communication towers on Boer Mountain.</p><p>\u201cThere has been a significant miscommunication regarding internet service in the Lakes District. Stress and anxiety coupled with social media have created unnecessary panic and speculation regarding internet service.\u201d</p><p>It added that any posts on social media saying that power is going down at 2 p.m. were \u201cNOT TRUE.\u201d</p><p>The second post at 2 p.m. addressed the second rumour, noting that BC Hydro had no plans to cut power to Burns Lake on Friday and that fire crews have kept the Tintegal fires away from the hydro lines.</p><p>The village did remind people that good emergency preparedness planning involves keeping cash on you and keeping your gas tank full.</p><p>The Tintagel fire was 8,514 hectares late last week and burning out of control. First discovered on July 7, the Tintagel and Sheraton Creek fires merged.</p><p>Skeena-Bulkley Valley MP Taylor Bachrach said in a Facebook post that he\u2019s heard the rumours that \u201care flying about the possible loss of fibre optic connectivity in the northwest due to fires.\u201d</p><p>He said he just got off the phone with Citywest CEO where he was assured the risk to connectivity is not imminent, and that the company wasn\u2019t shutting off its system proactively.</p><p>The only risk, he said, is if a burning tree were to fall on the line, but the line has a \u201cdecent treefree buffer so the risk is thought to be manageable.\u201d \u201cThere is no need to stockpile gas or cash beyond what is normally reasonable. Please be considerate of your neighbours.\u201d</p><p>Citywest provides communications services in the region and in a Facebook post Friday morning it said the company is actively monitoring the forest fire situation.

But government is also seeing more and more evacuations and access to accommodations is becoming increasingly difficult, she added.</p><p>\"We need accommodations available to keep people safe and to house critical response personnel like firefighters and health care staff,\" she said. \"At this time, we are strongly recommending that people with plans to travel to fire affected areas throughout the central interior and southeast in the coming days to cancel those plans. We need tourists and travellers to take this situation as seriously as the residents of these areas.\"</p><p>According to Ma, authorities have ordered 15,000 British Columbians to evacuate and 20,000 people are under evacuation alert.</p><p>Eby called the situation unpredictable right now and signalled that additional measures restricting travel might be coming.</p><p>\"If (experts) advise us that they need an order for essential transportation only in those regions, then Minister May and her team and our government will not hesitate to issue those necessary orders.

And finally, Alberta is known for its fire bans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Due to the large forest regions and farmlands in Alberta, at certain times of the year fire bans are imposed due to extreme fire hazards to protect life and property. Anything that can start a fire should be discarded during the no-fire season. We've noticed a couple of months ago how these wildfires negatively impacted several provinces across Canada such as property, wildlife and citizens.</p><p>Though fire bans are implemented, Alberta's dry climate and extreme heat will eventually cause wildfires to start. Imposing fire bans will mitigate and prevent any future fires from starting intentionally. However, if no fire bans were in place, forest fires would set all of Alberta on fire.</p><p>Acts 1:4-8 tells of the 12 disciples speaking with Christ as He instructed them to wait in Jerusalem for the Holy Spirit to descend upon them so they may be witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea and all the world.</p><p>As the story continues, the Holy Spirit, which resembled fire, came upon the heads of all those in its vicinity. This event resulted in a domino effect where all those present during Pentecost who also heard Peter's sermon, had the Holy Spirit descend upon them as well, which they too became on fire and 3,000 people were baptized in that instance.</p><p>We can say that Jerusalem was set on spiritual fire. Better yet, there was a lift on the fire ban that day where an orchestrated wildfire spread throughout Jerusalem and beyond. There was a prime indicator for the Holy Spirit's descent on the disciples which enabled them to preach the gospel and bring people to Christ, setting Jerusalem spiritually ablaze.</p><p>The kindle that led to the spark was that they were in one accord. Their unity is what caused a spiritual forest fire in Jerusalem, where many people were baptized.</p><p>They lifted their fire ban, which meant that they set aside their differences, admitted their faults to each other, and confessed their sins to God. Though they differed in personality and conduct, they needed to be united as one in purpose as the Father and Son were one in purpose for the salvation of souls.</p><p>Continued division amongst the disciples caused a fire ban that prevented the Holy Spirit from descending.</p><p>As long as division was present, there would be no outpouring of the Holy Spirit. We have to ask ourselves, is the reason why the Holy Spirit has not come down with fire upon us individually, or the church, is because we have imposed fire bans on ourselves? Whatever it may be, burdens, grudges, trials, or temptations, God wants us to give those to Him and lift the fire bans as we become united in purpose for the salvation of souls.</p><p>We know that Alberta's physical wildfires are hazardous to society.</p><p>However, spiritual wildfires, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, would benefit society as a whole. This outpouring is needed in our churches to spread the gospel and prepare people for the Second Coming of Christ.</p><p>So as the fire bans have been lifted in Alberta, let the fire bans in our lives be lifted as well so we can be used by the Holy Spirit and start spiritual wildfires in Alberta for God's glory.</p><p>Teddy Joseph is the pastor at the Stettler and Sedgewick Seventh-day Adventist Church.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Stettler Independent</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STEIND-news20230925PST4518632</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STEIND2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6981-66P1-JD2C-J089-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459608</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"598\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

We need to break this cycle of destruction.</p><p>Climate change is the defining issue of our times.</p><p>At a societal level, our choice is between life and money.</p><p>Within the context of forestry, the choice is between profit (driven by clear-cutting) and community safety and health-driven by a new paradigm of forest management based on ecology and conservation.</p><p>Taryn Skalbania Peachland</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUMREV-news20210923PSSA0002123381</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUMREV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63NX-K151-F0HF-84T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438276</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"507\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

More than 1,000 wildfires are burning across the vast country.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, our wildfire situation has taken another turn for the worse with a fire burning west of Yellowknife now representing a real threat to the city,\" Shane Thompson, the Northwest Territories' environment minister, told a news conference.</p><p>He ordered the city's nearly 20,000 residents to leave by noon Friday. There is only one highway open to the south.

)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The huge wildfire ravaging the Spanish holiday island of Tenerife that has burnt through more than 2,600 hectares of land is the \"most complex\" blaze to hit the Canary Islands in four decades, the regional government said Thursday.</p><p>The fire, which broke out late on Tuesday, has been raging through a forested area with steep ravines in the northeastern part of the island which is part of the Spanish archipelago that lies off the coast of northwestern Africa.</p><p>So far, the blaze, which has a perimeter of 30 kilometres (19 miles), has destroyed more than 2,600 hectares (6,400 acres), affecting some 7,600 people, many of whom were evacuated, the authorities said in a morning update.</p><p>Early on Thursday, people were evacuated from 10 small villages and hamlets in the area, they said, while also ordering residents to remain in their homes as a precautionary measure in La Esperanza, some five kilometres from the island's northern airport, Tenerife Norte.</p><p>There was no immediate reports of flights being affected.</p><p>\"It's been a very difficult night\u2026 this is probably the most complex fire we've ever had in the Canary Islands in at least the past 40 years,\" Fernando Clavijo, regional head of the seven-island archipelago, told reporters.</p><p>\"The extreme heat and weather conditions\u2026 is making the work harder,\" he added.</p><p>More than 250 firefighters backed by 17 aerial resources, have been drafted to tackle the fire, and troops from the Military Emergency Unit (UME) who regularly help efforts to stamp out some of the most dangerous blazes have also been mobilised.</p><p>\"A new detachment of UME troops will arrive during the afternoon,\" he said, with the defence ministry saying it would raise the number of troops sent to Tenerife to more than 200.</p><p>\"We are facing a fire the likes of which we've never seen before in the Canary Islands,\" meteorologist Vicky Palma, pointing to the vast column of smoke from a fire which by Thursday morning had been spreading for 34 hours.</p><p>The local authorities have cut off roads leading to the mountains on the northeastern part of the island.</p><p>\"We ask that the population respect these road closures,\" said Montserrat Roman, head of the archipelago's civil protection service.</p><p>The fire broke out after the islands were hit by a heat wave that has left many areas tinder dry.</p><p>As global temperatures rise due to climate change, scientists have warned heat waves will become more frequent and intense, with a much wider impact.</p><p>In 2022, which was a particularly bad year for wildfires in Europe, Spain was the worst-hit nation with nearly 500 blazes that destroyed more than 300,000 hectares, according to figures from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).</p><p>So far this year, more than 71,000 hectares have been ravaged by fire in Spain, which is one of the European countries most vulnerable to climate change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But peony bushes passed down from her late mother survived and the blackened May Day tree planted in memory of her longtime partner is sending up new shoots \u2014 hopeful signs as she prepares to start over in the East Prairie M\u00e9tis Settlement, about 240 miles (385 kilometers) northwest of Edmonton.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t leave,\u201d said Johnston, 72, who shared a home with her son and daughter-in-law. \u201cWhy would I want to leave such beautiful memories?\u201d</p><p>The worst wildfire season in Canadian history is displacing Indigenous communities from Nova Scotia to British Columbia, blanketing them in thick smoke, destroying homes and forests and threatening important cultural activities like hunting, fishing and gathering native plants. </p><p>Thousands of fires have scorched more than 42,000 square miles (110,00 square kilometers) across the country so far. On Tuesday, almost 900 fires were burning\u2014 most of them out of control \u2014 according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre website.</p><p>Fires aren\u2019t uncommon on Indigenous lands, but they\u2019re now occurring over such a widespread area that many more people are experiencing them at the same time \u2014 and some for the first time \u2014 stoking fears of what a hotter, drier future will bring, especially to communities where traditions run deep.</p><p>\u201cI've never seen anything like this,\u201d said Raymond Supernault, chairman of the East Prairie M\u00e9tis Settlement, where he said more than 85% of the 129-square-mile (334-square-kilometer) settlement burned in the first wildfire there in over 60 years. Fourteen houses and 60 other structures were destroyed by the intense, fast-moving fire that led to the evacuation of almost 300 people and decimated forested land.</p><p>\u201cIn blink of eye, we lost so much \u2026 it was devastating. I can't stress that enough,\u201d said Supernault, who said he hasn't seen any elk or moose, both important food sources, since the fire.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t just jump in the car and go to the IGA,\u201d for groceries, Supernault said. \u201cWe go to the bush.\u201d</p><p>In Canada, 5% of the population identifies as Indigenous \u2014 First Nation, M\u00e9tis or Inuit \u2014 with an even smaller percentage living in predominantly Indigenous communities. Yet more than 42% of wildfire evacuations have been from communities that are more than half Indigenous, said Amy Cardinal Christianson, an Indigenous fire specialist with Parks Canada.</p><p>As of last week, almost 23,000 people from 75 Indigenous settlements have had to evacuate this year, according to Indigenous Services Canada. More than 3,600 people from 15 First Nations reserves in five provinces were evacuated as of Thursday, the agency said.</p><p>It\u2019s not uncommon for Indigenous communities to evacuate repeatedly, Christianson said. A recent analysis of the Canadian Wildland Fire Evacuation database found that 16 communities were evacuated five or more times from 1980\u20132021 \u2014 all but two of them First Nations reserves, said Christianson, who participated in the analysis by the Canadian Forest Service.</p><p>Fires now \u201care so dangerous and so fast-moving\" that evacuations increasingly are necessary, a challenge in some remote communities where there might be one road in, or no roads at all, said Christianson, who is M\u00e9tis.</p><p>Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta \u2014 a province where about 7,600 square miles (19,800 square kilometers) have already burned, compared to just over 695 square miles (1,800 square kilometers) in all of 2022 \u2014 said some places burning again this year haven't fully recovered from previous fires.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time,\u201d said McMullen, calling it the worst fire season in Canadian history. \u201cThese are life-altering events.\u201d</p><p>Christianson said the effects will be felt for generations, because the intense heat is burning the soil and making it difficult for trees and other plants to regenerate.</p><p>She said Indigenous communities are increasingly vulnerable because they're often left out of decisions about forest management and fire response, and often can't afford to hire emergency managers. What's more, when fires affect urban centers at the same time, fire suppression shifts to larger communities.</p><p>Indigenous communities \u201creally want to be leaders in managing fires in their territory,\u201d including a return to preventive burning that was long suppressed by the government, said Christianson.</p><p>The Algonquins of Barriere Lake in northern Quebec evacuated in June because of heavy smoke from wildfires that came within 9 miles (15 kilometers) of and almost surrounded the reserve where about 350 to 400 people live, often miles apart, said Chief Casey Ratt, who never experienced a forest fire before this year.</p><p>\u201cLast year, me and my wife were talking about how many fires there were in Alberta, then boom! There were so many in Quebec this year,\u201d said Ratt. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, now we\u2019re dealing with wildfires like they are out west.\u2019\u201d</p><p>But it also wasn\u2019t a total surprise, said Ratt, because summer heat is more intense and ice forms later in the winter and melts faster in the spring. That diminishes their ability to ice-fish and hunt for moose and beaver, which often requires crossing a lake to an island.</p><p>\u201cSomething is happening,\u201d said Ratt, who believes climate change is largely to blame. \u201cI think this will be the norm moving forward.\u201d </p><p>The biggest concern is whether cultural traditions that have been passed down from generations of elders will survive into the future, said Supernault, from the East Prairie M\u00e9tis Settlement.</p><p>\u201cOur earth is changing ... and our traditional way of life is now put on hold,\u201d said Supernault. \u201cYou can't put a price on culture and traditional loss.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Clavijo said the fire had a nearly 30-kilometer-long (19-mile) perimeter.</p><p>\u201cThis is probably the most complicated blaze we have had on the Canary Islands, if not ever, in at least the last 40 years,\u201d Clavijo told reporters. Extreme temperatures in the island, he said, added to \u201cspecific meteorological conditions\u201d caused by the fire that turned the area into a virtual oven.</p><p>The blaze, which started Tuesday night, is centered on a craggy, mountainous area, which is difficult for emergency brigades to access. Spanish authorities said their main goal is to contain the fire and prevent it from reaching more populated areas. The island\u2019s main town, Santa Cruz, is 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from the flames.</p><p>The wildfire is threatening six municipalities. Some 7,600 residents in the area have either been evacuated or ordered to stay indoors Thursday due to hazardous air quality. Clavijo said firefighters were working day and night but the fire remained \u201cout of control.\u201d</p><p>The seven-island archipelago is located off the northwest coast of Africa and southwest of mainland Spain. </p><p>Tenerife is one of Spain\u2019s tourist hotspots. Tenerife Tourism office stressed in a statement Thursday afternoon that the main tourist areas and cities of the island are away from the fire. Business continues as usual in accommodation establishments, beaches and other tourist sites located in areas near the coast and in the midlands, the office said. </p><p>But access to the Teide National Park, the most important tourist attraction in Tenerife after the beaches, will be closed to the public from Thursday 18:00 local time (17:00 GMT), said the Canary regional government. All tourist facilities around the Teide volcano area, including accommodation, will be evacuated, alongside the Astrophysics Institute of the Canary Islands' personnel.</p><p>Further evacuations are expected in the coming hours in several neighbourhoods. The wildfire is particularly virulent on its north side.</p><p>Temperatures in the Canary Islands peaked at more than 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in recent days. Temperatures are set to rise again on Saturday.</p><p>The fire could become Spain\u2019s worst blaze so far this summer, as the country suffers another year of severe drought.</p><p>More than 2,000 people were evacuated in a wildfire on the nearby La Palma island last month that affected some 4,500 hectares (11,000 acres).</p><p>Wildfires have burned almost 64,000 hectares (158,000 acres) in Spain in the first seven months of the year, according to Spanish government data. That's the third highest figure in the last decade. </p><p>Spain accounted for almost 40% of the nearly 800,00 hectares (2 million acres) burned in the European Union in 2022, according to the European Forest Fire Information System.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-62c6c843d82adc325bdf5b92033afced</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YV-DH21-DY9S-T0K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"525\"/><timeReceived>08:42 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 17, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Disclosure information is available on the original site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">___</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Author: Ryan M. Katz-Rosene, Associate Professor, School of Political Studies, L\u2019Universit\u00e9 d\u2019Ottawa/University of Ottawa</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earlier this fall, a commentary in the journal Nature Communications, Earth &amp; Environment argued for a change to the implementation of the Paris Agreement\u2019s reporting mechanisms. The authors called for all countries to report carbon emissions and removals taking place across their entire territories, not just within so-called \u201cmanaged\u201d lands (as is presently the case).</p><p>However, this poses a challenge here in Canada, as there is deep uncertainty about the total carbon flux (balance of emissions and captures) in Canada\u2019s \u201cunmanaged\u201d land. </p><p>I echo calls for the Government of Canada to scale up and improve its greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring and modelling across Canada\u2019s entire territory, and to report these findings in a much more open and transparent manner as part of its annual National GHG Inventory. </p><p>Differentiating between managed and unmanaged land</p><p>Under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, member countries are expected to report GHG emissions and removals taking place as a result of human activities. However, within the LULUCF (or Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry) sector, it is not always clear what constitutes an anthropogenic influence. </p><p>The guidance provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been to delineate between \u201cmanaged\u201d and \u201cunmanaged\u201d lands, and to focus GHG reporting on the former since these are areas under substantive human influence. While a number of countries make use of this distinction, the portion of land in Canada that is unmanaged is truly significant \u2014 equivalent to about 69 per cent of the country\u2019s total land area. </p><p>Canada\u2019s National GHG Inventory does contain information about the carbon flux within managed lands, or lands comprised mostly of managed forest. There is currently around 232 million hectares of managed forest in Canada, however, this leaves roughly 715 million hectares of land in Canada which is technically unmanaged \u2014 all of which are unaccounted for in the National GHG Inventory.</p><p>What\u2019s more, while Canada does track emissions from natural disturbances (such as in a forest fire) occurring in managed areas, it does not actually report these disturbances to the UN as part of its LULUCF emissions, based on the claim that these are not anthropogenic. </p><p>While there is a logic to separating these out, there is a substantial difference to Canada\u2019s total LULUCF emissions, depending on whether or not they are included. For instance, if natural disturbances are included in the tally, Canada\u2019s managed land is typically a net source of carbon, while if they are not included, Canada\u2019s managed land is typically a net carbon sink.</p><p>The underlying problem, however, is the lack of clear and transparent information about GHG emissions and removals in Canada\u2019s unmanaged lands. </p><p>Estimates vary widely</p><p>Earlier this summer, during Canada\u2019s unprecedented wildfire season, I asked the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Canada (NRCAN) for historical information about the net Carbon flux in unmanaged lands. I was surprised to learn that NRCAN does not yet have this data. </p><p>What NRCAN does have is a very robust carbon budget modelling tool, and thanks to this, some preliminary (unverified) estimates of wildfire emissions in unmanaged forests.</p><p>Wildfire emissions estimates for unmanaged forests are indeed a step in the right direction (as wildfires account for the bulk of emissions from natural disturbances), but there still remains a majority of unmanaged land which is not forested \u2014 including, for instance, vast peatlands which are also subject to wildfires. </p><p>No GHG emissions of any type occurring in unmanaged lands are currently being tracked or reported within the National GHG Inventory process.</p><p>There have been various efforts to quantify these emissions, yet estimates vary considerably, with some data sets limited to forest lands, and others looking at the full national territory. </p><p>One recent estimate used 16 different \u201cDynamic Global Vegetation Models,\u201d and found that over the 20-year period from 2000-2020 unmanaged forests sequestered on average about 189 Megaton CO2 per year. </p><p>However, the Global Carbon Project\u2019s estimates of \u201catmospheric inversions\u201d suggests there may be orders of magnitude more carbon removal in Canada\u2019s unmanaged land.</p><p>The size of the discrepancy between these estimates is puzzling. While one obvious explanation comes down to the former model using intact forests as a proxy for unmanaged land, and the latter model including all of Canada\u2019s unmanaged land area, scientists believe there may be more to this discrepancy.</p><p>A need for further research and better reporting</p><p>It is unfortunate that Canada has no publicly stated estimate of the country\u2019s total carbon flux. This is important information to help track whether Canada\u2019s landmass is sequestering enough CO2 to offset natural disturbances, or whether the latter are outweighing the former. </p><p>It is essential that the Government of Canada enhance its current efforts in land-based carbon flux analysis, and that such data and analysis is reported to the public in a more clear and transparent way.</p><p>___</p><p>Ryan M.

For weeks, a thick haze carrying dangerous PM2.5 air pollution particles has greeted visitors in northern Thailand.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The PM2.5 air pollution has persisted, but the tourists have not, with bookings plummeting as the Songkran Festival quickly approaches.</p><p>On Friday, Chiang Mai's governor ordered residents to stay at home on Friday as wildfires raged near the city, causing air pollution levels to fall once more.</p><p>'The PM2.5 haze is everywhere,' said Gade Grey, proprietor of the Elliebum Boutique Hotel in Chiang Mai, which attracted an estimated 4 million global tourists in 2019, many of whom are Chinese.</p><p>In exasperation over the government's failure to fix the situation, a number of Chiang Mai citizens have gone to social media to write snarky comments about the city's ongoing air pollution.</p><p>'We will select and burn only quality dried leaves,' one such comment reads. Smoke from northern highland forest fires is combined with smoke from corn waste. They are burned while the threat of weed-killing chemicals is removed. You can be certain that every grain of superfine PM2.5 will enter your nose and lungs. Hurry, the dried leaves will soon run out.'</p><p>The other comment, from Dr Rungsrit Kanjanavanit, an oncology expert at Chiang Mai University's Faculty of Medicine, reads, 'Chiang Mai, every breath is an adventure.' Today is insane, an unlivable place.'</p><p>Petition over air pollution</p><p>A group of local artists met in Chiang Rai to stage a contest to see who could hold their breath the longest in order to show the world that the PM2.5 problem is awful. A group of painters painted a massive 13m by 2.5m depiction of the Phu Chi Fa mountain and forests on fire.</p><p>According to ThaiPBS, residents plan to congregate in front of the Phaya Mengrai monument at 5 p.m. on Monday to inform authorities that the dust situation has become intolerable.</p><p>Residents in Chiang Mai are being urged to attend the Legal Research and Development Centre of Chiang Mai University to sign a petition in support of a lawsuit to be filed in the Chiang Mai Administrative Court against Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, the National Environment Board, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over the PM2.5 problem.</p><p>Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha held video conferences with the leaders of neighbouring Myanmar and Laos to discuss the issue, which affects broad parts of Southeast Asia each year. Northern Thailand has been suffering from severe PM2.5 air pollution since the beginning of the year, owing in part to seasonal agricultural burning.</p><p>According to the public health ministry, about two million individuals have required medical care this year for respiratory diseases induced by air pollution. According to IQAir, levels of the most harmful PM2.5 particles, which are so small that they can enter the bloodstream, were more than 66 times higher than the World Health Organization's yearly guideline.</p><p>Wildfires in Chiang Rai Province</p><p>Now forest wildfires have exacerbated the situation, on Thursday in Chiang Rai province burned 96 hectares of forest.</p><p>The Pa Doi Tung forest fire control station raced to the scene, together with local officials, the Pha Muang task force, volunteers, and eight fire engines, to extinguish and confine the forest fire along the Thai-Myanmar border near Ban Pha Bue and Ban La Ba in Mae Fa Luang.</p><p>The Pha Muang task force also sent personnel to contain the fire near the road leading to Ban La Ba.</p><p>According to station chief Piyapong Sornchai, officials attempted to contain the fire to prevent it from spreading further and bolstered natural fire barriers such as the Lam Huay stream and a neighbouring coffee plantation with the assistance of two local villages.</p><p>Officials also sprayed water in specific areas to keep the fire from spreading to important landmarks. The worst wildfire in 20 years, according to locals.</p><p>Aerial inspections will be performed to assess the damage, with 600 rai estimated to be severely impacted.</p><p>More than 100 authorities would be deployed to search the region, with air support utilized to drop water on the same location to prevent flare-ups, according to Mr Piyapong.</p><p>Aside from Doi Tung, fires were also raging on Doi Jorrakhe in Mae Chan district and Pa Doi Phra Bat in Muang district, though local reports indicate that the blazes in these areas have since been 70-80% suppressed. The woodland in Doi Luang National Park near Ban Tham Pa Sang in Phan district was also burnt by the fire.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIRAI-CHIANGRAITIMES1004202300003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIRAI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6803-K031-F00C-6015-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472526</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"765\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CTN News - Chiangrai Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Chiang Rai Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 10, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001348</classCode><className>POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000056</classCode><className>AIR POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp;
