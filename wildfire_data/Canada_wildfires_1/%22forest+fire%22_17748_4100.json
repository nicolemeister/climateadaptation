On February 15, Canada signed a $108 million contract with Parsons Inc. for construction management and two years of care and maintenance on the Faro mine site. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Parsons, one of the largest players in remediation in the world, boasts that their \u201ccontract could span over 20 years and exceed $2 billion.\u201d </p><p>The numbers boggle the mind, says Lewis Rifkind of the Yukon Conservation Society. Afterall, $2.2 billion is the total 15-year federal allocation for the northern abandoned mines program designed for eight mines in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. Faro is just one, and the federal contract does not include the Vangorda plateau portion of the Faro site, which was sold separately for future and concurrent, development and reclamation. </p><p>But still, the numbers keep going up, and the timeline keeps getting extended. Five years ago, the costs were anticipated at $500 million for 10-15 years, and now estimates are for $2 billion over twenty years. </p><p>In addition to the contract awarded to Parsons this week, another contract for $5.8 million was awarded to another company, CH2M Hill Canada Ltd., to design a water treatment plant for the site. According to Treasury Board data, these two contracts are in addition to the total federal spend on the Faro mine site between 2006 to 2021, which amounts to over $600 million. </p><p>Geology drove the creation of the mine, and drives the clean-up. The tailings, which cover an area equivalent to over 26,000 football fields, creates acid-rock drainage, which, if not mitigated, grows worse over time. There are an estimated 70 million tonnes of tailings and 320 million tonnes of waste rocks on the Faro site. </p><p>Once billed as the largest open pit lead-zinc mine in the world, the story of Faro is not a straight, nor smooth line. Faro is a story of zealot prospectors, ambitious and visionary collaborators, and an assortment of wheelers and dealers, aided and abetted by eager politicians. </p><p>They waived a mine and a town into existence essentially in the middle of nowhere, and convinced authorities to build a new hydro dam and improve highways; and for banks and governments to open their wallets with an assortment of loans, loan guarantees and grants \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cother people\u2019s money\u201d. A book of the same name documents the rise and fall of one of the Faro mine owners, Dome Petroleum. </p><p>Faro\u2019s height of prosperity in the late 1970\u2019s was under Dome\u2019s tenure and boasted the highest standard of living for the community\u2019s 2,500 people. Labourers were paid $25 per hour and the cafeteria served steak and lobster. Those were the heady days of Dome Petroleum. </p><p>But Dome\u2019s dealings paled compared to those during the tenure of Curragh Resources under Clifford Frame with his cut-throat, anything-to-save-a-buck approach to mining, that ended with the death of 26 miners at his Westray mine, that also ended his Faro venture. </p><p>Between closures and shut downs, Faro produced ore for around 22 of the 28 years between 1970 and 1998. Community comfort rose and fell with the price of ore. The townsite was carefully planned but burned to the ground in a forest fire in 1968, one year after completion. The town was rebuilt with tiers of stratified housing according to rank (executives on the upper bank) and bunkhouses on the lower bench. It was carefully located distant from Ross River, and kept most of its First Nation employees working in the coal mine adjacent to Carmacks. </p><p>Faro\u2019s legacy is Yukon-wide. It created the demand for the Aishihik hydro dam which left the territory with excess hydro capacity for decades, opened the south Klondike highway year-round, left a viable townsite with affordable housing supported by a municipal grant which has left structures in place to house care and maintenance workers into the future. </p><p>But the colonial arrogance of the day is much more apparent now than then. The federal government asserts that remediation and restoration of the land is part of reconciliation efforts with First Nations. Submissions from the Liard First Nation to Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Board show that they are not fully convinced that the standards set for remediation are high enough. </p><p>Parsons is now managing two of the world\u2019s largest mine closure and reclamation projects, the Giant Mine in Northwest Territories, and now the Faro Mine Remediation Project, both of which rank in the top five on Canada\u2019s most contaminated sites list. </p><p>Rifkind says that without mining there would be no reclamation industry, likening it to an altered form of Naomi Klien\u2019s concept of disaster capitalism \u2014 companies that specialize in doing massive environmental cleanup after massive mining operations leave a mess. </p><p>That said, and apart from the enormous amount of greenhouse gas emissions that will be released as part of this project, and ignoring the amount of lime that will be required, Rifkind says that Parsons would be his choice of company to undertake the project as well. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re thankful that something is actually happening. At least they are doing something\u201d he says. </p><p>And for First Nations, the reclamation pill is harder to swallow. Never settled and never ceded, the Liard First Nation and the Ross River Dene Council have witnessed the slow and cumulative destruction of animal habitat, and the erosion of their wilderness of clean rivers and lakes. </p><p>\u201cThe legacy of harm is both physical and emotional,\u201d said Chief Jack Caesar of the Ross River Dena Council.

In an attempt to avoid that premium jump, Grulkey increased his deductible from $1,000 to $10,000. As a result, his premium only increased to $4,900.</p><p>Last month, he learned his premium was again set to jump from $4,900 to almost $6,800, even with the $10,000 deductible.</p><p>\"I asked my broker what would happen if I were to bump the deductible up to $20,000,\" Grulkey explained. \"But the insurance company saw that coming and said if you increase your deductible, it only reduces your premium by $30.\"</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Grulkey said his broker would shop around other insurance companies for a more affordable plan, but because 100 Mile House is within 50 kilometres of an active wildfire, no other companies will quote him.</p><p>\"Because I'm renewing in forest fire season, it's like paying for gas during rush hour in the morning,\" he said, \"I'm curious how many other businesses and property owners are being gouged by the insurance companies.\"</p><p>It's not uncommon for insurance rates and availability to be impacted by major events like fires, according to Rob de Pruis, director of consumer and industry relations with the Insurance Bureau of Canada.</p><p>READ MORE: Activists work to ensure Trans Mountain won't get insurance</p><p>\"When we see severe weather events like wildfires, it's very common that insurance companies routinely have limitations for placing new policies,\" de Pruis said. \"Insurance is preparing for the unforeseen risk. You can't buy house insurance when your house is on fire.\"</p><p>De Pruis said there are many factors that can impact premium cost, such as claims history, maintenance, replacement cost, change in business type or increase in inflation value.</p><p>There are also factors that have nothing to do with the individual property, such as an insurance company's overall claims from the previous year or investment income loss, which is something de Pruis said many insurance companies have faced over the past decade.</p><p>\"A lot of times the premium increases are completely independent of individual circumstances,\" he said.</p><p>There are policy options to help mitigate problems that can arise trying to renew during an event such as a wildfire, de Pruis noted. A 'declaration of emergency endorsement' can extend a policy's renewal date and maintain coverage during such a scenario. Renewal dates can also be changed part-way through a policy term, which is something de Pruis recommends if wildfire season is a concern to property owners.</p><p>Concerned customers can also reach out to the BC Financial Services Authority, a Crown agency that is responsible for supervising and regulating the financial service sector.</p><p>Sarah Lusk, director of communications for the BCFSA, said they are monitoring the situation closely and encourage property owners to contact them with insurance-related concerns.</p><p>\"While there's no obligation for insurance companies to renew policies, we expect insurers to treat consumers fairly and comply with all regulatory requirements,\" Lusk said.</p><p>Grulkey said he has no choice but to renew his plan at the higher cost, but has reached out to local politicians to make sure they're aware of the issue. He said he worries about the future of business in 100 Mile House with such skyrocketing costs. In addition to the higher insurance premiums, his municipal property tax also increased drastically in 2018.</p><p>\"There isn't enough retail traffic to justify high rents, and the amount the municipality and insurance companies take off the top leaves very little to do repairs, let alone renovations that would benefit the town,\" he said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:melissa.smalley@100milefreepress.net\">melissa.smalley@100milefreepress.net</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 100 Mile House Free Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLEHFP-news20210806PAA4195618</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:639N-Y2V1-F0HF-84MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

The complete set of financial statements and management discussion and analysis for the periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 are posted on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url> and on the Company's website <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.journeyenergy.ca\">www.journeyenergy.ca</url>.</p><p>Highlights for the first quarter, and to-date are as follows: //st * Generated sales volumes of 12,920 boe/d in the first quarter (45% crude oil; 11% NGL's; 44% natural gas). All of Journey's production is currently unhedged. Year-over-year sales volumes increased 52%. * Generated adjusted funds flow of $18.0 million or $0.31 per basic share and $0.28 per diluted share. Quarter-over-quarter, Adjusted Funds Flow was impacted by a 16% decrease in average, corporate, realized pricing per boe. The corresponding 39% reduction in operating netback was largely offset by the by the quarter over quarter increase in sales volumes. * Closed a Canadian Development Expense flow-through-share financing of 3.0 million shares at $6.62 /share for gross proceeds of $20.1 million . The proceeds of the flow-through-share financing will be utilized to fund an 8 well drilling program in the second half of 2023. * Produced 5,603 megawatts of electricity at Journey's power generation facility in Countess, Alberta at an average price of $159.65 /MWH. The run-rate during the first quarter was 64% of capacity. * Completed the purchase of the 16.5 MW power plant in MazeppaAlberta on April 28 . Journey continues to make progress with plans to re-activate this facility in its current location, most recently entering into an agreement to purchase the land the power facility resides on. In addition, the Company continues to advance the approval process for reconnecting and reactivating the facility to the power grid.</p><p>Three months ended</p><p>March 31, % Financial ($000's except per share amounts) 2023 2022 change Production revenue 58,443 45,858 27 Net income 6,440 13,769 (53) Per basic share 0.11 0.28 (61) Per diluted share 0.10 0.25 (60) Adjusted Funds flow 17,959 20,401 (12) Per basic share 0.31 0.42 (26) Per diluted share 0.28 0.36 (22) Cash flow from operations 11,461 21,811 (47) Per basic share 0.20 0.45 (56) Per diluted share 0.18 0.39 (54) Net capital expenditures 6,818 12,162 (44) Net debt 71,071 38,481 85 Share Capital (000's) Basic, weighted average 58,153 48,472 20 Diluted, weighted average 64,036 55,998 14 Basic, end of period 60,923 50,912 20 Fully diluted 67,863 59,272 14 Daily Sales Volumes Natural gas (Mcf/d) Conventional 30,608 22,836 34 Coal bed methane 4,279 4,163 3 Total natural gas volumes 34,887 26,999 29 Crude oil (Bbl/d) Light/medium 3,564 2,531 41 Heavy 2,175 629 246 Total crude oil volumes 5,739 3,160 82 Natural gas liquids (Bbl/d) 1,367 832 64 Barrels of oil equivalent (boe/d) 12,920 8,492 52 Average Realized Prices 1 Natural gas ($/mcf) 3.66 4.74 (23) Crude Oil ($/bbl) 79.16 104.80 (24) Natural gas liquids ($/bbl) 49.32 60.59 (19) Barrels of oil equivalent ($/boe) 50.26 60.00 (16) Operating Netback ($/boe) Realized prices 1 50.26 60.00 (16) Royalties (10.38) (10.63) (2) Operating expenses (19.78) (17.40) 14 Transportation expenses (1.06) (0.51) 108 Operating netback 19.04 31.46 (39) Note: 1. Realized prices include physical hedging gains.</p><p>OPERATIONS</p><p>In the first quarter of 2023, Journey was busy continuing with the integration of its acquisition (the \"Acquisition\") from Enerplus Corporation. This transaction was the primary contributor to the increase in sales volumes from 8,492 boe/d in the first quarter of 2022 to 12,920 boe/d in the first quarter of 2023. The acquisition had a positive impact on the liquids (crude oil and NGL's) sales mix as it increased from 47% in the first quarter of 2022 to 55% in the current quarter. This change will benefit Journey's netback going forward due to the significant shift towards the more valuable liquids weighting. Current production capability from the combined asset base is approximately 13,000 boe/d. Journey's productive capability continues to be affected by minor unplanned outages that are expected to be resolved by early summer. However, Journey is still projecting to achieve its full year guidance, even with a capital program that is weighted to the back half of the year.</p><p>Along with the continued integration of the Acquisition, Journey's activity levels in the first quarter of 2023 also included advancing the power business, and preparing for an active second half of the year. Journey's capital program has shifted more towards oil-weighted opportunities by replacing natural gas weighted drilling in Westerose with oil weighted drilling in Matziwin. This is expected to result in lower aggregate boe volumes in favour of higher netback oil volumes. Journey's 2023 drilling program now features 9 gross (7.6 net wells) including 4 wells in Medicine Hat; 3 wells in Cherhill; and 2 wells in Matziwin. It is important to note that $20 million of Journey's $63 million capital program is directed toward sales volume growth. In addition, Journey plans to expand its polymer flood in Medicine Hat and its waterflood in Matziwin, which will result in a less immediate, but longer lasting positive impact on the sales volumes at these locations. Journey has allocated $8 million of its 2023 capital budget to polymer costs, injector conversions, and facilities. Journey has also allocated $5.4 million of capital toward end-of-life costs and an additional $8 million in minor acquisition costs; land acquisitions; seismic data; and cost carry overs from projects started in 2022.</p><p>Even though Journey shifted its capital program towards oil weighted drilling, Journey continues to advance its repeatable plays in 2023. The Company is in final negotiations to enter into a farm-in agreement with a freehold mineral owner in the Gilby area of Alberta. This farm-in, combined with Journey's existing acreage will give the company access to approximately fifty contiguous, gross sections for Duvernay development drilling. These mineral rights are adjacent to Journey's Gilby gas processing facility. These rights are already overlain by liquid-rich, Glauconite production and contain two Duvernay test wells drilled as part of Journey's previous joint venture with Kiwetinohk. The primary term of the option agreement is for four years with a further option to extend the term to seven years. Journey currently plans to drill a minimum of two Duvernay wells on this block during the four year primary term.</p><p>EXPANDING JOURNEY'S POWER BUSINESS</p><p>For 2023, Journey has continued to prioritize its emerging power generation business and has made significant strides in this regard. Journey allocated $21 million in capital to its power generation business for 2023. The majority of this capital is associated with its Gilby power plant construction and the remainder to the Mazeppa power plant purchase. Although a portion of the Gilby capital may carry over into the first quarter of 2024, this is expected to be offset by an increased capital allocation devoted to re-energizing the purchased Mazeppa power plant. Therefore there is a potential upward bias to Journey's capital allocation to its power business in 2023.</p><p>Journey has demonstrated, through the operation of its existing Countess power plant, that it is far more profitable to convert its natural gas into electricity, than to merely sell the natural gas at spot prices. The currently operating, 4 MW Countess facility, which was originally commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2020, is already close to paying out the original investment. Based on Journey's realized power prices in 2022, the average, effective, net realized price for natural gas used to generate power for the year was approximately $10.54/mcf. For the first three months of 2023 the average, effective, net realized price was $8.60. This price takes into account the cost of the natural gas and the incremental costs of operating the power plant. As a comparison, the average AECO benchmark price for 2022 was approximately $5.43/mcf and $3.23/mcf for the first three months of 2023. Average power prices have increased over 250% since this facility came on stream. Journey is planning to increase its power sales to the Alberta electricity grid by over 500% over the next year. The nature of Journey's asset base is such that it is a large power consumer, and power represents 25% of overall corporate operating costs.</p><p>Journey previously announced that it had entered into an agreement to purchase a 16.5 MW power generation facility through an open auction process that started in November 2022. This facility was originally commissioned by another operator in 2015, and ran for less than one year before being shut-in. The Mazeppa facility is located near the community of High River Alberta and consists of five, 3.3 MW Jenbacher generators and includes switch gear, coolers, and an export transformer. The generators, ancillary equipment, and buildings are in excellent condition as they previously had minimal run time. Journey estimates that the replacement value of this facility is in excess of five times the purchase price.</p><p>The Mazeppa power facility acquisition closed in April 2023 and its cost has been included in the capital guidance for 2023. Since agreeing to purchase this facility, Journey has been actively pursuing the option of re-energizing this facility in its existing location. This option was further advanced in early May when Journey entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the land the power project is currently occupying. The land purchase is forecast to close in mid-May. As each of these milestones are achieved, Journey is more certain that there is a viable path for re-energizing this facility in place at Mazeppa by early 2024. Journey intends to provide further guidance on the time-line to an on-stream date in August. Full costs for re-energizing this facility have not been included in the 2023 capital guidance, but are not forecast to materially affect the 2023 capital program.</p><p>Journey has received preliminary approval to construct a 15.5 MW generation facility at its Gilby gas plant and has procured 17 MW of generating capacity in support of this project. The Company has continued to advance the design and approval of this project. The primary construction phase of this facility is scheduled to begin after breakup and this power project is currently anticipated to commence operations in the first quarter of 2024.</p><p>When the Gilby and Mazeppa power projects are on-stream, Journey will be in a position to more than offset its corporate power usage with power sales to the Alberta power grid. This will help diversify the corporate revenue stream and improves the sustainability of the Company even when there is a volatile commodity pricing environment. The record power prices of $311/MW realized in December of 2022, along with the expanding valuations demonstrated by recent market transactions continues to re-inforce the validity of this longer term strategy.</p><p>FINANCIAL</p><p>The first quarter of 2023 was the first full quarter operating the significant acquisition that closed on October 31, 2022. The 72% liquids (crude oil and NGL's) weighting from the Acquisition helped increase Journey's overall liquids weighting from 47% in the first quarter of 2022 to 55% in the first quarter of 2023. The Acquisition was well-timed as commodity prices started to soften in early 2023 and the increased emphasis on the higher netback liquids volumes contributed significantly to Journey's first quarter results. Average commodity prices decreased by 17% from the first quarter of 2022 to the current quarter with oil down by 25%, natural gas down by 35% and NGL's down by 19%. Journey still posted solid results with Adjusted Funds Flow for the first quarter of 2023 of $18.0 million. Crude oil sales volumes for the first quarter of 2023 represented 44% of total boe volumes but contributed 70% of total petroleum and natural gas revenues. Natural gas sales volumes contributed 45% of total boe sales volumes in 2023 while contributing 20% of total sales revenues.</p><p>As previously discussed, first quarter volumes and revenues were impacted by unplanned outages that are forecast to be resolved in the near term and full year guidance is still confirmed. First quarter revenues were also impacted by an unplanned maintenance outage at one of the power generation units at the Countess power plant. This resulted in an uncharacteristically low utilization rate of 64% for the quarter. This issue was resolved and utilization has returned to normal levels in March.</p><p>All of the field operating costs (royalties, operating and transportation expenses) experienced increases during the first quarter of 2023. Royalty expense was higher by 49% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. This was expected with the higher weighting to crude oil and the higher aggregate volumes sold. On a per boe basis royalty expense was $10.38/boe in 2023 as compared to $10.63 in the first quarter of 2022. Field operating expenses increased in 2023 as the acquisitions from 2022, workovers, reactivations, plant turnarounds and general inflationary pressures contributed to the total increase. In addition, $2.4 million of workover and turnaround costs were incurred in the first quarter of 2023 and accounted for approximately $2.05/boe of the total operating expenses on a per boe basis. As a result of these cost pressures, Journey averaged $19.78/boe for operating expenses in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to $17.40/boe in the same quarter of 2022.</p><p>Journey's general and administrative (\"G&amp;A\") costs were lower in 2023 as compared to the same quarter in 2022 as field-related cost recoveries mitigated additional staff costs related to the acquisitions in 2022. G&amp;A was $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2022. On a per boe basis, Journey's general and administrative costs were $1.57/boe for the first quarter of 2023 and $3.15/boe for the first quarter of 2022.</p><p>Finance expenses related to borrowings, or interest costs, increased by 66% to $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2023 from $1.6 million in the same quarter of 2022. Average, interest-bearing debt increased by 60% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter of 2022 mainly due to the vendor-take-back financing associated with the Acquisition.</p><p>Journey realized net income of $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $13.8 million in the same quarter of 2022. Net income per basic and diluted share was $0.11 and $0.10 respectively for the first quarter. Adjusted Funds Flow in the first quarter was 12% lower in 2023, wherein the Company generated $18.0 million, or $0.31 and $0.28 per basic and diluted share respectively as compared to $20.4 million, or $0.42 basic and $ 0.36 per diluted per share respectively in the same quarter of 2022. Cash flow from operations was $11.5 million in the first quarter of 2023 ($0.20 per basic share and $0.18 per diluted share) as compared to $21.8 million in the first quarter of 2022 ($0.45 and $0.39 per basic and diluted share respectively).</p><p>In March, Journey closed a bought deal flow-through share financing. The full 15% over-allotment was exercised bringing the total equity issuance to 3,040,031 flow-through common shares at a price of $6.62 per share for total gross proceeds of $20.1 million. The strong market pricing of the deal and the solid tax pool position of Journey made this transaction possible. The proceeds of the financing help fund Journey's drilling program which is currently expected to be begin in the summer.</p><p>Journey continued to be prudent with its capital spending during the first quarter as it underspent its Adjusted Funds Flows to allow for the maximum flexibility in its cash position while integrating the Acquisition. Total capital expenditures in the first quarter were $9.2 million including $2.4 million spent on abandonment and reclamation work. Journey exited the first quarter of 2023 with net debt of $71.1 million as compared to $38.5 million at March 31, 2022 and $98.8 million at the end of 2022. The higher net debt was mainly attributable to vendor-take-back debt, which assisted Journey in completing the Acquisition in October. The initial amount of this debt was $45 million and at March 31, 2023 the balance outstanding is $37 million. During the quarter Journey also fulfilled its obligation to repay AIMCo a balloon payment of $23.8 million leaving approximately $43.8 million of principal term debt owing to them. During January Journey also repaid the remaining $5 million of contingent bank debt owing from 2020. Even with the lower Adjusted Funds Flow from declining commodity prices in the quarter and the extra debt taken on to close the Acquisition, Journey's net debt to annualized Adjusted Funds Flow is a very respectable 1.0 times.</p><p>OUTLOOK &amp;GUIDANCE</p><p>Commensurate with the closing of its flow through share issuance on March 23, 2023, Journey has updated its 2023 guidance. The new guidance reflects minor sales volume adjustments to its base production, reductions in forecasted commodity prices and additions in the second half from a relatively small oil weighted development program. Journey remains poised to significantly ramp up capital expenditures in the second half of 2023 should commodity prices increase.</p><p>The early start of the forest fire season in Alberta is affecting many producers, including Journey. Journey's producing areas of Carrot Creek, Berrymoor. Ante Creek. Niton, Pine Creek, Kaybob, and Stolberg have all been affected to varying degrees. Field production has been directly impacted by evacuations and indirectly impacted by damage to the power grid and third party facility outages. Current production is impacted by approximately 1,200-1,300 boe/d (50% liquids), but has been as high as 2,000 boe/d. As always, Journey's first priority is the safety of both the nearby residents and its personnel. Journey personnel have worked with emergency services in its producing areas and will take all prudent and proactive measures to accomplish this objective. With recent rain and the diligent efforts of emergency services, the impact on Journey's production is gradually being resolved. However, it is difficult to quantify the length of time or the full extent of these outages and their impact on Journey's second quarter production.</p><p>This guidance incorporates many material underlying assumptions including but not limited to: //st * Forecasted commodity prices by month; * Assumptions of VTB principal payments since they are based upon realized commodity prices; * Forecasted operating costs, including forecasted prices for power; * Forecasted costs for the capital program; and * Forecasted results and phasing of production additions from the capital program;</p><p>2023 Guidance Annual average daily sales volumes 12,500-13,000 boe/d (54% crude oil &amp;NGL's 1 ) Adjusted Funds Flow $75-78 million Adjusted Funds Flow per weighted average share $1.24 - $1.29 Capital spending (E&amp;D, A&amp;D, ARO and Power) $63 million 2023 ending Net Debt $65-68 million Commodity prices 2 :</p><p>$75.00 WTI (USD $/bbl)</p><p>$3.00 MSW oil differentials (USD $/bbl)</p><p>$15.00 WCS oil differentials (USD $/bbl)</p><p>$3.25 AECO natural gas (CAD $/mcf)</p><p>$0.74 CAD/USD foreign exchange Notes: 1.

Coal-bed methane natural gas: 6%</p><p>e. Conventional natural gas: 40% 2. Commodity prices represent 2023 forecast averages.</p><p>Journey's goals for improving corporate sustainability in 2023 include: //st * Reducing leverage created by the transformational acquisition in 2022; * Adding inventory in repeatable plays; * Advancing the power generation business; * Managing its ARO; and * Continuing to search for creative ways to expand the Company's business.</p><p>Journey's low corporate decline, high working interest project inventory, operated infrastructure, and favourable expiry profile allow the Company to weather periods of lower than forecast commodity prices by proactively deferring portions of the capital program on a temporary basis. Journey is focused on adjusting its capital program to meet its near term obligations without sacrificing the longer term priorities of sustainability and enhancing shareholder value.</p><p>Journey continues to embark on a careful and prudent expansion of its business plan. Journey has achieved or exceeded all of its internal targets and created significant value for all stakeholders since the bottom of the market in 2020. This expansion has been buoyed by commodity price tailwinds and would not be possible without the talented team at Journey, both in the office and the field. Journey also recognizes the steady guidance supplied by its Board of Directors and the unyielding support of AIMCo, the Company's term debt provider and largest shareholder. Together, with the support of this combined team, your Company is extremely well positioned to continue its journey of value creation and maintain its growth trajectory for years to come. The Company looks forward to updating you on Journey's progress as it continues on this exciting development path.</p><p>Annual General Meeting</p><p>Journey's annual general meeting (\"AGM\" or the \"Meeting\") is scheduled for 3:00 pm (Calgary time) on May 24, 2023. Journey is offering shareholders an opportunity to listen to the business to be conducted at the Meeting by teleconference. Shareholders not attending in person must vote on the matters not less than forty-eight (48) hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays in the Province of Alberta) before the time of the Meeting. Further instructions on how to listen to the Meeting and how to vote in advance of the Meeting can be found in Journey's management information circular that is posted on the Company's website and on SEDAR. Journey expects to only have a minimum number of in-person attendees present to conduct the formal business of the Meeting and does not intend to provide a corporate presentation after the Meeting.</p><p>About the Company</p><p>Journey is a Canadian exploration and production company focused on conventional, oil-weighted operations in western Canada. Journey's strategy is to grow its production base by drilling on its existing core lands, implementing water flood projects, and executing on accretive acquisitions. Journey seeks to optimize its legacy oil pools on existing lands through the application of best practices in horizontal drilling and, where feasible, with water floods. In addition, Journey is seeking to grow its power generation business. Journey currently produces approximately 4 MW of electricity and with the recently announced facility acquisitions is anticipating to expand its productive capacity to approximately 36 MW within the next year.</p><p>ADVISORIES</p><p>This press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively \"forward looking information\") within the meaning of applicable securities laws relating to the Company's plans and other aspects of the anticipated future operations, management focus, strategies, financial, operating and production results, industry conditions, commodity prices and business opportunities.

These terms do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other companies. //st (1) \"Adjusted Funds Flow\" is calculated by taking \"cash flow provided by operating activities\" from the financial statements and adding or deducting: changes in non-cash working capital; non-recurring \"other\" income; transaction costs; and decommissioning costs. Adjusted Funds Flow per share is calculated as Adjusted Funds Flow divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding in the period. Because Adjusted Funds Flow and Adjusted Funds Flow per share are not impacted by fluctuations in non-cash working capital balances, Management believes these measures are more indicative of performance than the GAAP measured \"cash flow generated from operating activities\". In addition, Journey excludes transaction costs from the definition of Adjusted Funds Flow, as these expenses are generally in respect of capital acquisition transactions. The Company considers Adjusted Funds Flow a key performance measure as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate funds necessary to repay debt and to fund future growth through capital investment. Journey's determination of Adjusted Funds Flow may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. Journey also presents \"Adjusted Funds Flow per basic share\" where per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of net income (loss) per share, which per share amount is calculated under IFRS and is more fully described in the notes to the audited, year-end consolidated financial statements.</p><p>March 31, March 31,</p><p>2023 2022 Cash flow provided by operating activities 11,461 21,811 Add (deduct): Changes in non-cash working capital 4,280 (2,320) Transaction costs 2 8 Decommissioning costs incurred 2,216 902 Adjusted Funds Flow 17,959 20,401 Adjusted Funds Flow per basic (diluted) weighted average share $0.31 ($0.28) $0.42 ($0.36) (2) \" Netback(s) \". The Company uses netbacks to help evaluate its performance, leverage, and liquidity; comparisons with peers; as well as to assess potential acquisitions. Management considers netbacks as a key performance measure as it demonstrates the Company's profitability relative to current commodity prices. Management also uses them in operational and capital allocation decisions. Journey uses netbacks to assess its own performance and performance in relation to its peers. These netbacks are operating, Funds Flow and net income (loss). \" Operating netback \" is calculated as the average sales price of the commodities sold (excluding financial hedging gains and losses), less royalties, transportation costs and operating expenses. There is no GAAP measure that is reasonably comparable to netbacks. (3) \" Net debt \" is calculated by taking current assets and then subtracting accounts payable and accrued liabilities; the principal amount of term debt; and the carrying value of the other liability. Net debt is used to assess the capital efficiency, liquidity and general financial strength of the Company. In addition, it is used as a comparison tool to assess financial strength in relation to Journey's peers. NET DEBT RECONCILIATION</p><p>March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 ($000's) Principal amount of term debt 43,763 67,580 Principal amount of vendor-take-back debt 37,000 - Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 44,065 26,885 Principal amount of contingent bank debt 5,000 5,000 Other loans 419 410 Deduct: Cash in bank (19,440) (35,368) Accounts receivable (31,483) (21,087) Prepaid expenses (3,253) (1,739) Net debt 71,071 38,481 (4) Journey uses \" Capital Expenditures (excluding A&amp;D)\" and \"Capital Expenditures (including A&amp;D) \" to measure its capital investment level compared to the Company's annual budgeted capital expenditures for its organic capital program, excluding acquisitions or dispositions. The directly comparable GAAP measure to capital expenditures is cash used in investing activities. Journey then adjusts its capital expenditures for A&amp;D activity to give a more complete analysis for its capital spending used for FD&amp;A purposes. The capital spending for A&amp;D proposes has been adjusted to reflect the non-cash component of the consideration paid (i.e. shares issued). The following table details the composition of capital expenditures and its reconciliation to cash flow used in investing activities:</p><p>3 Months ended</p><p>2023 2022 Land and lease rentals 227 445 Geological &amp;geophysical 225 - Drilling and completions 2,156 9,148 Well equipment and facilities 3,716 2,520 Power generation assets 1,529 - Total capital expenditures 7,854 12,113 PP&amp;E acquisitions - 73 PP&amp;E dispositions (1,036) (24) Net capital expenditures 6,818 12,162 Other: Decommissioning expenditures 1 2,383 1,016 Total capital expenditures 9,201 13,178</p><p>Measurements</p><p>All dollar figures included herein are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted.</p><p>Where amounts are expressed in a barrel of oil equivalent (\"boe\"), or barrel of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\"), natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent at nine (6) thousand cubic feet (\"Mcf\") to one (1) barrel. Use of the term boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation. The boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 barrel (\"Bbl\") of oil or natural gas liquids is based on an energy equivalency conversion methodology primarily applicable at the burner tip, and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. This conversion conforms to the Canadian Securities Regulators' National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities.</p><p>Abbreviations</p><p>The following abbreviations are used throughout these MD&amp;A and have the ascribed meanings: //st A&amp;D acquisition and divestiture of petroleum and natural gas assets bbl barrel bbls barrels boe barrels of oil equivalent (see conversion statement below) boe/d barrels of oil equivalent per day E&amp;D exploration and development activities as defined in the COGE Handbook gj gigajoules GAAP Generally Accepted Accounting Principles IFRS International Financial Reporting Standards Mbbls thousand barrels MMBtu million British thermal units Mboe thousand boe Mcf thousand cubic feet Mmcf million cubic feet Mmcf/d million cubic feet per day MSW Mixed sweet Alberta benchmark oil price NGL's natural gas liquids (ethane, propane, butane and condensate) WCS Western Canada Select benchmark oil price WTI West Texas Intermediate benchmark Oil price</p><p>All volumes in this press release refer to the sales volumes of crude oil, natural gas and associated by-products measured at the point of sale to third-party purchasers.

The blaze is just one of 81 wildfires burning in Greece over the last day. </p><p><br/><br/>Civil Protection chief Nikos Hardalias said the fire north of Athens was 'very dangerous,' and had been made even worse by strong winds and tinder-dry conditions due to the heat that reached 45 Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) in the area, reports the Associated Press.[1] <br/><br/>As night fell, firefighters battled the blaze on the lower slopes of Mount Parnitha, aided by nine helicopters, seven aircraft, and 305 police in a densely vegetated area in the suburbs of Varympopi and Adames. The intensity of the flames scorched homes and cars and forced residents to flee. <br/><br/> Wildfire near Athens, Greece[2] <br/><br/> Euro News[3] is reporting that the greater Athens regional governor George Patoulis told state-run ERT television: 'It is a large fire and it will take a lot of work to get this under control. The foliage is very dense in these areas and it is very dried out due to the heatwave, so the conditions are difficult.' <br/><br/>The wildfire also forced the partial closure of Greece's main north-south highway. Residents left their homes in cars and on motorcycles, often clutching pets, heading toward the capital amid a blanket of smoke. <br/><br/>Fire crews went house-to-house, making sure everyone knew to evacuate, and no one is missing and no deaths have been reported, although Greek media said six people required treatment for light breathing complaints. <br/><br/> Wildfire near Athens, Greece[4] <br/><br/> According to Reuters,[5] in Athens, the power grid operator IPTO said the fire had damaged parts of the grid, posing a major risk to the electricity supply in parts of the metropolitan region. <br/><br/>'Dozens of homes are being burnt,' Michalis Vrettos, deputy mayor of the Acharnes region, told Open TV as thick plumes of smoke rose over the houses behind him.

They have set a target, for 17 northern provinces, to convert 100 tonnes of dried leaves per day into solid fuel.</p><p>Natural Resources and Environment Minister Varawut Silpa-archa says that project could help reduce hotspots during the dry season by as much as 20%. Furthermore it ease the problem of dust particles, especially PM2.5, in the atmosphere.</p><p>Instead of burning dried leaves in the forests, he said that utilizing the waste would be more sensible. The natural waste could provide a new source of income for rural people.</p><p>The minister said that the nine northern provinces of Chiang Rai; Chiang Mai; Lamphun; Lampang; Phrae; Nan; Mae Hong Son; Phayao and Phitsanuloke, where most hotspots are recorded each year, have been chosen to trial the project, with the participation of rural residents.</p><p>He also said that the ministry has approached companies,involved in the conversion of natural waste into fuel, to purchase at least 100 tonnes of dried leaves from each of the nine provinces on a daily basis.</p><p>He said the ministry is in the process of expanding a people's network to fight forest fires and protect the forests in their respective areas, after the ministry transferred the responsibility for forest fire management to local administrations.</p><p>Renewable power generation</p><p>Meanwhile, state and private sectors are stepping up efforts to give Thailand a new clean look, with economic activities fuelled by clean energy. New power plants and cars will be powered by energy that is more friendly to the environment.</p><p>The move is not only because oil and gas reserves are shrinking, but the government also wants its investments in renewable energy projects to drive the economy during the recovery, lasting well into next year.</p><p>Authorities set a target to have 30% of total energy consumption in 2036 derived from renewable resources, almost double its current share.</p><p>According to the National Alternative Energy Development Plan, renewable power generation capacity in the country must reach 16,788 megawatts by 2036. Thailand can generate 53% of this target at present.</p><p>Renewable resources range from biomass and biogas to sun, wind and water.</p><p>Biomass comes from plants and agricultural refuse, while biogas is produced by manure and wastewater from agro-processing industries and solid waste.</p><p>Electricity generated from these sources contributed 10.1% of national electricity consumption in September, compared with only 2.1% in 2010, according to the Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency Department.</p><p>The increase is satisfactory, but still insufficient if Thailand is to attain its goal in the strategic plan, said the department.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIRAI-CHIANGRAITIMES281120200000501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIRAI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61DP-W1T1-F00C-638T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472526</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"463\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 CTN News - Chiangrai Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Chiang Rai Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 28, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000CY8I</classCode><className>CAPSTONE INFRASTRUCTURE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0006IY0</classCode><className>ALTERNATIVE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS221115 WIND ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS221114 SOLAR ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4931 ELECTRIC &amp;

They have set a target, for 17 northern provinces, to convert 100 tonnes of dried leaves per day into solid fuel.</p><p>Natural Resources and Environment Minister Varawut Silpa-archa says that project could help reduce hotspots during the dry season by as much as 20%. Furthermore it ease the problem of dust particles, especially PM2.5, in the atmosphere.</p><p>Instead of burning dried leaves in the forests, he said that utilizing the waste would be more sensible. The natural waste could provide a new source of income for rural people.</p><p>The minister said that the nine northern provinces of Chiang Rai; Chiang Mai; Lamphun; Lampang; Phrae; Nan; Mae Hong Son; Phayao and Phitsanuloke, where most hotspots are recorded each year, have been chosen to trial the project, with the participation of rural residents.</p><p>He also said that the ministry has approached companies,involved in the conversion of natural waste into fuel, to purchase at least 100 tonnes of dried leaves from each of the nine provinces on a daily basis.</p><p>He said the ministry is in the process of expanding a people\u2019s network to fight forest fires and protect the forests in their respective areas, after the ministry transferred the responsibility for forest fire management to local administrations.</p><p>Renewable power generation</p><p>Meanwhile, state and private sectors are stepping up efforts to give Thailand a new clean look, with economic activities fuelled by clean energy. New power plants and cars will be powered by energy that is more friendly to the environment.</p><p>The move is not only because oil and gas reserves are shrinking, but the government also wants its investments in renewable energy projects to drive the economy during the recovery, lasting well into next year.</p><p>Authorities set a target to have 30% of total energy consumption in 2036 derived from renewable resources, almost double its current share.</p><p>According to the National Alternative Energy Development Plan, renewable power generation capacity in the country must reach 16,788 megawatts by 2036. Thailand can generate 53% of this target at present.</p><p>Renewable resources range from biomass and biogas to sun, wind and water.</p><p>Biomass comes from plants and agricultural refuse, while biogas is produced by manure and wastewater from agro-processing industries and solid waste.</p><p>Electricity generated from these sources contributed 10.1% of national electricity consumption in September, compared with only 2.1% in 2010, according to the Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency Department.</p><p>The increase is satisfactory, but still insufficient if Thailand is to attain its goal in the strategic plan, said the department.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIRAI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIRAI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61D8-3B61-JCH9-G0YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472526</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"463\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 CTN News - Chiangrai Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Chiang Rai Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 28, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000CY8I</classCode><className>CAPSTONE INFRASTRUCTURE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0006IY0</classCode><className>ALTERNATIVE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS221115 WIND ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS221114 SOLAR ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4931 ELECTRIC &amp;

In the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District, the eligibility criteria remains at 50 years of age and older. </p><p>While those who are included in the eligible age groupings can book appointments either online or over the phone health care workers and those identified as extremely vulnerable must use the telephone call in line as they will need to verify their eligibility. The remaining phase-one health care workers includes home-care workers, operating room staff, vaccination teams, dialysis and radiology technicians among other critical care staff.  </p><p>Meanwhile Saskatchewan doctors want new strategies to combat the COVID-19 variants. Dr. Anne Huang, a former deputy medical health officer with the Saskatchewan Health Authority equated the outbreaks in Regina and now Moose Jaw, to wildfires. Dr. Huang believes a \u201cring vaccination\u201d strategy to contain it. \"It\u2019s the same idea of starving the oxygen of a rapidly advancing forest fire with a fire break by cutting clearance in the forest,\" Dr. Huang said. Dr. Shahab and Premier Moe however are staying with the status quo for the city of Moose Jaw. People in Moose Jaw, Shahab said, need to look at what is happening in Regina and in their own city and choose to emulate the safety measures there. Mayor Fraser Tolmie is asking Moose Jaw residents to be extra vigilant in light of increasing COVID-19 cases in the city and the presence of variants of concern. The mayor said the city is having \"open conversations\" with public health officials and the provincial government regarding additional restrictions. The Premier said today that he continues to have faith in the people of Moose Jaw to do what they need to do to protect themselves and those around them and for that reason he will not upgrade the restrictions in that city to match those in Regina. Last week the Prairie South School Division decided to have all preK-12 schools in Moose Jaw and Caronport Elementary move to online learning as a precautionary measure until April 12. Tony Baldwin, the Director of Education, said in a letter to parents that although there have been \u201cno confirmed school level transmission\u201d there have been \u201cmore positive cases in schools over the past two days than we had for the 38 days prior to that.\u201d </p><p>At the Tuesday March 30th press conference however, Premier Moe stated that he did not want to increase restrictions in any areas. He did extend the public health orders that were set to end on April 5th, to April 12th. Over the next two weeks, the Premier confirmed that the province will receive approximately 184,000 doses of vaccine, more than has been received to date. Over three quarters of Saskatchewan residents age 80 and over have received both doses of a vaccine and over one half of those 70 and over have received theirs. As more and more vaccines arrive, the SHA and the government will open appointment bookings for more and more age groups. As the new ad campaign the government launched promotes, Premier Moe encouraged everyone to \u201cStick it to COVID\u201d.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-9f800578d0e44f0db7fd13c2c33028c0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62B9-W9H1-JBVR-338R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"554\"/><timeReceived>09:28 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 30, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That\u2019s a nearly tenfold increase over current electric vehicle sales. The proposed regulation was announced by the Environmental Protection Agency. The regulation would set tailpipe emissions limits for the 2027 through 2032 model years that call for far more new EVs than the auto industry agreed to sell less than two years ago.

The thrice-married former president who once supported abortion rights and boasted of his sexual prowess retains a strong standing among many of Iowa\u2019s evangelical leaders. As the 2024 campaign begins, they say they are grateful for Trump\u2019s judicial appointments that resulted in reversing a constitutional right to abortion. They shrug off the 34-count felony indictment stemming from hush money payments made to a porn actress and other controversy. Some evangelical leaders say Trump\u2019s action on policy they hold dear may erase questions about his moral character. By Thomas Beaumont.

Patients are concerned about whether they can still get the care they need. Abortion providers say they are trying to assure patients that nothing has changed, at least for the moment. And even if the ruling by a U.S. District Court judge in Texas stands, doctors are devising backup plans. These include replacing the usual two-drug medication abortion regimen with a slightly less effective method using only the other drug, misoprostol. By Laura Ungar and Heather Hollingsworth.

Yet prices are still rising fast enough to keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates at least once more, beginning in May. The government said that consumer prices rose just 0.1% from February to March, down from 0.4% from January to February and the smallest increase since December. By Christopher Rugaber.

The legislation was put on fast track as the Russian military is preparing for an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive.

Fortunately, they recovered their gear downstream and were able to pry open the logs to free Paddy. At Rainbow Lake (now called Spectrum), they quickly built rafts to fish and explore the island and the shoreline.</p><p>From their base at Peters Lake where they intended to spend two nights, they toured the surrounding area on foot as the horses grazed happily at the lake. Burnett was so impressed with the area, he mused about its potential as a future golf course and tourist resort. On their way to Margie Lake on the first day, they were fortunate to sight caribou, three young yearlings and an old bull.</p><p>Amazed at the beauty of the alpine, Burnett also found it a \u201cbotanist paradise\u201d as some plants were in seed in the valley but were still flowering at higher elevations. He describes \u201ca tiny glade among the balsam\u201d where \u201cevery square foot of space of which was carpeted with a mixture of Indian paintbrush and silvery-green plumes of the anemones\u201d and \u201cthe blending of colours and the lighting were perfect.\u201d</p><p>When they attempted to hike up Mt. Fraser on day two, which Bill had named after himself in 1928, they were blocked by a rockslide with a glacier behind it, \u201cwhich only wellequipped mountaineers would tackle.\u201d They had fun trying out some boot-skiing and when it began to rain, they headed back to camp for another night. The following day they hiked up to scenic Blue Lake and found floating islands of snow in the intense blue water.

Those Canadian communities are (from West to East): //st * Princeton, British Columbia ( Princeton and District Arena) * Douro -Dummer, Ontario (Douro Community Centre and Arena) * Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (Arna Marcel-Larocque) * Sydney, Nova Scotia (Canada Games Complex)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kraft Hockeyville has established a legacy of supporting Canadian communities by making an impact on community arenas and the overall culture of the game. The program is dedicated to building stronger, more connected, and inclusive communities across the country through the love of the game of hockey. In fact, according to the Kraft Hockeyville Community Hockey Survey, an overwhelming majority of Canadians agree that community hockey is a great way to bring communities together.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The program has managed to bring passionate hockey communities together again, including the Top 4 finalists. The Top 4 community finalists were selected based on their nomination stories and their ability to score additional rally points by engaging their community.</p><p>\"The passion and enthusiasm for hockey in Canadian communities was abundantly clear through the nominations we received from across the country,\" said Adam Butler, President of Canada and North America Coffee, Kraft Heinz. \"With hockey being the heart and soul of so many communities, it's never easy to select our finalists, but we couldn't be more excited to announce this year's Top 4 communities. Their stories really highlight the power hockey has in shaping communities.\"</p><p>About the Finalist Communities //st * Princeton, British Columbia ( Princeton and District Arena)</p><p>Princeton perseveres. After a forest fire threatened their community two years ago, they were hit by widespread floods that are still impacting residents today. \"How can I help?\" is the mentality of this community, and together, they have been able to overcome any obstacle in their way. The next obstacle is upgrading the Princeton and District Arena, which is the hub of the community. It's not just a place for hockey, but a place to create memories like weddings, dances, fundraisers, and more. With its roof in disrepair, water has been pouring onto the ice during games. Winning Kraft Hockeyville would allow the community to keep a roof over their skaters' heads, which means so much to them after all they've been through as a community. //st * Douro -Dummer, Ontario (Douro Community Centre and Arena)</p><p>Douro Arena is a place where all members of Douro-Dummer feel welcome. Whether you've stepped on the ice for the first time, or have been at it for decades, members of the community care about your experience as much as they care about their own. Youth hockey is only part of why the arena is so important to the community. It's also a place for the community to come together to support fundraising for the local food banks and toy drives. The community continues to strive to help make hockey more accessible for everyone, and winning Kraft Hockeyville would allow them to make long-overdue upgrades to their lobby and dressing rooms, so all members of the community and visitors feel welcome. //st * Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (Arna Marcel-Larocque)</p><p>Celebrating its 50th anniversary, Arna Marcel-Larocque sits in the centre of a small town with an unparalleled excitement for hockey. In the Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu community, the passion for the game is only half of what matters. The arena is the community's hub, where youth make lifelong connections and parents reconnect with old friends. Parents have passed their love of hockey to future generations who now claim the arena as their second home. It's clear that the arena is a source of joy for all members of the community. Winning Kraft Hockeyville would allow the community to build 50 more years of meaningful memories by helping fund much-needed upgrades throughout the arena including its changerooms, washrooms, and ice plant. //st * Sydney, Nova Scotia (Canada Games Complex)</p><p>Cape Breton is a small island with a huge passion for hockey. Locals describe the island the way they describe their love for community hockey: fierce, resolute, and resilient. The Canada Games Complex in Sydney was built 35 years ago to host the 1987 Canada Winter Games but has since had to close its doors to hockey. Since then, the demand for rink access on the island has outweighed the supply, making it difficult to accommodate the sharp increase in participation in girls' hockey the community has seen over the last number of years. Winning Kraft Hockeyville would help the community purchase the new compressor it needs to reopen its arena's doors and empower the girls on the island itching for ice time.</p><p>The 2022 grand prize winner will have an opportunity to host an NHL preseason game on a date to be determined by Kraft Heinz Canada, the NHL and NHLPA, and receive $250,000 to be used towards arena upgrades, as well as the coveted title of Kraft Hockeyville 2022. This year's winner and each of the three runner-up communities will also receive $10,000 worth of new hockey equipment for their minor hockey programs, courtesy of the NHLPA Goals &amp;Dreams fund.</p><p>These finalists are now tasked with rallying their community and Canadians from across the country.</p><p>Canadians from coast-to-coast can help determine the winner of Kraft Hockeyville 2022 by voting for one of the Top 4 communities online at krafthockeyville.ca. Voting opens on May 6th at 9:00am ET and closes on May 7th at 5:00 p.m. ET. Votes can only be cast on the website during the voting phase and voting per person is unlimited. The winner will be announced live on Hockey Night in Canada the evening of May 7th following the conclusion of the vote.</p><p>For complete contest rules and programs details, and to learn more about the Top 4 finalists, including their stories, photos, and videos, please visit krafthockeyville.ca.

Heralds Bay Developments Ltd., is owned by Kevin Lowe, former Edmonton Oilers hockey player who now works on the business side of the hockey organization.</p><p>He has partnered with two friends, Bruno Muller and Hans Abild. Abild is Lowe\u2019s neighbour at the lake while Muller spends a lot of time on Vancouver Island.</p><p>Lowe told the Observer they all share a great love for the outdoors and a great respect for it.</p><p>Lowe said his family has lived in Sunnybrae</p><p>for part of each year since 1992 and two years ago built a retirement residence not too far from the land he\u2019s subdividing.</p><p>Project manager Dave Cunliffe, from Celista, described the work that\u2019s been or will be done.</p><p>The Columbia Shuswap Regional District\u2019s official community plan has been amended from industrial to residential there to accommodate the future housing. A public information meeting was held in September 2020 along with a public hearing in February 2021, followed by the CSRD board\u2019s approval.</p><p>As the land was a former industrial brownfield site, a contaminant review has been done.</p><p>In concert with the highways ministry, Sunnybrae Canoe Point Road will be</p><p>relocated to the north and improved to ministry standards, he said.</p><p>The housing will be on the lake side of the road and the community sewer system to the north.</p><p>Cunliffe noted that one of the most important issues has been Bastion Mountain. Extensive geotechnical work has been completed to ensure protection from a worst-case scenario: debris torrents that could result from a forest fire followed by a torrential rainfall.</p><p>Protection involves building deflection berms to direct potential debris torrent flows through large-diameter culverts.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re held to a very high standard by the approving authority,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bar is set very high in terms of public safety, and so it should be. With the</p><p>whole development team, everybody has the same approach. If we can\u2019t do it safely, we shouldn\u2019t do it at all.\u201d</p><p>He said extensive archeology work has also been carried out and one site survived the previous industrial use. The site found was a food preparation site, carbon-dated at 5,000 years old, where there were elk bones, fish bones and turtle carcasses.</p><p>He said the archaeological work was completed with assistance predominantly from the Little Shuswap Lake Band.</p><p>Cunliffe said provincially established protocols are being followed, which include informing and consulting with the bands.</p><p>\u201cWere doing our best to avoid it,\u201d he said of the site, adding there has been sys\u00ac</p><p>tematic data recovery which involves understanding the history of the site and how it was used.</p><p>Other work being done is riparian area restoration because so much wood waste was left. That work includes importing soils and restoring habitat where fish can flourish. Public access to the lake will be available at the west end of the site.</p><p>Cunliffe predicts that construction could start in 2022.</p><p>Lowe said he bought the land about five years ago, but he had looked at it over the years when he ran or boated past. He said some residents were afraid a large multi-family high rise might be constructed, but that was not the plan. \u201cWe wanted to do something that would fit in with the area.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SHMANE-news20210723HBU9964</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SHMANE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:636T-1K51-F0HF-8152-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Ronald Todd accepted the job of principal and teacher at the Topley Public School. He and his mother left Vancouver, B.C. in late August, traveling north by steamship to Prince Rupert. After spending a night in that fair city, they boarded the Canadian National Railway for Topley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a day and a night on the train, they arrived at their destination to find (as Todd wrote years later) \u201cpractically the entire populace, including almost all of the school children, awaiting us at the station.\u201d</p><p>In 1923, according to Todd, the community of Topley consisted of a railway station, a general store, the Holmes family residence, another log cabin occupied by Clint Johnson (the itinerant Methodist minister), the schoolhouse, and \u201ca few sheds and outhouses.\u201d A forest fire had recently swept through the area, leaving in its wake large patches of purple fireweed.</p><p>The Todds boarded with the Bartley McCrea family, who operated the store, while local residents set about constructing a new cabin for the newcomers. When complete, it \u201cconsisted of one small room and two smaller bedrooms \u2013 one layer of boards lined with tar paper. Furnishings included two beds, a few chairs, a cook stove and a tin heater, and a sink, but no running water. A well was close by.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen children in six grades (1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8) attended the Topley School in 1923. Todd placed a major emphasis on arithmetic, reading and literature, grammar, and spelling, with a lesser emphasis on geography, history, drawing, nature study, and music.</p><p>\u201cFor physical education, all pupils stood by their desks for a few minutes each day and performed simple arm exercises under my direction,\u201d he said.</p><p>Todd and his mother participated in community events, attending dances held in the school. Local residents often invited them to dinner. The newcomers graciously accepted most of these offers, but there were exceptions.</p><p>\u201cMr.and Mrs. [name omitted] asked us a number of times to spend the weekend at their farm,\u201d he recalled. \u201cFor various reasons, we gently but firmly refused. Audrey Horning, my predecessor as teacher, told us that she had captured bed bugs in a bottle while spending a weekend (there).\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Name Omitted made quite an impression on the young teacher. \u201c(She) always demonstrated great social aplomb \u2013 she was a member of the School Board \u2013 but her housekeeping methods left something to be desired. I remember that members of the family, two boys and two girls, always made much ado about the cakes their mother made \u2013 rather tasteless as I remember, and often containing items such as thimbles, buttons, nails, or toothpicks! The lucky person who found one or another of these in his or her piece of cake was supposedly destined to become, respectively, a dressmaker, tailor, carpenter, or lumberjack.\u201d</p><p>Todd lasted one year as Topley\u2019s teacher.</p><p>He and his mother returned to Vancouver at the end of June 1924. \u201cI had enjoyed the year in Topley, but had no wish to return there,\u201d he recalled years later. \u201cIt was too far from Vancouver to suit me, the community was too small, and there was absolutely no possibility of professional advancement unless I could have joined the grade school teaching staff in Smithers, the nearest town of any size.\u201d</p><p>Todd went on to teach in Albion, then attended the University of British Columbia. Later, he moved to Seattle and became a librarian in the University of Washington \u2013 a post he held for 41 years.</p><p>\u00a9 Michael Riis-Christianson and the Lakes</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BURNSL-news20210526PPMA0001883155</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BURNSL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62SB-27M1-JD2C-J3HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438230</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"589\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Those Canadian communities are (from West to East):</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Princeton, British Columbia (Princeton and District Arena)Douro-Dummer, Ontario (Douro Community Centre and Arena)Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (Ar\u00e9na Marcel-Larocque)Sydney, Nova Scotia (Canada Games Complex)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kraft Hockeyville has established a legacy of supporting Canadian communities by making an impact on community arenas and the overall culture of the game. The program is dedicated to building stronger, more connected, and inclusive communities across the country through the love of the game of hockey. In fact, according to the Kraft Hockeyville Community Hockey Survey, an overwhelming majority of Canadians agree that community hockey is a great way to bring communities together.</p><p>The program has managed to bring passionate hockey communities together again, including the Top 4 finalists. The Top 4 community finalists were selected based on their nomination stories and their ability to score additional rally points by engaging their community.</p><p>\"The passion and enthusiasm for hockey in Canadian communities was abundantly clear through the nominations we received from across the country,\" said Adam Butler, President of Canada and North America Coffee, Kraft Heinz. \"With hockey being the heart and soul of so many communities, it's never easy to select our finalists, but we couldn't be more excited to announce this year's Top 4 communities. Their stories really highlight the power hockey has in shaping communities.\"</p><p>About the Finalist Communities</p><p>Princeton, British Columbia (Princeton and District Arena)Douro-Dummer, Ontario (Douro Community Centre and Arena)Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (Ar\u00e9na Marcel-Larocque)Sydney, Nova Scotia (Canada Games Complex)</p><p>Princeton perseveres. After a forest fire threatened their community two years ago, they were hit by widespread floods that are still impacting residents today. \"How can I help?\" is the mentality of this community, and together, they have been able to overcome any obstacle in their way. The next obstacle is upgrading the Princeton and District Arena, which is the hub of the community. It's not just a place for hockey, but a place to create memories like weddings, dances, fundraisers, and more. With its roof in disrepair, water has been pouring onto the ice during games. Winning Kraft Hockeyville would allow the community to keep a roof over their skaters' heads, which means so much to them after all they've been through as a community. </p><p>Princeton, British Columbia (Princeton and District Arena)Douro-Dummer, Ontario (Douro Community Centre and Arena)Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (Ar\u00e9na Marcel-Larocque)Sydney, Nova Scotia (Canada Games Complex)</p><p>Douro Arena is a place where all members of Douro-Dummer feel welcome. Whether you've stepped on the ice for the first time, or have been at it for decades, members of the community care about your experience as much as they care about their own. Youth hockey is only part of why the arena is so important to the community. It's also a place for the community to come together to support fundraising for the local food banks and toy drives. The community continues to strive to help make hockey more accessible for everyone, and winning Kraft Hockeyville would allow them to make long-overdue upgrades to their lobby and dressing rooms, so all members of the community and visitors feel welcome.</p><p>Princeton, British Columbia (Princeton and District Arena)Douro-Dummer, Ontario (Douro Community Centre and Arena)Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (Ar\u00e9na Marcel-Larocque)Sydney, Nova Scotia (Canada Games Complex)</p><p>Celebrating its 50th anniversary, Ar\u00e9na Marcel-Larocque sits in the centre of a small town with an unparalleled excitement for hockey. In the Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu community, the passion for the game is only half of what matters. The arena is the community's hub, where youth make lifelong connections and parents reconnect with old friends. Parents have passed their love of hockey to future generations who now claim the arena as their second home. It's clear that the arena is a source of joy for all members of the community. Winning Kraft Hockeyville would allow the community to build 50 more years of meaningful memories by helping fund much-needed upgrades throughout the arena including its changerooms, washrooms, and ice plant.</p><p>Princeton, British Columbia (Princeton and District Arena)Douro-Dummer, Ontario (Douro Community Centre and Arena)Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (Ar\u00e9na Marcel-Larocque)Sydney, Nova Scotia (Canada Games Complex)</p><p>Cape Breton is a small island with a huge passion for hockey. Locals describe the island the way they describe their love for community hockey: fierce, resolute, and resilient. The Canada Games Complex in Sydney was built 35 years ago to host the 1987 Canada Winter Games but has since had to close its doors to hockey. Since then, the demand for rink access on the island has outweighed the supply, making it difficult to accommodate the sharp increase in participation in girls' hockey the community has seen over the last number of years. Winning Kraft Hockeyville would help the community purchase the new compressor it needs to reopen its arena's doors and empower the girls on the island itching for ice time.</p><p>The 2022 grand prize winner will have an opportunity to host an NHL\u00ae preseason game on a date to be determined by Kraft Heinz Canada, the NHL and NHLPA, and receive $250,000 to be used towards arena upgrades, as well as the coveted title of Kraft Hockeyville 2022. This year's winner and each of the three runner-up communities will also receive $10,000 worth of new hockey equipment for their minor hockey programs, courtesy of the NHLPA Goals &amp; Dreams fund.</p><p>These finalists are now tasked with rallying their community and Canadians from across the country.</p><p>Canadians from coast-to-coast can help determine the winner of Kraft Hockeyville 2022 by voting for one of the Top 4 communities online at krafthockeyville.ca. Voting opens on May 6th at 9:00am ET and closes on May 7th at 5:00 p.m. ET. Votes can only be cast on the website during the voting phase and voting per person is unlimited. The winner will be announced live on Hockey Night in Canada the evening of May 7th following the conclusion of the vote.</p><p>For complete contest rules and programs details, and to learn more about the Top 4 finalists, including their stories, photos, and videos, please visitkrafthockeyville.ca.

Fines range between $200 to $350. If the fire is not a safety hazard and emergency services are not required, members of the community should call the bylaw division to report a burning bylaw complaint, said Dustin Gronc, the manager of bylaw services.</p><p>The public can report issues online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gravenhurst.ca/reportit\">www.gravenhurst.ca/reportit</url>.</p><p>The Town of Gravenhurst recognizes that the winter has been particularly hard on trees, shrubs and plants around properties, and that there is likely a lot of deadfall that people wish to clean up.

In the 107 years of available records, only 1961 proved a hotter summer, said Environment and Climate Change meteorologist Kyle Fougere.</p><p>The mean temperature for the summer has been 16.8 C, a full two degrees warmer than the typical 14.8 C. The mean is reached by combining all of the daytime temperatures and averaging them and then averaging those numbers for the summer.</p><p>June came in as the second hottest June on record \u2014 again 1961 proved hotter. July was the sixth warmest on record and August was the 27th.</p><p>While it was a dry summer, it ranks only as the 41st driest, largely because of the rain that finally came in August. That month 98 mm of rain fell, compared with the 72 mm that is typical for the month.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness. It was about time we had a wet month. It was much, much needed obviously,\u201d said Fougere.</p><p>The heat and the smoke were probably the biggest weather conversation starters for many central Albertans this year. Heat warnings and special air quality statements almost became routine as the summer wore on.</p><p>At the end of June and into early July, Alberta baked. There were at least 212 daily temperature records set across the province \u2014 including at least one in Red Deer \u2014 from June 25 to July 2. The high of 34.8 C recorded in Red Deer on June 30 beat the previous record of 30.6 C set in 1944.</p><p>The heat wave was felt throughout the province. In August, Edmonton set a record with 17 days above 30 C, eclipsing the previous record of 14 days set in 1961.</p><p>Fougere said meteorologists and climatologists are busy compiling all of the statistics and will present an overview later this month.</p><p>\u201cThere are just thousands and thousands of data points we have to go through.\u201d</p><p>The cause of the lengthy blast of heat was an unusually strong ridge of high pressure over Western Canada, explained in early July.</p><p>\u201cYou basically had low-pressure systems on either side which created what we call a blocking pattern. That blocking pattern is what made it sit over the western parts of Canada for a week on end and the temperatures just really built.</p><p>\u201cIt was both the magnitude of the ridge and this blocking pattern that led to this extreme heat.\u201d</p><p>Amazingly, daytime temperature peaks could have been higher except for the blanket of smoke from wildfires far to the southwest of central Alberta.</p><p>\u201cIt was a hot summer, but, absolutely, it could have been hotter if not for the forest fire smoke,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of times it looked like we were going to have very high temperatures and we were knocking off several degrees from what we expected from the daytime highs because of the smoke.</p><p>\u201cThe sun just wasn\u2019t able to infiltrate that smoke and make it down to the surface.\u201d</p><p>So, if not for the smoke it would easily have been the hottest summer on record right? Not so fast, explains Fougere. While the smoke may have checked daytime highs, it also trapped warmth leading to balmier-than-usual evenings. Since the records are built on averages of highs and lows, 1961 may still have been the hottest all things considered.</p><p>\u201cNot only does (the smoke) block our incoming radiation, but it blocks our outgoing solar radiation, keeping our mornings warmer.\u201d</p><p>Another interesting aspect of the past summer was the lack of thunderstorms, despite conditions, which seemed to be perfect for creating the lightning lightworks and rain deluges or hail storms that are a common summer feature.</p><p>\u201cThere were absolutely days where the conditions were there for thunderstorm development to be fairly widespread. But the thunderstorms just didn\u2019t form, or only a few formed, because of the smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt prevented that heat and the lift from the surface we typically get from that daytime heating.\u201d</p><p>The ridge of high pressure, which created the heat wave, also acted to reduce the thunderstorm threat.</p><p>\u201cI know there were days when we were looking and all the ingredients were there for severe thunderstorms. And on those days, typically you would have seen widespread severe weather and we had almost nothing this year. There were several days like that.\u201d</p><p>The lack of thunderstorms and the rain they bring was a big reason it was such a dry summer.</p><p>ADVOCATE STAFF</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20210908RDA0002096028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63JM-ND91-JD2C-J32C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

The land sits between Herald Park and Paradise Point.</p><p>The development company, Heralds Bay Developments Ltd., is owned by Kevin Lowe, former Edmonton Oilers hockey player who now works on the business side of the hockey organization. He has partnered with two friends, Bruno Muller and Hans Abild. Abild is Lowe's neighbour at the lake while Muller spends a lot of time on Vancouver Island.</p><p>Lowe told the Observer they all share a great love for the outdoors and a great respect for it. Lowe said his family has lived in Sunnybrae for part of each year since 1992 and two years ago built a retirement residence not too far from the land he's subdividing.</p><p>Project manager Dave Cunliffe from Celista described the work that's been or will be done.</p><p>The Columbia Shuswap Regional District's official community plan has been amended from industrial to residential there to accommodate the future housing. A public information meeting was held in September 2020 along with a public hearing in February 2021, followed by the CSRD board's approval.</p><p>As the land was a former industrial brownfield site, a contaminant review has been done.</p><p>In concert with the highways ministry, Sunnybrae Canoe Point Road will be relocated to the north and improved to ministry standards, he said.</p><p>The housing will be on the lake side of the road and the community sewer system to the north.</p><p>Cunliffe noted that one of the most important issues has been Bastion Mountain. Extensive geotechnical work has been completed to ensure protection from a worst-case scenario: debris torrents that could result from a forest fire followed by a torrential rainfall. Protection involves building deflection berms to direct potential debris torrent flows through large-diameter culverts.</p><p>\"We're held to a very high standard by the approving authority,\" he said. \"The bar is set very high in terms of public safety, and so it should be. With the whole development team, everybody has the same approach. If we can't do it safely, we shouldn't do it at all.\"</p><p>Read more: Secw\u00e9pemc Elders guide stories, bless sites for Shuswap Landmarks project</p><p>Read more: VIDEO: Salmon Arm esidents enjoy Valentine's Day skate on frozen Shuswap Lake</p><p>Read more: Have you heard the legend of Shuswaggi, the Shuswap Lake monster?</p><p>He said extensive archeology work has also been carried out and one site survived the previous industrial use. The site found was a food preparation site, carbon-dated at 5,000 years old, where there were elk bones, fish bones and turtle carcasses.</p><p>He said the archaeological work was completed with assistance predominantly from the Little Shuswap Lake Band.</p><p>Cunliffe said provincially established protocols are being followed, which include informing and consulting with the bands.</p><p>\"We're doing our best to avoid it,\" he said of the site, adding there has been systematic data recovery which involves understanding the history of the site and how it was used.</p><p>Other work being done is riparian area restoration because so much wood waste was left.

The mean is reached by combining all of the daytime temperatures and averaging them and then averaging those numbers for the summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">June came in as the second hottest June on record &amp; - again 1961 proved hotter. July was the sixth warmest on record and August was the 27th.</p><p>While it was a dry summer, it ranks only as the 41st driest, largely because of the rain that finally came in August. That month 98 mm of rain fell, compared with the 72 mm that is typical for the month.</p><p>\"Thank goodness. It was about time we had a wet month. It was much, much needed obviously,\" said Fougere.</p><p>The heat and the smoke were probably the biggest weather conversation starters for many central Albertans this year. Heat warnings and special air quality statements almost became routine as the summer wore on.</p><p>At the end of June and into early July, Alberta baked. There were at least 212 daily temperature records set across the province &amp; - including at least one in Red Deer &amp; - from June 25 to July 2.</p><p>The high of 34.8 C recorded in Red Deer on June 30 beat the previous record of 30.6 C set in 1944.</p><p>The heat wave was felt throughout the province. In August, Edmonton set a record with 17 days above 30 C, eclipsing the previous record of 14 days set in 1961.</p><p>Fougere said meteorologists and climatologists are busy compiling all of the statistics and will present an overview later this month.</p><p>\"There are just thousands and thousands of data points we have to go through.\"</p><p>The cause of the lengthy blast of heat was an unusually strong ridge of high pressure over Western Canada, explained in early July.</p><p>\"You basically had low-pressure systems on either side which created what we call a blocking pattern. That blocking pattern is what made it sit over the western parts of Canada for a week on end and the temperatures just really built.</p><p>\"It was both the magnitude of the ridge and this blocking pattern that led to this extreme heat.\"</p><p>Amazingly, daytime temperature peaks could have been higher except for the blanket of smoke from wildfires far to the southwest of central Alberta.</p><p>\"It was a hot summer, but, absolutely, it could have been hotter if not for the forest fire smoke,\" he said. \"A lot of times it looked like we were going to have very high temperatures and we were knocking off several degrees from what we expected from the daytime highs because of the smoke.</p><p>\"The sun just wasn't able to infiltrate that smoke and make it down to the surface.\"</p><p>So, if not for the smoke it would easily have been the hottest summer on record right?</p><p>Not so fast, explains Fougere. While the smoke may have checked daytime highs, it also trapped warmth leading to balmier-than-usual evenings. Since the records are built on averages of highs and lows, 1961 may still have been the hottest all things considered.</p><p>\"Not only does (the smoke) block our incoming radiation, but it blocks our outgoing solar radiation, keeping our mornings warmer.\"</p><p>Another interesting aspect of the past summer was the lack of thunderstorms, despite conditions, which seemed to be perfect for creating the lightning lightworks and rain deluges or hail storms that are a common summer feature.</p><p>\"There were absolutely days where the conditions were there for thunderstorm development to be fairly widespread. But the thunderstorms just didn't form, or only a few formed, because of the smoke.\"</p><p>\"It prevented that heat and the lift from the surface we typically get from that daytime heating.\"</p><p>The ridge of high pressure, which created the heat wave, also acted to reduce the thunderstorm threat.</p><p>\"I know there were days when we were looking and all the ingredients were there for severe thunderstorms. And on those days, typically you would have seen widespread severe weather and we had almost nothing this year. There were several days like that.\"</p><p>The lack of thunderstorms and the rain they bring was a big reason it was such a dry summer.</p><p>News tipsLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-4209596</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63JN-X781-F103-304F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors.

What is happening at the moment is a shambles and unacceptable to anyone with any love for this community. Monster garages with suites on lot lines, ugly development crowding Hot Springs Road, illegal secondary suites in the R1, single family zone, flooding and traffic chaos. These are all symptoms of a sick planning regime.</p><p>The problem could be lousy bylaws or bad administration. Perhaps both. It has to stop. I have 40 years of experience dealing with zoning bylaws and OCP bylaws throughout the Fraser Valley. I know how to fix and properly administer Harrison's bylaws . I will do so promptly in conjunction with elected councillors. My second priority is to mitigate the interface forest fire hazard. Prevention and good response planning will be followed by real progress on the Northern evacuation route. Handing this off to Kent hasn't worked. We need to take control and get it done. Instead of more committee meetings and consultants, we'll send a machine (probably an excavator) down the old forestry road through Sasquatch Park, the route I've been advocating for about 30 years. We'll then see what's needed to open it up for northward evacuation access to Hwy #7. Maybe not much, as the road bed is still intact, just overgrown.</p><p>John Buckley (Council): Sustainability and accessibility.</p><p>1. Development has to be managed so the villages growth systems and infrastructure can maintain both the residents and the tourists who visit our beautiful village. As our population ages it is important to ensure that all public spaces remain accessible and usable for all residents.</p><p>Accessibility is also important for tourism, as there is a clear trend to ensuring destinations can be accessed by all.</p><p>To that end, I support the new visitor information centre which is striving to obtain the Rick Hansen Gold Standard of accessibility.</p><p>2. Support local businesses. It's because of them that our property taxes remain significantly lower than otherwise might be. As an official resort community, we receive provincial government resort municipality initiative (RMI) funds which amount to millions of dollars, paying for infrastructure and amenities along the waterfront and throughout our village that we could otherwise not afford.</p><p>Leo Facio (Council, incumbent Mayor): My two highest priorities for the village are to be sustainable, also have more communication with the public and work on the emergency route.</p><p>Leslie Ghezesan (Council): To check where our tax money vanished as from 2018 went up $200 to $1,200 put this money to work for us.</p><p>Allan Jackson (Council): To ensure the Village remains economically sustainable. To ensure the right and concerns of the taxpayers are protected and heard.</p><p>Samantha Piper (Mayor, incumbent Council): I still have a lot of work I wish to continue with Council. The two highest priorities initially are a Service Capacity Review (SCR) and the second is Relationship Building. An SCR will take a deep dive into sustainable service delivery. The scope of works will include a look inward and outward of the municipality's procedures and overall framework; the purpose and goal will be to establish sustainable efficiencies, long-term strategies, community needs, and future service planning for the betterment of the community as a whole. The SCR process will require time.</p><p>If developed systematically, it will ensure a comprehensive review is generated, resulting in purpose-driven governance, municipal efficiencies, and overall community well-being. Relationship building is critically important. Council not only represents the village while at the council table but also while advocating for the village in other settings. Relationships and partnerships are what will continue to move our community forward. Joint-effort projects; regional initiatives; community to community resourcefulness; government to government ingenuity. By working collaboratively, much more can be achieved with the outcome of mutual benefits.</p><p>Michie Vidal (incumbent Council): 1. Housing needs are evolving. We are experiencing rapid growth, changing demographics and council must adapt. New residents and younger families re-vitalize our community and we must listen to their needs. Many of our seniors who have called Harrison home for many years are now considering downsizing and want to remain close to family and friends. We must find solutions and provide attainable housing for all ages. This can include incentives in partnership with programs provided by provincial and federal governments. We must continue to enhance our community where residents, businesses and visitors are provided with housing, amenities, infrastructure and programs to ensure a vibrant and thriving village.</p><p>2. We must continue to support the recommendations in our adopted Active Transportation Plan, Lagoon Master Plan, Parking Master Plan and our future Urban Forest Master Plan. These provide the justification when grant applications are submitted, and if awarded, provide upgrades and additions for the benefit of our community as a whole. Council has kept property taxes to modest increases. Grants provide the needed funding to ensure we have an active and safe community without the burden of substantial tax increases.</p><p>Ed Wood (Mayor): Build community spirit. Form committees and allow informal conversations by the public in village business, engage, listen, learn, and build. Quality of privacy in our homes. Ensure the draft OCP that allows for duplexes and coach houses to be built on presently zoned single home lots is not permitted.</p><p>What have you done to prepare for this position?</p><p>Allen: Harrison's new Mayor needs to hit the ground running, rather than spending the first year learning about ongoing issues which are in front of council. I'll be ready to do this job from day one as I have attended almost all council meetings for the past four years, even the early-morning specials. My attendance record in the past two years is almost 100%. I have often been the only one in the audience. I have asked questions and filed FOI requests to get clarity on issues which are unclear. When permitted, such as at public hearings, I have tried to contribute my expertise and knowledge of the Village.</p><p>For the past 45 years, I have taken an interest in all Village matters and thus have accumulated a knowledge base which is unique. Outside of Harrison, I have led many organisations and run many meetings which has given me a set of management skills which are directly applicable to being an effective Mayor and Chief Executive Officer. I've had a lifetime of successful business dealings. I've led and built several organisations which has afforded me an opportunity to learn how to build community engagement. Serving four terms as Harrison Mayor and several as councillor has taught me how municipal government works. I am the only mayoral candidate with any actual Mayoral or private-sector, \" real world\" business experience.</p><p>Buckley: The first thing I did was print out and deliver detailed brochures with my contact information introducing myself to the residents of Harrison who did not already know me. It outlined my past civic achievements and appointments during the past two terms I served as village councillor from 2011-2018. It also spoke of who I am, what I believe and what my intentions are going forward if elected. I believe it is very important for voters to know who their candidates are and what they stand for.</p><p>Facio: I have prepared by canvasing the village with printed cards, signage, media TV interview, attended the all candidates and a facebook video.</p><p>Ghezesan: Actively participated on the council meetings from 2011 up to 2018.</p><p>Jackson: With my 9years of experience as a previous councillor, my education and my keen interest in the Village of Harrison Hot Springs I am totally prepared.</p><p>Piper: My preparation for the position of Mayor has been extensive and wrapped with dedication and anticipation for the future. An essential factor in enhancing my leadership abilities is education. I have completed various certificates, diplomas, and training that primarily focus on local government or business. In doing so, I have built a deep knowledge of municipal government, its processes, and its framework. My elected official and career experience in local government also brings insight and understanding to the council table. My natural leadership skills, vision, ethical choices and behaviour, community devotion, compassion, empathy, and creativity are who I am. I value relationships, effective communication, accountability, and team. Through emotional intelligence, I navigate various situations with grace and understanding while maintaining professionalism.</p><p>Vidal: My dedication to continuous learning is one of my strengths. Gaining a knowledge base on the roles and responsibilities of Council is necessary. My current term on Council has provided me the opportunity to gain an understanding of the Executive powers which Council is granted. Familiarizing myself with legislation which Council falls under such as the Community Charter, and the Local Government Act provided the necessary understanding of the roles, responsibilities and jurisdiction of Council, Village staff, Provincial, Federal and First Nations governments. One of my Council liaison portfolios is participation in the Agassiz/Harrison Healthy Communities. Along with other community organizations, we collectively share and discuss innovative and creative solutions to address the needs of all ages within our two jurisdictions.</p><p>As 2nd Vice President of the Lower Mainland Local Government Association, I have expanded my understanding of the needs of Local Governments from Pemberton to Boston Bar, championing these regional needs with the Provincial Government.</p><p>However, most importantly, my term on Council has provided me the opportunity to listen and hear our residents and businesses concerns and bring these to the Council table. Being a member of Council is a combination of the ability to understand concerns of the community, in some cases lead and in other cases listen. Experience teaches you to know the difference.</p><p>Wood: My commitment to you as your mayoralty candidate was and is to go knocking on doors in the village, true one on one engagement. The passion I have seen and heard is what motivates me to be your full-time mayor.</p><p>I believe in quality versus quantity, the bonds that have been made, the concerns, and the questions have given me the drive for change.</p><p>It is my commitment to you that I will do everything in my power to open the community up and truly listen, learn, and build.Door to door petition to stop the selling of the overflow parking lands/civic hall.Lobbied Brad Vis / Laurie Throness, meeting in person, to stop selling of overflow parking lands/civic hallPhone conversations with the provincial deputy attorney General regarding grant applications.Volunteered my time to assist the village during the onset of the COVID crisis.Member of the Search and Rescue, short duration.Strong advocate to upgrade and maintain our infrastructure, ie Threat of flooding due to our substandard dike. Drinking Water Plant/Source/Wastewater Treatment Plant.2014 Harrison Hot Springs councillor candidate</p><p>Leadership is about listening, learning, engaging, directing, and building community spirit. I would allow true public participation in the 'village\" business. Presently if a member of the public has a concern, and they attend a council meeting, they can only ask questions of the elected official \"after\" they have already made their minds and voted on the matter. It makes absolutely No sense to not allow questions or make comments \"before\" council makes their decisions.</p><p>If elected, what steps would you take to ensure Harrison is safe from the threat of wildfires?</p><p>Allen: Job one will be to revisit the interface fire hazard assessment report and correct the erroneous wind pattern data. That report is based on the fallacy that the Harrison summer winds blow from north to south. They don't . They actually blow from south to north. So that report needs to be corrected and re-written. I expect the corrected report will state that our major threat is a forest fire in the East Sector. We will start to mitigate that by re-opening Quarry Road so that we can get vehicles back in there to fight fires. We will then remove the accumulated fuel from the village's 73 acres along McComb Drive and limb-up the trees. The same process will be carried out at Firehall Park and other village-owned woodland. Longer term, creating a community forest ( Harrison Forest Park) will allow us to manage the whole 400 acres east of McComb Drive to reduce the fire hazard. I will ensure that our fire department is equipped to deal with woodland fires and is not confined to the blacktop only. Land-owners will be encouraged to manage their lands to reduce the interface fire risk. Bylaws may be required.</p><p>Buckley: After speaking with Harrison's fire chief, I was informed Harrison firefighters are structural firefighters, who have been trained in fighting 'outside' fires such as houses, buildings, hotels.etc. Members are currently taking interface training. This type of training teaches them how to respond, react to and fight wildfires along mountains and forested areas. I would also continue promoting public education on the dangers of outdoor fires such as campfires, fireworks, etc, as well as to further our OCP's fire corridor requirements.</p><p>Facio: We completed a FireSmart plan with a consultant and the fire department in 2017, this has been put into our new OCP, new homes will be expected to have new FireSmart materials and landscaping.</p><p>Ghezesan: (no answer provided)</p><p>Jackson: The fire department and the village must come up with a \"good old fashioned Fire Drill\" this must be related to the residents via an \"Alert System.\"</p><p>Piper: A healthy tree canopy in the community will positively affect our local environment and climate. It starts with the Urban Forest Management Plan. In this plan, I anticipate we will have a better understanding of what we have, what we should have and where we should have trees. We all play a role in the safety of our community, and that starts at home. Initiatives preventing wildfire devastation can be developed through the proven practices of FireSmart. Although our community is a designated FireSmart community, I see the development of a FireSmart/Public Safety Committee beneficial to building initiatives and educational opportunities with a lens on residential areas. The importance of having an alternative route for the safety of our residents and visitors, primarily due to the prolonged dry seasons and longer wet seasons, is necessary.</p><p>Relationship-building will be essential while continuing to advocate with neighbouring communities for a secondary emergency route. Although the identified route is outside our community boundary, we can continue to champion the need to the provincial government. Our local fire department is full of undeniable expertise and passion. Ensuring the fire department has the resources, equipment and training required to do their job safely and effectively is essential to our overall community safety. I will always prioritize this area of the budget as crucial.</p><p>Vidal: In 2019, our village was awarded the BC FireSmart Community Protection Achievement award. This was in recognition of the steps taken to mitigate the danger of fires. Council can use standards that aid in helping to protect our homes. Land Use planning and development must include initiatives including design, construction materials and landscaping which support resiliency and protection to our homes and infrastructure. Our council, land use planners, neighbors and First Nations all need to work together. We all recognize that being FireSmart is a shared responsibility between Council and homeowners, and I encourage everyone to visit the BC FireSmart webpage for great information and recommendations. Many communities have adopted a Community Wildfire Protection Plan which helps to prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from wildfires, especially in our Interface Wildfire Development Permit Area. I support our village developing a similar policy.</p><p>Wood: Due to our rapid development, high density, it is not only wild fires but fires period. We need to train our fire fighters to handle all fire situations. I would work with the fire department to assist them with their needs, training and equipment. An evacuation route is a must, we can't rely on just Hot Springs Road. We must work with the District of Kent, which employs our joint emergency co Ordinator, the position has been vacated, and has been recently posted. I would ensure the OCP includes the \"wildfire zone\" in all future development projects.</p><p>During the past few years, there have been gaps in meetings being recorded or broadcast online. This has created some questions of transparency. Do you support additional efforts to broadcast and record meetings? Why or why not?</p><p>Allen: \"Additional efforts\" is not nearly good enough. As Mayor and CEO I will ensure that ALL public council meetings are recorded and broadcast on Zoom or other media. There is no valid excuse for not doing so. We have spent thousands of dollars on the equipment. We know it works well. We just have to turn it on.</p><p>I will ensure that all issues which should be dealt with in public are actually dealt with in public. There will be no more use of \" in-camera\" ( secret) meetings to hide issues from the public if they have a right to observe those discussions. For the past fourteen years, I have campaigned for \"open, honest government\". That's what I will deliver to Harrison residents. Your civic rights matter and will be respected by me.</p><p>Buckley: Yes, of course I would support increased transparency of recorded meetings as per what the community charter allows.</p><p>I campaigned on wanting to create more transparency between residents and the village in our day to day operations.</p><p>Facio: We did put in additional recording both in the village chambers and when the pandemic arrived we moved to the memorial hall where the ability for Zoom was installed, due to some conflict with the festival off the arts the recording will continue after the counsel has been asked to change their meeting date.</p><p>Ghezesan: We have to make it mandatory recordings evry meeting and broadcast them; we improving our transparency.</p><p>Jackson: I feel only items that should be discussed \"in camera\" are Legal, Land, and Labour\". everything should be discussed in a public forum and recorded.</p><p>Piper: I full-heartedly support consistent broadcasting and recordings of council meetings. At the start of my second term, I spoke in favour of recording meetings; we as council discussed options and logistics that resulted in the start of the video recordings that we see today. I also supported utilizing Zoom as a platform for residents to attend meetings. Yes, of course there was a learning curve, the pandemic restrictions, summer events, and technical difficulties which we all genuinely tried to navigate to the best of our abilities. The recordings and Zoom access are good for those unable to attend a face-to-face meeting. Not everyone in our community is available at the same time of day therefore providing access options for council meetings is an inclusive approach. Still, it also assists with showing processes, spreading knowledge on local projects/initiatives and business of council, as well as provides ease of access to council meetings. Can we do better? Probably, and if we can, we should; however, we need to remember additional equipment and technical support come with a cost that must be considered with budget and we need to be open to hearing what is and is not working for the community.</p><p>In my opinion, concepts of secret meetings, lack of notification, meetings without minutes, and changing to an organic approach for meeting structure are theories based on perceptions. The reality is the business of council is heavily legislated through the Community Charter. The strong language of \"Must\" when referring to the business of council is outlined in the legislation. Council must conduct public meetings, must have a Procedure Bylaw (rules of procedure for meetings of council), and must be recorded (minutes) to mention just a few of the requirements. I admit, the processes can be frustrating or confusing at times, partly due to the pace however, adhering to legislation is a necessity. The remarkable thing about municipal government is how reachable it is because it is local; residents have access to its front door and elected officials. There are many other ways government can be malleable and avoid barriers and I see those being reviewed in my plans for a Service Capacity Review (SCR).</p><p>Vidal: Prior to the pandemic, video recording equipment was installed in Council Chambers which allowed residents to view Council meetings on You Tube. During the early stages of the Covid pandemic, Council meetings were moved to Memorial Hall providing a larger space for physical distancing requirements. Video recording equipment was re-located, and once Public Health Orders mandated no public attendance at Council meetings, live streaming via Zoom Conferencing was introduced, allowing full participation for residents. In support of tourism recovery, and to accommodate the return of our numerous festivals and events, Council meetings returned to Council chambers at the Village office during the summer months. Council meetings have now returned to the Memorial Hall with full video recordings and Zoom Conferencing capabilities.</p><p>Wood: All council meetings must be at minimum recorded and available to the public, my preference would be to include zoom so the public can feel free to ask questions.</p><p>With the pandemic's effects on tourism, do you think Harrison can still continue to survive on tourism alone?</p><p>Allen: Tourism is Harrison's only industry, but it is no longer the dominant source of tax revenue it once was. The reality is that Harrison has fallen behind as a BC destination resort and our tourism industry is now foolishly focussed on day-trippers rather than overnight stays. This is unsustainable. We cannot grow a viable business sector on ice cream and beach BBQs.</p><p>We need \"heads in beds\" and overnight visitors who spend money in restaurants and shops while here. A serious discussion about our future economy needs to be part of the OCP review which I will initiate. My professional qualifications and extensive background in BC tourism will serve to find ways to enhance real tourism in the Village. If we can't do that, I fear that we are destined to be a retirement/bedroom community with a small tourism area swamped with day trippers. We must, and can, do better.</p><p>Buckley: After speaking with Tourism Harrison, I was informed that while the pandemic did have a significant impact, the residents did their best to support local businesses.</p><p>This past summer showed a fabulous return of visitors with hotels operating at near capacity. With the ongoing support of Tourism Harrison, Tourism can and will be the economic engine for Harrison and the greater region.</p><p>Facio: In 2021 tourism started to make a comeback and I believe this year in 2022 the tourism industry has had a tremendous rebound, with the additional extension of the region which includes Agassiz and Harrison Mills I believe tourism will get stronger.</p><p>Ghezesan: Too much is spent on tourism. Harrison is old enough to be advertised.</p><p>Jackson: Tourism is vital to the economic health of to all our various businesses, and generates income to the Village through Pay Parking, and the Resort Municipal Tax which has brought in over 8 million dollars since 2007.</p><p>Piper: Yes, I believe we can, partly due to our location. Harrison has much to offer with our breathtaking environment, experiences, area history, the dedicated business community, and recreational opportunities. At the same time, we should remain open to new and innovative ideas while being acutely aware of the change in consumer expectations. Due to technology and the push forward from the pandemic, home-based and small businesses continue to grow. It is critical to continually think big picture, build relationships, and monitor the ever-changing economic landscape through the lens of what it means for our community. The RMI funding for the community is a lifeline.</p><p>Continuing to work with the Provincial Government and advocating for the continuance of the RMI funding is crucial for our community. This funding enables tourism-based infrastructure improvements that create experiences for visitors to enjoy, encourage return trips, and residents, in turn, enjoy the same improvements. Having year-round events, festivals, and infrastructure that supports all-season activities is essential. Building upon the relationship with the Sts'ailes people and local Indigenous communities, local businesses, groups, associations, societies, Tourism Harrison, and the Harrison Agassiz Chamber of Commerce will ensure that the hard work and dedication for local events is supported by residents and visitors alike, resulting in drawing in customers for our local businesses. Attracting and retaining employees locally is essential for the success and sustainability of our local businesses. Putting our heads together to develop sustainable strategies that include affordable housing for workers is an absolute must. I see this work launching through committee work, meaningful engagement, and collaboration.</p><p>Vidal: Our visitors are returning to Harrison, tourism is recovering and remains the economic drive of our community. Travel restrictions have eased, and we have seen a substantial return and an increase in our tourism numbers from local, provincial and international visitors. Tourism is our main economy, and we must continue to promote our Village as a year-round destination. Steps have been taken in this direction including our Lights on the Lake winter display and the construction of the eco-friendly artificial outdoor skating rink which will re-open later this fall. Supporting these initiatives and finding other innovated and creative ideas will help to ensure our tourism industry continues to thrive and grow.</p><p>Wood: I believe with Smart development, including: green space, visual appearance, storm water management, tree buffer zone, energy efficiency (LEED), carbon footprint. The development on Hot Springs Road, Terra estates, is an example of how broken the village is, we need real change at the leadership level, before we scare all the people away.</p><p>Read the full Q&amp;A session online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.agassizharrisonobserver.com\">www.agassizharrisonobserver.com</url>.</p><p>Copyright 2022 Agassiz-Harrison Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGAHRO-news20221015PAC4381595</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGAHRO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66MF-8SG1-F0HF-83BX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4513\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Currently, outfitters are still able to apply for a permit to take guests into the backcountry.</p><p>\"I wish they would crank it up even higher to keep people out. If a forest fire goes through, I lose my business,\" Wohlgemuth said.</p><p>On Thursday, the risk of forest fires was so high that the province announced an immediate travel ban on backcountry trails and water routes in all provincial parks south of the 53rd parallel. The province also banned campfires in parks. As well, numerous municipalities have enacted burning restrictions.</p><p>There have been 51 forest fires this season, and provincial and municipal fire crews are still battling blazes at the east end of Falcon Lake in Whiteshell Provincial Park, as well as others in the RM of Piney and RM of Grahamdale, in southeast Manitoba.</p><p>DJ Seales, president of the Manitoba Lodges and Outfitters Association, said the provincial restrictions may have inconvenienced some guests at some lodges, but for the most part \"COVID is what is hurting them more.</p><p>\"Most thought this would last four to six months, but now as we have passed the one-year mark, many are dealing with COVID fatigue. It is especially hard for the lodge and outfitting industry that have 90 to 100 per cent American guests. The outfitting industry has dealt with at least one season/year of no income, with many now having a second year cancelled since spring season wasn't possible.\"</p><p>Seales said his members are thankful for the province's bridge grant and the hospitality relief program, both of which have helped keep some of them operating.</p><p>Seales said they are waiting for the federal government to look at the closed border.</p><p>\"We are now looking to the federal government to step up to making it possible for lodges and outfitters to welcome international guests,\" he said.</p><p>\"Until the border opens, this is not possible. A reopening plan that incorporates federal and provincial requirements is imperative to create a safe and effective reopening.\"</p><p>As for the fire situation and backcountry lockdown, Seales said the association supports it.</p><p>\"(The association) thanks the province for its actions to ensure that our precious forests and wildlife are protected. Without these resources there would not be an industry for lodges and outfitters. We would also like to thank the wildfire crews that are risking their safety to protect our province and its resources.\"</p><p>Wohlgemuth said he owns an outfitter business that caters to hunters, which has been forced to close.</p><p>\"All of my clientele is in the United States,\" he said.</p><p>\"If it wasn't for the pandemic, we would be able to go out with hunters, but we would just have to be more careful. I'm really happy the province is doing this because, with COVID, we've seen a bit more people coming out to do backcountry.</p><p>\"I'm glad they are trying to tell the public what is going on.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kevin.rollason@freepress.mb.ca\">kevin.rollason@freepress.mb.ca</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-news20210515TTAWwfp574425962</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62NX-2181-JDV5-F2SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Forest History Association.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prior to beginning his career as a lawyer, he earned his PhD at the University of Minnesota in cultural geography, where he wrote a thesis in 1979 entitled, But We Must Cultivate Our Garden: Twentieth Century Pioneering in Rural British Columbia.</p><p>During his thesis research phase, in addition to reviewing all pertinent literature on the topic, Simmons visited communities throughout North America, including many in British Columbia, and he attended 12 Coalition of Intentional Cooperative Communities meetings.</p><p>In his thesis, he described the backto-the-land movement as mostly unorganized, amorphous and a diverse group that included all ages of people from a wide variety of backgrounds,</p><p>who shared a wide-range of political view and that primarily settled on marginal, low-cost land.</p><p>According to Simmons, the number of people in B.C. who could be identified as back-to-the-landers was estimated to be at the minimum 15,000, which included both individual family groups and intentional communities.</p><p>Essentially, the movement was a reversal of the 20th century migration trend that resulted in a mass exodus of rural people moving to the cities and represented a rejection of urbanism in favour of a healthier lifestyle more in tune with nature.</p><p>What is perhaps most significant about Simmons\u2019 study is the discus</p><p>sion of the reasons why people chose to move to the country. While in the 1970s people were just beginning to become aware of the environmental problems that plague us today, they were indeed concerned about politics and the threat of nuclear war.</p><p>Simmons described the movement as an \u201coptimistic response to a pessimistic interpretation of modern life,\u201d</p><p>in which the participants seek to escape the \u201cpathos of modern life to create viable alternatives to it.\u201d</p><p>For those of us who were part of the back-to-the-land movement 40-50 years ago, the decisions we made then still resonate today. We chose an alternative lifestyle as a way to cope with the social decay of the times, with the goal of developing a better world for the future. Now the future</p><p>is here, and the problems have only intensified. Country living, while still more desirable than life in crowded, polluted cities, is no longer a haven, especially during the forest fire season.</p><p>To date, I have provided stories about a number of Shuswap\u2019s intentional communities. For many others, the complete story may never be told.</p><p>For example, close to Cherryville there was a community established</p><p>in the mid-1970s called Dandelion Landslide that was dedicated to art.</p><p>Living there were a number of graduates from the Kootenay School of Art, who made pottery and sculpture, as well as painted.</p><p>In the early 1970s, former Okanagan college instructor Tom Marshall was living in the U.S. and eager to move to Canada. He read an ad in the Mother Earth News for the Fantasy Farm community in Grindrod that was looking for members so he headed there in 1974. It was owned by a lawyer who was eager to share the property with young idealists looking for a better life. It did not take long for the experiment to fail and Tom moved away within a year.</p><p>When the Hailos Community in Bear Valley faded, a group, led by Ira Zbarsky, purchased a farm on Branchflower Road in Silver Creek where they formed a co-op. They lived together in an 11-bedroom house and grew a large vegetable garden.

(TSX: JOY) (OTCQX: JRNGF) (\"Journey\" or the \"Company\") announces its financial results for the first quarter of 2023. The complete set of financial statements and management discussion and analysis for the periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 are posted on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url> and on the Company's website <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.journeyenergy.ca\">www.journeyenergy.ca</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights for the first quarter, and to-date are as follows:</p><p> Generated sales volumes of 12,920 boe/d in the first quarter (45% crude oil; 11% NGL's; 44% natural gas). All of Journey's production is currently unhedged. Year-over-year sales volumes increased 52%.Generated adjusted funds flow of $18.0 million or $0.31 per basic share and $0.28 per diluted share. Quarter-over-quarter, Adjusted Funds Flow was impacted by a 16% decrease in average, corporate, realized pricing per boe. The corresponding 39% reduction in operating netback was largely offset by the by the quarter over quarter increase in sales volumes.Closed a Canadian Development Expense flow-through-share financing of 3.0 million shares at $6.62/share for gross proceeds of $20.1 million. The proceeds of the flow-through-share financing will be utilized to fund an 8 well drilling program in the second half of 2023.Produced 5,603 megawatts of electricity at Journey's power generation facility in Countess, Alberta at an average price of $159.65/MWH. The run-rate during the first quarter was 64% of capacity.Completed the purchase of the 16.5 MW power plant in MazeppaAlberta on April 28. Journey continues to make progress with plans to re-activate this facility in its current location, most recently entering into an agreement to purchase the land the power facility resides on. In addition, the Company continues to advance the approval process for reconnecting and reactivating the facility to the power grid.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"7\" rowsep=\"0\"

This transaction was the primary contributor to the increase in sales volumes from 8,492 boe/d in the first quarter of 2022 to 12,920 boe/d in the first quarter of 2023. The acquisition had a positive impact on the liquids (crude oil and NGL's) sales mix as it increased from 47% in the first quarter of 2022 to 55% in the current quarter. This change will benefit Journey's netback going forward due to the significant shift towards the more valuable liquids weighting. Current production capability from the combined asset base is approximately 13,000 boe/d. Journey's productive capability continues to be affected by minor unplanned outages that are expected to be resolved by early summer. However, Journey is still projecting to achieve its full year guidance, even with a capital program that is weighted to the back half of the year.</p><p>Along with the continued integration of the Acquisition, Journey's activity levels in the first quarter of 2023 also included advancing the power business, and preparing for an active second half of the year. Journey's capital program has shifted more towards oil-weighted opportunities by replacing natural gas weighted drilling in Westerose with oil weighted drilling in Matziwin. This is expected to result in lower aggregate boe volumes in favour of higher netback oil volumes. Journey's 2023 drilling program now features 9 gross (7.6 net wells) including 4 wells in Medicine Hat; 3 wells in Cherhill; and 2 wells in Matziwin. It is important to note that $20 million of Journey's $63 million capital program is directed toward sales volume growth. In addition, Journey plans to expand its polymer flood in Medicine Hat and its waterflood in Matziwin, which will result in a less immediate, but longer lasting positive impact on the sales volumes at these locations. Journey has allocated $8 million of its 2023 capital budget to polymer costs, injector conversions, and facilities. Journey has also allocated $5.4 million of capital toward end-of-life costs and an additional $8 million in minor acquisition costs; land acquisitions; seismic data; and cost carry overs from projects started in 2022.</p><p>Even though Journey shifted its capital program towards oil weighted drilling, Journey continues to advance its repeatable plays in 2023. The Company is in final negotiations to enter into a farm-in agreement with a freehold mineral owner in the Gilby area of Alberta. This farm-in, combined with Journey's existing acreage will give the company access to approximately fifty contiguous, gross sections for Duvernay development drilling. These mineral rights are adjacent to Journey's Gilby gas processing facility. These rights are already overlain by liquid-rich, Glauconite production and contain two Duvernay test wells drilled as part of Journey's previous joint venture with Kiwetinohk. The primary term of the option agreement is for four years with a further option to extend the term to seven years. Journey currently plans to drill a minimum of two Duvernay wells on this block during the four year primary term.</p><p>EXPANDING JOURNEY'S POWER BUSINESS</p><p>For 2023, Journey has continued to prioritize its emerging power generation business and has made significant strides in this regard. Journey allocated $21 million in capital to its power generation business for 2023. The majority of this capital is associated with its Gilby power plant construction and the remainder to the Mazeppa power plant purchase. Although a portion of the Gilby capital may carry over into the first quarter of 2024, this is expected to be offset by an increased capital allocation devoted to re-energizing the purchased Mazeppa power plant. Therefore there is a potential upward bias to Journey's capital allocation to its power business in 2023.</p><p>Journey has demonstrated, through the operation of its existing Countess power plant, that it is far more profitable to convert its natural gas into electricity, than to merely sell the natural gas at spot prices. The currently operating, 4 MW Countess facility, which was originally commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2020, is already close to paying out the original investment. Based on Journey's realized power prices in 2022, the average, effective, net realized price for natural gas used to generate power for the year was approximately $10.54/mcf. For the first three months of 2023 the average, effective, net realized price was $8.60. This price takes into account the cost of the natural gas and the incremental costs of operating the power plant. As a comparison, the average AECO benchmark price for 2022 was approximately $5.43/mcf and $3.23/mcf for the first three months of 2023. Average power prices have increased over 250% since this facility came on stream. Journey is planning to increase its power sales to the Alberta electricity grid by over 500% over the next year. The nature of Journey's asset base is such that it is a large power consumer, and power represents 25% of overall corporate operating costs.</p><p>Journey previously announced that it had entered into an agreement to purchase a 16.5 MW power generation facility through an open auction process that started in November 2022. This facility was originally commissioned by another operator in 2015, and ran for less than one year before being shut-in. The Mazeppa facility is located near the community of High River Alberta and consists of five, 3.3 MW Jenbacher generators and includes switch gear, coolers, and an export transformer. The generators, ancillary equipment, and buildings are in excellent condition as they previously had minimal run time. Journey estimates that the replacement value of this facility is in excess of five times the purchase price.</p><p>The Mazeppa power facility acquisition closed in April 2023 and its cost has been included in the capital guidance for 2023. Since agreeing to purchase this facility, Journey has been actively pursuing the option of re-energizing this facility in its existing location. This option was further advanced in early May when Journey entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the land the power project is currently occupying. The land purchase is forecast to close in mid-May. As each of these milestones are achieved, Journey is more certain that there is a viable path for re-energizing this facility in place at Mazeppa by early 2024. Journey intends to provide further guidance on the time-line to an on-stream date in August. Full costs for re-energizing this facility have not been included in the 2023 capital guidance, but are not forecast to materially affect the 2023 capital program.</p><p>Journey has received preliminary approval to construct a 15.5 MW generation facility at its Gilby gas plant and has procured 17 MW of generating capacity in support of this project. The Company has continued to advance the design and approval of this project. The primary construction phase of this facility is scheduled to begin after breakup and this power project is currently anticipated to commence operations in the first quarter of 2024.</p><p>When the Gilby and Mazeppa power projects are on-stream, Journey will be in a position to more than offset its corporate power usage with power sales to the Alberta power grid. This will help diversify the corporate revenue stream and improves the sustainability of the Company even when there is a volatile commodity pricing environment. The record power prices of $311/MW realized in December of 2022, along with the expanding valuations demonstrated by recent market transactions continues to re-inforce the validity of this longer term strategy.</p><p>FINANCIAL</p><p>The first quarter of 2023 was the first full quarter operating the significant acquisition that closed on October 31, 2022. The 72% liquids (crude oil and NGL's) weighting from the Acquisition helped increase Journey's overall liquids weighting from 47% in the first quarter of 2022 to 55% in the first quarter of 2023. The Acquisition was well-timed as commodity prices started to soften in early 2023 and the increased emphasis on the higher netback liquids volumes contributed significantly to Journey's first quarter results. Average commodity prices decreased by 17% from the first quarter of 2022 to the current quarter with oil down by 25%, natural gas down by 35% and NGL's down by 19%. Journey still posted solid results with Adjusted Funds Flow for the first quarter of 2023 of $18.0 million. Crude oil sales volumes for the first quarter of 2023 represented 44% of total boe volumes but contributed 70% of total petroleum and natural gas revenues. Natural gas sales volumes contributed 45% of total boe sales volumes in 2023 while contributing 20% of total sales revenues.</p><p>As previously discussed, first quarter volumes and revenues were impacted by unplanned outages that are forecast to be resolved in the near term and full year guidance is still confirmed. First quarter revenues were also impacted by an unplanned maintenance outage at one of the power generation units at the Countess power plant. This resulted in an uncharacteristically low utilization rate of 64% for the quarter. This issue was resolved and utilization has returned to normal levels in March.</p><p>All of the field operating costs (royalties, operating and transportation expenses) experienced increases during the first quarter of 2023. Royalty expense was higher by 49% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. This was expected with the higher weighting to crude oil and the higher aggregate volumes sold. On a per boe basis royalty expense was $10.38/boe in 2023 as compared to $10.63 in the first quarter of 2022. Field operating expenses increased in 2023 as the acquisitions from 2022, workovers, reactivations, plant turnarounds and general inflationary pressures contributed to the total increase. In addition, $2.4 million of workover and turnaround costs were incurred in the first quarter of 2023 and accounted for approximately $2.05/boe of the total operating expenses on a per boe basis. As a result of these cost pressures, Journey averaged $19.78/boe for operating expenses in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to $17.40/boe in the same quarter of 2022.</p><p>Journey's general and administrative (\"G&amp;A\") costs were lower in 2023 as compared to the same quarter in 2022 as field-related cost recoveries mitigated additional staff costs related to the acquisitions in 2022. G&amp;A was $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2022. On a per boe basis, Journey's general and administrative costs were $1.57/boe for the first quarter of 2023 and $3.15/boe for the first quarter of 2022. </p><p>Finance expenses related to borrowings, or interest costs, increased by 66% to $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2023 from $1.6 million in the same quarter of 2022. Average, interest-bearing debt increased by 60% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter of 2022 mainly due to the vendor-take-back financing associated with the Acquisition. </p><p>Journey realized net income of $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $13.8 million in the same quarter of 2022. Net income per basic and diluted share was $0.11 and $0.10 respectively for the first quarter. Adjusted Funds Flow in the first quarter was 12% lower in 2023, wherein the Company generated $18.0 million, or $0.31 and $0.28 per basic and diluted share respectively as compared to $20.4 million, or $0.42 basic and $ 0.36 per diluted per share respectively in the same quarter of 2022. Cash flow from operations was $11.5 million in the first quarter of 2023 ($0.20 per basic share and $0.18 per diluted share) as compared to $21.8 million in the first quarter of 2022 ($0.45 and $0.39 per basic and diluted share respectively).</p><p>In March, Journey closed a bought deal flow-through share financing. The full 15% over-allotment was exercised bringing the total equity issuance to 3,040,031 flow-through common shares at a price of $6.62 per share for total gross proceeds of $20.1 million. The strong market pricing of the deal and the solid tax pool position of Journey made this transaction possible. The proceeds of the financing help fund Journey's drilling program which is currently expected to be begin in the summer.</p><p>Journey continued to be prudent with its capital spending during the first quarter as it underspent its Adjusted Funds Flows to allow for the maximum flexibility in its cash position while integrating the Acquisition. Total capital expenditures in the first quarter were $9.2 million including $2.4 million spent on abandonment and reclamation work. Journey exited the first quarter of 2023 with net debt of $71.1 million as compared to $38.5 million at March 31, 2022 and $98.8 million at the end of 2022. The higher net debt was mainly attributable to vendor-take-back debt, which assisted Journey in completing the Acquisition in October. The initial amount of this debt was $45 million and at March 31, 2023 the balance outstanding is $37 million. During the quarter Journey also fulfilled its obligation to repay AIMCo a balloon payment of $23.8 million leaving approximately $43.8 million of principal term debt owing to them. During January Journey also repaid the remaining $5 million of contingent bank debt owing from 2020. Even with the lower Adjusted Funds Flow from declining commodity prices in the quarter and the extra debt taken on to close the Acquisition, Journey's net debt to annualized Adjusted Funds Flow is a very respectable 1.0 times.</p><p>OUTLOOK &amp; GUIDANCE</p><p>Commensurate with the closing of its flow through share issuance on March 23, 2023, Journey has updated its 2023 guidance. The new guidance reflects minor sales volume adjustments to its base production, reductions in forecasted commodity prices and additions in the second half from a relatively small oil weighted development program. Journey remains poised to significantly ramp up capital expenditures in the second half of 2023 should commodity prices increase.</p><p>The early start of the forest fire season in Alberta is affecting many producers, including Journey. Journey's producing areas of Carrot Creek, Berrymoor. Ante Creek. Niton, Pine Creek, Kaybob, and Stolberg have all been affected to varying degrees. Field production has been directly impacted by evacuations and indirectly impacted by damage to the power grid and third party facility outages. Current production is impacted by approximately 1,200-1,300 boe/d (50% liquids), but has been as high as 2,000 boe/d. As always, Journey's first priority is the safety of both the nearby residents and its personnel. Journey personnel have worked with emergency services in its producing areas and will take all prudent and proactive measures to accomplish this objective. With recent rain and the diligent efforts of emergency services, the impact on Journey's production is gradually being resolved. However, it is difficult to quantify the length of time or the full extent of these outages and their impact on Journey's second quarter production.</p><p>This guidance incorporates many material underlying assumptions including but not limited to:</p><p> Generated sales volumes of 12,920 boe/d in the first quarter (45% crude oil; 11% NGL's; 44% natural gas). All of Journey's production is currently unhedged. Year-over-year sales volumes increased 52%.Generated adjusted funds flow of $18.0 million or $0.31 per basic share and $0.28 per diluted share. Quarter-over-quarter, Adjusted Funds Flow was impacted by a 16% decrease in average, corporate, realized pricing per boe. The corresponding 39% reduction in operating netback was largely offset by the by the quarter over quarter increase in sales volumes.Closed a Canadian Development Expense flow-through-share financing of 3.0 million shares at $6.62/share for gross proceeds of $20.1 million. The proceeds of the flow-through-share financing will be utilized to fund an 8 well drilling program in the second half of 2023.Produced 5,603 megawatts of electricity at Journey's power generation facility in Countess, Alberta at an average price of $159.65/MWH. The run-rate during the first quarter was 64% of capacity.Completed the purchase of the 16.5 MW power plant in Mazeppa Alberta on April 28. Journey continues to make progress with plans to re-activate this facility in its current location, most recently entering into an agreement to purchase the land the power facility resides on. In addition, the Company continues to advance the approval process for reconnecting and reactivating the facility to the power grid.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">2023 Guidance</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Annual average daily sales volumes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">12,500-13,000 boe/d (54% crude oil &amp; NGL's1)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted Funds Flow</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$75-78 million</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted Funds Flow per weighted average share</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$1.24 - $1.29</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Capital spending (E&amp;D, A&amp;D, ARO and Power)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$63 million</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2023 ending Net Debt</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$65-68 million</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Commodity prices2: WTI (USD $/bbl) MSW oil differentials (USD $/bbl) WCS oil differentials (USD $/bbl) AECO natural gas (CAD $/mcf) CAD/USD foreign exchange</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$75.00 $3.00 $15.00 $3.25 $0.74</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"368\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Notes:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The weighting of the corporate sales volumes guidance is as follows:</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">a.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Heavy oil: 18%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">b.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Light/medium crude oil: 25%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">c.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">NGL's: 11%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">d.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Coal-bed methane natural gas: 6%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">e.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Conventional natural gas: 40%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Commodity prices represent 2023 forecast averages.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Journey's goals for improving corporate sustainability in 2023 include:</p><p> Generated sales volumes of 12,920 boe/d in the first quarter (45% crude oil; 11% NGL's; 44% natural gas).

Journey is focused on adjusting its capital program to meet its near term obligations without sacrificing the longer term priorities of sustainability and enhancing shareholder value.</p><p>Journey continues to embark on a careful and prudent expansion of its business plan. Journey has achieved or exceeded all of its internal targets and created significant value for all stakeholders since the bottom of the market in 2020. This expansion has been buoyed by commodity price tailwinds and would not be possible without the talented team at Journey, both in the office and the field. Journey also recognizes the steady guidance supplied by its Board of Directors and the unyielding support of AIMCo, the Company's term debt provider and largest shareholder. Together, with the support of this combined team, your Company is extremely well positioned to continue its journey of value creation and maintain its growth trajectory for years to come.

Journey is offering shareholders an opportunity to listen to the business to be conducted at the Meeting by teleconference. Shareholders not attending in person must vote on the matters not less than forty-eight (48) hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays in the Province of Alberta) before the time of the Meeting. Further instructions on how to listen to the Meeting and how to vote in advance of the Meeting can be found in Journey's management information circular that is posted on the Company's website and on SEDAR. Journey expects to only have a minimum number of in-person attendees present to conduct the formal business of the Meeting and does not intend to provide a corporate presentation after the Meeting.</p><p>About the Company</p><p>Journey is a Canadian exploration and production company focused on conventional, oil-weighted operations in western Canada. Journey's strategy is to grow its production base by drilling on its existing core lands, implementing water flood projects, and executing on accretive acquisitions. Journey seeks to optimize its legacy oil pools on existing lands through the application of best practices in horizontal drilling and, where feasible, with water floods. In addition, Journey is seeking to grow its power generation business. Journey currently produces approximately 4 MW of electricity and with the recently announced facility acquisitions is anticipating to expand its productive capacity to approximately 36 MW within the next year.</p><p>ADVISORIES</p><p>This press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively \"forward looking information\") within the meaning of applicable securities laws relating to the Company's plans and other aspects of the anticipated future operations, management focus, strategies, financial, operating and production results, industry conditions, commodity prices and business opportunities.

These terms do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other companies. </p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"24\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"600\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">(1)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\"Adjusted Funds Flow\" is calculated by taking \"cash flow provided by operating activities\" from the financial statements and adding or deducting: changes in non-cash working capital; non-recurring \"other\" income; transaction costs; and decommissioning costs. Adjusted Funds Flow per share is calculated as Adjusted Funds Flow divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding in the period. Because Adjusted Funds Flow and Adjusted Funds Flow per share are not impacted by fluctuations in non-cash working capital balances, Management believes these measures are more indicative of performance than the GAAP measured \"cash flow generated from operating activities\". In addition, Journey excludes transaction costs from the definition of Adjusted Funds Flow, as these expenses are generally in respect of capital acquisition transactions. The Company considers Adjusted Funds Flow a key performance measure as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate funds necessary to repay debt and to fund future growth through capital investment. Journey's determination of Adjusted Funds Flow may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. Journey also presents \"Adjusted Funds Flow per basic share\" where per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of net income (loss) per share, which per share amount is calculated under IFRS and is more fully described in the notes to the audited, year-end consolidated financial statements.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"384\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">March 31,  2023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">March 31, 2022</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash flow provided by operating activities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">11,461</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">21,811</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Add (deduct):</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Changes in non-cash working capital</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4,280</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(2,320)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Transaction costs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Decommissioning costs incurred</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,216</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">902</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted Funds Flow</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">17,959</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">20,401</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted Funds Flow per basic (diluted) weighted average share</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$0.31 ($0.28)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">$0.42 ($0.36)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"24\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"600\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">(2)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\"Netback(s)\".

Extreme hot and dry conditions are forecasted to continue for the coming weeks and an area closure is in effect for public safety on the Red River Ranger District. The full closure order, including a map of the closed area can be found at the following link: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/nezperceclearwater/notices/?cid=FSEPRD929801\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/nezperceclearwater/notices/?cid=FSEPRD929801</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Up to date information on the status of the Dixie-Jumbo wildfire can be found at the following link:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7608/#\">https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7608/#</url></p><p>Exploration Update:</p><p>Exploration crews have now collected 34 rock samples and 935 soil samples on the Companys Erickson Ridge project and 23 rock and 770 soil samples on its South Orogrande project so far in 2021. All samples have arrived at MSALabs in Langley, BC, and assays are pending.</p><p>The Companys drill permit has now been received for its South Orogrande project and a 2,000-meter core drilling program is planned to commence once the wildfire has been contained, which is anticipated to occur in late Summer.</p><p>The Company still awaits receipt of a drill permit for its nearby Erickson Ridge project.</p><p>Extreme hot and dry conditions throughout the month of June lead to a very high forest fire danger in the area. Safety is our top priority and we look forward to returning to the project once the fire has been contained and the area closure has been lifted. We are pleased with the exploration progress to date and are hopeful that fire crews will be able to stop the spread of the main Dixie Fire westward into the community of Dixie and that no structures will be affected.</p><p>About Gold Lion Resources Inc.</p><p>Gold Lion Resources Inc. is a mineral exploration company actively involved in the exploration of its precious metal focused portfolio including the South Orogrande, Erikson Ridge, Robber Gulch, Cuteye and the Fairview Properties located in Idaho and British Columbia.

(the \"Company\" or \"Rockland\") (CSE:RKL) is pleased to report that the Company has restarted its initial 2,500 metre drill program at the Cole Gold Mines Property, Red Lake Mining Division, Ontario. Rockland's program will test the historical gold resource and potential extensions of the mineralization down-dip and west of the Cole underground workings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The drilling program was temporarily suspended on July 12, 2021 due to the extreme forest fire activity in the Red Lake District. The current restart follows the lifting of an emergency order on August 18, 2021 that allowed for the resumption of exploration activities.</p><p>Rockland's CEO, Mike England stated \"It is great to have the drill turning again on our highly anticipated diamond drilling program at the Cole Gold Mines Property. This Property, located at the west end of the prolific Red Lake Greenstone belt, has only recently become accessible for exploration after the expiry of the Cole patents. Rockland's program is the first drilling campaign on the Cole Gold Mines Property since 1972\".</p><p>Approximately 12 drill holes are planned for the initial program. In addition to testing gold mineralized veins that were developed by underground workings in the 1930s, several drill holes will target a newly recognized east-west trending magnetic low that is associated with known mineralization west of the Cole shaft. In addition, the Company has initiated overburden stripping in preparation for channel sampling on surface showings that expose mineralized quartz veins and associated shear zones.</p><p>Garry Clark, P.Geo, a qualified person under National Instrument 43-101, is the qualified person responsible for reviewing and approving the geological contents of this news release as they pertain to the Cole Gold Mines Property.</p><p>About the Cole Gold Mines Property</p><p>Rockland Resources Ltd. is acquiring a 100-per-cent interest in the Cole Gold Mines Property, located in Ball township, Red Lake Mining Divison, Ontario. The Property consists of 28 mining claims (568 ha) located 30 km west of the Cochenour, Campbell, Red Lake mine complex owned and operated by Evolution Mining. The Property represents a rare opportunity to explore a strategically located asset in one of the most active, prolific producing mining districts in Canada. The property hosts high-grade gold values in a classic Red Lake-type quartz vein and silica-sulphide replacement zones.</p><p>About Rockland Resources Ltd.</p><p>Rockland Resources is engaged in the business of mineral exploration and the acquisition of mineral property assets in Canada. Its objective is to locate and develop economic precious and base metal properties of merit and to conduct its exploration program on the properties. In addition to the Cole Gold Property, Rockland is exploring the Summit Old Timer Property that consists of three (3) mineral claims covering an area of 1,915 hectares located approximately 17 km southeast of the City of Nelson, within the Nelson Mining Division, British Columbia.</p><p>On Behalf of the Board of Directors</p><p>Richard Sutcliffe<br/>President and Director</p><p>For further information, please contact:</p><p>Mike England<br/>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mike@engcom.ca\">mike@engcom.ca</email></p><p>Neither the Canadian Stock Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</p><p>FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: This news release contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or future performance and reflect management's current expectations and assumptions.

And it\u2019s free.</p><p>Continued on A14 Continued from A12 \u201cLoretta Taylor and I would hang out in my little Fiat, and she\u2019d play flute and I\u2019d play guitar and we\u2019d sing. But I didn\u2019t do anything seriously for a few years. High school ends, people graduate and scatter, off you go your separate ways. I went to University for a while. I worked a bunch of different jobs. I always had an old Framus acoustic guitar gathering dust in the corner of whatever apartment I was in, and I had gotten rid of all my electric amplified equipment \u2026 which was a BIG mistake, given how bloody expensive all that stuff is now on the collector\u2019s market!\u201d Along came an intermediate period in Jamie\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cI worked as a commercial fisherman. I worked on a ski hill. I worked out at Fort Steele. I was drifting. I didn\u2019t have any connections with the local music community. And then in 1972 I found work in Calgary for a ski company, and I met some musicians. They invited me to come around to their rehearsal space and jam with them. That\u2019s when we formed the band Axis, and I was back in the game, and now I was in a big city scene!\u201d At long last Jamie was now digging into extensive regional touring to sizeable audiences.</p><p>\u201cAxis was a traveling band who played endless strings of one-nighter gigs up and down and all across pretty much anywhere in Alberta that had a cabaret or a community hall.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before the hectic pace of roadwork swept Jamie away along the highways and byways of Canada.</p><p>\u201cThings were going well for Axis, but I was growing restless. I wanted to play different material than the other guys. And then some musical friends from back home in Kimberley reached out to me and asked me to join their reconstituted band, so before I knew it, Tennyson Finch was born. I moved back to Cranbrook and we spent three months in rigorous in-depth rehearsals before we hit the road \u2014 and we were on the road until 1976! We travelled everywhere \u2014 from Victoria out to Thunder Bay and back.</p><p>\u201cWe toured in a trusty 54-passenger school bus that we converted into the Ultimate Tour Vehicle:comfy bunk beds, a secure area to store our gear. It was the era of Zoot Suits. We had to wear big chunky platform heels and cut our hair like David Cassidy ...our agent in Saskatoon insisted it\u2019d be far easier for us to land gigs if we got with that program.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019d just tour, tour, tour, and Tennyson Finch finally ground to a halt primarily because I became burned out. My voice was wearing out. Nodes were forming on my vocal cords. And so I stepped away from music for quite a long time.</p><p>\u201cMy focus then went to other priorities. I went to University. I started working in the Emergency Department at the hospital. And then I ended up moving north to Fort Mac-Murray in the mid-1980s. But it was there that I met my Muse-my dear wife Jean, who\u2019s always been so supportive with all that I do.\u201d</p><p>It was then that the talents of Jamie Neve that we know and love ignited for real.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2014 I had written songs when I was younger, but it never bore fruit. One of the reasons I left Tennyson Finch was that most of the others didn\u2019t want to do original material. They were only interested in making money playing Top-40 cover tunes on the cabaret circuit. But once I got to Fort Mac, I started songwriting in earnest.\u201d</p><p>And once again the siren song of the Rocky Mountains drew Jamie home.</p><p>\u201cI eventually moved back to the Kootenays and immediately ran into old friends and bandmates-like bass wizard Dave Birch, who had played with me in Tennyson Finch. He and I started playing together and we began working on this growing heap of songs I\u2019d written-and it took off for real. We played as a duo for a while. I had a full-time job and a growing family, but there was always time for music. And then I reconnected with Rob Young out in Calgary, who was also a Tennyson Finch veteran \u2014 he wanted to join forces with us.</p><p>\u201cSo the three of us formed a solid trio and talked about recording an official album. Marty Musser was a drummer who\u2019d played in various bands with both Rob and Dave, so we persuaded him to join us, 60 Hertz was born, and we recorded the Time Stands Still album!\u201d 60 Hertz was well-liked locally for its roots-rock approach live and on record, reminiscent of Buffalo Springfield and Blue Rodeo.</p><p>\u201cLike all good things, 60 Hertz came to an end after playing around for a good six years or more. From there I went back to playing as a solo performer in and around the Kootenays. And then (drummer) Brian Hamilton and (keyboardist) Rick Parsons asked if I wanted to form a new band with them. I was keen on playing non-standard cover tunes which weren\u2019t worn-out classic rock songs you\u2019ve heard a thousand times and it wasn\u2019t a hard sell at all! Away we went, and we played together for five good years before Rick sadly passed away too soon. Brian and I were never able to replace Rick, but how could we? Rick was a unique talent all his own.\u201d</p><p>In and around all this endless musical activity, Neve also found the time to involve himself with the Fisher Peak Performing Artists Society (FPPAS), the Cranbrook-based non-profit organization whose tireless work has brought the Cranbrook community such established perennial live-concert events as SummerSounds, the Winter Ale Series, and the Peak Music Festival. Impressive work for someone who only has 24 hours in a day and seven days in a week.</p><p>\u201cThen I ran into Randy Marchi, who\u2019d already had a globetrotting career performing with the Incredible Laughing Band and Sensation. He was one of the few people around here who\u2019d truly been a fulltime professional musician. We started chatting about music, and before I knew it, we\u2019d recruited a squad of likeminded talent and formed Brass Monkey \u2014 which is still active today.</p><p>Brian and I still perform as a duo, using sequences and such to fill Rick\u2019s absence as best as possible. And I keep performing the occasional solo show, which allows me to showcase other songs I wouldn\u2019t normally perform in a full band and do my Dylanesque /Neil Young-sounding material.</p><p>\u201cLife is full. Life is rich.</p><p>Never a dull moment.

(the \"Company\" or \"Rockland\") is pleased to report that the Company has restarted its initial 2,500 metre drill program at the Cole Gold Mines Property, Red Lake Mining Division, Ontario. Rockland's program will test the historical gold resource and potential extensions of the mineralization down-dip and west of the Cole underground workings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The drilling program was temporarily suspended on July 12, 2021 due to the extreme forest fire activity in the Red Lake District. The current restart follows the lifting of an emergency order on August 18, 2021 that allowed for the resumption of exploration activities.</p><p>Rockland's CEO, Mike England stated \"It is great to have the drill turning again on our highly anticipated diamond drilling program at the Cole Gold Mines Property. This Property, located at the west end of the prolific Red Lake Greenstone belt, has only recently become accessible for exploration after the expiry of the Cole patents. Rockland's program is the first drilling campaign on the Cole Gold Mines Property since 1972\".</p><p>Approximately 12 drill holes are planned for the initial program. In addition to testing gold mineralized veins that were developed by underground workings in the 1930s, several drill holes will target a newly recognized east-west trending magnetic low that is associated with known mineralization west of the Cole shaft. In addition, the Company has initiated overburden stripping in preparation for channel sampling on surface showings that expose mineralized quartz veins and associated shear zones.</p><p>Garry Clark, P.Geo, a qualified person under National Instrument 43-101, is the qualified person responsible for reviewing and approving the geological contents of this news release as they pertain to the Cole Gold Mines Property.</p><p>About the Cole Gold Mines Property</p><p>Rockland Resources Ltd. is acquiring a 100-per-cent interest in the Cole Gold Mines Property, located in Ball township, Red Lake Mining Divison, Ontario. The Property consists of 28 mining claims (568 ha) located 30 km west of the Cochenour, Campbell, Red Lake mine complex owned and operated by Evolution Mining. The Property represents a rare opportunity to explore a strategically located asset in one of the most active, prolific producing mining districts in Canada. The property hosts high-grade gold values in a classic Red Lake-type quartz vein and silica-sulphide replacement zones.</p><p>About Rockland Resources Ltd.</p><p>Rockland Resources is engaged in the business of mineral exploration and the acquisition of mineral property assets in Canada. Its objective is to locate and develop economic precious and base metal properties of merit and to conduct its exploration program on the properties. In addition to the Cole Gold Property, Rockland is exploring the Summit Old Timer Property that consists of three (3) mineral claims covering an area of 1,915 hectares located approximately 17 km southeast of the City of Nelson, within the Nelson Mining Division, British Columbia.</p><p>On Behalf of the Board of Directors</p><p>Richard Sutcliffe President and Director</p><p>For further information, please contact:</p><p>Mike England Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mike@engcom.ca\">mike@engcom.ca</email></p><p>Neither the Canadian Stock Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</p><p>FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: This news release contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or future performance and reflect management's current expectations and assumptions.

We were lucky the trail is reasonably well travelled and someone spotted it and called it in,\" Owens said.</p><p>The fire, which Owens said is human-caused, was burning beside the creek then up a 35-foot embankment. At the top of the embankment a heavily forested area approximately 20 feet by 50 feet was on fire.</p><p>\"The fire had started down low and shot up the face of this cliff. If you're not on the trail or in the creek, it's pretty challenging terrain. It was a challenge to get water there.</p><p>\"It did consume a fair amount of space in there.\"</p><p>The PAFD duty crew attended, and the night shift was called in early to help put out the blaze.

What is happening at the moment is a shambles and unacceptable to anyone with any love for this community. Monster garages with suites on lot lines, ugly development crowding Hot Springs Road, illegal secondary suites in the R1, single family zone, flooding and traffic chaos. These are all symptoms of a sick planning regime.</p><p>The problem could be lousy bylaws or bad administration. Perhaps both. It has to stop. I have 40 years of experience dealing with zoning bylaws and OCP bylaws throughout the Fraser Valley. I know how to fix and properly administer Harrison's bylaws . I will do so promptly in conjunction with elected councillors. My second priority is to mitigate the interface forest fire hazard. Prevention and good response planning will be followed by real progress on the Northern evacuation route. Handing this off to Kent hasn't worked. We need to take control and get it done. Instead of more committee meetings and consultants, we'll send a machine (probably an excavator) down the old forestry road through Sasquatch Park, the route I've been advocating for about 30 years. We'll then see what's needed to open it up for northward evacuation access to Hwy #7. Maybe not much, as the road bed is still intact, just overgrown.</p><p>John Buckley (Council): Sustainability and accessibility.</p><p>1. Development has to be managed so the villages growth systems and infrastructure can maintain both the residents and the tourists who visit our beautiful village. As our population ages it is important to ensure that all public spaces remain accessible and usable for all residents.</p><p>Accessibility is also important for tourism, as there is a clear trend to ensuring destinations can be accessed by all.</p><p>To that end, I support the new visitor information centre which is striving to obtain the Rick Hansen Gold Standard of accessibility.</p><p>2. Support local businesses. It's because of them that our property taxes remain significantly lower than otherwise might be. As an official resort community, we receive provincial government resort municipality initiative (RMI) funds which amount to millions of dollars, paying for infrastructure and amenities along the waterfront and throughout our village that we could otherwise not afford.</p><p>Leo Facio (Council, incumbent Mayor): My two highest priorities for the village are to be sustainable, also have more communication with the public and work on the emergency route.</p><p>Leslie Ghezesan (Council): To check where our tax money vanished as from 2018 went up $200 to $1,200 put this money to work for us.</p><p>Allan Jackson (Council): To ensure the Village remains economically sustainable. To ensure the right and concerns of the taxpayers are protected and heard.</p><p>Samantha Piper (Mayor, incumbent Council): I still have a lot of work I wish to continue with Council. The two highest priorities initially are a Service Capacity Review (SCR) and the second is Relationship Building. An SCR will take a deep dive into sustainable service delivery. The scope of works will include a look inward and outward of the municipality's procedures and overall framework; the purpose and goal will be to establish sustainable efficiencies, long-term strategies, community needs, and future service planning for the betterment of the community as a whole. The SCR process will require time.</p><p>If developed systematically, it will ensure a comprehensive review is generated, resulting in purpose-driven governance, municipal efficiencies, and overall community well-being. Relationship building is critically important. Council not only represents the village while at the council table but also while advocating for the village in other settings. Relationships and partnerships are what will continue to move our community forward. Joint-effort projects; regional initiatives; community to community resourcefulness; government to government ingenuity. By working collaboratively, much more can be achieved with the outcome of mutual benefits.</p><p>Michie Vidal (incumbent Council): 1. Housing needs are evolving. We are experiencing rapid growth, changing demographics and council must adapt. New residents and younger families re-vitalize our community and we must listen to their needs. Many of our seniors who have called Harrison home for many years are now considering downsizing and want to remain close to family and friends. We must find solutions and provide attainable housing for all ages. This can include incentives in partnership with programs provided by provincial and federal governments. We must continue to enhance our community where residents, businesses and visitors are provided with housing, amenities, infrastructure and programs to ensure a vibrant and thriving village.</p><p>2. We must continue to support the recommendations in our adopted Active Transportation Plan, Lagoon Master Plan, Parking Master Plan and our future Urban Forest Master Plan. These provide the justification when grant applications are submitted, and if awarded, provide upgrades and additions for the benefit of our community as a whole. Council has kept property taxes to modest increases. Grants provide the needed funding to ensure we have an active and safe community without the burden of substantial tax increases.</p><p>Ed Wood (Mayor): Build community spirit. Form committees and allow informal conversations by the public in village business, engage, listen, learn, and build. Quality of privacy in our homes. Ensure the draft OCP that allows for duplexes and coach houses to be built on presently zoned single home lots is not permitted.</p><p>What have you done to prepare for this position?</p><p>Allen: Harrison's new Mayor needs to hit the ground running, rather than spending the first year learning about ongoing issues which are in front of council. I'll be ready to do this job from day one as I have attended almost all council meetings for the past four years, even the early-morning specials. My attendance record in the past two years is almost 100%. I have often been the only one in the audience. I have asked questions and filed FOI requests to get clarity on issues which are unclear. When permitted, such as at public hearings, I have tried to contribute my expertise and knowledge of the Village.</p><p>For the past 45 years, I have taken an interest in all Village matters and thus have accumulated a knowledge base which is unique. Outside of Harrison, I have led many organisations and run many meetings which has given me a set of management skills which are directly applicable to being an effective Mayor and Chief Executive Officer. I've had a lifetime of successful business dealings. I've led and built several organisations which has afforded me an opportunity to learn how to build community engagement. Serving four terms as Harrison Mayor and several as councillor has taught me how municipal government works. I am the only mayoral candidate with any actual Mayoral or private-sector, \" real world\" business experience.</p><p>Buckley: The first thing I did was print out and deliver detailed brochures with my contact information introducing myself to the residents of Harrison who did not already know me. It outlined my past civic achievements and appointments during the past two terms I served as village councillor from 2011-2018. It also spoke of who I am, what I believe and what my intentions are going forward if elected. I believe it is very important for voters to know who their candidates are and what they stand for.</p><p>Facio: I have prepared by canvasing the village with printed cards, signage, media TV interview, attended the all candidates and a facebook video.</p><p>Ghezesan: Actively participated on the council meetings from 2011 up to 2018.</p><p>Jackson: With my 9years of experience as a previous councillor, my education and my keen interest in the Village of Harrison Hot Springs I am totally prepared.</p><p>Piper: My preparation for the position of Mayor has been extensive and wrapped with dedication and anticipation for the future. An essential factor in enhancing my leadership abilities is education. I have completed various certificates, diplomas, and training that primarily focus on local government or business. In doing so, I have built a deep knowledge of municipal government, its processes, and its framework. My elected official and career experience in local government also brings insight and understanding to the council table. My natural leadership skills, vision, ethical choices and behaviour, community devotion, compassion, empathy, and creativity are who I am. I value relationships, effective communication, accountability, and team. Through emotional intelligence, I navigate various situations with grace and understanding while maintaining professionalism.</p><p>Vidal: My dedication to continuous learning is one of my strengths. Gaining a knowledge base on the roles and responsibilities of Council is necessary. My current term on Council has provided me the opportunity to gain an understanding of the Executive powers which Council is granted. Familiarizing myself with legislation which Council falls under such as the Community Charter, and the Local Government Act provided the necessary understanding of the roles, responsibilities and jurisdiction of Council, Village staff, Provincial, Federal and First Nations governments. One of my Council liaison portfolios is participation in the Agassiz/Harrison Healthy Communities. Along with other community organizations, we collectively share and discuss innovative and creative solutions to address the needs of all ages within our two jurisdictions.</p><p>As 2nd Vice President of the Lower Mainland Local Government Association, I have expanded my understanding of the needs of Local Governments from Pemberton to Boston Bar, championing these regional needs with the Provincial Government.</p><p>However, most importantly, my term on Council has provided me the opportunity to listen and hear our residents and businesses concerns and bring these to the Council table. Being a member of Council is a combination of the ability to understand concerns of the community, in some cases lead and in other cases listen. Experience teaches you to know the difference.</p><p>Wood: My commitment to you as your mayoralty candidate was and is to go knocking on doors in the village, true one on one engagement. The passion I have seen and heard is what motivates me to be your full-time mayor.</p><p>I believe in quality versus quantity, the bonds that have been made, the concerns, and the questions have given me the drive for change.</p><p>It is my commitment to you that I will do everything in my power to open the community up and truly listen, learn, and build.Door to door petition to stop the selling of the overflow parking lands/civic hall.Lobbied Brad Vis / Laurie Throness, meeting in person, to stop selling of overflow parking lands/civic hallPhone conversations with the provincial deputy attorney General regarding grant applications.Volunteered my time to assist the village during the onset of the COVID crisis.Member of the Search and Rescue, short duration.Strong advocate to upgrade and maintain our infrastructure, ie Threat of flooding due to our substandard dike. Drinking Water Plant/Source/Wastewater Treatment Plant.2014 Harrison Hot Springs councillor candidate</p><p>Leadership is about listening, learning, engaging, directing, and building community spirit. I would allow true public participation in the 'village\" business. Presently if a member of the public has a concern, and they attend a council meeting, they can only ask questions of the elected official \"after\" they have already made their minds and voted on the matter. It makes absolutely No sense to not allow questions or make comments \"before\" council makes their decisions.</p><p>If elected, what steps would you take to ensure Harrison is safe from the threat of wildfires?</p><p>Allen: Job one will be to revisit the interface fire hazard assessment report and correct the erroneous wind pattern data. That report is based on the fallacy that the Harrison summer winds blow from north to south. They don't . They actually blow from south to north. So that report needs to be corrected and re-written. I expect the corrected report will state that our major threat is a forest fire in the East Sector. We will start to mitigate that by re-opening Quarry Road so that we can get vehicles back in there to fight fires. We will then remove the accumulated fuel from the village's 73 acres along McComb Drive and limb-up the trees. The same process will be carried out at Firehall Park and other village-owned woodland. Longer term, creating a community forest ( Harrison Forest Park) will allow us to manage the whole 400 acres east of McComb Drive to reduce the fire hazard. I will ensure that our fire department is equipped to deal with woodland fires and is not confined to the blacktop only. Land-owners will be encouraged to manage their lands to reduce the interface fire risk. Bylaws may be required.</p><p>Buckley: After speaking with Harrison's fire chief, I was informed Harrison firefighters are structural firefighters, who have been trained in fighting 'outside' fires such as houses, buildings, hotels.etc. Members are currently taking interface training. This type of training teaches them how to respond, react to and fight wildfires along mountains and forested areas. I would also continue promoting public education on the dangers of outdoor fires such as campfires, fireworks, etc, as well as to further our OCP's fire corridor requirements.</p><p>Facio: We completed a FireSmart plan with a consultant and the fire department in 2017, this has been put into our new OCP, new homes will be expected to have new FireSmart materials and landscaping.</p><p>Ghezesan: (no answer provided)</p><p>Jackson: The fire department and the village must come up with a \"good old fashioned Fire Drill\" this must be related to the residents via an \"Alert System.\"</p><p>Piper: A healthy tree canopy in the community will positively affect our local environment and climate. It starts with the Urban Forest Management Plan. In this plan, I anticipate we will have a better understanding of what we have, what we should have and where we should have trees. We all play a role in the safety of our community, and that starts at home. Initiatives preventing wildfire devastation can be developed through the proven practices of FireSmart. Although our community is a designated FireSmart community, I see the development of a FireSmart/Public Safety Committee beneficial to building initiatives and educational opportunities with a lens on residential areas. The importance of having an alternative route for the safety of our residents and visitors, primarily due to the prolonged dry seasons and longer wet seasons, is necessary.</p><p>Relationship-building will be essential while continuing to advocate with neighbouring communities for a secondary emergency route. Although the identified route is outside our community boundary, we can continue to champion the need to the provincial government. Our local fire department is full of undeniable expertise and passion. Ensuring the fire department has the resources, equipment and training required to do their job safely and effectively is essential to our overall community safety. I will always prioritize this area of the budget as crucial.</p><p>Vidal: In 2019, our village was awarded the BC FireSmart Community Protection Achievement award. This was in recognition of the steps taken to mitigate the danger of fires. Council can use standards that aid in helping to protect our homes. Land Use planning and development must include initiatives including design, construction materials and landscaping which support resiliency and protection to our homes and infrastructure. Our council, land use planners, neighbors and First Nations all need to work together. We all recognize that being FireSmart is a shared responsibility between Council and homeowners, and I encourage everyone to visit the BC FireSmart webpage for great information and recommendations. Many communities have adopted a Community Wildfire Protection Plan which helps to prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from wildfires, especially in our Interface Wildfire Development Permit Area. I support our village developing a similar policy.</p><p>Wood: Due to our rapid development, high density, it is not only wild fires but fires period. We need to train our fire fighters to handle all fire situations. I would work with the fire department to assist them with their needs, training and equipment. An evacuation route is a must, we can't rely on just Hot Springs Road. We must work with the District of Kent, which employs our joint emergency co Ordinator, the position has been vacated, and has been recently posted. I would ensure the OCP includes the \"wildfire zone\" in all future development projects.</p><p>During the past few years, there have been gaps in meetings being recorded or broadcast online. This has created some questions of transparency. Do you support additional efforts to broadcast and record meetings? Why or why not?</p><p>Allen: \"Additional efforts\" is not nearly good enough. As Mayor and CEO I will ensure that ALL public council meetings are recorded and broadcast on Zoom or other media. There is no valid excuse for not doing so. We have spent thousands of dollars on the equipment. We know it works well. We just have to turn it on.</p><p>I will ensure that all issues which should be dealt with in public are actually dealt with in public. There will be no more use of \" in-camera\" ( secret) meetings to hide issues from the public if they have a right to observe those discussions. For the past fourteen years, I have campaigned for \"open, honest government\". That's what I will deliver to Harrison residents. Your civic rights matter and will be respected by me.</p><p>Buckley: Yes, of course I would support increased transparency of recorded meetings as per what the community charter allows.</p><p>I campaigned on wanting to create more transparency between residents and the village in our day to day operations.</p><p>Facio: We did put in additional recording both in the village chambers and when the pandemic arrived we moved to the memorial hall where the ability for Zoom was installed, due to some conflict with the festival off the arts the recording will continue after the counsel has been asked to change their meeting date.</p><p>Ghezesan: We have to make it mandatory recordings evry meeting and broadcast them; we improving our transparency.</p><p>Jackson: I feel only items that should be discussed \"in camera\" are Legal, Land, and Labour\". everything should be discussed in a public forum and recorded.</p><p>Piper: I full-heartedly support consistent broadcasting and recordings of council meetings. At the start of my second term, I spoke in favour of recording meetings; we as council discussed options and logistics that resulted in the start of the video recordings that we see today. I also supported utilizing Zoom as a platform for residents to attend meetings. Yes, of course there was a learning curve, the pandemic restrictions, summer events, and technical difficulties which we all genuinely tried to navigate to the best of our abilities. The recordings and Zoom access are good for those unable to attend a face-to-face meeting. Not everyone in our community is available at the same time of day therefore providing access options for council meetings is an inclusive approach. Still, it also assists with showing processes, spreading knowledge on local projects/initiatives and business of council, as well as provides ease of access to council meetings. Can we do better? Probably, and if we can, we should; however, we need to remember additional equipment and technical support come with a cost that must be considered with budget and we need to be open to hearing what is and is not working for the community.</p><p>In my opinion, concepts of secret meetings, lack of notification, meetings without minutes, and changing to an organic approach for meeting structure are theories based on perceptions. The reality is the business of council is heavily legislated through the Community Charter. The strong language of \"Must\" when referring to the business of council is outlined in the legislation. Council must conduct public meetings, must have a Procedure Bylaw (rules of procedure for meetings of council), and must be recorded (minutes) to mention just a few of the requirements. I admit, the processes can be frustrating or confusing at times, partly due to the pace however, adhering to legislation is a necessity. The remarkable thing about municipal government is how reachable it is because it is local; residents have access to its front door and elected officials. There are many other ways government can be malleable and avoid barriers and I see those being reviewed in my plans for a Service Capacity Review (SCR).</p><p>Vidal: Prior to the pandemic, video recording equipment was installed in Council Chambers which allowed residents to view Council meetings on You Tube. During the early stages of the Covid pandemic, Council meetings were moved to Memorial Hall providing a larger space for physical distancing requirements. Video recording equipment was re-located, and once Public Health Orders mandated no public attendance at Council meetings, live streaming via Zoom Conferencing was introduced, allowing full participation for residents. In support of tourism recovery, and to accommodate the return of our numerous festivals and events, Council meetings returned to Council chambers at the Village office during the summer months. Council meetings have now returned to the Memorial Hall with full video recordings and Zoom Conferencing capabilities.</p><p>Wood: All council meetings must be at minimum recorded and available to the public, my preference would be to include zoom so the public can feel free to ask questions.</p><p>With the pandemic's effects on tourism, do you think Harrison can still continue to survive on tourism alone?</p><p>Allen: Tourism is Harrison's only industry, but it is no longer the dominant source of tax revenue it once was. The reality is that Harrison has fallen behind as a BC destination resort and our tourism industry is now foolishly focussed on day-trippers rather than overnight stays. This is unsustainable. We cannot grow a viable business sector on ice cream and beach BBQs.</p><p>We need \"heads in beds\" and overnight visitors who spend money in restaurants and shops while here. A serious discussion about our future economy needs to be part of the OCP review which I will initiate. My professional qualifications and extensive background in BC tourism will serve to find ways to enhance real tourism in the Village. If we can't do that, I fear that we are destined to be a retirement/bedroom community with a small tourism area swamped with day trippers. We must, and can, do better.</p><p>Buckley: After speaking with Tourism Harrison, I was informed that while the pandemic did have a significant impact, the residents did their best to support local businesses.</p><p>This past summer showed a fabulous return of visitors with hotels operating at near capacity. With the ongoing support of Tourism Harrison, Tourism can and will be the economic engine for Harrison and the greater region.</p><p>Facio: In 2021 tourism started to make a comeback and I believe this year in 2022 the tourism industry has had a tremendous rebound, with the additional extension of the region which includes Agassiz and Harrison Mills I believe tourism will get stronger.</p><p>Ghezesan: Too much is spent on tourism. Harrison is old enough to be advertised.</p><p>Jackson: Tourism is vital to the economic health of to all our various businesses, and generates income to the Village through Pay Parking, and the Resort Municipal Tax which has brought in over 8 million dollars since 2007.</p><p>Piper: Yes, I believe we can, partly due to our location. Harrison has much to offer with our breathtaking environment, experiences, area history, the dedicated business community, and recreational opportunities. At the same time, we should remain open to new and innovative ideas while being acutely aware of the change in consumer expectations. Due to technology and the push forward from the pandemic, home-based and small businesses continue to grow. It is critical to continually think big picture, build relationships, and monitor the ever-changing economic landscape through the lens of what it means for our community. The RMI funding for the community is a lifeline.</p><p>Continuing to work with the Provincial Government and advocating for the continuance of the RMI funding is crucial for our community. This funding enables tourism-based infrastructure improvements that create experiences for visitors to enjoy, encourage return trips, and residents, in turn, enjoy the same improvements. Having year-round events, festivals, and infrastructure that supports all-season activities is essential. Building upon the relationship with the Sts'ailes people and local Indigenous communities, local businesses, groups, associations, societies, Tourism Harrison, and the Harrison Agassiz Chamber of Commerce will ensure that the hard work and dedication for local events is supported by residents and visitors alike, resulting in drawing in customers for our local businesses. Attracting and retaining employees locally is essential for the success and sustainability of our local businesses. Putting our heads together to develop sustainable strategies that include affordable housing for workers is an absolute must. I see this work launching through committee work, meaningful engagement, and collaboration.</p><p>Vidal: Our visitors are returning to Harrison, tourism is recovering and remains the economic drive of our community. Travel restrictions have eased, and we have seen a substantial return and an increase in our tourism numbers from local, provincial and international visitors. Tourism is our main economy, and we must continue to promote our Village as a year-round destination. Steps have been taken in this direction including our Lights on the Lake winter display and the construction of the eco-friendly artificial outdoor skating rink which will re-open later this fall. Supporting these initiatives and finding other innovated and creative ideas will help to ensure our tourism industry continues to thrive and grow.</p><p>Wood: I believe with Smart development, including: green space, visual appearance, storm water management, tree buffer zone, energy efficiency (LEED), carbon footprint. The development on Hot Springs Road, Terra estates, is an example of how broken the village is, we need real change at the leadership level, before we scare all the people away.</p><p>Read the full Q&amp;A session online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.agassizharrisonobserver.com\">www.agassizharrisonobserver.com</url>.</p><p>Copyright 2022 Agassiz-Harrison Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGAHRO-news20221007PAC4381595</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGAHRO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66JR-GPX1-F0HF-83X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4513\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

On February 15, Canada signed a $108 million contract with Parsons Inc. for construction management and two years of care and maintenance on the Faro mine site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Parsons, one of the largest players in remediation in the world, boasts that their \"contract could span over 20 years and exceed $2 billion.\"</p><p>The numbers boggle the mind, says Lewis Rifkind of the Yukon Conservation Society. Afterall, $2.2 billion is the total 15-year federal allocation for the northern abandoned mines program designed for eight mines in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. Faro is just one, and the federal contract does not include the Vangorda plateau portion of the Faro site, which was sold separately for future and concurrent, development and reclamation.</p><p>But still, the numbers keep going up, and the timeline keeps getting extended. Five years ago, the costs were anticipated at $500 million for 10-15 years, and now estimates are for $2 billion over twenty years.</p><p>In addition to the contract awarded to Parsons this week, another contract for $5.8 million was awarded to another company, CH2M Hill Canada Ltd., to design a water treatment plant for the site. According to Treasury Board data, these two contracts are in addition to the total federal spend on the Faro mine site between 2006 to 2021, which amounts to over $600 million.</p><p>Geology drove the creation of the mine, and drives the clean-up. The tailings, which cover an area equivalent to over 26,000 football fields, creates acid-rock drainage, which, if not mitigated, grows worse over time. There are an estimated 70 million tonnes of tailings and 320 million tonnes of waste rocks on the Faro site.</p><p>Once billed as the largest open pit lead-zinc mine in the world, the story of Faro is not a straight, nor smooth line. Faro is a story of zealot prospectors, ambitious and visionary collaborators, and an assortment of wheelers and dealers, aided and abetted by eager politicians.</p><p>They waived a mine and a town into existence essentially in the middle of nowhere, and convinced authorities to build a new hydro dam and improve highways; and for banks and governments to open their wallets with an assortment of loans, loan guarantees and grants \u2014 sometimes referred to as \"other people's money\". A book of the same name documents the rise and fall of one of the Faro mine owners, Dome Petroleum.</p><p>Faro's height of prosperity in the late 1970's was under Dome's tenure and boasted the highest standard of living for the community's 2,500 people. Labourers were paid $25 per hour and the cafeteria served steak and lobster. Those were the heady days of Dome Petroleum.</p><p>But Dome's dealings paled compared to those during the tenure of Curragh Resources under Clifford Frame with his cut-throat, anything-to-save-a-buck approach to mining, that ended with the death of 26 miners at his Westray mine, that also ended his Faro venture.</p><p>Between closures and shut downs, Faro produced ore for around 22 of the 28 years between 1970 and 1998. Community comfort rose and fell with the price of ore. The townsite was carefully planned but burned to the ground in a forest fire in 1968, one year after completion. The town was rebuilt with tiers of stratified housing according to rank (executives on the upper bank) and bunkhouses on the lower bench. It was carefully located distant from Ross River, and kept most of its First Nation employees working in the coal mine adjacent to Carmacks.</p><p>Faro's legacy is Yukon-wide. It created the demand for the Aishihik hydro dam which left the territory with excess hydro capacity for decades, opened the south Klondike highway year-round, left a viable townsite with affordable housing supported by a municipal grant which has left structures in place to house care and maintenance workers into the future.</p><p>But the colonial arrogance of the day is much more apparent now than then. The federal government asserts that remediation and restoration of the land is part of reconciliation efforts with First Nations. Submissions from the Liard First Nation to Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Board show that they are not fully convinced that the standards set for remediation are high enough.</p><p>Parsons is now managing two of the world's largest mine closure and reclamation projects, the Giant Mine in Northwest Territories, and now the Faro Mine Remediation Project, both of which rank in the top five on Canada's most contaminated sites list.</p><p>Rifkind says that without mining there would be no reclamation industry, likening it to an altered form of Naomi Klien's concept of disaster capitalism \u2014 companies that specialize in doing massive environmental cleanup after massive mining operations leave a mess.</p><p>That said, and apart from the enormous amount of greenhouse gas emissions that will be released as part of this project, and ignoring the amount of lime that will be required, Rifkind says that Parsons would be his choice of company to undertake the project as well.</p><p>\"We're thankful that something is actually happening. At least they are doing something\" he says.</p><p>And for First Nations, the reclamation pill is harder to swallow. Never settled and never ceded, the Liard First Nation and the Ross River Dene Council have witnessed the slow and cumulative destruction of animal habitat, and the erosion of their wilderness of clean rivers and lakes.</p><p>\"The legacy of harm is both physical and emotional,\" said Chief Jack Caesar of the Ross River Dena Council.

The Yukon Riverside Arts Festival featured exhibits and events scattered throughout town over Friday, Saturday and Sunday. There were golf and fastball tournaments, and a horticultural exhibition on Saturday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The events kicked off on Thursday afternoon with the Authors on Eighth walking tour, organized by the Klondike Visitors Association. Winners of the Authors on Eighth writing contest were announced at the event. Dawson resident Lulu Keating received the prize for her short story \"Across the Slide.\" The poetry winner was Kaitlyn Lonee for her submission, \"The Ballad of Mad Maggie,\" while E.T. Thorbeng received the under 16 prize for \"Middle of the Pack.\"</p><p>The opening of the Dawson City Museum's new exhibition halls was postponed again, due to a delay of installation of some exhibit lighting, but a sneak preview revealed what is going to be spectacular displays of the museum collection. The new exhibits on the main floor address the history of the Dawson region up to the end of the nineteenth century, while the second-floor galleries focus on important subjects from the twentieth century. Community figures are profiled in each exhibit and First Nation history features more prominently than before. This exhibit has been in the planning for several years, and a more complete review of the exhibit should follow the opening later this year.</p><p>Each day during the weekend, well-known Yukon poet, KJ Munro, took visitors on Hiku walks through the streets of Dawson, ending at Jack London Square, where participants were encouraged to share any creative works inspired by the walk.</p><p>One of the highlights of the Friday line-up was the evening event, \"Words Out Loud,\" readings and musical performances, sponsored by Yukon Words Society in partnership with the Dawson Print and Publishing Festival. Featured were Dawsonites Kylie van Every, who shared several stories told by Tr'ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebchin elders, Mary Fraughton, who read several poems, including some reflecting complex family relationships, and Charles Atlas Sheppard, who shared his short story about morel mushroom picking near Dawson. West Dawsonite banjo-plucking and guitar-picking Mo Knight sang several of her own compositions. The socially distanced audience responded enthusiastically to all the performers.</p><p>The parade commenced at noon on Saturday, following a route designed to circumvent construction at the south end of Fifth Avenue. The procession was led by a highland pipe band, followed by members of the Yukon Order of Pioneers, Pioneer Women, restored antique automobiles, children on bicycles, floats, RCMP in red serge, a clown riding a penny farthing bicycle, and the Dawson Fire Department's fleet of new and restored vehicles. Horn blasts from their modern fire engines were loud enough to be heard all the way to Bear Creek.</p><p>Commissioner Ang\u00e9lique Bernard hosted a free picnic at the Commissioner's Residence in the afternoon. The picnic was an alternative to the Commissioner's tea and ball which were cancelled due to COVID-19. Complimentary box lunches were handed out. Several parties signed up to play croquet and bocce on the lawn under sunny blue skies. Story Laureate Michael Gates gave a short reading, followed by special guided tours inside the mansion.</p><p>In another event sponsored by the Print &amp; Publishing Festival, Author Ivan Coyote launched their new book 'Care of' at the Palace Grand Theatre. The event was hosted and opened with a short performance given by Toronto-based performer, Becky Johnson.</p><p>By all accounts, the Discovery Day weekend was the first event of the past two summers to see a return of visitors to Dawson in significant numbers. Restaurants were busy, and the streets, if not jammed with pedestrians as in normal times, were filled with lively crowds. One businessperson described Dawson streets as desolate back on July 1, while others described the impact of reduced visitation during the pandemic. Another expressed the difficult adjustment to larger crowds after having dealt with small numbers to that point this season and last.</p><p>The forest fire evacuation notice was reduced by wet weather earlier in the week, however, road construction through several sections of the North Klondike Highway between Stewart Crossing and Gravel Lake meant several delays, mud when wet, and dust when dry. Two overturned vehicles in a short stretch of the construction zone were a testament to the hazardous driving conditions. Other than that, Discovery weekend was a lively event welcoming visitors back to Dawson City, and an indication that life may be returning to a semblance of normal.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Yukon News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20210819IYN4201553</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63DF-KJ81-F0HF-824B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"805\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

On a go-forward basis, with the Corrib Natural Gas Project (\"Corrib\") acquisition in Ireland now closed, approximately 40% of our gas is now priced off of European gas benchmarks. * Repurchased 1.6 million common shares for $30 million and declared cash dividends of $16 million , for a total of $46 million returned to shareholders in the quarter. In conjunction with our Q1 2023 release, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, payable on July 17, 2023 to shareholders of record on June 30, 2023 . The base dividend was increased by 25% in Q1 2023, and has increased 67% from Q1 2022 to the current $0.10 per share per quarter. * Q1 2023 production averaged 82,455 boe/d(8) a decrease of 4% from the previous quarter due to unplanned downtime in Australia , partially offset by new well production from our Alberta Deep Basin and Montney assets in Canada . * Q1 2023 Montney drilling program delivered positive results as we continue to optimize the drilling and completion methods. The most recent two (2.0 net) wells drilled on our British Columbia lands were tied-in during the second half of March 2023 and produced at an average IP30 rate of 1,250 boe/d(15) (51% liquids). * On March 31, 2023 we successfully closed the acquisition of an incremental 36.5% interest in Corrib, increasing Vermilion's operated interest to 56.5%. The acquisition adds approximately 7,000 boe/d of premium-priced, high netback, low emission European natural gas production, further strengthening Vermilion's international portfolio. The acquisition makes Vermilion the largest provider of domestic natural gas in Ireland . * Made significant progress on our asset high-grading strategy during Q1 2023 with the closing of the Corrib acquisition and divestment of select non-core assets in southeast Saskatchewan . These asset high-grading initiatives serve to position Vermilion for long-term success by increasing our exposure to premium-priced European gas, redirecting capital to higher rate of return projects, and reducing our operating cost structure and asset retirement obligations.

(15) Initial 30-day production (\"IP30\") for the Company's most recent two (2.0 net) wells drilled on our British Columbia lands averaged 1,250 boe/d per well. IP30 consisted of 49% light and medium crude oil, 2% NGLs, and 49% shale gas, using a conversion of six mcf of gas to one barrel of oil, based on field level estimates for the first 30 full days of production following the tie-in of the well.</p><p>Message to Shareholders</p><p>The first quarter of 2023 was an active quarter for Vermilion, as we executed our winter drilling program in Canada while also closing two strategic transactions to further high-grade our portfolio. We invested $155 million of exploration and development capital during Q1 2023, primarily focused on our winter drilling campaign in Canada, which included drilling and completion activity in Alberta, British Columbia and southeast Saskatchewan. We continue to make significant progress on our Montney development through further optimization of the drilling and completion process. Our most recent two (2.0 net) wells drilled on our British Columbia lands were tied-in during the second half of March 2023 and produced at an average IP30 rate of 1,250 boe/d(1) (51% liquids). In addition, we completed the sale of select southeast Saskatchewan assets during the quarter and closed the acquisition of an incremental 36.5% ownership in the Corrib Natural Gas Project (\"Corrib\") in Ireland. These two transactions, combined with the Mica Montney acquisition completed in 2022, were all part of our asset high-grading strategy, which serves to position Vermilion for long-term success by increasing our exposure to premium-priced European gas, expanding our North American inventory, redirecting capital to higher rate of return projects, and reducing our operating cost structure and asset retirement obligations.</p><p>Production in the first quarter averaged 82,455 boe/d, which included the impact of Australia maintenance downtime as previously reported. We generated $253 million of fund flows from operations (\"FFO\") in Q1 2023, resulting in $98 million of free cash flow (\"FCF\"), which was used to fund our base dividend, share repurchases and acquisitions. Including the dividend and share repurchases, we returned over $46 million of capital to our shareholders. Net debt of $1.37 billion at the end of Q1 2023, represented 0.9 times trailing FFO.</p><p>We will continue to allocate the majority of FCF to debt reduction until we achieve our next net debt target of $1 billion. The majority of the incremental capital return beyond the base dividend will be in the form of share buybacks, as we believe our common shares remain significantly undervalued. To date, we have repurchased 2.2 million common shares in 2023 and 4.6 million in total under our existing NCIB. We plan to renew our NCIB in July 2023 and based on our current pace of share repurchases and base dividend, we anticipate returning 25% to 30% of FCF to shareholders in 2023, depending on commodity prices. Once we achieve our $1 billion debt target we plan to increase our return of capital to shareholders and will communicate the specific targets at that time.</p><p>Over the past two years we have focused on strengthening the balance sheet and high-grading the asset base to position Vermilion for long-term success. We have made significant progress on both of these fronts, and while we will continue to advance these initiatives, we will now place an even greater focus on operational execution throughout our asset base. In Canada, we will continue to develop and grow our strategic Montney position where we are seeing very encouraging results from recently drilled wells. In the United States we will continue to develop and grow our Turner oil play in the Powder River Basin while also testing new prospects across our Wyoming land base, including the Niobrara and Parkman formations. In Europe, we will continue to advance our deep gas exploration and development plans in Germany and new gas development in Croatia. We have a large land base with significant gas resource potential in both Germany and Croatia and we will continue to work with the respective governments in each country to identify opportunities for Vermilion to assist in developing their domestic supply of natural gas.</p><p>Q1 2023 Operations Review</p><p>North America</p><p>Production from our North American operations averaged 60,046 boe/d(2) in Q1 2023, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter primarily due to new production from our Alberta Deep Basin and Montney assets in Canada. In Alberta, we drilled seven (3.1 net), completed ten (6.3 net), and brought on production nine (7.6 net) Mannville liquids rich conventional natural gas wells, while at Mica we drilled six (6.0 net), completed five (5.0 net), and brought on production four (4.0 net) Montney liquids rich shale gas wells. We also completed two small tuck-in acquisitions within our Montney and Alberta Deep Basin assets during the quarter.</p><p>We continue to focus on optimizing the drilling and completion process on our Mica Montney assets and are seeing improved results from new wells. Our most recent two (2.0 net) wells drilled on our British Columbia lands were tied-in during the second half of March 2023 and produced at an average IP30 rate of 1,250 boe/d(1) (51% liquids). We are encouraged by these recent results and we continue to work through the permitting process for the planned 16,000 boe/d battery in British Columbia, which will facilitate the next phase of expansion on our Montney asset. We received one additional permit in Q1 2023 and are confident we will receive the remaining permit required to proceed with the construction of the battery in the near future.</p><p>In Saskatchewan, we drilled three (3.0 net), completed three (3.0 net), and brought on production four (4.0 net) light and medium crude oil wells. In the United States, we drilled five (2.1 net), completed two (0.7 net), and brought on production two (0.7 net) light and medium crude oil wells in Wyoming. All of the wells drilled in the United States were two-mile lateral wells, which are significantly more economic than one-mile laterals. During the quarter we participated in two non-operated Parkman wells and one non-operated Niobrara well, the results from which will enhance our understanding of these formations as it relates to future development prospects on our Powder River Basin acreage in Wyoming. We have a large land base with approximately 15,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin prospective for the Niobrara and the Parkman formations. Our six (5.3 net) well operated Turner drilling program is currently underway with all wells expected to be completed and on-stream by the third quarter.</p><p>International</p><p>Production from our International operations averaged 22,408 boe/d(2) in Q1 2023, a decrease of 17% from the prior quarter, primarily due to unplanned downtime in Australia, which was offline during the first quarter for maintenance. In Europe, production in the Netherlands increased over the prior quarter due to volumes from a new well brought online during the quarter, and production in France was fully restored following forest fire-related downtime in the second half of 2022. A nationwide strike in France affected several of the refineries in France in late March and April; however, the strike has not had any material impact on our operations.</p><p>In Germany, we drilled two (2.0 net), completed three (3.0 net), and brought on production three (3.0 net) light and medium crude oil wells during the quarter. We also continued to advance our deep gas exploration and development plans in Germany as we prepare for our first well to be drilled in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the Netherlands, we completed and brought on production one (0.5 net) conventional natural gas well from our Q4 2022 drilling campaign. We also drilled the first (0.5 net) conventional natural gas well of our two (1.0 net) well 2023 program and commenced drilling of the second (0.5 net) conventional natural gas well late in the quarter. The first well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons, however initial results from the second well look encouraging, with an approximately 10 metre gas column identified. In Australia, maintenance work on the Wandoo platform progressed as planned through the first quarter. To date, we have performed over 95% of the inspections and completed repairs where necessary to ensure we operate with the highest safety standards. Much of the identified repair work resulting from the inspections is preemptive, which we expect to result in higher operational run-rates with less unplanned downtime in the future. In early April, a cyclone entered the region which forced us to evacuate the offshore platform and temporarily halt maintenance operations. While there was no physical damage to the platform, the evacuation occurred during final maintenance work and will now require additional time to reorganize and complete the remaining inspections. As a result, we now anticipate production to remain offline for most of the second quarter.</p><p>Outlook and Guidance Update</p><p>With most of our Canadian assets currently under spring break-up restrictions, our second quarter drilling and completion activity has shifted to the United States. In addition to our Q1 2023 drilling activity, we plan to drill five (4.4 net) wells targeting the Turner Sands and participate in six (1.5 net) wells targeting the Parkman sands and Niobrara shale formations over the remainder of 2023. As noted above, our Australia maintenance program has been extended into late Q2 2023 due to severe cyclone activity in the region. Taking into account the acquisition and divestiture transactions that closed in Q1 2023, the delayed start-up of Australia production and our planned activity in Q2 2023, we expect Q2 2023 production to average 84,000 to 86,000 boe/d. Our 2023 annual production guidance of 82,000 to 86,000 boe/d and capital budget of $570 million remain unchanged.</p><p>Commodity Hedging</p><p>Vermilion hedges to manage commodity price exposures and increase the stability of our cash flows. In aggregate, as of May 3, 2023, we have 15% of our expected net-of-royalty production hedged for the remainder of 2023. With respect to individual commodity products, we have hedged 49% of our European natural gas production, 0% of our crude oil production, and 13% of our North American natural gas volumes for the remainder of 2023, respectively.

Our business model emphasizes free cash flow generation and returning capital to investors when economically warranted, augmented by value-adding acquisitions. Vermilion's operations are focused on the exploitation of light oil and liquids-rich natural gas conventional and unconventional resource plays in North America and the exploration and development of conventional natural gas and oil opportunities in Europe and Australia.</p><p>Vermilion's priorities are health and safety, the environment, and profitability, in that order. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of the public and those who work with us, and the protection of our natural surroundings. We have been recognized by leading ESG rating agencies for our transparency on and management of key environmental, social and governance issues. In addition, we emphasize strategic community investment in each of our operating areas.</p><p>Vermilion trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VET.</p><p>Disclaimer</p><p>Certain statements included or incorporated by reference in this document may constitute forward-looking statements or information under applicable securities legislation.

In addition to any other assumptions identified in this document, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things: the ability of Vermilion to obtain equipment, services and supplies in a timely manner to carry out its activities in Canada and internationally; the ability of Vermilion to market crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas successfully to current and new customers; the timing and costs of pipeline and storage facility construction and expansion and the ability to secure adequate product transportation; the timely receipt of required regulatory approvals; the ability of Vermilion to obtain financing on acceptable terms; foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; future crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices; and management's expectations relating to the timing and results of exploration and development activities.</p><p>Although Vermilion believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements or information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because Vermilion can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Financial outlooks are provided for the purpose of understanding Vermilion's financial position and business objectives, and the information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward looking statements or information are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by Vermilion and described in the forward looking statements or information. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the ability of management to execute its business plan; the risks of the oil and gas industry, both domestically and internationally, such as operational risks in exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas; risks and uncertainties involving geology of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas deposits; risks inherent in Vermilion's marketing operations, including credit risk; the uncertainty of reserves estimates and reserves life and estimates of resources and associated expenditures; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production and associated expenditures; potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects; Vermilion's ability to enter into or renew leases on acceptable terms; fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and inflation; health, safety, and environmental risks; uncertainties as to the availability and cost of financing; the ability of Vermilion to add production and reserves through exploration and development activities; the possibility that government policies or laws may change or governmental approvals may be delayed or withheld; uncertainty in amounts and timing of royalty payments; risks associated with existing and potential future law suits and regulatory actions against or involving Vermilion; and other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this document or in Vermilion's other filings with Canadian securities regulatory authorities.</p><p>The forward looking statements or information contained in this document are made as of the date hereof and Vermilion undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by applicable securities laws.</p><p>This document contains metrics commonly used in the oil and gas industry. These oil and gas metrics do not have any standardized meaning or standard methods of calculation and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used and should therefore not be used to make comparisons. Natural gas volumes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent. Barrels of oil equivalent (boe) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.</p><p>Financial data contained within this document are reported in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2023 Market News Publishing Inc.

(\"Vermilion\", \"We\", \"Our\", \"Us\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: VET) (NYSE: VET) is pleased to report operating and condensed financial results for the three months endedMarch31, 2023.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The unaudited interim financial statements and management discussion and analysis for the three months endedMarch31, 2023 will be available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (\"SEDAR\") at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>, on EDGAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml\">www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml</url>, and on Vermilion's website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.vermilionenergy.com\">www.vermilionenergy.com</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights</p><p> Q1 2023 fund flows from operations (\"FFO\")(1) was $253 million ($1.56/basic share)(2) and exploration and development (\"E&amp;D\") capital expenditures(3) were $155 million, resulting in free cash flow (\"FCF\")(4) of $98 million ($0.60/basic share)(5).Net earnings were $380 million ($2.34/basic share) for Q1 2023, primarily driven by acquisition and disposition activity in the quarter.Vermilion's average realized natural gas price of $10.77 per mcf was over three times higher than the average AECO benchmark index price for the quarter, as 32% of our Q1 2023 gas had direct exposure to European gas pricing. On a go-forward basis, with the Corrib Natural Gas Project (\"Corrib\") acquisition in Ireland now closed, approximately 40% of our gas is now priced off of European gas benchmarks.Repurchased 1.6 million common shares for $30 million and declared cash dividends of $16 million, for a total of $46 million returned to shareholders in the quarter. In conjunction with our Q1 2023 release, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, payable on July 17, 2023 to shareholders of record on June 30, 2023. The base dividend was increased by 25% in Q1 2023, and has increased 67% from Q1 2022 to the current $0.10 per share per quarter.Q1 2023 production averaged 82,455 boe/d(8) a decrease of 4% from the previous quarter due to unplanned downtime in Australia, partially offset by new well production from our Alberta Deep Basin and Montney assets in Canada.Q1 2023 Montney drilling program delivered positive results as we continue to optimize the drilling and completion methods. The most recent two (2.0 net) wells drilled on our British Columbia lands were tied-in during the second half of March 2023 and produced at an average IP30 rate of 1,250 boe/d(15) (51% liquids).On March 31, 2023 we successfully closed the acquisition of an incremental 36.5% interest in Corrib, increasing Vermilion's operated interest to 56.5%. The acquisition adds approximately 7,000 boe/d of premium-priced, high netback, low emission European natural gas production, further strengthening Vermilion's international portfolio. The acquisition makes Vermilion the largest provider of domestic natural gas in Ireland.Made significant progress on our asset high-grading strategy during Q1 2023 with the closing of the Corrib acquisition and divestment of select non-core assets in southeast Saskatchewan. These asset high-grading initiatives serve to position Vermilion for long-term success by increasing our exposure to premium-priced European gas, redirecting capital to higher rate of return projects, and reducing our operating cost structure and asset retirement obligations.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\"

We invested $155 million of exploration and development capital during Q1 2023, primarily focused on our winter drilling campaign in Canada, which included drilling and completion activity in Alberta, British Columbia and southeast Saskatchewan. We continue to make significant progress on our Montney development through further optimization of the drilling and completion process. Our most recent two (2.0 net) wells drilled on our British Columbia lands were tied-in during the second half of March 2023 and produced at an average IP30 rate of 1,250 boe/d(1) (51% liquids). In addition, we completed the sale of select southeast Saskatchewan assets during the quarter and closed the acquisition of an incremental 36.5% ownership in the Corrib Natural Gas Project (\"Corrib\") in Ireland. These two transactions, combined with the Mica Montney acquisition completed in 2022, were all part of our asset high-grading strategy, which serves to position Vermilion for long-term success by increasing our exposure to premium-priced European gas, expanding our North American inventory, redirecting capital to higher rate of return projects, and reducing our operating cost structure and asset retirement obligations.</p><p>Production in the first quarter averaged 82,455 boe/d, which included the impact of Australia maintenance downtime as previously reported. We generated $253 million of fund flows from operations (\"FFO\") in Q1 2023, resulting in $98 million of free cash flow (\"FCF\"), which was used to fund our base dividend, share repurchases and acquisitions. Including the dividend and share repurchases, we returned over $46 million of capital to our shareholders. Net debt of $1.37 billion at the end of Q1 2023, represented 0.9 times trailing FFO.</p><p>We will continue to allocate the majority of FCF to debt reduction until we achieve our next net debt target of $1 billion. The majority of the incremental capital return beyond the base dividend will be in the form of share buybacks, as we believe our common shares remain significantly undervalued. To date, we have repurchased 2.2 million common shares in 2023 and 4.6 million in total under our existing NCIB. We plan to renew our NCIB in July 2023 and based on our current pace of share repurchases and base dividend, we anticipate returning 25% to 30% of FCF to shareholders in 2023, depending on commodity prices. Once we achieve our $1 billion debt target we plan to increase our return of capital to shareholders and will communicate the specific targets at that time.</p><p>Over the past two years we have focused on strengthening the balance sheet and high-grading the asset base to position Vermilion for long-term success. We have made significant progress on both of these fronts, and while we will continue to advance these initiatives, we will now place an even greater focus on operational execution throughout our asset base. In Canada, we will continue to develop and grow our strategic Montney position where we are seeing very encouraging results from recently drilled wells. In the United States we will continue to develop and grow our Turner oil play in the Powder River Basin while also testing new prospects across our Wyoming land base, including the Niobrara and Parkman formations. In Europe, we will continue to advance our deep gas exploration and development plans in Germany and new gas development in Croatia. We have a large land base with significant gas resource potential in both Germany and Croatia and we will continue to work with the respective governments in each country to identify opportunities for Vermilion to assist in developing their domestic supply of natural gas.</p><p>Q1 2023 Operations Review</p><p>North America</p><p>Production from our North American operations averaged 60,046 boe/d(2) in Q1 2023, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter primarily due to new production from our Alberta Deep Basin and Montney assets in Canada. In Alberta, we drilled seven (3.1 net), completed ten (6.3 net), and brought on production nine (7.6 net) Mannville liquids rich conventional natural gas wells, while at Mica we drilled six (6.0 net), completed five (5.0 net), and brought on production four (4.0 net) Montney liquids rich shale gas wells. We also completed two small tuck-in acquisitions within our Montney and Alberta Deep Basin assets during the quarter.</p><p>We continue to focus on optimizing the drilling and completion process on our Mica Montney assets and are seeing improved results from new wells. Our most recent two (2.0 net) wells drilled on our British Columbia lands were tied-in during the second half of March 2023 and produced at an average IP30 rate of 1,250 boe/d(1) (51% liquids). We are encouraged by these recent results and we continue to work through the permitting process for the planned 16,000 boe/d battery in British Columbia, which will facilitate the next phase of expansion on our Montney asset. We received one additional permit in Q1 2023 and are confident we will receive the remaining permit required to proceed with the construction of the battery in the near future.</p><p>In Saskatchewan, we drilled three (3.0 net), completed three (3.0 net), and brought on production four (4.0 net) light and medium crude oil wells. In the United States, we drilled five (2.1 net), completed two (0.7 net), and brought on production two (0.7 net) light and medium crude oil wells in Wyoming. All of the wells drilled in the United States were two-mile lateral wells, which are significantly more economic than one-mile laterals. During the quarter we participated in two non-operated Parkman wells and one non-operated Niobrara well, the results from which will enhance our understanding of these formations as it relates to future development prospects on our Powder River Basin acreage in Wyoming. We have a large land base with approximately 15,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin prospective for the Niobrara and the Parkman formations. Our six (5.3 net) well operated Turner drilling program is currently underway with all wells expected to be completed and on-stream by the third quarter.</p><p>International</p><p>Production from our International operations averaged 22,408 boe/d(2) in Q1 2023, a decrease of 17% from the prior quarter, primarily due to unplanned downtime in Australia, which was offline during the first quarter for maintenance. In Europe, production in the Netherlands increased over the prior quarter due to volumes from a new well brought online during the quarter, and production in France was fully restored following forest fire-related downtime in the second half of 2022. A nationwide strike in France affected several of the refineries in France in late March and April; however, the strike has not had any material impact on our operations.</p><p>In Germany, we drilled two (2.0 net), completed three (3.0 net), and brought on production three (3.0 net) light and medium crude oil wells during the quarter. We also continued to advance our deep gas exploration and development plans in Germany as we prepare for our first well to be drilled in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the Netherlands, we completed and brought on production one (0.5 net) conventional natural gas well from our Q4 2022 drilling campaign. We also drilled the first (0.5 net) conventional natural gas well of our two (1.0 net) well 2023 program and commenced drilling of the second (0.5 net) conventional natural gas well late in the quarter. The first well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons, however initial results from the second well look encouraging, with an approximately 10 metre gas column identified. In Australia, maintenance work on the Wandoo platform progressed as planned through the first quarter. To date, we have performed over 95% of the inspections and completed repairs where necessary to ensure we operate with the highest safety standards. Much of the identified repair work resulting from the inspections is preemptive, which we expect to result in higher operational run-rates with less unplanned downtime in the future. In early April, a cyclone entered the region which forced us to evacuate the offshore platform and temporarily halt maintenance operations. While there was no physical damage to the platform, the evacuation occurred during final maintenance work and will now require additional time to reorganize and complete the remaining inspections. As a result, we now anticipate production to remain offline for most of the second quarter.</p><p>Outlook and Guidance Update</p><p>With most of our Canadian assets currently under spring break-up restrictions, our second quarter drilling and completion activity has shifted to the United States. In addition to our Q1 2023 drilling activity, we plan to drill five (4.4 net) wells targeting the Turner Sands and participate in six (1.5 net) wells targeting the Parkman sands and Niobrara shale formations over the remainder of 2023. As noted above, our Australia maintenance program has been extended into late Q2 2023 due to severe cyclone activity in the region. Taking into account the acquisition and divestiture transactions that closed in Q1 2023, the delayed start-up of Australia production and our planned activity in Q2 2023, we expect Q2 2023 production to average 84,000 to 86,000 boe/d. Our 2023 annual production guidance of 82,000 to 86,000 boe/d and capital budget of $570 million remain unchanged.</p><p>Commodity Hedging</p><p>Vermilion hedges to manage commodity price exposures and increase the stability of our cash flows. In aggregate, as of May 3, 2023, we have 15% of our expected net-of-royalty production hedged for the remainder of 2023. With respect to individual commodity products, we have hedged 49% of our European natural gas production, 0% of our crude oil production, and 13% of our North American natural gas volumes for the remainder of 2023, respectively.

Our business model emphasizes free cash flow generation and returning capital to investors when economically warranted, augmented by value-adding acquisitions. Vermilion's operations are focused on the exploitation of light oil and liquids-rich natural gas conventional and unconventional resource plays in North America and the exploration and development of conventional natural gas and oil opportunities in Europe and Australia.</p><p>Vermilion's priorities are health and safety, the environment, and profitability, in that order. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of the public and those who work with us, and the protection of our natural surroundings. We have been recognized by leading ESG rating agencies for our transparency on and management of key environmental, social and governance issues. In addition, we emphasize strategic community investment in each of our operating areas.</p><p>Vermilion trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VET.</p><p>Disclaimer</p><p>Certain statements included or incorporated by reference in this document may constitute forward-looking statements or information under applicable securities legislation. Such forward-looking statements or information typically contain statements with words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"expect\", \"plan\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"propose\", or similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. Forward looking statements or information in this document may include, but are not limited to: capital expenditures and Vermilion's ability to fund such expenditures; Vermilion's additional debt capacity providing it with additional working capital; statements regarding the return of capital; the flexibility of Vermilion's capital program and operations; business strategies and objectives; operational and financial performance; petroleum and natural gas sales; future production levels and the timing thereof, including Vermilion's 2023 guidance, and rates of average annual production growth; the effect of changes in crude oil and natural gas prices, changes in exchange and inflation rates; significant declines in production or sales volumes due to unforeseen circumstances; the effect of possible changes in critical accounting estimates; statements regarding the growth and size of Vermilion's future project inventory, wells expected to be drilled in 2023; exploration and development plans and the timing thereof; Vermilion's ability to reduce its debt; statements regarding Vermilion's hedging program, its plans to add to its hedging positions, and the anticipated impact of Vermilion's hedging program on project economics and free cash flows; the potential financial impact of climate-related risks; acquisition and disposition plans and the timing thereof; operating and other expenses, including the payment and amount of future dividends; royalty and income tax rates and Vermilion's expectations regarding future taxes and taxability; and the timing of regulatory proceedings and approvals.</p><p>Such forward looking statements or information are based on a number of assumptions, all or any of which may prove to be incorrect. In addition to any other assumptions identified in this document, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things: the ability of Vermilion to obtain equipment, services and supplies in a timely manner to carry out its activities in Canada and internationally; the ability of Vermilion to market crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas successfully to current and new customers; the timing and costs of pipeline and storage facility construction and expansion and the ability to secure adequate product transportation; the timely receipt of required regulatory approvals; the ability of Vermilion to obtain financing on acceptable terms; foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; future crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices; and management's expectations relating to the timing and results of exploration and development activities.</p><p>Although Vermilion believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements or information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because Vermilion can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Financial outlooks are provided for the purpose of understanding Vermilion's financial position and business objectives, and the information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward looking statements or information are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by Vermilion and described in the forward looking statements or information. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the ability of management to execute its business plan; the risks of the oil and gas industry, both domestically and internationally, such as operational risks in exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas; risks and uncertainties involving geology of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas deposits; risks inherent in Vermilion's marketing operations, including credit risk; the uncertainty of reserves estimates and reserves life and estimates of resources and associated expenditures; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production and associated expenditures; potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects; Vermilion's ability to enter into or renew leases on acceptable terms; fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and inflation; health, safety, and environmental risks; uncertainties as to the availability and cost of financing; the ability of Vermilion to add production and reserves through exploration and development activities; the possibility that government policies or laws may change or governmental approvals may be delayed or withheld; uncertainty in amounts and timing of royalty payments; risks associated with existing and potential future law suits and regulatory actions against or involving Vermilion; and other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this document or in Vermilion's other filings with Canadian securities regulatory authorities.</p><p>The forward looking statements or information contained in this document are made as of the date hereof and Vermilion undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by applicable securities laws.</p><p>This document contains metrics commonly used in the oil and gas industry. These oil and gas metrics do not have any standardized meaning or standard methods of calculation and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used and should therefore not be used to make comparisons. Natural gas volumes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent. Barrels of oil equivalent (boe) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.</p><p>Financial data contained within this document are reported in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.</p><p> View original content to download multimedia:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vermilion-energy-inc-announces-results-for-the-three-months-ended-march-31-2023-301815124.html\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vermilion-energy-inc-announces-results-for-the-three-months-ended-march-31-2023-301815124.html</url></p><p>SOURCE  Vermilion Energy Inc.</p><p> View original content to download multimedia: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2023/03/c2339.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2023/03/c2339.html</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNW-20230503C2339</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6852-W9M1-JC8H-P2CF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6685\"/><timeReceived>4:05 PM Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CNW Group</copyright><publicationName>Canada NewsWire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 3, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The program was packed with so many concurrent events and activities that it was impossible to attend them all. The Yukon Riverside Arts Festival featured exhibits and events scattered throughout town over Friday, Saturday and Sunday. There were golf and fastball tournaments, and a horticultural exhibition on Saturday. The events kicked off on Thursday afternoon with the Authors on Eighth walking tour, organized by the Klondike Visitors Association. </p><p>Winners of the Authors on Eighth writing contest were announced at the event. Dawson resident Lulu Keating received the prize for her short story \u201cAcross the Slide.\u201d The poetry winner was Kaitlyn Lonee for her submission, \u201cThe Ballad of Mad Maggie,\u201d while E.T. Thorbeng received the under 16 prize for \u201cMiddle of the Pack.\u201d The opening of the Dawson City Museum\u2019s new exhibition halls was postponed again, due to a delay of installation of some exhibit lighting, but a sneak preview revealed what is going to be spectacular displays of the museum collection. The new exhibits on the main floor address the history of the Dawson region up to the end of the nineteenth century, while the secondfloor galleries focus on important subjects from the twentieth century. Community figures are profiled in each exhibit and First Nation history features more prominently than before. This exhibit has been in the planning for several years, and a more complete review of the exhibit should follow the opening later this year. Each day during the weekend, well-known Yukon poet, KJ Munro, took visitors on Hiku walks through the streets of Dawson, ending at Jack London Square, where participants were encouraged to share any creative works inspired by the walk. One of the highlights of the Friday line-up was the evening event, \u201cWords Out Loud,\u201d readings and musical performances, sponsored by Yukon Words Society in partnership with the Dawson Print and Publishing Festival. Featured were Dawsonites Kylie van Every, who shared several stories told by Tr\u2019ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebchin elders, Mary Fraughton, who read several poems, including some reflecting complex family relationships, and Charles Atlas Sheppard, who shared his short story about morel mushroom picking near Dawson. West Dawsonite banjo-plucking and guitar-picking Mo Knight sang several of her own compositions. The socially distanced audience responded enthusiastically to all the performers. The parade commenced at noon on Saturday, following a route designed to circumvent construction at the south end of Fifth Avenue. The procession was led by a highland pipe band, followed by members of the Yukon Order of Pioneers, Pioneer Women, restored antique automobiles, children on bicycles, floats, RCMP in red serge, a clown riding a penny farthing bicycle, and the Dawson Fire Department\u2019s fleet of new and restored vehicles. Horn blasts from their modern fire engines were loud enough to be heard all the way to Bear Creek. Commissioner Ang\u00e9lique Bernard hosted a free picnic at the Commissioner\u2019s Residence in the afternoon. The picnic was an alternative to the Commissioner\u2019s tea and ball which were cancelled due to COVID-19. Complimentary box lunches were handed out. Several parties signed up to play croquet and bocce on the lawn under sunny blue skies. Story Laureate Michael Gates gave a short reading, followed by special guided tours inside the mansion. In another event sponsored by the Print &amp; Publishing Festival, Author Ivan Coyote launched their new book \u2018Care of\u2019 at the Palace Grand Theatre. The event was hosted and opened with a short performance given by Torontobased performer, Becky Johnson. By all accounts, the Discovery Day weekend was the first event of the past two summers to see a return of visitors to Dawson in significant numbers. Restaurants were busy, and the streets, if not jammed with pedestrians as in normal times, were filled with lively crowds. One businessperson described Dawson streets as desolate back on July 1, while others described the impact of reduced visitation during the pandemic. Another expressed the difficult adjustment to larger crowds after having dealt with small numbers to that point this season and last. The forest fire evacuation notice was reduced by wet weather earlier in the week, however, road construction through several sections of the North Klondike Highway between Stewart Crossing and Gravel Lake meant several delays, mud when wet, and dust when dry. Two overturned vehicles in a short stretch of the construction zone were a testament to the hazardous driving conditions. Other than that, Discovery weekend was a lively event welcoming visitors back to Dawson City, and an indication that life may be returning to a semblance of normal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20210818PTEA0002067125</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63DC-83J1-F0HF-81HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

It was a unique and effective approach to kickstart climate action, said David Righter, an environmental planner whose thesis reviewed Nova Scotia\u2019s coastal adaptation planning. </p><p>\u201cMany municipalities across Canada have created plans, but this is the only case in which the province actually mandated that these plans get completed,\u201d said Righter. \u201cThat's really been the biggest underlying factor for their success.\u201d </p><p>The province supported municipalities with workshops, webinars, research projects and baseline scientific information. This served as a starting point for the plans, including a study of the climate risks a community is facing and which adaptation measures are high priority. </p><p>Righter\u2019s 2021 thesis study found nearly 75 per cent of the actions have been implemented to some degree, which he says is proof of the success of the province\u2019s strategy. </p><p>His study found the actions most likely to be completed were related to emergency preparedness, like setting evacuation routes, developing communications and alerts and securing backup power. Land-use planning that restricts building and protects wetlands or plans to move structures away from coastlines are most commonly underway. </p><p>Other actions include changing construction guidelines, doing hazard studies, educating people on local risks, or installing dikes and berms. </p><p>The Municipality of the District of Digby is one community Righter identified as a high-performer, successfully blending adaptation, mitigation and reduction. </p><p>The municipality, home to the Bay of Fundy and some of the world's highest tides, is making moves to harness wave energy. </p><p>Tidal power can be considered climate mitigation because it's moving away from the use of fossil fuels by harnessing renewable energy, Righter said. \"It also works well with emergency preparedness and disaster risk reduction because if you're able to produce energy locally, you're not as reliant on the electricity grid across the province \u2026 if there's a major storm,\u201d he added. </p><p>Sea level rise and increased heat that feeds forest fire risks are two of the key vulnerabilities that came out of Digby's adaptation plan, said Terry Thibodeau, renewable energy co-ordinator at the municipality who was involved in the plans. </p><p>Another key step Digby took was installing five weather stations across the district to monitor sea-level rise, tides, atmospheric pressure, wind speeds, precipitation and more, said Thibodeau. </p><p>Residents and fishers use the information in their day-to-day lives, and there\u2019s an opportunity for the provincial and federal governments to use some of the weather stations\u2019 information, he said. </p><p>This type of information forms the basis for predictive modelling, which informs adaptation decisions like planting eelgrass in certain areas to slow the tides. But more advanced data collection methods are needed for predictive modelling, and implementing any action item requires cash. </p><p>\u201cIn our case, we're a small municipal unit. We're strapped for cash, we don't have the money available to us that some of these other bigger municipal units would have,\u201d said Thibodeau. </p><p>Righter said his study found that was a barrier across the board \u2014 even wealthier municipalities cited a lack of funding as an obstacle to their plans. </p><p>Thibodeau thinks tying adaptation planning to funding could work to encourage municipalities across Canada to create comprehensive plans like his municipality did in 2013. </p><p>\u201cIt's hard to stimulate municipal units when everybody's so worried about cleaning the sidewalks and making sure the wastewater treatment plant works, because if your toilet backs up, then climate change is a non-starter,\u201d he said. </p><p>Another success story that could be applied across the country lies in New Brunswick. In 2002, the provincial government declared wetlands protected spaces, which stopped development on floodplains. </p><p>Protecting these coastal marshes stops people from moving into areas at risk of flooding, and provides other benefits like mitigating storm surges and flooding, reducing erosion, and enhancing biodiversity. </p><p>Similarly, Nova Scotia is in consultations on Coastal Protection Act Regulations, which will provide protection for sensitive coastal ecosystems and limit how close to the water people can build. </p><p>Land-use regulations like New Brunswick\u2019s protected wetlands are important tools for adaptation and disaster risk reduction, according to the CCA report. </p><p>In response to the Jan. 13 report, Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault and Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair released a joint statement recognizing the need for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction to be better integrated to weather future climate-related disasters. </p><p>\u201cThroughout the last two years, we\u2019ve supported Canadians through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and with the historic and devastating impacts of climate-related disasters. During this time, it\u2019s become even more clear that there is a need for stronger collaboration and partnerships, alongside a more complete all-hazard risk assessment to inform emergency management decisions,\u201d the statement reads. </p><p>Developing Canada\u2019s first National Adaptation Strategy, advancing flood hazard mapping in high-risk areas and setting up a Task Force on Flood Insurance and Relocation are a few of the eight measures listed in the statement that the government is pursuing. </p><p>Green Party parliamentary leader Elizabeth May says although adaptation is often thought of as a long-term endeavour, the \u201clong-term\u201d actions we take now will be critical in less than a year when fire season comes around. </p><p>\u201cA lot of things we should do for adaptation to climate crisis events we can no longer avoid are also helpful in mitigating by increasing sequestration and they also are helpful for biodiversity,\u201d said May.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-8ee4c9b010d042e495393e8f2d6d0b43</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64J5-H3G1-JBVR-3031-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1045\"/><timeReceived>05:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 14, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The deferrals offer a pause from that approach. Chainsaw medicine is not sustainable,\" Skalbania said</p><p>\"It is not working to control the beetle kill, and it is not protecting logging jobs. You cannot outsmart Mother Nature.\"</p><p>Skalbania said mill closures and job losses have been a reality of the forest industry for the past 20 years, while opportunities exist to retrain and retool forestry workers in other environment-enhancement related jobs such as upgrading decommissioned forestry roads, reseeding, upgrading damaged fish habitat and removing old road culverts, jobs that primarily would have to evolve from government funding.</p><p>She says since 2005, 35 sawmills in B.C.'s interior and nine on the coast have permanently closed, along with about half of the coastal shake and shingle mills, thousands of jobs lost in the process without a ripple or a blip to B.C.'s total provincial labour force.</p><p>She argues raw log exports, mill automation and over clear-cutting have been bigger detriments to the forest industry than is the potential for preserving old-growth forests and placing a higher priority on environmental sustainability.</p><p>She cites the example of Newfoundland losing its cod fishing industry which caused initial economic hardship, but the province over time managed to carry on in new economic directions.</p><p>She cites statistics that show 1.9 per cent of available jobs in the B.C. labour force are involved with forestry. \"Important jobs yes to some communities still but hardly the backbone of our economy. But keeping forestry workers employed at the cost of degradation of our environment&amp;#x26;#8230;you need to give your head a shake.\"</p><p>Skalbania said she remains concerned that under the BC Forest and Range Practices Act, logging takes precedence over all other land uses identified under that act, now coupled with the addition of forest fire mitigation efforts now placed under that legislation as well.</p><p>\"Placing wildfire safety in the hands of the logging industry&amp;#x26;#8230;there is not a good track record for community safety in the past. Loggers do one thing and they do it well, remove trees.\"</p><p>To support the deferral process, the government has ceased advertising and selling B.C. timber sales in affected old-growth and at-risk forest stands, those details being shared by First Nations right and titleholders so they can advise how to proceed on the deferral areas in their respective territories.</p><p>When the deferral period ends, the B.C. government says the newly identified at-risk forests will either be added to the 3.5 million hectares of old-growth forest already off-limits to harvesting or be included within the new forest management plans.</p><p>Jim Cooperman, a Shuswap environmentalist and advocate for the protection of old-growth forests, says the deferrals bring to the forefront the role forests play to mitigate climate change.</p><p>\"Forests are important carbon sinks, and already B.C.'s forests are emitting far more carbon than they are sequestering, due to clear-cutting, fires, pests and diseases,\" Cooperman said.</p><p>\"If Canada and the province are really going to seriously commit to their global objectives, they must dramatically reduce logging and plant many more trees.\"</p><p>Skalbania reiterated the importance of tree planting, which she says has largely been a failure to keep up with timber harvesting, as a landscape management tool that needs to be re-emphasized.</p><p>\"We see watershed refurbishing practices being carried out in the Cowichan Valley (on Vancouver Island) and the Nicola Valley. They are prototypes of pilot projects and we need more of those,\" she said.</p><p>READ MORE: B.C. appoints expert panel on further old-growth forest preservation</p><p>READ MORE: March to protect old growth, stop industrial logging coming to B.C. legislature</p><p>To report a typo, email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newstips@kelownacapnews.com\">newstips@kelownacapnews.com</email></p><p>@KelownaCapNews <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newstips@kelownacapnews.comLike\">newstips@kelownacapnews.comLike</email> us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter and subscribe to our daily newsletter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KLOWNA-4237875</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KLOWNA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6418-0TV1-JDH1-C04D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"919\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kelowna Capital News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 5, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;
