With COVID-19, however, we\u2019re seeing that our governance mechanisms don\u2019t drive global solutions even when our lives depend on it. This is a problem because it will lead to diminishing trust in public institutions and a dragged-out pandemic response, as we fail to prevent deaths, long-term disability and lasting economic hardship of millions. To end this pandemic, Canada must act with foresight, but what does that mean?</p><p> Simple won\u2019t cut it Earlier this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invited Canadians to, once again, get vaccinated:get your first shot, your second shot, your booster, vaccinate your children, and let\u2019s get out of this pandemic for good, he said. The problem is, we alone will not end this pandemic. In the current global landscape, the virus outsmarted us. Global vaccine roll-out has been inequitable:less than three per cent of people in low-income countries have been vaccinated as the richest countries hoard vaccines, and refuse to support waivers on COVID-19 vaccine patent rights or to keep pharmaceutical companies from bullying middle-and lower-income countries. As scientists warned, COVID-19 kept mutating, and the latest variant in the series \u2014 Omicron \u2014 largely escapes our immune resistance. Enter school closures, preventable deaths, chronic diseases, social isolation, anxiety, depression and so on. But the answer is not to boycott boosters out of guilt, while globally, millions are waiting on their first dose. The sooner we all get our shot, the easier it will be to advocate for Canada and other countries to stop vaccine hoarding. By March, G7 countries will have 1.4 billion surplus vaccine doses and we have seen our governments let them expire before. This is not an issue of national versus global interest. We need a plan that encompasses both. Right now, there is no such plan.</p><p>What about international cooperation? The G7 Summit in June 2021 ended with leaders of the seven richest countries promising to deliver an inadequate portion of vaccines to countries without supply \u2014 a promise on which they managed to under-deliver. The announced measures included no future scenario mapping, no international mechanisms of collaboration that go beyond the ineffective charity models. This means we are failing to account for the challenges we can assume are ahead of us and failing to co-ordinate with our global partners on solving them. Our leaders returned from the summit asking us to basically keep throwing buckets of water at a raging forest fire. As the fire spread, we grew frustrated with each other for not doing enough. A different model, one based on collaboration, is possible. Argentina, Mexico, Bolivia, Cuba, Venezuela and political leaders across 20 countries, health experts and vaccine manufacturers organized an alternative summit, triggering agreements of scientific and economic collaboration. Cuba developed its own highly effective vaccine and committed to equitable distribution, with exports to Vietnam and Venezuela in progress. Pediatrician Peter Hotez and his team at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital developed a vaccine produced in India and Indonesia, and are sharing patents, technology and making partnerships with the two countries, Bangladesh and South Africa with the goal of distribution across sub-Saharan Africa. The issue is, as Dr. Hotez notes, G7 countries and global policy makers are not helping.</p><p>The fundamental problem with Canada\u2019s COVID response Currently, the COVID-19 response is backwards:the solutions are global yet policy-makers and governments are focused on reactive national and sub-national policies. Global mechanisms (like the COVAX initiative) lack, as United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres admitted, teeth \u2014 with limited funding and decision-making resources. In panic and fear, the world\u2019s richest countries replaced foresight and strategic planning with medieval tactics:put up the trenches, hoard resources, isolate the vulnerable, hold down the fort \u2026 too bad the enemy is airborne. Places like Canada struggle with co-ordination between provincial and federal governments. Outdated approaches to federalism have resulted in insufficient collaboration around the procurement of essential goods and equipment, poor policy co-ordination (like travel and health policies), incoherent province-to-province health measures, inconsistent public messaging, and an isolationist view that disregards the consequences of global inaction.</p><p>Switching the script As we enter 2022 with closed schools, overwhelmed hospitals and an isolated, tired and scared population we have a choice. We can keep blaming each other or act with fortitude and foresight. Canada\u2019s public should listen to health experts, but also demand a coherent future-oriented strategy. Our strategies must account for global, national and regional agendas. They must address risks and opportunities across public health, trade, international relations, infrastructure, social safety nets and public narratives. And methods to guide this work already exist. Labelled as foresight, these include innovative models for strategic planning based on future-oriented risk and opportunity mapping, scenario-testing, solution-building and policy-making. Research groups (like the Hawaii Research Center for Futures Studies or the Futures of Social Innovation Lab at the Ontario College of Art and Design University), the UN are all using these approaches. Countries around the world, from small island states like Cape Verde and Mauritius to global leaders in innovation like Rwanda and the European Union have all been investing in foresight capacity. Canada should leverage foresight to strengthen its federal model and the COVID-19 response. Combining existing and the emerging data, exploring new possible pathways, addressing existing but also future risks and identifying new forms of partnerships is urgent. This will require prioritizing public health over profits, upholding lived experiences, trusting technical experts and remaining adaptive. Canada\u2019s strategy must account for federal and national mandates but also the importance of global engagement. Without it, we will be living on borrowed time, waiting for a new variant, a new booster, a new quick fix.

nitf:lede=\"true\">Aug 12, 2021( Digital Journal: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com\">http://www.digitaljournal.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> Rain overnight in wildfire-ravaged areas of Greece have helped 'improve the situation' on Thursday, a local mayor said, but hundreds of firefighters were still battling to contain new flare-ups. </p><p><br/> Fires fanned by Greece's most severe heatwave in decades \u2014 which authorities have blamed on climate change \u2014 have burnt through nearly 100,000 hectares over the last fortnight, leaving three dead, hundreds homeless, thousands forced to evacuate, and economic and environmental devastation in their wake. <br/> 'The fire fronts are still active' on the island of Evia and the Arcadia region of the Peloponnese peninsula and 'fires are constantly flaring up' in both areas, a firefighting official told AFP. <br/> And a new fire broke out on Thursday morning in a forested area of Aspropyrgos, 20 kilometres (12 miles) northwest of Athens. <br/> After weeks of punishing temperatures often well over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), a lower 33 degrees Celsius was forecast for Thursday. <br/> The falling temperatures and overnight rain in Evia, thePeloponnese and central Greece had helped 'improve the situation,' said Stathis Koulis, the mayor of Gortynia. <br/> The village of Gortynia in a mountainous area of Arcadia 200 kilometres (120 miles) west of Athens has become the primary focus in the Peloponnese, with deep ravines posing a challenge to firefighters. <br/> Twenty villages have been evacuated in the area over the past few days and 680 firefighters, including more than a hundred sent to help from France, and five water-dropping aircraft have been relentlessly battling the flames. <br/>Greek firefighters have been bolstered by more than 1,200 reinforcements from numerous countries particularly in Europe, as well as vehicles and equipment. <br/> In just eight days, 568 fires have been recorded across Greece. <br/><br/>- 'Can't take it anymore' - <br/><br/>Nearly 100,000 hectares of forests and farmland have burned since July 29 in Greece's worst wildfires since 2007, the European Forest Fire Information System said. <br/> 'I can't take it anymore,' said Kostis Angelou as he wandered between the corpses of his goats, all 372 of them burnt by a fire that devoured forests on Evia. <br/> The 44-year-old farmer managed to survive by spending hours under an irrigation water pipe, surrounded by flames. <br/> 'A saint saved me,' he said. <br/> The Mediterranean has been hit by a savage fire season, with Algeria announcing three days of national mourning starting Thursday for the 69 dead killed in blazes there. <br/>Italy has also been hit by fires, and the island of Sicily recorded 48.8 degrees Celsius (119.8 Fahrenheit) on Wednesday, which if confirmed would be a new European record, beating Greece's previous high. <br/> Eight people were killed in fires in Turkey's south earlier in the month, while in the north the death toll rose to five on Thursday from flash floods that have swept across several Black Sea regions. <br/> The latest extreme weather events come after a 'code red' report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was published on Monday warning that the world is warming far faster than

Right now, Williams says, they have about 25 people on their volunteer roster, which is well below where it needs to be should something big go down.</p><p>\"If you think about, at any one time, maybe a quarter of your volunteers might be available to respond,\" she says, \"and we need a lot more than that if there's ever a larger-scale event like a forest fire up Island and we end up taking in everyone from the Port McNeill and Port Hardy area, 25 people isn't going to cut it. Our ideal would be about 75.\"</p><p>If this sounds like something you'd like to be involved with, you can go through the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.volunteercr.ca\">www.volunteercr.ca</url> web portal and find Volunteer Campbell River in the \"I Want To Volunteer\" section, then look for Emergency Support Services Volunteer.</p><p>Or you could contact SRD Emergency Services Coordinator Sean Koopman by email at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:SKoopman@srd.ca\">SKoopman@srd.ca</email> or by calling him at 250-830-6702.</p><p>RELATED: Ready Renaissance helps train Canadian response teams for future international disasters</p><p>RELATED: Island's amateur radio operators now better equipped to deal with emergencies</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:miked@campbellrivermirror.comLike\">miked@campbellrivermirror.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPRIV-4147782</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPRIV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62R4-JDR1-JDH1-C4YR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Campbell River Mirror</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 23, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0008XAN</classCode><className>DISPLACED PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(AP) \u2014 Dozens of wildfires were burning in hot, dry conditions across the U.S. West, including a blaze touched off by lightning that was moving toward northern Arizona's largest city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The mountainous city of Flagstaff was shrouded in smoke Monday, and ash was falling from the sky. The national forest surrounding it announced a full closure set to begin later this week \u2014 the first time that has happened since 2006.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Intense heat that has hampered firefighting efforts more broadly was expected to moderate in the coming days. But, the National Weather Service noted it could bring uncertainty for fire crews.</p><p>\u201cThe humidity and the possibility of some scattered rainfall is a good thing,\" said meteorologist Andrew Taylor. \"The lightning is not a good thing.\u201d</p><p>In California, firefighters still faced the difficult task of trying to contain a large forest fire in rugged coastal mountains south of Big Sur that forced the evacuation of a Buddhist monastery and nearby campground.</p><p>In New Mexico, lightning-sparked blazes have been scorching the southern part of the state where a large portion of the Gila Wilderness remains closed, and fire officials are closely watching the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument.</p><p>More land has burned across Arizona so far to date with new wildfire starts quickly shifting resources. While humans are to blame for an overwhelming majority of wildfires, lightning started a 31-square mile (80-square kilometer) blaze west of Sedona that was moving toward Flagstaff.</p><p>A top-tier management team had been ordered to oversee the blaze that's burning in grass, juniper, chaparral and ponderosa pine. </p><p>Some campers already evacuated, and residents of rural areas have been told to prepare to evacuate on a moment's notice, said Coconino County sheriff's spokesman Jon Paxton.</p><p>If the fire continues its northeastern push, hundreds of people in Flagstaff \u2014 a college city about two hours north of Phoenix \u2014 also could be impacted, Paxton said.</p><p>Fire officials were mapping out a plan to starve the Rafael Fire of fuel as it moves through rugged terrain, canyons and wilderness, said fire information officer Dolores Garcia. </p><p>As of Monday, it was moving parallel to Interstate 40 along the Coconino and Yavapai county lines. The fire was about 16 miles from Flagstaff, but it's hard to say how quickly it was spreading through various terrain, Garcia said.</p><p>Two national forests in northern Arizona made rare announcements to close completely to visitors starting Wednesday because of concerns they won't have enough resources to respond to any future wildfires. </p><p>\u201cWe have limited resources, and we\u2019re tapped right now,\u201d said Brady Smith, a spokesman for the Coconino National Forest that surrounds Flagstaff.</p><p>The Coconino last issued a full closure in 2006. The nearby Kaibab National Forest, which borders the Grand Canyon, last fully closed in 2002. Both forests are popular for hiking, camping, fishing and other recreation because they sit at higher elevations and are much cooler than the state's desert areas. </p><p>Arizona is at the highest level of preparedness for wildfires. A large wildfire burning near Superior, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) west of Phoenix, was nearly 70% contained Monday. The 282-square-mile (730-square-kilometer) blaze was human-caused.</p><p>Residents near the small communities of Pine and Strawberry remain evacuated because of another wildfire that has danced among the treetops, with flames jumping ahead carried by wind. Some local roads also were closed.</p><p>Firefighting crews have yet to contain any of the wildfire's perimeter. The lightning-sparked blaze was estimated at 51 square miles (132 square kilometers) Monday and is being managed by a top-tier team.</p><p>Firefighters in Oregon were focused on two wildfires, one burning near the state's highest peak and another in the southern part of the state that was threatening 125 structures.</p><p>In Utah, several wildfires were burning in bone-dry conditions. The largest near the small town of Enterprise in southern Utah forced evacuations over the weekend. But homeowners were allowed to return as containment reached 50%. ___</p><p>Associated Press writer John Antczak in Los Angeles and Andrew Selsky in Salem, Oregon contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-93aea01f8925d12f7f85be40e893cc80</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6301-FTG1-DY9S-T0H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><timeReceived>07:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 21, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The mountainous city of Flagstaff was shrouded in smoke Monday, and ash was falling from the sky. The national forest surrounding it announced a full closure set to begin later this week \u2014 the first time that has happened since 2006.</p><p>Intense heat that has hampered firefighting efforts more broadly was expected to moderate in the coming days. But, the National Weather Service noted it could bring uncertainty for fire crews.</p><p>\u201cThe humidity and the possibility of some scattered rainfall is a good thing,\u201d said meteorologist Andrew Taylor. \u201cThe lightning is not a good thing.\u201d</p><p>In California, firefighters still faced the difficult task of trying to contain a large forest fire in rugged coastal mountains south of Big Sur that forced the evacuation of a Buddhist monastery and nearby campground.</p><p>In New Mexico, lightning-sparked blazes have been scorching the southern part of the state where a large portion of the Gila Wilderness remains closed, and fire officials are closely watching the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument.</p><p>More land has burned across Arizona so far to date with new wild-fire starts quickly shifting resources.</p><p>While humans are to blame for an overwhelming majority of wildfires, lightning started a 31-square mile (80-square kilometer) blaze west of Sedona that was moving toward Flagstaff.</p><p>A top-tier management team had been ordered to oversee the blaze that\u2019s burning in grass, juniper, chaparral and ponderosa pine.</p><p>Some campers already evacuated, and residents of rural areas have been told to prepare to evacuate on a moment\u2019s notice, said Coconino County sheriff\u2019s spokesman Jon Paxton.</p><p>If the fire continues its northeastern push, hundreds of people in Flagstaff \u2014 a college city about two hours north of Phoenix \u2014 also could be impacted, Paxton said.</p><p>Fire officials were mapping out a plan to starve the Rafael Fire of fuel as it moves through rugged terrain, canyons and wilderness, said fire information officer Dolores Garcia.</p><p>As of Monday, it was moving parallel to Interstate 40 along the Coconino and Yavapai county lines. The fire was about 16 miles from Flagstaff, but it\u2019s hard to say how quickly it was spreading through various terrain, Garcia said.</p><p>Two national forests in northern Arizona made rare announcements to close completely to visitors starting Wednesday because of concerns they won\u2019t have enough resources to respond to any future wildfires.</p><p>\u201cWe have limited resources, and we\u2019re tapped right now,\u201d said Brady Smith, a spokesman for the Coconino National Forest that surrounds Flagstaff.</p><p>The Coconino last issued a full closure in 2006. The nearby Kaibab National Forest, which borders the Grand Canyon, last fully closed in 2002. Both forests are popular for hiking, camping, fishing and other recreation because they sit at higher elevations and are much cooler than the state\u2019s desert areas.</p><p>Arizona is at the highest level of preparedness for wildfires. Evacuations were in place for fires west of Phoenix, northeast of Tucson and near Heber. Some local roads also were closed.</p><p>A top-tier management team was overseeing a blaze near the communities of Pine and Strawberry where residents also were evacuated. The fire has burned among the treetops, with wind carrying flames far ahead.</p><p>Firefighting crews have yet to contain any of the wildfire\u2019s perimeter. The lightning-sparked blaze was estimated at 51 square miles (132 square kilometers) Monday.</p><p>Firefighters in Oregon were focused on two wildfires, one burning near the state\u2019s highest peak and another in the southern part of the state that was threatening 125 structures.</p><p>In Utah, several wildfires were burning in bone-dry conditions. The largest near the small town of Enterprise in southern Utah forced evacuations over the weekend. But homeowners were allowed to return as containment reached 50%.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20210622RDA0001953536</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6300-Y791-JD2C-J282-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"667\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

The deferrals offer a pause from that approach. Chainsaw medicine is not sustainable,\" Skalbania said</p><p>\"It is not working to control the beetle kill, and it is not protecting logging jobs. You cannot outsmart Mother Nature.\"</p><p>Skalbania said mill closures and job losses have been a reality of the forest industry for the past 20 years, while opportunities exist to retrain and retool forestry workers in other environment-enhancement related jobs such as upgrading decommissioned forestry roads, reseeding, upgrading damaged fish habitat and removing old road culverts, jobs that primarily would have to evolve from government funding.</p><p>She says since 2005, 35 sawmills in B.C.'s interior and nine on the coast have permanently closed, along with about half of the coastal shake and shingle mills, thousands of jobs lost in the process without a ripple or a blip to B.C.'s total provincial labour force.</p><p>She argues raw log exports, mill automation and over clear-cutting have been bigger detriments to the forest industry than is the potential for preserving old-growth forests and placing a higher priority on environmental sustainability.</p><p>She cites the example of Newfoundland losing its cod fishing industry which caused initial economic hardship, but the province over time managed to carry on in new economic directions.</p><p>She cites statistics that show 1.9 per cent of available jobs in the B.C. labour force are involved with forestry. \"Important jobs yes to some communities still but hardly the backbone of our economy. But keeping forestry workers employed at the cost of degradation of our environment\u2026you need to give your head a shake.\"</p><p>Skalbania said she remains concerned that under the BC Forest and Range Practices Act, logging takes precedence over all other land uses identified under that act, now coupled with the addition of forest fire mitigation efforts now placed under that legislation as well.</p><p>\"Placing wildfire safety in the hands of the logging industry\u2026there is not a good track record for community safety in the past. Loggers do one thing and they do it well, remove trees.\"</p><p>To support the deferral process, the government has ceased advertising and selling B.C. timber sales in affected old-growth and at-risk forest stands, those details being shared by First Nations right and titleholders so they can advise how to proceed on the deferral areas in their respective territories.</p><p>When the deferral period ends, the B.C. government says the newly identified at-risk forests will either be added to the 3.5 million hectares of old-growth forest already off-limits to harvesting or be included within the new forest management plans.</p><p>Jim Cooperman, a Shuswap environmentalist and advocate for the protection of old-growth forests, says the deferrals bring to the forefront the role forests play to mitigate climate change.</p><p>\"Forests are important carbon sinks, and already B.C.'s forests are emitting far more carbon than they are sequestering, due to clear-cutting, fires, pests and diseases,\" Cooperman said.</p><p>\"If Canada and the province are really going to seriously commit to their global objectives, they must dramatically reduce logging and plant many more trees.\"</p><p>Skalbania reiterated the importance of tree planting, which she says has largely been a failure to keep up with timber harvesting, as a landscape management tool that needs to be re-emphasized.</p><p>\"We see watershed refurbishing practices being carried out in the Cowichan Valley (on Vancouver Island) and the Nicola Valley. They are prototypes of pilot projects and we need more of those,\" she said.</p><p>READ MORE: B.C. appoints expert panel on further old-growth forest preservation</p><p>READ MORE: March to protect old growth, stop industrial logging coming to B.C. legislature</p><p>To report a typo, email:</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newstips@kelownacapnews.com\">newstips@kelownacapnews.com</email></p><p>@KelownaCapNews</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newstips@kelownacapnews.com\">newstips@kelownacapnews.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter and subscribe to our daily newsletter.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Kelowna Capital News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KLOWNA-news20211105PCE4237875</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KLOWNA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6415-YTX1-JD2C-J4RY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"921\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Right now, Williams says, they have about 25 people on their volunteer roster, which is well below where it needs to be should something big go down.</p><p>\"If you think about, at any one time, maybe a quarter of your volunteers might be available to respond,\" she says, \"and we need a lot more than that if there's ever a larger-scale event like a forest fire up Island and we end up taking in everyone from the Port McNeill and Port Hardy area, 25 people isn't going to cut it. Our ideal would be about 75.\"</p><p>If this sounds like something you'd like to be involved with, you can go through the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.volunteercr.ca\">www.volunteercr.ca</url> web portal and find Volunteer Campbell River in the \"I Want To Volunteer\" section, then look for Emergency Support Services Volunteer.</p><p>Or you could contact SRD Emergency Services Coordinator Sean Koopman by email at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:SKoopman@srd.ca\">SKoopman@srd.ca</email> or by calling him at 250-830-6702.</p><p>RELATED: Ready Renaissance helps train Canadian response teams for future international disasters</p><p>RELATED: Island's amateur radio operators now better equipped to deal with emergencies</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:miked@campbellrivermirror.com\">miked@campbellrivermirror.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 Campbell River Mirror</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPRIV-news20210423PCB4147782</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPRIV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62H9-11D1-JD2C-J4D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

They are prototypes of pilot projects and we need more of those,\" she said.</p><p>READ MORE: B.C. appoints expert panel on further old-growth forest preservation</p><p>READ MORE: March to protect old growth, stop industrial logging coming to B.C. legislature</p><p>To report a typo, email:</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newstips@kelownacapnews.com\">newstips@kelownacapnews.com</email></p><p>@KelownaCapNews</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newstips@kelownacapnews.com\">newstips@kelownacapnews.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter and subscribe to our daily newsletter.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Lake Country Calendar</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECC-news20211105PLA4237836</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6415-YTX1-JD2C-J4S7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438265</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"921\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Tonight, as we mark this pillar, I want to bring in Dr. Abdu Sharkawy, our infectious disease specialist at Toronto Western Hospital. Doctor, you have been our guide since day one, and I think if we look at the numbers, they are moving now in the right direction, but Canada has now surpassed 100,000 cases. Now obviously the vast majority have recovered, still more than 8,000 dead, a thousand deaths in the city of Toronto alone, and, you know, we're always reminded these are lives, families forever changed. So as a medical professional, has this been a failure of the system?</p><p>DR. ABDU SHARKAWY (Infectious Disease Specialist): Well, there's no question it has been a failure. And the simple reason why is that this is a preventable disease. This is a disease that is transmitted due to breaches in hygiene, and breaches in protocol with respect to taking care of the most vulnerable segments of our community. And this is why we need to remain exceedingly vigilant until the months ahead, that we remain steadfastly committed to ensuring every one of us does what we can to prevent the spread of this disease. I liken this to a forest fire when things were much worse. We're in the embers phase right now. We don't want to reignite them and have this pandemic start all over again in a much worse way.</p><p>LAFLAMME: And in this embers phase, as much as we want it to be, with all these reopenings, life is not back to normal, at least not now, and it won't be for the summer. So if you have anything positive, now would be a really good time to share it with us.</p><p>SHARKAWY: Well, I think numbers are trending in the right direction, and hopefully the summertime will allow people to go outdoors and to physically distance in a healthy way. Go and do that, enjoy the time with your family, and with the people that you love, and do it safely.</p><p>LAFLAMME: Okay. As always, Dr. Sharkawy, thank you for marking this grim milestone with us tonight.</p><p>SHARKAWY: Good night, Lisa.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605H-0CJ1-DYX2-92HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"335\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 CTV Televisions, Inc.

The fire threatened the power supply to parts of the capital after damaging the transmission network, officials said.</p><p>Fueled by the worst heat wave in decades, the fires drew closer to a summer palace at Tatoi outside Athens once used by the former Greek royal family, as well as an archaeological site in southern Greece that was the birthplace of the ancient Olympics. </p><p>\u201cThe country is facing an unprecedented environmental crisis, with multiple large fires,\u201d said Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who visited Tatoi as well as Ancient Olympia, where flame lighting ceremonies for the summer and winter Olympics are held every two years. </p><p>As additional support arrived from Greece\u2019s military and European Union countries, water-dropping planes and helicopters swooped over blazes near the capital, in central Greece, on the island of Evia, and near Ancient Olympia to the south. Dozens of villages and settlements were evacuated, including a beachside campsite and hotels on Evia, where boats were used to transport stranded vacationers to safety. </p><p>A heat wave baking southeast Europe for a second week has also triggered deadly fires in Turkey and Albania and blazes across the region.</p><p>North Macedonia\u2019s government on Thursday declared the country in a state of crisis for the next 30 days due to wildfires.</p><p>The EU Commissioner for the environment, Virginijus Sinkevicius, said the fires and extreme weather globally over the summer were a clear signal for the need to address climate change.</p><p>\u201cWe are fighting some of the worst wildfires we\u2019ve seen in decades. But this summer\u2019s floods, heatwaves and forest fires can become our new normality,\u201d he wrote in a tweet.</p><p>\u201cWe must ask ourselves: Is this the world we want to live in? We need immediate actions for nature before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>The EU bolstered assistance to fire-stricken countries, sending 40 French firefighters and eight tons of material to help Greece.</p><p>Greece\u2019s Civil Protection Agency said the risk of fires across southern Greece would increase further Friday, with windy weather forecast for parts of the country, despite an expected slight dip in temperatures that reached 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) earlier this week. The heat wave was described as Greece\u2019s worst since 1987. </p><p>Defense Minister Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos said the armed forces would expand their role in fire prevention, with ground patrols, drones, and aircraft over areas vulnerable to wildfires.</p><p>Outside Athens, a forest fire that broke out on the northern fringes of the capital Tuesday and damaged or destroyed scores of homes rekindled, triggering fresh evacuations, threatening homes and sending thick smoke over the capital.</p><p>The EU Atmosphere Monitoring Service said smoke plumes from the region\u2019s wildfires were clearly visible in satellite images, adding that the estimated intensity of the wildfires in Turkey was at the highest level since records started in 2003.</p><p>On the island of Evia, a major fire that broke out Tuesday was ravaging forests, leading to the evacuation of villages and a camping site, sending people fleeing in cars and by sea. </p><p>The fires have not caused any deaths or serious injuries in Greece. But Greek scientists said the total destruction in just three days this month exceeded 50% of the average area burned in the country in previous years. An Athens Observatory report said an estimated 6,000 hectares (14,800 acres) went up in smoke between Sunday and Wednesday, compared to 10,400 hectares in the whole of last year.</p><p>The causes of the Greek wildfires were unclear, but authorities say human error and carelessness are most frequently to blame.</p><p>However, arson was suspected in the blaze near ancient Olympia, with officials noting that seven fires broke out in quick succession in the region on Wednesday.</p><p>The mayor of the local town of Pyrgos, Panagiotis Antonakopoulos, told Open TV that one person had been spotted moving suspiciously in nearby woodland on a motorbike, stopping every so often and a fire breaking out shortly after his stops. The person, he said, had not yet been arrested.</p><p>____</p><p>Becatoros reported from Argostoli, Greece.

It's unbelievable. Those who lose their shame lose their heart too,' main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) spokesman Faik Oztrak tweeted. <br/> The government has also been criticised over the lack of firefighting planes, with Turkey forced to accept help from Azerbaijan, Iran, Russia and Ukraine. <br/> 'If we don't have planes or helicopters, we must buy them,' Bodrum mayor Aras of the CHP said in a video shared on Twitter. <br/> Erdogan insisted Saturday that Turkey had 'the strongest infrastructure in the region to fight forest fires' as he promised financial support for those affected. <br/> Experts warn that climate change will wreak further damage in Turkey, causing more fires and other disasters if necessary measures to tackle the problem are not taken. <br/> According to European Union figures, Turkey has been hit by 133 wildfires in 2021 so far compared with an average of 43 by this point in the years between 2008 and 2020. <br/> Last month six people were killed after heavy rain caused flooding and landslides in northeastern Turkey. <br/><url

It's like our new fire hall, nobody else has new fire hall either.\"</p><p>The drone was purchased about a month ago at a cost of $600, and Cox describes its potential as \"pretty spectacular.\"</p><p>It has already proven itself during flash flooding at the end of October when it provided clear photo determination of where the worst of the water accumulation was. But Cox sees many uses for the device, which has a wing span of about 12 inches and sends live images back to the operator.</p><p>\"If we have a bush or forest fire, we can see the areas around it quickly: if there's a water source near by, which direction the fire is travelling and where we can attack if from,\" he said. \"Same for a major fire, if we can get the drone up we can see 360 degrees and locate what's vulnerable and what's not, and we can use it for search and rescue instead of people trekking through the field.\"</p><p>Cox is also relying on the drone to give the department a better idea of the extend of spring flooding, especially on Maple Hill Road.</p><p>\"We'll be able to see the extent of the flooding and the areas where there is serious, or potentially serious damage without having to send people into the water,\" he said.</p><p>He also points to the rail line going through town. \"If something happened there, it would mean we wouldn't have to get physically close to see what's going on and what emergency measures are required.\"</p><p>Powassan Fire Safety Officer Ben Mousseau spent three days in an intense course in North Bay learning how to control the drone and then sat specific tests in order to receive his pilot's registration. At the moment, he is the only firefighter licensed to fly the device, and it can only be flown as far as Mousseau is able to visually track it.</p><p>\"We didn't see the need for us to be purchasing an ATV or anything like that because it's a lot of money and there are ones in the close proximity that we can use when required,\" Cox said. \"We don't want to duplicate services in the region when not necessary.</p><p>\"The closest drone that the Ministry of Natural Resources have is in Sudbury, so we may be able to help them out when needed. Calling us to help has got to be cheaper than using a helicopter,\" he joked.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2020110959381248</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:618F-KBP1-JDH1-C566-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"399\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

He later amended his claim, adding as defendants the Queen, the prime minister, the premier, Elections B.C., and several other parties.</p><p>Judge Douglas Thompson described the plaintiff's demands as wide-ranging: \"It includes a private audience with Her Majesty, the suspension of trade with China, the dismantling of Transport Canada, the postponement of an election, the release of classified documents, the \"cleaning up of the swamp,\" the reconstruction of the RCMP, an MRI of his entire body, $32 trillion, and 500,000 Tesla shares,\" the judge noted.</p><p>The hearing March 1 in B.C.

The development includes a paved and lighted walkway connecting Hillside Avenue to a new bus stop on Uplands Drive.</p><p>The side of Kellie Uphill-Tilsner's home and driveway that border the new walkway are not fenced and she said she worries the potential increase in foot traffic next to her property could pose a security risk, so she wants the developer to build a fence between her property and the easement.</p><p>She said she has sent numerous e-mails to the city and has been told she is welcome to put up a fence.</p><p>5. Nanaimo RCMP pull over hundreds of drivers for failing to slow down and move over, Oct. 21</p><p>Hundreds of drivers were pulled aside by Nanaimo RCMP when they failed to slow down and move over for tow trucks \"assisting\" a vehicle on the Nanaimo Parkway.</p><p>The enforcement action was part of a staged event in the southbound lanes near the Northfield Road intersection rest stop.

With only a couple of months remaining in the drill season it is unlikely that our current drill contractor will return this season. Alternatives are being considered. * Our core shed in Crescent Mills was untouched by the fire although power was interrupted. Power is expected to be restored this week permitting us to fully resume activity. * Seven holes (5,872 ft) had been completed on our Superior deposit up until the evacuation order of July 20, 2021. Five holes have been logged and split core sent to the lab for assay. Core from holes 6 &amp;7 still need to be logged, cut and sent to the lab in Reno. We expect all assays to be completed and received by late October 2021. * We initially planned 10-12 holes at Superior to be able to reclassify the Superior resource (60 million tonnes @ 0.41% copper as per our Technical report on Superior dated Nov 7, 2014 available on Sedar) from inferred to indicated. The 7 holes completed will allow us to only partially achieve this objective, but we will be able to quantify the gold and silver credits in the deposit that were largely ignored in assays by prior owners.</p><p>US Copper CEO Stephen Dunn commented: \"We at US Copper have closely watched the incredible destruction caused by the Dixie Fire and wish to say to all those affected that we are very sorry for the loss and pain that many of you have endured. Our thoughts are especially with those who have lost homes and livelihoods in Greenville and surrounding areas.

If we had left the equipment on site and it burned down, we could have lost our service for a large chunk of the valley for well over a month due to re-ordering time due to COVID.\u201d </p><p>The equipment was removed by Wednesday afternoon, and didn\u2019t give the company much time to warn the public, he says. </p><p>\u201cIt was a last-minute decision and we didn't have a lot of time to warn clients about it since this whole scenario happened so fast,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever as soon as I decided this was the plan, we sent a broadcast email out to all clients affected by the outage, telling them that if they are receiving this email, their internet service would be cut in about an hour and to continue to look for updates about this outage by calling our office line, where we had updated recordings telling people what was going on, and when they could be expecting service back.\u201d </p><p>Anger at move </p><p>The decision prompted much anger among residents in the area. At a community meeting on Saturday, July 24, one evacuee said she was outraged by the decision. </p><p>\u201cIf that [service] had been up, I would have had that many more hours to prepare to go,\u201d she said, noting she had to leave with just the clothes on her back. \u201cIs anyone going to hold Columbia Wireless responsible\u2026 but when we needed them the most\u2026 shouldn\u2019t that be a mandate to not cut off communication for people who don\u2019t have that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more mad about that than the evacuation. Why would they do that to us?\u201d  </p><p>Leslie says he hopes residents understand the decision. </p><p>\u201cI would tell this customer that we had very little time to react to try and prevent an outage from possibly lasting over a month,\u201d he said, noting the company also reached out to its customers in the area after service was restored. \u201cIt was a very similar experience as most public had when they were alerted to evacuate their houses. We had very little time to decide what to do and we had never dealt with a forest fire threat to any of our towers before.\u201c </p><p>Leslie says the winds on the fire changed the next day, and they were able to restore internet service within 24 hours. He says it\u2019s been working perfectly since. </p><p>Columbia Wireless is now working with fire officials to look at ways to FireSmart the tower site. </p><p>\u201cThey assured me that they now recognize how important our service is for the valley and they are very interested in protecting it as an essential service to the valley,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working on a plan to help prevent wildfire danger in the future, such as talking to Forestry to get a wood clearing permit to create fire breaks around our main towers that are located on the tops of mountains.  </p><p>\u201cWe will be looking at some sort of fire extinguishing system for our towers, too.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-1cd183e6ab044921ae485df209676a67</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:638B-C5Y1-DY9S-T3S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><timeReceived>03:46 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 30, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0MxOEZFQjREMEU0NDJDRDg2QjlGQ0Y3QjEzNTZBREE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDIyOTIwOUI5NTQ0NDMzREFBMUQ4ODBBMzEwNzAyQjU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N518112GM</classCode><className>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000354</classCode><className>COMPUTER NETWORKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It's like our new fire hall, nobody else has new fire hall either.\"</p><p>The drone was purchased about a month ago at a cost of $600, and Cox describes its potential as \"pretty spectacular.\"</p><p>It has already proven itself during flash flooding at the end of October when it provided clear photo determination of where the worst of the water accumulation was. But Cox sees many uses for the device, which has a wing span of about 12 inches and sends live images back to the operator.</p><p>\"If we have a bush or forest fire, we can see the areas around it quickly: if there's a water source near by, which direction the fire is travelling and where we can attack if from,\" he said. \"Same for a major fire, if we can get the drone up we can see 360 degrees and locate what's vulnerable and what's not, and we can use it for search and rescue instead of people trekking through the field.\"</p><p>Cox is also relying on the drone to give the department a better idea of the extend of spring flooding, especially on Maple Hill Road.</p><p>\"We'll be able to see the extent of the flooding and the areas where there is serious, or potentially serious damage without having to send people into the water,\" he said.</p><p>He also points to the rail line going through town. \"If something happened there, it would mean we wouldn't have to get physically close to see what's going on and what emergency measures are required.\"</p><p>Powassan Fire Safety Officer Ben Mousseau spent three days in an intense course in North Bay learning how to control the drone and then sat specific tests in order to receive his pilot's registration. At the moment, he is the only firefighter licensed to fly the device, and it can only be flown as far as Mousseau is able to visually track it.</p><p>\"We didn't see the need for us to be purchasing an ATV or anything like that because it's a lot of money and there are ones in the close proximity that we can use when required,\" Cox said. \"We don't want to duplicate services in the region when not necessary.</p><p>\"The closest drone that the Ministry of Natural Resources have is in Sudbury, so we may be able to help them out when needed. Calling us to help has got to be cheaper than using a helicopter,\" he joked.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2020110559374974</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6187-KBS1-F103-31NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"399\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Nanaimo man\u2019s $32-trillion lawsuit thrown out by B.C. Supreme Court, March 9 A Nanaimo man who tried to sue for $32 trillion after being struck by a car while riding his bicycle got his day in court before his case was thrown out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The plaintiff filed a lawsuit against ICBC alleging that he \u201csuffered physical and emotional injuries\u201d in a 2018 hit-and-run, according to court documents. He later amended his claim, adding as defendants the Queen, the prime minister, the premier, Elections B.C. , and several other parties.</p><p>Judge Douglas Thompson described the plaintiff \u2019s demands as wide-ranging:\u201cIt includes a private audience with Her Majesty, the suspension of trade with China, the dismantling of Transport Canada, the postponement of an election, the release of classified documents, the \u201ccleaning up of the swamp,\u201d the reconstruction of the RCMP, an MRI of his entire body, $32 trillion, and 500,000 Tesla shares,\u201d the judge noted.</p><p>The hearing March 1 in B.C. Supreme Court in Nanaimo necessitated lawyers for seven defendants to appear via teleconference.</p><p>The judge said the plaintiff \u2019s claims were not reasonable and were \u201cscandalous, vexatious and otherwise an abuse of process.\u201d</p><p>2. Stealthy warship attracts notice as it sails through waters off Nanaimo, Oct. 18 A U.S. Navy destroyer may be designed to be radar stealthy, but its unusual appearance attracted attention when it sailed the waters off north Nanaimo.</p><p>The USS Michael Monsoor is one of three Zumwalt-class guided missile destroyers designed to be less visible on radar.</p><p>\u201cZumwalt-class destroyers are the most lethal and sophisticated destroyers ever built,\u201d noted a U.S. Navy press release.</p><p>3. One dead, three arrested following shooting at Nanaimo\u2019s Rock City Plaza, May 20 A man was shot and killed at Rock City Centre in Nanaimo.</p><p>A heavy police presence gathered outside the Wendy\u2019s restaurant at the plaza along the old Island highway after witnesses reported hearing shots fired.</p><p>Nanaimo RCMP confirmed one person died in the incident from apparent gunshot wounds and three individuals were arrested and later released.</p><p>Police later said they believed the incident was tied to Lower Mainland-centred gang conflict.</p><p>4. Neighbour wonders why new walkway next to her Nanaimo home doesn\u2019t come with a fence, Oct. 18 A Nanaimo family is looking for some separation from a walkway next to their home.</p><p>Last year, a house next door and lots surrounding it were purchased for a small residential development. The development includes a paved and lighted walkway connecting Hillside Avenue to a new bus stop on Uplands Drive.</p><p>The side of Kellie Uphill-Tilsner\u2019s home and driveway that border the new walkway are not fenced and she said she worries the potential increase in foot traffic next to her property could pose a security risk, so she wants the developer to build a fence between her property and the easement.</p><p>She said she has sent numerous e-mails to the city and has been told she is welcome to put up a fence.</p><p>5. Nanaimo RCMP pull over hundreds of drivers for failing to slow down and move over, Oct. 21 Hundreds of drivers were pulled aside by Nanaimo RCMP when they failed to slow down and move over for tow trucks \u201cassisting\u201d a vehicle on the Nanaimo Parkway.</p><p>The enforcement action was part of a staged event in the southbound lanes near the Northfield Road intersection rest stop.

She met John (Red) Hull at a dance in Sudbury in 1953 and they were married on February 19, 1955.</p><p>In 1958 Red flew up from Alberta to work and settle in Keno City. Vel, with two daughters in tow, drove up the Alaska Highway that June with her brother-in-law, pregnant sister, and their two sons. They encountered the huge forest fire at Fireside that happened that year but made it through before the highway was closed. This was one of the fifty-seven trips Vel made up and down the Alaska Highway. In 1960 they moved to Calumet and that same year their son was born in Mayo. In 1962 they decided to move to Quebec but found themselves back in the Yukon within a year and back in Calumet before moving on to Elsa. A move to Alberta was made in 1967 but again they were back in the Yukon within a year this time settling in Carcross. In 1971 they moved to Whitehorse and in 1972 their last daughter was born. Whitehorse remained Vel\u2019s home until her passing.</p><p>Vel was an Avon Lady, a volunteer firefighter and fire chief in Carcross, worked for the Department of Public Works, the Whitehorse Post Office, Supply and Services (YTG), The Bicycle Repair Center business which they owned for fourteen years, and her favorite job of all -The Yukon Visitor\u2019s Center where she worked until her passing. She enjoyed many activities throughout her life such as knitting, curling, bowling, square dancing, clogging, and most recently crocheting hats for newborns at WGH. She really enjoyed their winter trips to Arizona but most of all she loved going to dances with Red at the Legion or any where Hank Karr or the Canucks were playing. They loved their social life and had many, many good friends.</p><p>Vel volunteered with every organization she was ever involved in and most recently was volunteering at the Golden Age Society.</p><p>Vel was featured in the Remarkable Yukon Women book by Claire Festel and Valerie Hodgson and her and Red were in a wonderful article by Mike Craigen titled Living Legends, Red (John) and Velma Hull, Growing Older Younger.</p><p>Vel is greatly missed by the love of her life, Red, of sixty-eight years, and her children, Laurie Babala (Glenn) Costa Rica, Carol Marks (Bryon) Whitehorse, Rick Hull (Luanne) Whitehorse, and Christina O\u2019Connell (Darin) Red Deer, Alberta. Vel also leaves behind eight grandchildren, Ryan (Dani), Jill, Kimberly, Shannon, Hayley (Jon), Richard (Tammy), Brandon and Rachel as well as three great grandchildren, Autumn, Charlie and Isla. She is also deeply missed by her sister-inlaw, Hilda, and many nieces and nephews. Vel was pre-deceased by her siblings, Harry, Grace, Maurice, Ken and Mary.</p><p>A celebration of life will be held in the summer to honor the passing of a wonderful and amazing woman who we all loved.</p><p>Velma Doris Hull Eva was born village of Regietiw, Lemkivshchyna, youngest of five girls; two brothers died at 2, the northern part of Regietiw became Poland. Life was difficult growing up, since her father passed away when she was 4 years old. Before she could complete grade 4, her mother took her out of school to go to work on the farm to help ends meet. She was unable to return to school to complete her education.</p><p>In January 1964, Eva made her way to Whitehorse, Yukon, where her cousin Antonia Hapak resided. She married on February 22, 1964, to Ambrose Kopinec. They were blessed with two children Mark and Maria. Eva and Ambrose raised their children in Whitehorse and were strong believers in the Catholic faith and attended Sacred Heart Parish. Eva was predeceased by her husband Ambrose on May 13, 1982, her four sisters and their husbands.</p><p>In the summer of 2018, Eva moved to Edmonton, Alberta, and June 3, 1934, in the Ukraine.

But if you think this is bad, imagine what it will be like if we go through this month-long shutdown and don't accomplish the objective of getting out-of-control COVID-19 variants under control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is what the Ontario Medical Association, the Association of Local Public Health Agencies and a host of experts are warning is in store, because Doug Ford's latest lockdown doesn't go far enough. As far as we know now, schools will still be session after the long weekend. Essential workers are still vulnerable. Churches are open. Most stores are still open, albeit with reduced capacity. In other words, this is not a lockdown like we had earlier with the stay-at-home order that ended in mid-February. That is exactly what provincial modelling says we should have right now, but the government chose this less severe option. And it did that belatedly, even having heard from health experts for weeks that we are losing the fight against variants.</p><p>Anthony Dale, head of the Ontario Hospital Association, put it this way in an interview with Torstar columnist Bruce Arthur: \"If the worst-case scenarios come to fruition as the modelling suggests, we're looking at a mass casualty event in Ontario's hospitals and their critical care units. This is the biggest crisis in Ontario's modern health-care history.\" What could that look like? In Italy it looked like doctors deciding who could be saved and who would not get treatment. Same in New York state.</p><p>All we can do now is keep doing the right things, stay home and get vaccinated. And if you're a praying person, you might want to try that.</p><p>The mayors of municipalities across the Greater Toronto Hamilton Area this week did something that makes a lot of sense. In fact, it should have been acted on before now.</p><p>As vaccinations rolled out to more and younger people, the mayors called on the provincial government to increase the supply of vaccines to hot spot areas, which would include Hamilton as well as Peel and Toronto. A media release from the GTHA mayors group says municipalities are making \"considerable efforts\" to vaccinate as many eligible residents as supplies allow.</p><p>Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger said this city is doing as well as can be expected given available vaccines. He said in a CBC interview: \"We're doing as well as we can given the supply. I don't know that we can do any better unless the supply improves.\"</p><p>The GTHA mayors said in a statement: \"Current numbers clearly indicate this region is a COVID-19 hot spot, and we believe vaccine allocation should take that into account, in the GTHA and in other hot spot areas in the country.\"</p><p>This isn't about putting Hamilton or other hot spot cities \"ahead\" of other jurisdictions that are less severely afflicted by the virus. It's more like a form of triage.</p><p>If you were in charge of battling a forest fire that covered 5,000 hectares but was most dangerous to neighbouring communities in a concentrated area half that size, would you apply firefighting resources equally, or would you first focus on the region that is most dangerous to most people, eventually ensuring the entire area was covered?</p><p>It's an imperfect comparison, but it holds to a point. There are parts of Ontario that have very little COVID-19, so the need for vaccines in those areas is less pressing than in hot zone jurisdictions like Hamilton. Why not ensure the hardest hit areas are armed with the most vaccines? It just makes sense.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-news20210403THSW54f4eac9f0504e7da581183f908c8996</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62C1-JKP1-F197-54GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"585\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

But if you think this is bad, imagine what it will be like if we go through this month-long shutdown and don't accomplish the objective of getting out-of-control COVID-19 variants under control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is what the Ontario Medical Association, the Association of Local Public Health Agencies and a host of experts are warning is in store, because Doug Ford's latest lockdown doesn't go far enough. As far as we know now, schools will still be session after the long weekend. Essential workers are still vulnerable. Churches are open. Most stores are still open, albeit with reduced capacity. In other words, this is not a lockdown like we had earlier with the stay-at-home order that ended in mid-February. That is exactly what provincial modelling says we should have right now, but the government chose this less severe option. And it did that belatedly, even having heard from health experts for weeks that we are losing the fight against variants.</p><p>Anthony Dale, head of the Ontario Hospital Association, put it this way in an interview with Torstar columnist Bruce Arthur: \"If the worst-case scenarios come to fruition as the modelling suggests, we're looking at a mass casualty event in Ontario's hospitals and their critical care units. This is the biggest crisis in Ontario's modern health-care history.\" What could that look like? In Italy it looked like doctors deciding who could be saved and who would not get treatment. Same in New York state.</p><p>All we can do now is keep doing the right things, stay home and get vaccinated. And if you're a praying person, you might want to try that.</p><p>The mayors of municipalities across the Greater Toronto Hamilton Area this week did something that makes a lot of sense. In fact, it should have been acted on before now.</p><p>As vaccinations rolled out to more and younger people, the mayors called on the provincial government to increase the supply of vaccines to hot spot areas, which would include Hamilton as well as Peel and Toronto. A media release from the GTHA mayors group says municipalities are making \"considerable efforts\" to vaccinate as many eligible residents as supplies allow.</p><p>Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger said this city is doing as well as can be expected given available vaccines. He said in a CBC interview: \"We're doing as well as we can given the supply. I don't know that we can do any better unless the supply improves.\"</p><p>The GTHA mayors said in a statement: \"Current numbers clearly indicate this region is a COVID-19 hot spot, and we believe vaccine allocation should take that into account, in the GTHA and in other hot spot areas in the country.\"</p><p>This isn't about putting Hamilton or other hot spot cities \"ahead\" of other jurisdictions that are less severely afflicted by the virus. It's more like a form of triage.</p><p>If you were in charge of battling a forest fire that covered 5,000 hectares but was most dangerous to neighbouring communities in a concentrated area half that size, would you apply firefighting resources equally, or would you first focus on the region that is most dangerous to most people, eventually ensuring the entire area was covered?</p><p>It's an imperfect comparison, but it holds to a point. There are parts of Ontario that have very little COVID-19, so the need for vaccines in those areas is less pressing than in hot zone jurisdictions like Hamilton. Why not ensure the hardest hit areas are armed with the most vaccines? It just makes sense.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-news20210403THS2021040360596606</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62BY-8D91-F197-501G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"585\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

(AP) \u2014 The monstrous wildfire burning in Oregon has grown to a third the size of Rhode Island and spreads miles each day, but evacuations and property losses have been minimal compared with much smaller blazes in densely populated areas of California.</p><p>The fire\u2019s jaw-dropping size contrasted with its relatively small impact on people underscores the vastness of the American West and offers a reminder that Oregon, which is larger than Britain, is still a largely rural state, despite being known mostly for its largest city, Portland.</p><p>The 476-square-mile (1,210-square-kilometer) Bootleg Fire is burning 300 miles (483 kilometers) southeast of Portland in and around the Fremont-Winema National Forest, a vast expanse of old-growth forest, lakes and wildlife refuges.</p><p>If the fire were in densely populated parts of California, \u201cit would have destroyed thousands of homes by now,\u201d said James Johnston, a researcher with Oregon State University\u2019s College of Forestry who studies historical wildfires. \u201cBut it is burning in one of the more remote areas of the lower 48 states. It\u2019s not the Bay Area out there.\u201d</p><p>At least 2,000 homes have been evacuated at some point during the fire and another 5,000 threatened. At least 70 homes and more than 100 outbuildings have gone up in flames. Thick smoke chokes the area where residents and wildlife alike have already been dealing with months of drought and extreme heat. No one has died.</p><p>Pushed by strong winds from the southwest, the fire is spreading rapidly to the north and east, advancing toward an area that\u2019s increasingly remote.</p><p>Evacuation orders on the fire\u2019s southern edge, closer to more populous areas like Klamath Falls and Bly, have been lifted or relaxed as crews gain control. Now it\u2019s small, unincorporated communities like Paisley and Long Creek \u2014 both with fewer than 250 people \u2014 and scattered homesteads that are in the crosshairs.</p><p>\u201cThe Bootleg Fire is threatening ranch houses that are in pretty far-flung areas,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThere are no suburbs in that area.\u201d</p><p>But as big as the Bootleg Fire is, it\u2019s not the biggest Oregon has seen. The fire\u2019s current size puts it fourth on the list of the state\u2019s largest blazes in modern times, including rangeland fires, and second on the list of infernos specifically burning in forest.</p><p>These megafires usually burn until the late fall or even early winter, when rain finally puts them out.</p><p>The largest forest fire in modern history was the Biscuit Fire, which torched nearly 780 square miles (2,000 square kilometers) in 2002 in the Rogue River\u2013Siskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon and northern California. The largest fire of any type was the Long Draw Fire in 2012, which incinerated 872 square miles (2,260 square kilometers) of mostly sagebrush and rangeland in the endless expanses of southeastern Oregon, where almost no one lives.</p><p>By the time the Bootleg Fire is extinguished months from now, it will likely be as big or bigger than those fires, but research shows that Oregon once experienced megafires much larger than these fairly often, Johnston said.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important for us to take the long view of wildfire. In the context of the last couple hundreds years, the Bootleg Fire is not large,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things my lab group does is reconstruct historical fires, and fires that were burning in that area in the 1600s and 1700s were just as big as the Bootleg Fire or bigger.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s little reassurance for fire crews battling the current blaze, which is 25% contained.</p><p>On Monday, flames forced the evacuation of a wildlife research station as firefighters had to retreat from the flames for the ninth consecutive day due to erratic and dangerous fire behavior. Sycan Marsh hosts thousands of migrating and nesting birds and is a key research station on wetland restoration in the upper reaches of the Klamath Basin.</p><p>Fire pushed by winds and fueled by bone-dry conditions jumped fire-retardant containment lines and pushed up to 4 miles into new territory, authorities said.</p><p>Fire crews were also rushing to corral multiple \u201cslop fires\u201d \u2014 patches of flames that escaped fire lines meant to contain the blaze \u2014 before they grew in size.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20210720RDA0002017508</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6360-4701-JD2C-J2YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"696\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

If they\u2019re unable to raise the funds to purchase the property, it will be sold privately.</p><p>The 153-acre property is a rare privately owned parcel in the middle of a globally significant wilderness area:southern Tweedsmuir Provincial Park, B.C. \u2019s largest park at almost one million hectares. It is located 60 kms east of Bella Coola and accessible by float plane or by hiking the Hunlen Falls/Turner Lake Chain Trail.</p><p>The original homestead, known as the Birches, was built by Ralph Edwards, a pioneering homesteader, amateur pilot and conservationist. Unfortunately the Birches burnt to the ground in a 2004 forest fire, but Ralph\u2019s son John Edwards constructed a small cabin which still stands there today.</p><p>Ralph was perhaps best known for his commitment to the area\u2019s trumpeter swans, who were facing extinction when he took up residence at Lonesome Lake in 1913 at the age of 21. When Edwards first arrived, Lonesome Lake was home to a gaggle of trumpeter swan ref- ugees, a species facing extinction due to over-hunting in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p><p>The lake\u2019s remoteness offered the swans safety, but at the cost of starvation during severe winters. In 1925, the Canadian government enlisted Edwards\u2019 help to feed the swans during winter. Over the years, a number of family members took on the task \u2013first Ralph, then Stan, John, and Trudy \u2013 using sacks of corn which were hauled in by packhorse.</p><p>During Princess Elizabeth\u2019s 1951 tour of Canada, she was promised a Dominion gift of trumpeter swans, by arrangement of British conservationist Peter Scott, who was head of the Severn Wildlife Trust in Britain (now known as the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust). Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake as they had been fed by the Edwards family for decades.</p><p>In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy Turner (Trudy had by now entirely taken over the feeding of them), five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although, in the 19th century, the swans had been brought by ship to European zoos).</p><p>Ralph was awarded the Order of Canada in 1972 for his work and by the 1980s, trumpeter swan populations had increased throughout their range, and the Canadian government stopped its feeding program.</p><p>Both Ralph and members of his family have either written or been featured in several books and television programs, most nota- bly Leland Stowe\u2019s best-selling Crusoe of Lonesome Lake and his sister-inlaw\u2019s book Ruffles on My Longjohns.</p><p>Ralph became semi-famous for his living off the land accomplishments and was featured in a documentary and on the 1957 Christmas Day edition of This Is Your Life. Guests for the show included his younger brother, whom he had not seen in 35 years; former Army comrades he had not seen in 38 years; and his 93-year-old mother.</p><p>Ralph passed away in 1977 and John in 2007. The property remains in the family and the push is on for the BC Parks Foundation to raise the funds to purchase this unique piece of land.

It is a tale of two stories \u2013 the mid-level elevation snow is gone, the higher elevation snow is still there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rainfall patterns will have a significant influence going forward on streamflow conditions for the remainder of the year.\u201d</p><p>Doug Lundquist, warning preparedness meteorologist for Environment Canada, said the dryer than normal spring has placed a heightened need for the Okanagan\u2019s May-July rainy season to come through.</p><p>\u201cJune is the wettest month by far in the Okanagan and we need that to happen again this year,\u201d Lundquist said.</p><p>\u201cIt looks the forecast is for the rains to start up next week so we\u2019ll be watching for that\u2026to help us get through the summer fire season,\u201d he added.</p><p>Bob Warner, with BC Wildfire, said as of May 10, 177 wildfires had burned just over 2,000 hectares across the province.</p><p>Warner said it\u2019s still early to read anything into those numbers yet, citing that in historically high fire seasons in 2017 and 2018, there was virtually no fire activity in May for either of those years.</p><p>He said forest conditions remain very dry through Kelowna, Penticton, Vernon, Merritt and Salmon Arm.</p><p>\u201cThe June rains generally dictate the level of wildfire season we will see in July and August. So we keep our fingers crossed we will get some rain in June,\u201d Warner said.</p><p>Karilyn Alex, Okanagan Nation Alliance fisheries biologist, says said sockeye salmon, kokanee and rainbow trout spawning numbers remain in line with recent historical markers while the chinook salmon spawning resurgence continues to show positive gains.</p><p>Alex said of the 110,000 to 170,000 fish spawning return in the Columbia River system, about 80 per cent find their way back to the Okanagan River, reflecting the historic significance of that salmon run and the need to provide tributary habitat and streamflows to support the revitalization of the fishery.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUMREV-news20210520PSSA0001868423</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUMREV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62R2-7SD1-F0HF-81D0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438276</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"670\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake as they had been fed by Edwards family for decades.</p><p>In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy Turner (Trudy had by now entirely taken over the feeding of them), five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although, in the 19th century, the swans had been brought by ship to European zoos).</p><p>Ralph was awarded the Order of Canada in 1972 for his work and by the 1980s, trumpeter swan populations had increased throughout their range, and the Canadian government stopped its feeding program.</p><p>Both Ralph and members of his family have either written or been featured in several books and television programs, most notably Leland Stowe's best-selling Crusoe of Lonesome Lake and his sister-in-law's book Ruffles on My Longjohns.</p><p>Ralph become semi-famous for his living off the land accomplishments and was featured in a documentary and on the 1957 Christmas Day edition of This Is Your Life. Guests for the show included his younger brother, whom he had not seen in 35 years; former Army comrades he had not seen in 38 years; and his 93-year-old mother.</p><p>Ralph passed away in 1977 and John in 2007. The property remains in the family and the push is on for the BC Parks Foundation to raise the funds to purchase this unique piece of land.

These airports also provide essential air services, more so during this COVID-19 pandemic, including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Honourable Jim Carr, Minister and Special Representative for the Prairies and Member of Parliament for Winnipeg South Centre, on behalf of the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra today announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at airports in Manitoba. </p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP), the Government of Canada will provide over $21.9 million to the following Manitoba airports for safety-related projects:</p><p>Flin Flon</p><p> Replacement of sand storage shed - $287,071 Replacement of airport beacon to better identify the airport's location to pilots at night - $16,088</p><p>Gods Lake Narrows</p><p> Replacement of sand storage shed - $287,071 Replacement of airport beacon to better identify the airport's location to pilots at night - $16,088</p><p>Lac Brochet</p><p> Replacement of sand storage shed - $287,071 Replacement of airport beacon to better identify the airport's location to pilots at night - $16,088</p><p>Red Sucker Lake</p><p> Replacement of sand storage shed - $287,071 Replacement of airport beacon to better identify the airport's location to pilots at night - $16,088</p><p>Shamattawa</p><p> Replacement of sand storage shed - $287,071 Replacement of airport beacon to better identify the airport's location to pilots at night - $16,088</p><p>Thompson</p><p> Replacement of sand storage shed - $287,071 Replacement of airport beacon to better identify the airport's location to pilots at night - $16,088</p><p>For 2021-2022, Transport Canada has allocated ACAP funding to 63 airports for 86 safety-related projects,\u00a0including runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles and installing wildlife fencing. </p><p>Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over\u00a0$1.1 billion for 1,088 projects at 199 airports across the country.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"We know how vital airports are to urban centres and remote communities. The investment our government is making will help ensure continued safe and reliable airport operations for residents, many of whom depend on their local airports not only for personal travel and business, but also for community resupply of essential goods and access to routine and emergency medical care in larger centres. This is part of how we build stronger more resilient and inclusive communities across Canada.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jim CarrMinister and Special Representative for the Prairies and Member\u00a0of Parliament for Winnipeg South Centre</p><p>\"Our Government recognizes that airports are major contributors to the economic growth and social well-being of smaller communities, and local airport workers. In addition to supporting personal travel, local airports are key connectors for business, health care, social services, and emerging resource development sectors. These investments will improve access to safe, reliable and efficient air transportation options, and will help us deliver our promise to build safer, healthier and stronger communities across Canada.

With COVID-19, however, we\u2019re seeing that our governance mechanisms don\u2019t drive global solutions even when our lives depend on it.</p><p>This is a problem because it will lead to diminishing trust in public institutions and a dragged-out pandemic response, as we fail to prevent deaths, long-term disability and lasting economic hardship of millions.</p><p>To end this pandemic, Canada must act with foresight, but what does that mean?</p><p>Simple won\u2019t cut it</p><p>Earlier this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invited Canadians to, once again, get vaccinated: get your first shot, your second shot, your booster, vaccinate your children, and let\u2019s get out of this pandemic for good, he said.</p><p>The problem is, we alone will not end this pandemic.</p><p>In the current global landscape, the virus outsmarted us. Global vaccine roll-out has been inequitable: less than three per cent of people in low-income countries have been vaccinated as the richest countries hoard vaccines, and refuse to support waivers on COVID-19 vaccine patent rights or to keep pharmaceutical companies from bullying middle- and lower-income countries.</p><p>As scientists warned, COVID-19 kept mutating, and the latest variant in the series \u2014 Omicron \u2014 largely escapes our immune resistance. Enter school closures, preventable deaths, chronic diseases, social isolation, anxiety, depression and so on.</p><p>But the answer is not to boycott boosters out of guilt, while globally, millions are waiting on their first dose. The sooner we all get our shot, the easier it will be to advocate for Canada and other countries to stop vaccine hoarding.</p><p>By March, G7 countries will have 1.4 billion surplus vaccine doses and we have seen our governments let them expire before.</p><p>This is not an issue of national versus global interest. We need a plan that encompasses both. Right now, there is no such plan.</p><p>What about international cooperation?</p><p>The G7 Summit in June 2021 ended with leaders of the seven richest countries promising to deliver an inadequate portion of vaccines to countries without supply \u2014 a promise on which they managed to under-deliver.</p><p>The announced measures included no future scenario mapping, no international mechanisms of collaboration that go beyond the ineffective charity models. This means we are failing to account for the challenges we can assume are ahead of us and failing to co-ordinate with our global partners on solving them.</p><p>Our leaders returned from the summit asking us to basically keep throwing buckets of water at a raging forest fire. As the fire spread, we grew frustrated with each other for not doing enough.</p><p>A different model, one based on collaboration, is possible.</p><p>Argentina, Mexico, Bolivia, Cuba, Venezuela and political leaders across 20 countries, health experts and vaccine manufacturers organized an alternative summit, triggering agreements of scientific and economic collaboration.</p><p>Cuba developed its own highly effective vaccine and committed to equitable distribution, with exports to Vietnam and Venezuela in progress.</p><p>Pediatrician Peter Hotez and his team at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital developed a vaccine produced in India and Indonesia, and are sharing patents, technology and making partnerships with the two countries, Bangladesh and South Africa with the goal of distribution across sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>The issue is, as Dr. Hotez notes, G7 countries and global policy makers are not helping.</p><p>The fundamental problem with Canada\u2019s COVID response</p><p>Currently, the COVID-19 response is backwards: the solutions are global yet policy-makers and governments are focused on reactive national and sub-national policies.</p><p>Global mechanisms (like the COVAX initiative) lack, as United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres admitted, teeth \u2014 with limited funding and decision-making resources.</p><p>In panic and fear, the world\u2019s richest countries replaced foresight and strategic planning with medieval tactics: put up the trenches, hoard resources, isolate the vulnerable, hold down the fort \u2026 too bad the enemy is airborne.</p><p>Places like Canada struggle with co-ordination between provincial and federal governments. Outdated approaches to federalism have resulted in insufficient collaboration around the procurement of essential goods and equipment, poor policy co-ordination (like travel and health policies), incoherent province-to-province health measures, inconsistent public messaging, and an isolationist view that disregards the consequences of global inaction.</p><p>Switching the script</p><p>As we enter 2022 with closed schools, overwhelmed hospitals and an isolated, tired and scared population we have a choice. We can keep blaming each other or act with fortitude and foresight. Canada\u2019s public should listen to health experts, but also demand a coherent future-oriented strategy.</p><p>Our strategies must account for global, national and regional agendas. They must address risks and opportunities across public health, trade, international relations, infrastructure, social safety nets and public narratives. And methods to guide this work already exist.</p><p>Labelled as foresight, these include innovative models for strategic planning based on future-oriented risk and opportunity mapping, scenario-testing, solution-building and policy-making. Research groups (like the Hawaii Research Center for Futures Studies or the Futures of Social Innovation Lab at the Ontario College of Art and Design University), the UN are all using these approaches.</p><p>Countries around the world, from small island states like Cape Verde and Mauritius to global leaders in innovation like Rwanda and the European Union have all been investing in foresight capacity.</p><p>Canada should leverage foresight to strengthen its federal model and the COVID-19 response. Combining existing and the emerging data, exploring new possible pathways, addressing existing but also future risks and identifying new forms of partnerships is urgent.</p><p>This will require prioritizing public health over profits, upholding lived experiences, trusting technical experts and remaining adaptive. Canada\u2019s strategy must account for federal and national mandates but also the importance of global engagement. Without it, we will be living on borrowed time, waiting for a new variant, a new booster, a new quick fix.</p><p>___</p><p>Gloria Novovic has previously worked with Cooperation Canada and consults for Canada's international cooperation sector.

Columns of smoke also billowed from the nearby Nk'Mip Creek wildfire that happened at the same time last summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The winery itself was not physically damaged by the blaze. But smoke from the colossal fires blanketed the sky and travelled over swathes of land, seeping into the grapes of many vineyards in the Okanagan Valley, one of British Columbia's top-producing wine regions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The smoky air was enough to alter Misson's red grapes, which he suspects were exposed during a specific ripening stage - known as veraison - that made them more vulnerable to smoke damage than his white grapes, which were unharmed.</p><p>\"Fifty per cent of my volume - basically 100 per cent of my reds - have been affected by smoke. We were getting hit from lefts and rights and upper cuts. It was a combination of all the surrounding wildfires, I think,\" Misson said. \"The grapes are not heavily contaminated, but the impact is definitely there and we're trying to see if we can fix it.\"</p><p>\"We've talked about the option of just not bottling it this year ... the last thing I want to do is a release of a less-than-adequate wine.\"</p><p>It has been a difficult year for B.C. wine producers after record-breaking summer temperatures and smoke taint from wildfires took a toll on the $2.8-billion industry, with average yields estimated to be down by 30 per cent due to extreme weather conditions, according to Wine Growers British Columbia. The Okanagan Valley, nicknamed the \"Smokanagan\" because of increasing wildfires in the area, in south-central B.C., is home to more than 85 per cent of the province's 284 grape wineries.</p><p>The 2021 wildfire season in B.C. was the third worst on record in terms of area burned, and the town of Lytton broke Canadian heat records with temperatures peaking at a scorching 49.6 C.</p><p>Climate change and extreme weather patterns exacerbate the frequency and intensity of wildfires, driven by decreased rainfall, higher temperatures, lower humidity and increased wind speeds. Global wildfires are expected to increase by 14 per cent by 2030, 30 per cent in 2050, and 50 per cent by the end of this century, the United Nations said in February.</p><p>A hint of smokiness in wine can be deemed desirable. Some effects from smoke can go undetected and even give similar flavour characteristics as wine aged in oak.</p><p>But when wine is smoke-tainted, an extreme result of smoke impact, the flavour is often compared to that of an ashtray. Most tainted wines are unsellable.</p><p>Smoke taint occurs when volatile phenols, a class of airborne molecules present in wildfire smoke, are absorbed into grape skins and vine leaves. In an attempt to get rid of them, enzymes in the grape bind the volatile phenols with sugar molecules to form new compounds, which are precursors to possibly undesirable smoky flavours.</p><p>But the extremely tricky part for wine producers is that these unpleasant flavours and odours only become apparent and are detected after fermentation, when yeast is added to the grape, and after wineries have invested money and time to harvest and ferment tonnes of grapes that initially smell perfectly fine.</p><p>Misson's winery is not the only one to have been hit by extreme heat and climate conditions this past year. Another Okanagan winery, Blue Mountain Vineyard and Cellars also located in Okanagan Falls, announced in April that its grapes were contaminated by smoke from the Thomas Creek Wildfire and would not be bottling its 2021 vintage.</p><p>\"While attempts to mitigate the impact of the contamination were tried, the results did not meet the winery's quality standards,\" the winery said in a statement. \"We made the very difficult decision not to bottle the 2021 vintage simply because we were not willing to compromise the reputation.\"</p><p>Smoke taint from wildfires is a global phenomenon and has had crushing impacts on wineries around the world including in Australia and California, which have had record-breaking wildfire seasons in recent years. Wine Australia estimated that the cost of smoke taint following the 2003 wildfires was $300 million in lost revenue.</p><p>Wine Growers British Columbiaspokesperson Laura Kittmer said there is a silver lining to the smaller yields and extreme heat.</p><p>\"Less wine was produced in 2021, but what we are seeing is the wine that was produced is very high quality with intense flavours,\" Kittmer said. Wine Growers British Columbia said in an email that there is no data suggesting there will be a significant increase in the price of wine due to 2021's decreased yield.</p><p>Mitigating the damage</p><p>Wesley Zandberg, an analytical chemist at the University of British Columbia's Okanagan campus, says smoke poses a massive threat to B.C.'s wine industry.</p><p>Zandberg studies smoke taint and ways to prevent smoke molecules from getting into the grapes in the first place. The concentration of contamination from volatile phenols he's watching out for is measured in amounts as little as just 10 parts per billion.</p><p>\"So a teaspoon of smoky aroma in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Some volatile phenols are really pungent, it's astonishingly low concentrations,\" Zandberg said.</p><p>Zandberg and a team of students in his laboratory have been spearheading research on smoke taint since 2015.</p><p>Grapes are typically most vulnerable in the week or two following the period of veraison when the grape skin softens and changes colour. \"It's important to stress that smoke taint is not guaranteed every time you have smoke exposure,\" Zandberg said.</p><p>He has been experimenting with different agricultural sprays, coating grapes that are placed inside tents filled with smoke from burned pine needles, local soil and bark, simulating the effects of a forest fire on B.C. vineyards. This summer, Zandberg hopes to continue evaluating already approved agricultural sprays to protect grapes, but said the use of the products is complicated.</p><p>\"Sprays could be coating the grape in a way that's protective so the smoke can't get in. But on the flip side, you could be making the grapes stickier and the taint worse,\" Zandberg said.</p><p>Ross Wise, chair of the British Columbia Wine Grape Council, said the industry is learning to adapt and that labs that test for smoke taint have been busier than usual, \"probably out of an abundance of caution.\"</p><p>\"We can get our grapes tested before we harvest, so we get a good picture of whether there's smoke impact on our wine. Then we can make decisions on whether we pick the grapes at all or whether we can hand harvest them,\" Wise said.</p><p>Wise, who is also a winemaker at Black Hills Estate winery in Oliver, which was under an evacuation alert during the wildfires last summer, said hand harvesting was a good way to mitigate smoke impact.</p><p>\"By hand harvesting grapes you enable the juice to stay out of contact with the skin of the grape for longer. Then you have the option of pressing the grape immediately when it gets to the winery,\" Wise said.</p><p>\"If you limit that contact time, it limits the potential to pick up smoke from the skin of the grapes, whereas machine harvest breaks the skin, so you have a bit more contact of the juice with the skin.\"</p><p>Effect on tourism</p><p>Wineries in the area whose grapes were not impacted by smoke taint did not get away from the devastating wildfire season scot-free.</p><p>Breanna Nathorst, spokesperson for Grizzli Winery in Kelowna, said the winery witnessed an 80 per cent decrease in traffic last summer because of smoke, despite being out of the way of ignited forests.</p><p>\"Being a winery and in the tourism industry, you have to think a lot about international and non-local tourism,\" Nathorst said. \"We've had to update all of our offerings and experience to focus on our local neighbourhood because our non-local guests won't visit if there's smoke.\"</p><p>The business model of the winery has been adjusted to include farmers markets and an outdoor cinema so locals can set up picnics and enjoy food on the weekends. \"With all the cancellations, we really had to adapt quickly,\" Nathorst said.</p><p>Montekarn's Misson has also had to adjust. His smoke-affected red grapes are undergoing a treatment of activated carbon, which can neutralize undesirable flavours. He's optimistic that it will work, but has resigned himself to the possibility that he might not be bottling a red vintage this year.</p><p>\"It's just the reality of where we're living at this particular time on the planet. It's getting warmer, there's no doubt about it,\" Misson said.</p><p>\"It is what it is and there's nothing I can do to change it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20220521TTA2022052164495740</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65H1-7841-JDV5-F0MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1464\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

As the fire spread, we grew frustrated with each other for not doing enough.</p><p>A different model, one based on collaboration, is possible.</p><p>Argentina, Mexico, Bolivia, Cuba, Venezuela and political leaders across 20 countries, health experts and vaccine manufacturers organized <url normalizedValue=\"https://progressive.international/wire/2021-06-21-progressive-international-hails-the-beginning-of-a-new-international-health-order-as-global-south-states-commit-to-share-covid-19-vaccine-technology-and-production/en/\">an alternative summit</url>, triggering agreements of scientific and economic collaboration.</p><p>Cuba developed its own <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03470-x\">highly effective vaccine</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2021/11/cuban-covid-vaccine-pandemic-biotech-research\">committed to</url> equitable distribution, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/28/cuba-begins-commercial-exports-of-its-covid-19-vaccines\">with exports</url> to Vietnam and Venezuela in progress.</p><p>Pediatrician Peter Hotez and his team at Texas Children's Hospital developed a vaccine <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.texaschildrens.org/about-us/news/releases/texas-childrens-hospital-and-baylor-college-medicine-host-signing-ceremony-biofarma-and-indonesian\">produced in India and Indonesia</url>, and are sharing patents, technology and making partnerships with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bcm.edu/news/baylor-college-of-medicine-and-texas-childrens-hospital-collaborate-with-incepta-vaccine-ltd-to-develop-a-covid-19-vaccine-for-bangladesh\">the two countries, Bangladesh</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bcm.edu/news/baylor-tch-and-immunitybio-collaborate-for-covid-19-vaccine-for-africa\">South Africa</url> with the goal of distribution across sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>The issue is, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/PeterHotez/status/1477455370578763788\">Dr. Hotez notes</url>, G7 countries and global policy makers are not helping.</p><h>The fundamental problem with Canada's COVID response</h><p>Currently, the COVID-19 response is backwards: the solutions are global yet policy-makers and governments are focused on reactive national and sub-national policies.</p><p>Global mechanisms (like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator/covax\">the COVAX initiative</url>) lack, as United Nations Secretary General <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dpng5/our-multilateralism-has-no-teeth-why-its-incredibly-difficult-for-the-un-to-make-real-change\">Ant\u00f3nio Guterres admitted</url>, teeth - with limited funding and decision-making resources.</p><p>In panic and fear, the world's richest countries replaced foresight and strategic planning with medieval tactics: put up the trenches, hoard resources, isolate the vulnerable, hold down the fort ... too bad the enemy is airborne.</p><p>Places like Canada <url normalizedValue=\"https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/april-2020/how-well-is-canadas-intergovernmental-system-handling-the-crisis/\">struggle with co-ordination</url> between provincial and federal governments. <url normalizedValue=\"https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/may-2021/coping-with-covid-requires-a-return-to-co-operative-federalism/\">Outdated approaches to federalism</url> have resulted in insufficient collaboration around the procurement of essential goods and equipment, poor policy co-ordination (like travel and health policies), incoherent province-to-province health measures, inconsistent public messaging, and an isolationist view that disregards the consequences of global inaction.</p><h>Switching the script</h><p>As we enter 2022 with closed schools, overwhelmed hospitals and an isolated, tired and scared population we have a choice. We can keep blaming each other or act with fortitude and foresight. Canada's public should listen to health experts, but also demand a coherent future-oriented strategy.</p><p>Our strategies must account for global, national and regional agendas. They must address risks and opportunities across public health, trade, international relations, infrastructure, social safety nets and public narratives. And methods to guide this work already exist.</p><p>Labelled as foresight, these include innovative models for strategic planning based on future-oriented risk and opportunity mapping, scenario-testing, solution-building and policy-making. Research groups (like the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.futures.hawaii.edu/\">Hawaii Research Center for Futures Studies</url> or the <url normalizedValue=\"https://slab.ocadu.ca/\">Futures of Social Innovation Lab at the Ontario College of Art and Design University</url>), the <url normalizedValue=\"https://unsdg.un.org/resources/applying-foresight-and-alternative-futures-united-nations-development-assistance\">UN</url> are all using these approaches.</p><p>Countries around the world, from small island states like Cape Verde and Mauritius to global leaders in innovation like Rwanda and <url normalizedValue=\"https://oecd-opsi.org/innovations/the-scenario-exploration-system/\">the European Union</url> have all been investing in foresight capacity.</p><p>Canada should leverage foresight to strengthen its federal model and the COVID-19 response. Combining existing and the emerging data, exploring new possible pathways, addressing existing but also future risks and identifying new forms of partnerships is urgent.</p><p>This will require prioritizing public health over profits, upholding lived experiences, trusting technical experts and remaining adaptive. Canada's strategy must account for federal and national mandates but also the importance of global engagement. Without it, we will be living on borrowed time, waiting for a new variant, a new booster, a new quick fix.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gloria Novovic has previously worked with Cooperation Canada and consults for Canada's international cooperation sector.

It's one of several co-ordinating bodies stickhandling the response to what is shaping up to be another active wildfire season in British Columbia. </p><p>Firefighting teams from Quebec and New Brunswick were set to arrive in B.C. on Monday to assist with the devastating blazes. </p><p>The nearly 100 out-of-province members must pass COVID-19 safety checks before being sent into the field, the BC Wildfire Service said. </p><p>Provincial fire information officer Jean Strong said the extra support will not only help boost morale, but allow firefighters to take much-needed breaks for their health. </p><p>\"It's certainly a relief to know that help is on the way,\" she said. </p><p>Public Safety Canada has also committed the Armed Forces for airlift support to carry crews, supplies and equipment in and out of fire zones and to assist with emergency evacuations if needed, it said. </p><p>The wildfire service says 199 active wildfires were burning in B.C. as of Monday afternoon, with at least 46 sparked in the past two days. There are 13 fires considered \"wildfires of note.\" </p><p>Evacuation orders are in place forfive of those wildfires, including one near Lytton that continues to burn. The fire covered 76 square kilometres but didn't grow significantly on Sunday or Monday.</p><p>The Thompson-Nicola Regional District is co-ordinating a bus tour for Lytton residents who wish to survey the damage, but a date has not been set while the risk remains high. </p><p>\"It's still not safe to go through that area,\" Sell said. </p><p>Investigators believe the fire was human-caused but won't be able to confirm that until the investigation is complete, Strong said. </p><p>Separate fires north of Kamloops and east of 100 Mile House have also forced hundreds of people from their homes and prompted evacuation alerts for hundreds more. The largest one, known as the Sparks Lake fire, has scorched 363 square kilometres and has not yet been contained. </p><p>North of Lillooet, firefighting crews managed to completed some guards along the edge of a 260-square-kilometre blaze but it remains out of control. Although it was initially aggravated by aggressive winds, they had died down by Monday, Strong said. </p><p>\"Over the last few days we did get a little bit of a helping hand in some areas due to weather,\" she said. </p><p>Another set of crews were planning a controlled burn using helicopters and hand ignition Monday near a smaller fire at Deka Lake to remove fuel at the fire's edge. </p><p>Despite the progress, a non-profit agency that co-ordinates interprovincial aid and resources has warned more difficult days lie ahead in B.C.</p><p>\"Anticipating multiple fire starts each day over the next (three) days,\" says the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre in its report issued Sunday.</p><p>Environment Canada is maintaining heat warnings of up to 35 C during the day for several B.C. regions, including areas where many of the most threatening wildfires continue to burn</p><p>Lightning was in Monday's forecast for many of the at-risk regions, with a chance of showers.</p><p>\u2014 By Amy Smart in Vancouver.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 5, 2021.</p><p>Note to readers: This is a corrected story.

Full operation of public schools isn't going to happen until next fall, but additional students are being added to classroom instruction this spring, he said.</p><p>Horgan described B.C. as \"the envy of the country\" in his series of conference calls with premiers and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He noted that Quebec is about to restart its construction industry in mid-May, while B.C. never shut construction sites down.</p><p>\"Unlike other provinces we resisted the call for a full lockdown of our economy,\" Horgan said. He cited restaurants as another example of a phased approach, where they were not ordered closed, just given restrictions to work with.</p><p>\"It's not just going to be a flick of a switch,\" Horgan said. \"The consuming public has to be comfortable and confident that they can go into that restaurant safely.\"</p><p>Another example of the B.C. approach is tree planting, which is getting underway with restrictions on camps and transportation for B.C.'s largest-ever planting season. B.C. employs about 5,000 seasonal planters, many from out of province, and this year's target is more than 300 million seedlings, focused on areas impacted by the record 2017 and 2018 forest fire seasons.</p><p>B.C.'s state of emergency has been extended for another two-week period as required by provincial law. It gives the province additional powers to protect supply systems and transportation, and was used through the 2017 and 2018 B.C. wildfire seasons.</p><p>RELATED: B.C. expanding classroom teaching, video classes</p><p>RELATED: B.C. tree planting ramps up with COVID-19 rules</p><p>The COVID-19 state of emergency was declared March 18 by Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth, the same day bars and night clubs were ordered to shut down.

Not only do we get to compete alongside countries with strong gymnastics programs but our team will get to interact and learn from other athletes and coaches and get a glimpse into how other people style their gymnastics.\"</p><p>Gymnastics has been Martineau's life since she was three years old and tumbling with Linda Hall in the gym at St. Martin's Elementary School in Ennismore.</p><p>\"I would have figure skating lessons at the arena on Saturdays and then go across the street for gymnastics,\" she remembered. Later she trained at Kawartha and Victoria Vivants in Lindsay and as a member of the TASSS gymnastics team.</p><p>Two of her biggest coaching influences, Chris McCarthy and Jean Winter, helped lead her to numerous COSSA and OFSAA awards while at TASSS.</p><p>\"I've known Jean since I was six. She was a judge and a coach, and I still discuss gymnastics with her and ask her questions. She's incredibly supportive with sharing her experiences.\"</p><p>Martineau said her best coaches were steady and patient and able to move at her level. They never made her feel like she had to fit a certain standard of gymnast. That's what she tries to emulate when she's working with her own athletes.</p><p>\"Coaching is never static. It's constantly growing and changing. As a coach, I'm assisting the athlete on their dreams and goals.\"</p><p>Her favourite part of coaching is when she gets to step back to watch her athletes perform their routines.</p><p>\"You've done everything you can as a coach. You're standing behind them. Maybe warmup didn't go according to plan but they still have to perform and you can only stand back. They salute the judges; do their routine. There were form breaks or small errors but they land and when they look at you and their face is beaming, that's what I remember the most.\"</p><p>Martineau maintains you need a passion for competitive gymnastics and that's why she doesn't mind that her 12-year-old son Sebastian has given up the sport in favour of lacrosse in pursuit of his dream to one day be a Peterborough Laker.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-news20210510TPE2021051060914059</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62MV-6651-JDV5-F2RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 10, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001389</classCode><className>GYMNASTICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000126</classCode><className>ATHLETES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp;

Supreme Court rulings, she will introduce a motion at a Tuesday, April 28 meeting seeking to temporarily halt the practice at 707 Community Park, while its status is assessed and recommendations are made on addressing fire risk.</p><p>The park is bigger than Vancouver's Stanley Park, Craig told the News Bulletin. It was previously harvested, with minimal tree-growing and cultivating management taking place since becoming a park in 2005.</p><p>There are areas of dense, dry, dead trees and big slash piles, Craig said.</p><p>\"The forest has been growing up around that and it's a concern when you have a very large park &amp;#x26;#8230; the ability to attack a forest fire can be limited in some areas of the park,\" she said. \"The fire chief has been working over the years. He gets [B.C. Wildfire Service] in there and they do work and they're clearing trails and they're clearing brush and developing access points.\"</p><p>Craig said the park has areas which can't be accessed with emergency vehicles yet and it has a cellular phone coverage dead zone.</p><p>\"Being able to co-ordinate an emergency response is hampered in some of the area,\" said Craig. \"If a fire happened at night, or in windy conditions, we wouldn't get immediate assistance from B.C. Wildfire Service and there are residential areas around the perimeter of the park.\"</p><p>Will Sprogis, Gabriola Volunteer Fire Department chief, will make a presentation on the subject to the board this week, said Craig. He could not be reached for comment.</p><p>The meeting takes place Tuesday, April 28.</p><p>RELATED: Bylaw allows homeless to camp overnight at select RDN parks</p><p>RELATED: RDN begins enforcing overnight camping bylaw</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editor@nanaimobulletin.comLike\">editor@nanaimobulletin.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NANWSB-3988870</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NANWSB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSG-8CX1-JDH1-C123-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438304</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"353\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nanaimo News Bulletin</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000863</classCode><className>HOMELESSNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CA23</classCode><className>CAMPING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX001883</classCode><className>DECISIONS &amp; RULINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST0009ZVD</classCode><className>SUPREME COURTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GX055</classCode><className>VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Across the Prairie provinces, more than 160 fires are burning in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and northwest Ontario.</p><p>All told, Canada\u2019s currently active wildfires have consumed about 1.2 million hectares of territory, an area twice the size of Prince Edward Island.</p><p>In 14 different states across the U.S., meanwhile, about 21,000 firefighters are battling 96 fires, including 24 large blazes in Montana and 20 in Idaho.</p><p>\u201cThe demand from the 2021 fire season shows we both need more resources in the future,\u201d the Natural Resources memo says.</p><p>The situation is serious enough to have come up in a phone conversation Monday between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Joe Biden, who agreed that it\u2019s beyond time to come up with a different approach.</p><p>In addition to their shared focus on mitigating climate change, the memo says the two countries are discussing a \u201cco-ordinated investment program\u201d to increase the pool of trained firefighters.</p><p>\u201cGiven that we are seeing longer, more intense fire seasons due to climate change and a resulting strain on resources, Canada and the U.S.are looking at ways to address these challenges in a co-ordinated way,\u201d it says.</p><p>Canada is also working on a \u201cblueprint\u201d for North American collaboration on the science surrounding wildfires, based on a proposal developed by Natural Resources Canada and the U.S. Forest Service in conjunction with experts from all three countries.</p><p>\u201cCanada is continuing to look at ways to work collaboratively with the United States as well as other partner countries to develop innovative solutions, increasing global capacity to respond, and reducing the vulnerability from catastrophic wildfires.\u201d</p><p>Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom told Biden that the U.S. Forest Service, which is responsible for nearly 60 per cent of the forest lands in the state, took a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach to the massive Tamarack fire, which has been burning on both sides of the California-Nevada boundary.</p><p>\u201cThey waited, and what we saw is the fire took off,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe need your help to change the culture in terms of the suppression strategies in this climate, literally and figuratively, to be more aggressive on these federal fires.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, said Johnston, one important step will be for the rest of the world to stop waiting for vast tracts of the continent to catch fire before thinking about how to deal with the problem.</p><p>\u201cThere simply isn\u2019t any easy solution,\u201d he said, noting that California spent nearly two per cent of its annual gross domestic product on dealing with wildfires.</p><p>Proactive strategies \u2014 using mechanical means and prescribed burns when conditions are less volatile to reduce the amount of raw fuel \u2014 will be a critical part of any successful plan.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true that the only way to fight fire is with fire,\u201d Johnston said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice about whether to have fire, but we do have some choices about where and when.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PONNWS-news20210818PRSA0002065468</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PONNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63D7-M141-F0HF-83HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459606</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Now she and her husband, Brad Schreiber, both coach at Markham Gymnastics Club which boasts 450 athletes from the GTA.</p><p>Coaching was a part-time gig to help pay the bills while Martineau completed a forest fire fighting course in Mackenzie, British Columbia after graduating from Thomas A. Stewart Secondary School. After a car accident Martineau was forced to retire early from firefighting.</p><p>\"I never planned on coaching,\" Martineau said, \"but that's what passion does. Gymnastics is an element of who I grew up to be as a person. I am very excited for the Maccabiah games. In Israel. Not only do we get to compete alongside countries with strong gymnastics programs but our team will get to interact and learn from other athletes and coaches and get a glimpse into how other people style their gymnastics.\"</p><p>Gymnastics has been Martineau's life since she was three years old and tumbling with Linda Hall in the gym at St. Martin's Elementary School in Ennismore.</p><p>\"I would have figure skating lessons at the arena on Saturdays and then go across the street for gymnastics,\" she remembered. Later she trained at Kawartha and Victoria Vivants in Lindsay and as a member of the TASSS gymnastics team.</p><p>Two of her biggest coaching influences, Chris McCarthy and Jean Winter, helped lead her to numerous COSSA and OFSAA awards while at TASSS.</p><p>\"I've known Jean since I was six. She was a judge and a coach, and I still discuss gymnastics with her and ask her questions. She's incredibly supportive with sharing her experiences.\"</p><p>Martineau said her best coaches were steady and patient and able to move at her level. They never made her feel like she had to fit a certain standard of gymnast. That's what she tries to emulate when she's working with her own athletes.</p><p>\"Coaching is never static. It's constantly growing and changing. As a coach, I'm assisting the athlete on their dreams and goals.\"</p><p>Her favourite part of coaching is when she gets to step back to watch her athletes perform their routines.</p><p>\"You've done everything you can as a coach. You're standing behind them. Maybe warmup didn't go according to plan but they still have to perform and you can only stand back. They salute the judges; do their routine. There were form breaks or small errors but they land and when they look at you and their face is beaming, that's what I remember the most.\"</p><p>Martineau maintains you need a passion for competitive gymnastics and that's why she doesn't mind that her 12-year-old son Sebastian has given up the sport in favour of lacrosse in pursuit of his dream to one day be a Peterborough Laker.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-news20210510TPEWa5a268c6a178472f8db95ae257f5c70f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62MX-GD21-F197-520F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario) Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 10, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001389</classCode><className>GYMNASTICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000126</classCode><className>ATHLETES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp;

Fire crews managed to stop its movement there but additional evacuations were ordered for the western Antelope Valley.</p><p>In one dramatic moment, several firefighters ran to safety when a longhorn bull that was apparently escaping the blaze charged at them.</p><p>The so-called Lake Fire was just 12% contained as of Saturday morning, and after threatening more than 5,400 homes, it had charred more than 23 square miles (59.5 square kilometres) of brush and trees. Fire officials said 21 buildings had been destroyed, including at least five homes.</p><p>The blaze was in the Angeles National Forest near Lake Hughes.</p><p>Firefighters were struggling in steep, rugged terrain amid scorching temperatures. The National Weather Service warned temperatures could hit 111 degrees (44 Celsius) in the Antelope Valley Saturday, and winds gusting 15-20 mph (24-32 kph) was expected later in the afternoon.</p><p>\"In addition to that, we have a very unstable air mass over the Lake Fire that's going to allow for a pyrocumulus (cloud) development later today so that will create extreme fire behaviour,\" NWS meteorologist Matt Mehle said.</p><p>Record-breaking heat is possible through the weekend, with triple-digit temperatures and unhealthy air predicted for many parts of the state. There also was a chance of isolated thunderstorms worsening the fire threat by creating dry lightning and strong downdrafts, fire officials said</p><p>There was no containment of a blaze that blackened foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. It churned through 2.3 square miles (5.96 square kilometres) of brush on Thursday and was moving away from homes. Evacuation orders issued to residents were lifted early Friday.</p><p>Azusa police said they were looking for a homeless man suspected of starting the fire. He was identified as Osmin Palencia, 36, and was last known to be living in a riverbed encampment near the site where the fire started.</p><p>Police said Palencia was believed to be violent and urged people to use caution if they see him.</p><p>Another blaze came dangerously close to a neighbourhood in the city of Corona, east of Los Angeles, before crews controlled it. And a Northern California fire in the community of Sloughhouse, near Sacramento, burned about 500 acres (202 hectares) before firefighters stopped its forward spread.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-567e3271d97ebb1cd74f69c7c9d11b3e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KP-GYF1-JBVR-30MD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"459\"/><timeReceived>01:24 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 15, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Bianca Mugyenyi</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even before the UN labelled climate change \"code red for humanity\" and a virus upended our lives, it was a bad idea to spend huge sums on new warplanes. But now the \"security\" argument is wholly untenable. Procuring cutting-edge new fighter jets will simply line the pockets of arms manufacturers while strengthening the Air Force's ability to fight in aggressive U.S. and NATO-led wars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The federal government plans to spend $19 billion on 88 new fighter jets. But that's just the sticker price. The full life cycle cost is expected to reach $77 billion.</p><p>These resources could be directed toward more socially useful endeavours, from ensuring all reserves have healthy drinking water, to building social housing and turbocharging a just transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>Instead, the heavy carbon emitting fighter jets will lock in fossil fuel militarism for decades after the government has committed to reach net zero in its operations. Incredibly, the greenhouse gases emitted by fighter jets aren't included in the calculation since the military is exempt from emission reduction targets even though it accounts for 59 per cent of federal government GHGs.</p><p>While worsening the climate crisis, new fighter jets are not needed to protect Canadians. When the procurement process began, former deputy minister of national defence Charles Nixon argued that next-generation fighter jets \"are not required to protect Canada's populace or sovereignty.\" He pointed out they would be largely useless in dealing with an attack like 9/11, responding to natural disasters, providing international humanitarian relief or in peacekeeping operations. Plus, you can't bomb a virus or forest fire.</p><p>Useless in dealing with looming security threats, fighter jets effectively funnel public resources into corporate pockets. Even though Prime Minister Justin Trudeau repeatedly promised not to purchase Lockheed Martin's F-35 prior to being elected, the government has quietly spent hundreds of millions of dollars to remain part of the consortium developing the $1.7-trillion stealth fighter so Canadian firms can continue to profit from the gargantuan corporate handout. The Liberals will likely break their promise and select the F-35 when the final decision is made later this year.</p><p>As is normal in the military-industrial complex, all three firms (Boeing, Saab and Lockheed) vying to build Canada's new fighter jets have offices only blocks from Parliament Hill. These manufacturers also hire former top soldiers and make funds available to think tanks that promote their interests.</p><p>Proponents of new fighter jets repeat over and over: Canada has made commitments to NATO and NORAD, which protect us from the Russians, Chinese and other aggressors.</p><p>But there's nothing \"defensive\" about military alliances with a country former president Jimmy Carter called \"the most warlike nation in the history of the world.\"</p><p>The U.S. has over 800 international military bases and its special forces are stationed in three-quarters of the world's nations. Regarding Russia, NATO has troops in a handful of bordering states with Canadians stationed in Latvia and Ukraine, as well as Air Force and Navy assets regularly rotating through Romania and the Baltic and Black seas.</p><p>For its part, China is encircled by tens of thousands of U.S. troops in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Philippines, Thailand and Guam, as well as the U.S. Seventh Fleet. Canadian naval vessels have recently patrolled the South China Sea and the military has sought a small base in Singapore, according to The Canadian Press, \"to support the United States' 'pivot' toward Asia to counter a rising China.\"</p><p>Cutting-edge new fighter jets are not designed to defend Canada from China or Russia but rather to increase the Canadian military's capacity to rain bombs on countries, often in the Global South, in U.S.-led wars. Over the past three decades, Canadian fighter jets have bombed Iraq, Serbia, Libya and Iraq/Syria. Many innocent civilians were killed directly or due to the destruction of infrastructure.</p><p>In perhaps the most egregious example, Canadian fighter jets bombed Libya in 2011 against the wishes of the African Union, which opposed the NATO campaign led by a Canadian general. An upsurge in anti-Blackness, including slave markets, subsequently appeared in Libya and violence quickly spilled southward to Mali and across much of Africa's Sahel.</p><p>Spending tens of billions of dollars in order to be able to bomb largely Black and brown people living in countries thousands of kilometres away does not make Canadians more secure. We can find far better uses for our tax dollars.</p><p>Bianca Mugyenyi is the director of the Canadian Foreign Policy Institute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20210814TTA2021081461939983</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63CF-TY41-JDV5-F2X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

However, three outbuildings suffered \u201clight exterior damage,\u201d and one storage shed burned down. </p><p>Residents in the area self-evacuated and no injuries occurred. </p><p>Roach said the firefighters did well to keep the blaze at bay. </p><p>\u201cIt was a tough fire. The top of the ground is tinder dry and the flames were pretty intense,\u201d he said. </p><p>As well as firefighters from Greenfield and North Queens, there were firefighters from Liverpool, Tri-District, Hemford, New Germany and Port Medway on the scene, and a crew from Annapolis Royal were on standby at the North Queens fire hall. Lunenburg and Sable River fire crews were also on standby. </p><p>Staff with the Department of Lands and Forestry attended as well. </p><p>Firefighters worked the area from about 2:30 p.m. to 8:45 p.m., according to Roach, and several members of the North Queens and Greenfield departments as well as the Department of Lands and Forestry returned the following day to check for hotspots. </p><p>Paul Schnurr, Wildfire Training Officer with the Department of Lands and Forestry, said they have a mandate to attend all forest fires in the province with some exemptions being fires located on federal land. </p><p>A helicopter was also dispatched, \u201cbecause there were structures that were in the area, and given the day and the potential for fire growth,\u201d said Schnurr. \u201cBut the fire was stopped at a roadway, and because of the peninsula we were able to keep it from extending very far into the woods, so the helicopter was cancelled.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLucky that the fire departments got there quickly,\u201d said Conrad. \u201cWe probably saved four cottages and some other outbuildings.\u201d </p><p>Conrad reported there were about 18 firefighters on the scene who fought the head of the fire, and their main priority was to protect the cottages nearby. </p><p>Dwayne Primeau, president of the Greater Molega Lake Lot Owners Association (GMLLOA), posted a message of appreciation on the GMLLOA website. </p><p>\u201cOn behalf of all members, we express a heartfelt thank you to the firefighters and fire departments who responded swiftly and bravely to fight this fire,\u201d he said, noting that the fire travelled across eight properties. </p><p>The non-profit association formed in 1977 and currently consists of 63 permanent residents, 413 seasonal owners and about 1,136 properties in the Ponhook, Molega, Beaverdam, Annis, Hidden, Beavertail and Black Rattle lakes. </p><p>Schnurr emphasized the importance of being fire safe now. </p><p>\u201cA lot of people believe the woods are very wet. They\u2019re standing on the ground and soil may be very wet itself. But what\u2019s available to burn right now are things like grasses, leaves and weeds, which just take a few hours to dry out and that ignites very easily,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cIt often surprises people how fast a fire will travel, so you need to be very careful, follow the restrictions that are posted on the burn safe line and remember you\u2019re responsible for your fire at the end of the day.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-064f17a5e3e44357b57ff11123319cf1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62M0-TPP1-DY9S-T3S2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"657\"/><timeReceived>03:09 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 5, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The cities included Rome, Florence and Palermo, but also Bolzano, which is usually a refreshing hot-weather escape in the Alps,</p><p>The local National Health Service offices in Rome and Bologna telephoned older residents who live alone to see if they needed groceries or medicines delivered so they wouldn't venture out in the searing heat.</p><p>The Italian air force, which oversees the national weather service, said the interior parts of the islands of Sardinia and Sicily could expect to see temperatures upwards of 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) by Friday. By early afternoon on Thursday in Rome, the city famous for its ornamental as well as strategically placed sidewalk drinking fountains sizzled in 38 C (100 F) heat.</p><p>\"I drink a lot of water, more water, more water and more water,\" said Hank Heerat, a tourist from the Netherlands cycling down the broad boulevard flanking the Roman Forum.</p><p>At the ancient Colosseum, Civil Protection volunteers distributed hundreds of bottles of water to visitors.</p><p>In Serbia, the spell of hot, dry weather prompted four municipalities to declare an emergency after Rzav River levels plummeted, endangering water supplies. Authorities imposed drinking water restrictions affecting some 250,000 people, while the army brought in water tanks for public use.</p><p>\"We have a period of severe drought, we cannot take any more water from the river,\" Zoran Barac, the head of a local water supply utility, told state broadcaster RTS.</p><p>In Spain, the national weather service warned temperatures could hit 44 C (111 F) in some areas in coming days. Parts of the northeastern Catalonia region were forecast to reach 42 C (107.6 F) on Thursday.</p><p>Authorities in Barcelona, the Catalan capital, designated 162 museums, libraries, schools and other public places around the city as \"climate shelters.\" The sites offered an escape from the heat, cool drinking water and staff trained in dealing with heatstroke.</p><p>The surge in temperatures, due to a mass of hot, dry air from Africa, was expected to ease starting on Monday on the Iberian peninsula.</p><p>While Southern Europe is known for sunny, hot summers, climate scientists say there's little doubt climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving extreme events such as heat waves, droughts and wildfires, which they say are likely to happen more frequently as Earth warms.</p><p>A German tourist in Rome concurred.</p><p>Because of climate change, \"temperatures are very high. So I think it's a better option is to reduce the carbon dioxide from the cars and travel more with the metro,\" said Philippe Kutaski near the Colosseum in Rome.</p><p>As in past years, Croatia's Adriatic Sea resorts were hosting hundreds of thousands of tourists. But those stepping out of the sea sweltered as temperatures reached 39 C (102 F) on the coast on Wednesday.</p><p>Crops suffered, too.</p><p>The Italian agriculture lobby Coldiretti said Thursday that 20% of the tomato crop in Italy's south was lost due to torrid heat and humidity. Italy exports nearly 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) worth of tomatoes and tomato products like canned or bottled sauce throughout the world.</p><p>While much attention has focused on southern Europe's heat crisis, it was even hotter on the North African shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Temperatures hit 50 C (122 F) in Tunisia, a record high for the country. The last previous high was 48.2 C (nearly 119 F) in 1968.</p><p>In Algeria, most of the regions of the north of the country have been placed on alert for heat waves. Fires ravaging mountain forests and villages in Algeria's Berber region have killed at least 65 people, including 28 soldiers.</p><p>Blazes have devoured forest and brush areas in Greece and in southern Italy for days.</p><p>In Italy, temperatures in the mid-40s C (over 110 F) in inland parts of Sardinia, Calabria and Sicily made for ripe fire conditions. But long spells of drought also were blamed. By the start of summer in Italy, vegetation had already withered from lack of rain and \"essentially became fuel\" for wildfires, Italian Civil Protection official Luigi D'Angelo told Italian state TV.</p><p>&amp;
