Wildlife trees will also be retained whenever safe and practical.</p><p>\"Only a minimal amount of timber will be harvested and removed, the focus is on smaller diameter trees and surface fuels,\" said Nolander.</p><p>The project is funded by the province's Wildfire Risk Reduction program, and is being overseen in a number of locations by the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development's Mountain Resorts Branch (MRB) in association with the BC Wildfire Service in an effort to protect mountain resort communities, critical infrastructure and provincial assets on Crown Land.</p><p>\"MRB has collaborated with the District of Elkford, Sites and Trails BC, BC Hydro and various recreational groups to minimize impact to residents.\"</p><p>Signs will be posted to both to inform residents and to ensure safety to the public during operations.</p><p>The current treatment area is located at the base of the ski hill, next to private properties and critical infrastructure.</p><p>All burning will be carried out in compliance with the Open Burning and Smoke Control Regulations to reduce the impact of smoke, with burn piles no larger than two metres by three metres located at least 100 metres from private residences. Further burning will occur in fall of 2021.</p><p>For more information, call 250-371-3952 or email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mountainresortsbranch@gov.bc.ca\">mountainresortsbranch@gov.bc.ca</email></p><p>READ MORE: CBT kicks off new year with grant opportunities for Basin residents</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:reporter@thefreepress.ca\">reporter@thefreepress.ca</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 Fernie Free Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FREPRS-news20210129PFP4109185</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FREPRS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61X5-2WK1-JD2C-J279-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438278</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"440\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

On Feb. 11, 1958, Deehr was a student at Reed College in Portland, Ore. He asked a Fulbright student from Norway named Tone to the Portland Symphony that night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They went for a stroll on a golf course after the concert. Looking past the treetops, they noticed the sky was blood red.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">People as far south as Mexico saw the red sky that night. Some thought Martians. Others thought Christ was visiting for the second time. In Portland, people thought a forest fire was causing the glow.</p><p>Deehr knew better, because he was studying the physics of Earth and space. Under the crimson sky, he was sure of two things: he and Tone were seeing a great red aurora, and he would ask her on another date.</p><p>The Deehrs have now been married 61 years. Charles \u2014 Chuck to his friends \u2014 was a space-physicist and aurora forecaster at the University of Alaska Fairbanks for most of</p><p>that time. In decades of sky-watching in the north, he has seen a few red auroras, but not many.</p><p>Fringes of red and blue hanging from aurora curtains \u2014 the result of particles from the sun reacting with nitrogen in the upper</p><p>atmosphere \u2014 happen often, but the great displays that flood the sky with diffuse red light are rare.</p><p>Red aurora displays happen so high in the sky they are often the only form of aurora ever seen by people in the midlatitudes.</p><p>In A.D. 37, a great red aurora showed itself to the citizens of Rome. Those in London gazed up at a red sky in September 1839. A blazing display in 1938 lit the sands of the Sahara Desert in northern Africa. Deehr and his date witnessed one of</p><p>the most spectacular displays in 1958. Others have happened in 1989, 2000 and 2001.</p><p>Great red auroras are rare because they require a perfect mix of heavenly conditions.</p><p>\u201cTo get a pure red aurora, you need two things from the sun,\u2019\u2019 Deehr said. \u201cLots of solar flares with ultraviolet radiation to heat the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and lots of coronal mass ejections to power the Earth\u2019s magnetospheric generator of aurora.\u201d</p><p>The green aurora northerners enjoy almost every dark night is a product of particles cast off by the sun that stream outward into space. This solar wind takes a day to two to reach Earth.</p><p>It flows over the planet and reacts with Earth\u2019s magnetic field. In the upper atmosphere, this electrical discharge reacts with gases, causing them to glow in the same way electricity fires up a neon light.</p><p>Green auroras occur at about 60 miles above Earth. Pure red auroras are much higher, from about 200 to 300 miles up, which allows people closer to the equator to see them. An important gas remaining at that altitude is oxygen, and electrons that excite the oxygen atoms there</p><p>produce a red light as pure as a laser.</p><p>Cameras and phones that can capture more light wavelengths than our eyes sometimes show red in aurora photos in which the photographer only saw greens. Red auroras have to be 10 times as bright as green auroras for us to see that color with the naked eye.</p><p>Red auroras are unpredictable, but in the past they have tended to bunch themselves around periods when the solar cycle \u2014 an 11-year period of sun activity \u2014 features lots of solar activity.</p><p>Today, Chuck Deehr is a professor emeritus at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. He doesn\u2019t expect to ever see a red aurora as brilliant as the night of Feb. 11, 1958, but some things \u2014 like a first date that leads to a 63-year partnership, four daughters, and seven grandchildren \u2014 happen only once in a lifetime.</p><p>Since the late 1970s, the University of Alaska Fairbanks\u2019 Geophysical Institute has provided this column free in cooperation with the UAF research community. This year is the institute\u2019s 75th anniversary.

What skills and experience do you have that would make you a good trustee? 2. If elected, what would be your top three priority areas during your term? 3. Do you think the Islands Trust generally needs more legislative powers, and if so, for what purposes? BEN CORNO 1. I'm a good-willed and fair facilitator of discussion. I delight in learning new things, and I'm excited by the minutiae of public policy and the impact that it has on real people. I possess a great deal of empathy for anyone I'm talking with, and love to put myself in their shoes. I am lucky to have nurtured an expansive and pliable imagination, as well as an attention to detail. I have a strong need to have those details taken care of in the planning stages of any project.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. First, promoting a conservation mindset to all residents, as well as trying to make conservation covenants more accessible for homeowners.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Second, taking care of the responsibilities of the job in good time, with care to devote to meaningful public consultation, and consistent, detailed communications. I will consider this a full-time job.</p><p>Third, identifying the best places for multifamily development on island, and being ready to be a hard-working, optimistic and flexible steward of those projects.</p><p>3. I feel that the Trust has sufficient legislative power at the local trust committee level, and that a modernization of our official community plan, as well as the Trust Policy Statement, is needed to give our community direction with regards to our conservation goals, as well as our community care goals.</p><p>To what degree the Trust Council should have increased legislative power, I am not yet sure of. I'm still learning, and that's a great question to spur on my further learning.</p><p>GARY GAGNE 1. The main skill that I possess is being a problem solver and peace keeper by nature. Seeing the big picture and thinking outside the box comes quite naturally to me. I have many years of volunteer service including my current position as vice chair of NSSWD. I worked on Climate Action Plan 2.0; on the board of Island Pathways, and their two committees, and worked in Africa on permaculture installations. I also sit on the Salt Spring Housing Council. My natural tendency to lookfor connection leads me to find ways to bring diverse groups together. Energy and passion included! 2. I am passionate about climate action and justice for all. My first priority would be to support the continuation of work begun on Maxwell Creek Watershed with regard to forest fire mitigation and wetland and forest restoration, with the eventual goal of expanding that resilience to all of Salt Spring. Regarding affordable worker housing, I have cost-effective and simple solutions that would enhance the quality of life and food security on the island. We also need to include Salt Spring in the Speculation and Vacancy Tax system and regulate STVRs. \"Reduce, Reuse and Recycle\" includes housing as well.</p><p>3. It seems to me that governments generally have very little capacity to effectively use the powers they already do have, let alone waste staff time on trying to get new powers. The province needs to clarify that the purpose of the trust is to protect the natural environment, not the built environment. A useful aid in connecting with that purpose and with nature more deeply can be found in guidance from our Indigenous Elders and discovering the true value of life, not dead things (money, devices). This is the path most likely to get us out of our current pickle.</p><p>DON MARCOTTE AND JAMIE HARRIS, RUNNING AS A SLATE 1. We feel our decades of knowledge on how the Islands Trust works, along with our deep understanding of how the Islands Trust has had a negative impact on our community as a whole, will make us great trustees. Also, our business experience and established relationships would assist us greatly in our roles as trustees.</p><p>2. Addressing the ever-increasing workforce housing crisis by working as fast as we possibly can to make provisions for ownership housing for workers and their families will be our first and foremost priority.</p><p>Secondly, we would work towards reducing the Trust's budget, by working with other elected trustees to aggressively get the Islands Trust performing efficiently and effectively to meet our communities'objectives.</p><p>Thirdly, we would work together with other governmental agencies and associations to focus on the much-needed managing of our watersheds and conservancy lands, to improve the overall condition of these areas while reducing the growing wildfire risk.</p><p>3. We absolutely do NOT think the Islands Trust needs more legislative power. If anything, we feel the Islands Trust's bid for more power has been a huge waste of time, money and a gross overreach, as there are already other governmental agencies in place heavily regulating the areas the Trust wishes to gain control in.</p><p>JENNY MCCLEAN 1. I do know people on Salt Spring Island from all walks of life, and have a vision of howto create a community that works out for many types of people. I have been following the politics on Salt Spring Island for a long time, and I know about the different groups and what people here are working to have built, and what they are concerned about protecting. I do read land use documents connected to Salt Spring as a personal hobby and I am aware of how things are run and what the issues are.</p><p>2. My top three priorities would be housing that serves families; learning about the aquifers, and their capacity and applying that knowledge to land use, and planning for the community we will have in the future.</p><p>3. I do not believe that the Islands Trust can take on more legislative powers without a lot of public outcry. I would have to see if the public overwhelmingly wishes for the Islands Trust to have more legislative power before I would even say anything like that.</p><p>LAURA PATRICK 1. The issues the Trust has to deal with are complex and have interdependencies with other government bodies. As a newly elected representative it takes time to get your feet under you and understand how things work, what the policy purview of each government body is and, most importantly, how to get things done within that framework. I now have one term under my belt and can hit the ground running with all that learning AND all those relationships with other levels of government already in hand. I bring a balance of honesty and compassion to the role of trustee. I am not dogmatic. I really do care about the consequences of the decisions I make.</p><p>2. Work initiated in my first term must continue to meet the challenges of climate change, the housing crisis, and walking the talk on reconciliation with First Nations. For example, I would:\u07e6 develop a multi-agency housing strategy and action plan that ensures all future development on Salt Spring is delivering the housing our community actually needs and is built with climate change adaptation in mind.</p><p>\u07e6 build respectful relationships and work in trust with the many First Nations that wish to be involved in ensuring the well-being of our island for future generations.</p><p>3. Not necessarily, although the provincial review of the Islands Trust's mandate, governance and structure will ultimately daylight opportunities to the act. The fact is, the Trust hasn't fully utilized the powers it already has, and I believe we need to use these powers to coordinate the various government entities that share responsibility for addressing issues on our island like housing, equitable water resource use and watershed protection.</p><p>ELISSA POOLE 1. Dedication, civility, compromise and perseverance are essential for any work that involves people, projects and problem-solving. These aren't skills so much as character traits, but they've informed how I've approached an array of skilled professions. I've been a classical musician, journalist, editor and university teacher; I ran two ensembles, found the financing to produce their CDs and concert series, and am now working with conservationists to save an island forest and wetland. I've acquired new skills with each of these activities. So I'm not daunted by the immense work that will be required to carry out the Trust's duties. I have great respect for other people's expertise, I would never hesitate to ask for advice, and I finish what I start.</p><p>2. The Trust was founded with the explicit aim of preserving and protecting the environment. A priority is reviewing the draft Policy Statement to ensure that this original mandate is clarified and strengthened throughout, and that it addresses the climate crisis in a way that values the health and security of all life on the islands. All other priorities fall in line with this one:the housing crisis, transparency in the Trust's process, protecting coastal Douglas-fir ecosystems and watersheds.</p><p>3. Maintaining a protected area in the middle of an intensely developed urban region requires funding and cooperation at all levels. The Trust Act must be tightened, along with the Trust Policy Statement, the official community plan and the bylaws, to ensure that the Islands Trust's top priority is to protect the natural environment. That does not exclude other objectives. We need provincial and First Nations representation on Trust Council (recommended by the Governance Review Report); and the province must provide funding and legislative tools for implementing coastal Douglas-fir protection through development permit areas, for enforcement of bylaws and addressing our housing crisis.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUDFWD-news20221005PGWA0003031390</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUDFWD2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:677F-XV51-JD2C-J16V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484148</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

The dominant gold-hosting stratigraphy consists of felsic sediments and volcanic units.</p><p>About Great Bear</p><p>Great Bear Resources Ltd. is a well-financed gold exploration company managed by a team with a track record of success in mineral exploration.

This bylaw, 2022-005 \u201cNatural Vegetative Buffer\u201d was passed by the Hastings Highlands council at their May 4 meeting. Seasonal resident Stan Ralph and about one hundred other concerned residents have filed this appeal. It is still to be determined when this appeal will be heard by the OLT. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An appeal was submitted to the OLT and received by Hastings Highlands on June 16, by Ralph, a seasonal resident of HH for 56 years and about a hundred other shoreline residents who disagree with the provisions of the bylaw. With this appeal, according to the Planning Act, the contentious bylaw 2022-005 will not come into force until the appeal is either withdrawn or finally disposed of, and then it will be active retroactively to the day it was passed. Ralph says he does not know when the appeal will be heard by the OLT at this time, and that said timing is \u201centirely in their hands.\u201d </p><p>Hastings Highlands council passed bylaw 2022-005 \u201cNatural Vegetative Buffer\u201d at their meeting on May 4. Superseding comprehensive zoning bylaw 2004-035, which required a 15-metre natural vegetative barrier to be maintained along shorelines in the municipality. This new bylaw now required a 30-metre barrier to be in place along the shorelines, aligning with the Hastings County Official Plan, which was updated in 2017. Ontario\u2019s Planning Act, subsections 26(9) and 27(1) stipulate this change to the bylaw to adhere to the County\u2019s Official Plan. </p><p>Bylaw 2022-005 was submitted in a report by municipal planner John Jardine at the April 6 meeting, and council proceeded with the change to the zoning bylaw to conform to the County\u2019s official plan on the advice of their legal counsel, Cunningham Swan LLP. </p><p>As stated, the amended bylaw requires 30 metres versus the current 15 metres of vegetation, with a clearing permitted for water access. Septic systems must also conform to this 30-metre distance from the shore. Aside from septic systems and buildings, docks, boathouses and boat launches must also be 30 metres from the high-water mark of any water bodies. A break in this vegetative barrier of 25 per cent or 75 feet (whichever is less) was allowed under this amended zoning bylaw, for shoreline water access or a clearing. The purpose of this expansion of the vegetative buffer zone is to protect water quality, prevent blue-green algae, soil erosion and preserves the ecological balance of these aquatic environments. </p><p>Legal non-conforming uses in certain cases, or grandfathering, was also allowed under bylaw 2022-005, as long as the land use was established at a time when such use was permitted under prior zoning regulations and the structure was in use consistently since. Exceptions to this grandfathering clause are structures erected in contravention of the zoning bylaw that prohibited building closer than 15 metres from the shoreline. </p><p>Steep or unstable slopes were also not developable, and bylaw 2022-005 also changed the setback from these slopes from 15 metres to 30 metres. This change avoids loading force increases at the top of the slope, stop drainage pattern changes that could spur erosion and preclude the loss of stabilizing vegetation on the slope. </p><p>Ralph gave a presentation to Hastings Highlands council on March 2, outlining the work that his family has done for decades to preserve the environment on their property and the surrounding area. He criticized bylaw 2022-005 and asked that it not be adopted for a myriad of reasons. He also wrote a Letter to the Editor to The Bancroft Times on May 4 criticizing its passage by council that day. The main points of Ralph and his fellow appellants\u2019 criticisms are; having to allow the 30 metre barrier revert to its natural vegetative state (from the previous 15 metres), they allege that the bylaw\u2019s conformation to the Hastings County </p><p>Official Plan was not mandatory due to the language used in the Act, they allege that this bylaw will severely restrict their quiet enjoyment of this area and say it amounts to \u201cexpropriation without compensation\u201d, they allege that the bylaw is in direct opposition to HH fire department regulations, they allege that despite the open houses and soliciting input on the township website the township didn\u2019t consider differing opinions on this bylaw, and they allege that if a dead or dangerous tree was within this barrier, they\u2019d need the municipality\u2019s permission to remove it. </p><p>Ralph says that if residents are happy with the bylaw as it is, then they can do nothing, However, he asks that anyone who is interested in opposing this bylaw and supporting the OLT appeal to contact him at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:reabaigh@sympatico.ca\">reabaigh@sympatico.ca</email>, and he thanked all those who\u2019ve supported the appeal thus far. </p><p>However, at the March 2 meeting that Ralph presented at, municipal planner John Jardine did reply to some of Ralph\u2019s concerns about what was, at that time, a proposed bylaw. </p><p>With regard to Ralph\u2019s concerns that the new bylaw would contrive HH fire department regulations about having clearings around a dwelling, Jardine said he\u2019d spoken with the past fire chief Jason Post, who said that these were actually recommendations from the MNRF that had been put up online for residents to make their dwellings and properties safer, and were not regulations. </p><p>Jardine said that the bylaw would recognize any legal non-conforming structure within the 30-metre buffer and would not expect those dwelling to have any trees or shrubs close by that would increase their risk in the event of a forest fire. </p><p>\u201cThe proposed bylaw is granting exceptions to allow for clearing of 25 per cent of shoreline frontage or 23 metres whichever is lesser. So, the natural vegetative buffer is increased, but we\u2019re actually giving people more flexibility on how the space is used,\u201d he says. </p><p>As for Ralph\u2019s contention that the County\u2019s Official Plan said they \u201cshould\u201d conform to the 30-metre buffer versus \u201cmust,\u201d Jardine was adamant that the municipality\u2019s zoning bylaw has to conform to the official plan, and says that the Planning Act says should and not must or shall, as it recognizes that there are times that exceptions are needed for municipalities to grant them. </p><p>\u201cThe Planning Act says should, because otherwise, there\u2019d never be any exception granted, like someone wanting to seek a minor variance,\u201d he says. </p><p>In any event, this appeal of bylaw 2022-005 Natural Vegetative Buffer will be proceeding to an OLT hearing at some point in coming months, where Ralph and his supporters can make their case and Hastings Highlands can defend their bylaw. The Bancroft Times will keep you apprised of any further developments as they arise.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-034e7128e36b46e5902ce5d89ce225dd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65TJ-GVX1-JBVR-32WS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1124\"/><timeReceived>07:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 29, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This past year has seen a small growth from 2020, but the potential for more was snuffed out by COVID-19 restrictions, forest fires, flooding and other extreme weather.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tourism Abbotsford executive director Craig Nichols said it has been a rough two years, but there is some hope on the horizon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Tourism Abbotsford stats, tourism-related spending increased to approximately $37 million last year from $24.5 million in 2020. Nichols said the summer was not one to remember, with little to no international travel and forest fire smoke plaguing much of B.C.</p><p>\"The first half of 2021 performed as we expected. Things were slow to begin and then ramped up as regional and provincial travel restrictions eased in late spring and into summer,\"Nichols said. \"The second half of the year was anything but expected given the nearby forest fires and local floods.\"</p><p>Hotel occupancy did increase from 44 per cent in 2020 to 61.2 per cent in 2021. There was a surge in hotel occupancy in November following the extreme flooding. Hotels provided housing and shelter for many during that crisis, not to mention they became the resting spots for many emergency and support personnel.</p><p>Nichols said occupancy rate rarely dipped below 70 per cent during the time surrounding the floods. Hotels also remained busy due to ongoing pipeline work in and around the Fraser Valley.</p><p>Despite some of the doom and gloom, Nichols said there were several positive tourism-related items to come out of 2021. He pointed to activity at the Abbotsford International Airport, the arrival and success of the Abbotsford Canucks and the resilience of local businesses as encouraging.</p><p>\"The fact that the low-cost carriers have stayed in operation through the pandemic and were able to see some good business the second half of the year is a very positive sign,\"he said. \"I think that bodes well for the future of the airlines and makes the goal of two million-plus passengers through YXX in the next couple of years realistic. The most positive development during last year was the fact that so many of our local hospitality businesses survived the many challenges the pandemic brought their way. While some may not have had record-breaking years, the fact that there was enough support to sustain them is awesome.\"</p><p>On the Canucks, Nichols said having the team here during what is usually a downtime for tourism has been a great benefit to the community. He believes that when restrictions ultimately end the team will be a big showcase for Abbotsford.</p><p>\"Not only does it bring professional hockey close to local sport fans, but it will also help draw people from Metro Vancouver, the Island, and Interior regions into the community for the day and overnight. We look forward to working with the Canucks in the months and years ahead to bring new hockey fans into the community and showcase all that Abbotsford has to offer.\"</p><p>After a year without events, 2022 marks the return of events to Tradex. The facility reopened to local events in February, with more likely coming if restrictions allow them. Tradex also became a safe space for people escaping forest fires in the summer and flooding in November, when it transformed into an emergency reception centre.</p><p>With the future of Tradex in doubt (as of press deadline) -it was listed for sale or lease last year -Nichols said it's important to realize the asset that Abbotsford has in the facility.</p><p>\"Tradex is extremely important for our local economy,\"he said. \"As much as we celebrate the positive impact that AHL hockey will have, it's worth mentioning Tradex hosts upwards of 65 to 70 events spread over 150-plus event days per year with each event attracting a slightly different audience.</p><p>\"Abbotsford doesn't have beaches, lakes, resorts or large destination attractions. What it does have, though, are events, many of which occur at Tradex. We remain hopeful the facility will remain event-based and will continue to serve the community and hospitality businesses for many years to come.\"</p><p>Nichols said he believes there should be more steady growth in 2022 as the province hopefully returns to more normal times.</p><p>\"Unlike last year when it was a hopeful optimism, this time the optimism feels more certain and well-placed,\"he said.</p><p>\"There is pent-up demand in the marketplace, but what our industry needs is a prolonged period of recovery where three good months is followed by another three good months. If we can get six-plus months of sustained growth in a row, our industry will finally have a chance to begin to repair some of the damage that has been done over the past 24 months.\"</p><p>Nicols also noted that Tourism Abbotsford is asking for the community's feedback in a few months to begin work on a five-year tourism strategy for Abbotsford.

These airports also provide essential air services, more so during this Covid-19 pandemic, including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response.</p><p>The Honourable Jim Carr, Minister and Special Representative for the Prairies, on behalf of the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, today announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at airports in Alberta. </p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP), the Government of Canada will provide over $20 million to the following Alberta airports for safety-related projects:</p><p>Fort Chipewyan</p><p> Rehabilitation of airside pavement - $11,021,416</p><p>Grande Prairie</p><p> Rehabilitation of airside pavement - $11,021,416</p><p>Lethbridge</p><p> Rehabilitation of airside pavement - $11,021,416</p><p>Lloydminster</p><p> Rehabilitation of airside pavement - $11,021,416</p><p>Medicine Hat</p><p> Rehabilitation of airside pavement - $11,021,416</p><p>For 2021-2022, Transport Canada has allocated ACAP funding to 63 airports for 86 safety-related projects, \u00a0\u00a0including runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles and installing wildlife fencing. </p><p>Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over \u00a0\u00a0$1.1 billion for 1,088 projects at 199 airports across the country.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"We know how vital airports are to urban centres and remote communities. The investment our government is making will help ensure continued safe and reliable airport operations for residents, many of whom depend on their local airports not only for personal travel and business, but also for community resupply of essential goods and access to routine and emergency medical care in larger centres. This is part of how we build stronger more resilient and inclusive communities across Canada.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jim CarrMinister and Special Representative for the Prairies </p><p>\"Our Government recognizes that airports are major contributors to the economic growth and social well-being of smaller communities, and local airport workers. In addition to supporting personal travel, local airports are key connectors for business, health care, social services, and emerging resource development sectors. These investments will improve access to safe, reliable and efficient air transportation options, and will help us deliver our promise to build safer, healthier and stronger communities across Canada. This is more important than ever as we work towards reopening our economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar AlghabraMinister of Transport</p><p>Quick Facts</p><p> Rehabilitation of airside pavement - $11,021,416</p><p>Associated Links</p><p> Rehabilitation of airside pavement - $11,021,416</p><p>Transport Canada is online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tc.gc.ca\">www.tc.gc.ca</url>.

The cool, wet weather on Monday likely contributed to getting the blaze under control.</p><p>The fire was close to the Kwikwexwelhp Healing Village, which is a minimum security facility with an aboriginal focus. The fire is said to be currently moving away from that site and poses no immediate danger.</p><p>\"Sts'ailes has a communication protocol with BCFS for notifications and updates to ensure there are no risks to the community, environment, infrastructures or cultural/spiritual values,\" the message to residents said. \"Our thoughts are with the responders, the land and those affected by this. Please be safe.\"</p><p>Inez Watters lives in the area and what she witnessed this past weekend made her fear for the community.</p><p>\"You can see the smoke,\" she told Black Press on Sunday. \"It's very, very thick. I am so worried as we have elders here with asthma and also so many children. I pray that the Creator brings rain as soon as possible.\"</p><p>Amid the fear, she said she trusts the leadership at Sts'ailes, including Chief Ralph Leon Jr.</p><p>\"I'm very honored also that Sts'ailes has a very strong chief and council and many band members who are keeping our First Nations community members updated and keeping our anxiety under control,\" she said. \"One mind, One Nation, One Heart. We can all get through this as we all keep positive.\"</p><p>A second fire was discovered on Sunday in the Silver River area. The blaze is on the east side of Harrison Lake and has consumed about 16 hectares, growing from its initial reported size of one hectare, according to B.C. Wildfire Service.</p><p>The cause of both blazes remains unknown as of Monday morning.</p><p>These are the second and third wildfires in the region this season so far. The first was on Mt. Woodside on April 14.</p><p>According to B.C.

The cool, wet weather on Monday likely contributed to getting the blaze under control.</p><p>The fire was close to the Kwikwexwelhp Healing Village, which is a minimum security facility with an aboriginal focus. The fire is said to be currently moving away from that site and poses no immediate danger.</p><p>\"Sts'ailes has a communication protocol with BCFS for notifications and updates to ensure there are no risks to the community, environment, infrastructures or cultural/spiritual values,\" the message to residents said. \"Our thoughts are with the responders, the land and those affected by this. Please be safe.\"</p><p>Inez Watters lives in the area and what she witnessed this past weekend made her fear for the community.</p><p>\"You can see the smoke,\" she told Black Press on Sunday. \"It's very, very thick. I am so worried as we have elders here with asthma and also so many children. I pray that the Creator brings rain as soon as possible.\"</p><p>Amid the fear, she said she trusts the leadership at Sts'ailes, including Chief Ralph Leon Jr.</p><p>\"I'm very honored also that Sts'ailes has a very strong chief and council and many band members who are keeping our First Nations community members updated and keeping our anxiety under control,\" she said. \"One mind, One Nation, One Heart. We can all get through this as we all keep positive.\"</p><p>A second fire was discovered on Sunday in the Silver River area. The blaze is on the east side of Harrison Lake and has consumed about 16 hectares, growing from its initial reported size of one hectare, according to B.C. Wildfire Service.</p><p>The cause of both blazes remains unknown as of Monday morning.</p><p>These are the second and third wildfires in the region this season so far. The first was on Mt. Woodside on April 14.</p><p>According to B.C. Wildfire Service, a fire classified as \"out of control\" describes a wildfire having little or no response to fire suppression attempts and it still has significant likelihood of spreading.</p><p>READ MORE: Agassiz, Seabird Island firefighters contain Mt.

Nearly 400 homes and businesses, including an apartment complex, were reduced to ash and rubble when fierce winds whipped flames through town with little warning.</p><p>Here are five things we've learned about that fire 10 years ago:</p><p>How did the wildfire happen?</p><p>The Slave Lake wildfire burned through the town from May 14 to May 16, 2011.</p><p>Officials with the Alberta government announced in November 2011 that an unknown arsonist recklessly or deliberately ignited the forest fire.</p><p>Damages were pegged at $700 million &amp; - one of the country's costliest disasters.</p><p>How long did it take to clean up?</p><p>Mayor Tyler Warman says many milestones were reached within two years.</p><p>The government centre and about 80 per cent of homes were rebuilt. But Warman says it took another four years to finish roads and sidewalks.</p><p>\"We waited a couple years for people to finish construction.\"</p><p>Warman says there was a list of projects and they slowly checked them off.</p><p>\"When I look around the community, I see things rebuilt. I see new investment. I see new businesses.\"</p><p>How did it affect the town's residents?</p><p>Warman says the population hasn't changed a whole lot since the fire.</p><p>The No. 1 factor that saved the community, he says, was temporary housing that was built for residents while they rebuilt their homes.</p><p>\"It was the difference between success and failure. Without it, we would have been decimated.\"</p><p>Warman says some single people and young couples who were living in the apartment complex left, but school enrolment numbers were steady the next fall.</p><p>\"There was a pretty strong indication that the people were still here.\"</p><p>Research done after the fire showed some residents with psychological stress symptoms &amp; - particularly children. The study suggested children involved in disasters be offered counselling and assistance in recovery.</p><p>What have we learned about wildfires?</p><p>Mike Flannigan, a renewable resources professor at the University of Alberta, says the Slave Lake fire has left a legacy.</p><p>\"Fire management in Canada is among the best in the world and Alberta is among the best in Canada,\" he says. \"What has become clear is that events like Slave Lake aren't isolated events.</p><p>\"One of the politicians of the day was in the paper saying it was a one-off. It was a fluke. It won't happen again. I said the day after &amp;#x26;#8230; expect more events like this, unfortunately.'</p><p>\"It's all about the extreme conditions.\"</p><p>He says the fires in Slave Lake, Fort McMurray, Alta., and Kelowna, B.C., led to politicians paying attention.</p><p>Did anything change afterward?</p><p>Flannigan says there has been more federal funding for wildfire research.</p><p>\"Things have changed, but we still need to do more,\" he says. \"It's not going away with climate change.\"</p><p>He says more structures will be at risk if development continues in the boreal forest.</p><p>Warman adds those developments need to be prepared for emergencies and for recovery after disasters.</p><p>\"A good plan is better than a quick plan.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-4154990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62MW-F371-F103-3187-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors.

Another 23 were arrested on Tuesday, including four who were removed from under a vehicle they had attached themselves to earlier in the day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of the arrestees both days had been arrested previously.</p><p>Police said that in addition to the arrests, several people requested assistance with leaving the area, and police helped transport them and their gear out.</p><p>The Rainforest Flying Squad, the group behind the old-growth logging protests, reported that three separate camps were raided on Monday, including their headquarters. RFS spokesperson Kathleen Code said that the camps were still standing \u201cin some form or another\u201d after the police action, and that protesters had been given 24 hours to vacate the area. Police had also put up a gate on the road to headquarters, establishing an exclusion zone that protesters say is illegal.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not intending to stand down,\u201d Code said. \u201cWe\u2019ve put out the call to the public to come and help defend.\u201d</p><p>The raids came as supporters of the blockades held a one-year anniversary celebration on the grounds of the Legislature in Victoria.</p><p>About 300 people attended the rally, which was led by Indigenous leaders and scientists.</p><p>\u201cThe rally [Monday] confirmed that we need to be there,\u201d Code said. \u201cIt really confirmed our determination and resolve to be there, especially with [Pacheedaht elder Bill Jones\u2019s] approval and guidance.\u201d</p><p>Bill Jones has been a vocal supporter of the protests and blockades, while Pacheedaht\u2019s elected chief councillor Jeff Jones, and Frank Queesto Jones, who is recognized by council as the hereditary chief, have repeatedly asked the protesters to leave their traditional lands.</p><p>Police say more arrests are anticipated at Fairy Creek, and that they are monitoring the situation from the ground and air. RCMP air support provided photos of several vehicles being used to block the roads within the injunction area, which raised further concerns for the police.</p><p>\u201cThe use of vehicles to block roadways is not only a breach of the court-ordered injunction, but creates serious difficulties for the local fire department to access those roadways in the event of a forest fire,\u201d Chief Supt. John Brewer, Gold Commander of the Community-Industry Response Group said on Monday.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also, once again, relaying my tremendous concern about the deep trenches that have been dug up in the middle of the roads to purposefully obstruct their use by loggers and police who are trying to enforce the injunction. The damage created to these roads will undoubtedly hinder emergency crews from providing necessary assistance to protesters and general public in the area.\u201d</p><p>Brewer reiterated his concerns about the roads on Tuesday, and mentioned piles of garbage that are being strewn about by the protesters.</p><p>\u201cThe destruction of the roads with these massive trenches being dug up by protesters, as well as the piles of garbage being scattered is appalling,\u201d he said. \u201cFor people who claim to be stewards of the land, they have certainly created severe environmental damages to these grounds, which will take great efforts to clean up.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COWCIT-news20210812PPYA0002057187</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COWCIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BY-SXC1-F0HF-843X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438285</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"587\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

It offered much insight to a sad situation in the Cowichan Valley. This is an opportunity for North Cowichan to take action on significant innovations vital to the difficult decisions we must make on wastewater disposal.</p><p>Cowichan Tribes have been very understanding since allowing a lagoon system on their land in the 1960s, but the agreement to cease discharge into the Cowichan River by 2021 will not be solved with a quick and dirty plan based on \"dilution is the solution\"! The long pipe is a bizarre and completely unsatisfactory outcome offered by Clay Reitsma. I wonder if a discharge pipe to Separation Channel will cheer residents of Maple Bay, Salt Spring Island and Crofton? Residents of the San Juan Islands and Seattle have sued Greater Victoria for a similar approach. The senior manager of Engineering is proposing an approach to disposing sewage effluent Greater Victoria is only now solving with a new plant at Mcloughlin Point. In 2021 when the Esquimalt plant goes into operation it will make the Cowichan Valley the worst water polluter on Canada's west coast!</p><p>This catastrophe must be a call to action for our MLA and MP as well. Cowichan's wastewater environmental challenge could become a significant local economy builder &amp; - a green solution with benefits! This is a chance for North Cowichan to explore federal and provincial support as we search for ways out of the COVID Depression. Building infrastructure for the Cowichan Valley is exactly what is required at this time. To suggest the lagoons are a \"secondary/tertiary hybrid\" is a dangerous exaggeration. Plan to build a proper tertiary plant able to separate dangerous and beneficial materials while producing recycled water.

Reporter Sarah Simpson has been combing through old newspapers with the assistance of the Kaatza Station Museum and Archives so we can jog your memory, give you that nostalgic feeling, or just a chuckle, as we take a look at what was making headlines this week around Cowichan Lake in years gone by.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week around the Cowichan Lake area\u2026</p><p>10 years ago</p><p>It was beginning to look at lot like graduation time, a decade ago this week in Lake Cowichan. \"Raising funds for a dry grad event\" was the headline in the April 4, 2012 edition of the Lake Cowichan Gazette, and it seems the students did well with their bottle drive.</p><p>\"Saturday's dry-grad fundraiser went off without a hitch, collecting nearly $1,000 in bottles from local Cowichan Lake residents,\" wrote Tammy Caruso. \"Julie Foster, dry-grad coordinator says the grads still have many fundraising activities planned to raise money before they head out from June 28 to June 30 to go white water rafting near Hell's Gate in the Fraser Canyon on the mainland. Volunteers and grad students attended Saturday's event to help drive and collect from all areas in and surrounding Lake Cowichan.</p><p>\"LCSS and the graduating class are appreciative for all of the continued support that aids in making the dry grad event a success.\"</p><p>Teenagers dominated the headlines of that paper, it seems as the second story was about teen hockey.</p><p>\"High performance players gather at the Lake,\" wrote Dennis Skalicky.</p><p>\"There was a full house at the Cowichan Lake Sports Arena on the weekend as the male Under 16 Region Camp was held locally. Players from Vancouver Island and the Central Coast were in town at the camp that is designed to instruct and prepare players for future opportunities in the High Performance Program. This is a great opportunity for kids to play against players from outside their own association and for the best to play the best.</p><p>\"Lake Cowichan was chosen because of the access to ice time and that it is a central location on the south part of the Island where most of the players come from. You could almost feel the tension in the air as the players waited for their final interviews on Sunday afternoon to see who made the team.\"</p><p>25 years ago</p><p>\"Small school district 'no longer justifiable' says former SB chair\" graced the front page of the April 2, Lake News. Things sure changed in between the announcement the boards would join and the actual combining of the two, the paper explained.</p><p>\"It has been four months since School Boards #65 and #66 amalgamated to form Cowichan Valley School District #79. Our local trustees' opinions on amalgamation vary, with trustee Pat Weaver being the most outspoken opponent. With the exception of Weaver, what is now being said about amalgamation, is greatly different than one year ago.</p><p>\"Trustee Wilma Rowbottom has now a more optimistic attitude towards the amalgamation. Rowbottom, who was chairman of School District #66 prior to amalgamation, and who, just over a year ago described herself as 'dead' when she learned of the amalgamation announcement, says now that small school districts are no longer justifiable. The problems that have arisen with amalgamation such as the complexity of the changeover and the costs involved, will be worth the effort once things are worked out and running smoothly she says.\"</p><p>In other news of 25 years ago, the winners of the Lake News's Easter Colouring Contest were named. Do you recognize any of these folks? They'll be much older now!</p><p>In the 5-6-year-old category, Jeannie Bogaards took first with Serene Zabok and Mandie Foster second and third.</p><p>In the 7-8-year-old group, Marissa McCallum won with Cari-lynn Yablonski and Matthew Foster second and third.</p><p>Jenny Johel took the 9-10-year-old group beating out runners-up Jocelyn Lundberg and Mark Edwards.</p><p>\"The work was exceptional, and it was obvious that many children spent a lot of time on their projects,\" said the paper.</p><p>Wondering what those kids are up to today\u2026</p><p>40 years ago</p><p>A hero got his due this week 40 years ago, according to the Lake News of March 31, 1982.</p><p>\"Hero logger rewarded after local fire drama\" was the headline but it wasn't a soap opera type of drama. It was a matter of life and death and deserving of some serious kudos.</p><p>\"A Victoria logger who rescued a Mesachie Lake co-worker from a forest fire last October has been given an award for bravery by the Workers' Compensation Board. Lyle Hallberg was fighting a fire at Harris Creek in the B.C. Forest Products Renfrew division when Will Goranson of Mesachie Lake was hit by a burning tree. Goranson's clothes caught fire and his hands and arms were burned. The wind changed direction, putting the men in danger. Gornanson couldn't make it to safety, because of his injuries, so Hallberg returned to drag him out. Witnessess said Goranson would have died if it were not [for] Hallberg's action. Hallberg received a plaque, a bronze medallion and a $1,000 cheque.\"</p><p>Wow!</p><p>And finally, in the same edition, \"Lake Cowichan village council has decided that the village should not have to pay $25,000 extra because a contracting firm ran into additional costs while constructing the new village water pump house. On the recommendation of its engineering firm, council decided March 23 not to accede to a claim by Standard General Construction Ltd. that the extra should be paid to cover a costly 'sheet-piling' experiment. The construction firm had taken a sample of the soil fairly close to the sight of the pumping station to determine what sort of ground it had to work with. Once excavation started, however, it was discovered that the ground was denser and wetter than had been expected.\"</p><p>The error cost the firm $25,000.</p><p>Oops.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sarah.simpson@cowichanvalleycitizen.com\">sarah.simpson@cowichanvalleycitizen.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2022 Lake Cowichan Gazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECG-news20220403PLC4303335</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECG2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:654V-XWS1-JD2C-J0CY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"968\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

His family is also unable to secure insurance for its trapping cabins due to forest fire risk. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's not just the cabin and financial loss. It's a way of life that's being challenged and interrupted,\" Barks said. </p><p>He's one of the northern trappers stuck contending with a lack information on wildfire threats to his property. Years of work could be wiped away in an instant with little warning. </p><p>This year's wildfire season more than doubled the five-year average with 530 fires as of Friday afternoon, forcing evacuations and impacting trappers' livelihoods and ways of life. </p><p>It's why Barks takes comfort in the mapping his son Dale has prepared with his training as a biology graduate student at the University of Saskatchewan. Using data from two satellite systems, Dale is regularly updating detailed local maps that account for information like trails, vegetation and waterways. </p><p>Dale began making the maps after he found Saskatchewan's wildfire web mapping and other sources weren't providing information as quickly as he would have liked. The extra information offers advanced warning if a property is at risk, Dale said. </p><p>That's a familiar concern. A fire has wiped out about half of a trapline that he and his brother operate, turning the forest into a patch of trees and miles of unbroken burned hills, Dale said. </p><p>In a prepared statement, Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency spokesperson Karri Kempf said the province keeps fire base and provincial duty desks that coordinate resources and information to and from the field. Personnel receive daily briefings and ground crews keep radios for communication, she said. </p><p>Kempf encouraged residents collecting valuables from threatened property to contact their local protection base for information and advice, and for concerned residents to visit the SPSA's website. </p><p>Traditional use cabins are registered with the Ministry of Environment and shared with SPSA, she said, adding that people with unregistered cabins should notify the province. Monitoring fire is \"a shared responsibility\" with the aim \"to reduce risk to personnel property and stay safe,\" Kempf said. </p><p>While Randy Barks is appreciative of fire teams' work, he thinks there can be a lack of communication between government agencies that limits fire response. In one case, he remembers when a neighbour's cabin went up in flames despite fire teams working in the area. It's why more warning would be welcome. </p><p>\"It's still not communicated within departments (or) between departments,\" Barks said. \"There's absolutely no reason any cabin should have been lost there.\" </p><p>Saskatchewan Trappers Association President Wrangler Hamm says he plans to push for the government to share more information with trapping representatives who could be affected by wildfires. </p><p>Until then, Lyle Munro, who is the STA's local director in the Nipawin area, is another trapper who doesn't know what has happened to his property. He wishes there was more of a warning system that would allow him to collect his assets and set sprinkler systems before leaving for safety. </p><p>\"We got to call in all the time just to try and figure out what's going on,\" he said. \"It's a scary situation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-d163248cb78a434dbd8d29c7e152aa69</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BG-1261-DY9S-T05N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"581\"/><timeReceived>10:53 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 9, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>STX001990</classCode><className>SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS177</classCode><className>SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Summers are long, winters are short and mild, and the amenities are superb. It's no wonder the population and development in the Okanagan and Interior of B.C. are soaring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many communities were built bordering or completely within wildland areas with homes positioned among the trees on the mountain slopes. However, there is an ever-looming risk of living in this paradise, one intensified in recent years with the changing climate. Nowhere in Canada have wildfires been \u2013 or have the potential to continue to be \u2013 quite as catastrophic in both human and economic toll as the Interior of British Columbia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mike Pritchard has seen the evolution of the Okanagan landscape and its wildfires first-hand. Growing up he spent his days on horseback on mountainous rangeland around Kelowna, where his ranching family had tenure to graze their cattle. Today some the area's highest-end housing developments are nestled on the same slopes.</p><p>During a 30-year career with BC Wildfire Services, Mike led fuel management initiatives and fought fires throughout the Okanagan, while maintaining a small ranch on the side. Presently, in what he calls 'retirement', Mike works as a Project Coordinator for the British Columbia Cattlemen's Association (BCCA), marrying his experience by reducing wildfire risk with a little-known tool \u2013 cattle.</p><p>\"Ranchers and those with wildfire experience have known for years that grazed areas can slow or turn a fire,\" said Pritchard, \"but we needed to be able to prove this.\" An initiative led by the BCCA set out to put science to these claims. The association brought together municipalities, researchers and ranchers to collaborate on a series of targeted grazing pilot projects in areas at high-risk for wildfires like Kelowna, Cranbrook and Summerland.</p><p>Fuel management, then and now</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the primary fuel management strategy in BC has been the thinning of dense conifer stands. After thinning, the ground between the remaining trees is exposed to more rain and sunlight allowing grass growth to take off. Without maintenance, grass becomes an extremely volatile fuel type, especially as it cures over the summer. According to Pritchard, \"thinning conifers without follow up maintenance of grass essentially just traded one fuel type for another.\"</p><p>Other fuel management strategies like controlled burns don't work well close to urban settings. The practice is logistically difficult to carry out and there is always the inherent risk of unintended fire spread. Controlled burns are also smoky and unpopular with residents. Smoke can be a nuisance as well as a threat to human health, especially for certain at-risk populations.</p><p>Targeted grazing \u2013 or turning out cattle for two to three weeks in an area needing fuel management -works where other common techniques do not. Grazed grass is far less likely to burn. \"Think of your lawn,\" explains Pritchard, \"if you don't mow it, the grass will grow, dry out and go to seed. Mowing it encourages regrowth and keeps it in a vegetative state.\" Intense, short-term grazing mimics the natural disturbance of traditional grazers with which the land evolved. It also provides co-benefits like nutrient distribution through manure, as well as the formation of diverse grass canopy heights favoured by wildlife. Grazing cattle and wildlife cohabitate next to urban areas, preserving the nature that residents seek in the Okanagan, close to home.</p><p>Targeted grazing will not prevent a forest fire; it reduces the risk of a fire starting. If one does start, the grazed fuel break provides the opportunity for firefighters to bring the fire under control before it becomes a dangerous crown fire where the entire length of the tree burns. This is especially important in communities built on mountainsides like those around Lake Okanagan. Wind systems that form over mountainous terrain follow a diurnal cycle of heating and cooling, meaning air moves up the mountain during the day, and down the mountain at night. This natural phenomenon often leads fire to slip into communities at night unexpectedly and when firefighting resources are limited. Air resources like water bombers are unable to be used in the dark of night. By sunrise, destruction can be already widespread.</p><p>Fire fuels community spirit in ranchers</p><p>Ranchers Keith and Marnie Manders were impacted by fire two years in a row. \"My wife woke up at four o'clock in the morning and saw flames coming down the mountain. You can imagine how we felt,\" said Keith. That night, the Manders experienced the dangerous combination of fire and the diurnal effect firsthand. They were lucky the structures on their property were spared, thanks to Keith's recent decision to graze up to the edges of their property.</p><p>The Manders' cattle made it to safety, but the family lost a significant amount of their spring grazing rangeland to fire. When Keith learned about the targeted grazing pilot projects, he was all hands on deck, offering his grazing leases and cattle. \"It feels so good to be involved in something positive for the community and show that we can play a role in keeping its members safe.\"</p><p>Managing cattle so close to an urban area meant an extra workload for Keith. His personal cellphone number was displayed on signage around the community so people could call if they had questions about the cattle. Spring-loaded pedestrian and equine gates were installed in areas where recreation trails overlapped with targeted grazing land.</p><p>Watering stations for cattle were brought in where necessary and remained in place after cattle were moved out for use by horses and dogs.</p><p>The pilot projects saw cattle grazing right up to backyard fences of homes, the periphery of golf courses and borders around vineyards, all to reduce fire risk. \"People noticed the buffers grazing created,\" said Keith. \"Once you show people, they're fully on board. It was the consultation process and creating awareness and buy-in ahead of grazing that was a challenge.\"</p><p>Scientific results from the projects are also becoming available, with preliminary data showing the fine fuel load was effectively reduced by 30 to 40 per cent without any degradation of the Okanagan ecosystem.</p><p>The 'when' not 'if' of fire in B.C.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, B.C. has experienced several record-breaking fire seasons. Together, fires in 2017 and 2018 released three times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than from all the province's fossil fuel burning sources combined. As the occurrence and magnitude of wildfires have grown, the human and economic tolls have followed. The price of fires is largely borne by urban centres. While the government of BC continues to invest huge sums of money into wildfire mitigation, it's clear that a diverse array of strategies is needed, and that targeted grazing should be included.</p><p>There is tremendous potential to replicate this mitigation strategy in other parts of the province. Around Lake Okanagan alone, there are wildland areas in dire need of fine fuel management and brimming with urban interface areas. With fencing, access to water and a champion to lead local initiatives, cattle can graze nearly anywhere there's grass. Similar targeted grazing initiatives in Montana have even received investment from insurance companies, which have an inherent interest in reducing fire damage to homes. To move targeted grazing from a pilot project to routine practice in B.C., more of such support is needed.</p><p>Targeted grazing makes sense. It protects forest infrastructure and ecology; it supports local food production; it also contributes to the protection of life and communities. You could say targeted grazing in interface areas is a match made in paradise, to protect paradise - such as the Okanagan.</p><p>The short documentary, \"Too Close to Home\" can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tooclosetohome.ca\">www.tooclosetohome.ca</url></p><p>Lynsay Beavers writes about both the beef and dairy sectors in Canada.</p><p>_______________</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:news@starjournal.net\">news@starjournal.net</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook</p><p>Copyright 2022 Barriere Star Journal</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BARSTR-news20220723PBA4350367</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BARSTR2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:660H-P9X1-F0HF-83D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1349\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Despite a long history of helping out, both need all hands on deck to battle rampant wildfires on either side of the border, says a Natural Resources Canada background memo obtained by The Canadian Press.</p><p>Both the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre and its U.S.counterpart are at Level 5 of the \u201cnational preparedness\u201d scale, the highest tier, \u201cindicating a deficit of personnel in both countries,\u201d the memo says.</p><p>\u201cWithin that context, neither country has been able to share resources with each other.\u201d</p><p>Both will continue to be able to access other international resources if necessary, the memo notes \u2014 indeed, about 100 firefighters from Mexico recently arrived in B.C. , joining a number of Canadian Armed Forces personnel \u2014 but the situation points to a challenge that\u2019s only going to get worse.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s two outlooks to think about:the first is the outlook for the rest of the summer, and the outlook for the rest of the summer is hot and dry,\u201d said James Johnston, a forest management and wildfire expert at Oregon State University.</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s the outlook for summers to come, and that outlook is even hotter and drier.\u201d</p><p>Last year, Canada sent 529 frontline crew members, 62 supervisory teams and a number of aircraft to help the U.S.battle a slew of fires across hard-hit California, Oregon and much of the Pacific Northwest, the backgrounder noted.</p><p>This year, however, both countries have their hands full:in B.C. alone, where 269 active fires were reported Wednesday, experts are anticipating the worst summer in the province in more than 70 years. Across the Prairie provinces, more than 160 fires are burning in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and northwest Ontario.</p><p>All told, Canada\u2019s currently active wildfires have consumed about 1.2 million hectares of territory, an area twice the size of Prince Edward Island.</p><p>In 14 different states across the U.S., meanwhile, about 21,000 firefighters are battling 96 fires, including 24 large blazes in Montana and 20 in Idaho.</p><p>\u201cThe demand from the 2021 fire season shows we both need more resources in the future,\u201d the Natural Resources memo says.</p><p>The situation is serious enough to have come up in a phone conversation Monday between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Joe Biden, who agreed that it\u2019s beyond time to come up with a different approach.</p><p>In addition to their shared focus on mitigating climate change, the memo says the two countries are discussing a \u201cco-ordinated investment program\u201d to increase the pool of trained firefighters.</p><p>\u201cGiven that we are seeing longer, more intense fire seasons due to climate change and a resulting strain on resources, Canada and the U.S.are looking at ways to address these challenges in a co-ordinated way,\u201d it says.</p><p>Canada is also working on a \u201cblueprint\u201d for North American collaboration on the science surrounding wildfires, based on a proposal developed by Natural Resources Canada and the U.S. Forest Service in conjunction with experts from all three countries.</p><p>\u201cCanada is continuing to look at ways to work collaboratively with the United States as well as other partner countries to develop innovative solutions, increasing global capacity to respond, and reducing the vulnerability from catastrophic wildfires.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20210805RDA0002046719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:639C-NBW1-JD2C-J28S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"578\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

These results partially offset the effects of high volatility in the price of our key inputs\", explained Arturo Guti\u00e9rrez, Chief Executive Officer of Arca Continental.</p><p>As we look ahead in 2022, we will remain focused on maintaining the growth momentum in sales through the use of innovative and sustainable commercial strategies that meet the needs of our customers and consumers, in order to continue delivering solid financial and operating results that exceed the expectations of our shareholders\", he added.</p><p>ESG</p><p>In Mexico, Arca Continental, in an alliance with Fundaci\u00f3n Coca-Cola and World Wildlife Fund, signed an agreement to develop sustainable aquifers using nature-based solutions that will help increase the availability of water in the state of Chihuahua.We reinforced our commitment to reduce the use of resin in plastic packaging, becoming the first bottler in North America to lightweight our 12-ounce PET presentation from 22 to 14 grams, by using state-of-the art technology that incorporates an ultra-thin protective layer of glass in the insides of these bottles.In Ecuador, we closed the program \"Agua por el Futuro\" (or \"Water for the Future\") in the Carmen de Jad\u00e1n de Ecuador community, where we carried out activities to protect 14 water sources and restore 49 hectares.Through the initiative \"Programa DAR\", we trained over 2,000 people in inclusive recycling best practices, setting up four new collection centers in the cities of Quito and Guayaquil and carrying out three programs to recover waste. As of result of this project, we were able to recover more than 2,000 tons of waste, 45% of which was PET.During 1Q22, we launched the campaign \"El Amor Multiplica\" (or \"Love Multiplies\"), a project in which we develop initiatives under four categories: fostering female talent, community wellness, protection of water and a culture of recycling. Through this initiative, we have supported more than 400 thousand women and entrepreneurs with training programs, thus generating over 100 thousand new jobs.In Argentina, we donated 20,000 liters of water to firefighter and volunteers that worked to put out the forest fire that covered nearly 10% of the total area of the Corrientes.</p><p>RECENT EVENTS</p><p>On March 31, 2022, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's ratified the credit ratings of AC and AC Bebidas at \"mxAAA\" with stable outlook, the highest rating in Mexico.On April 1, 2022, Arca Continental announced that in 2022 it planned to invest more than Ps. 12,000 million, allocated towards strengthening and innovating production, distribution, and execution capabilities, as well as digitalization and sustainability projects. Of the total investment amount, approximately 50% will go to initiatives aimed at strengthening operations in Mexico, and the other 50% to various projects in the U.S. and South America.On April 1, 2022, Arca Continental's Annual Shareholders' Meeting approved a cash dividend of Ps. 3.18 per share, in a single payment beginning April 19, 2022, equivalent to a total of Ps. 5,610 million, representing a payout ratio of 46%.At the Annual Shareholders' Meeting held on April 1, 2022, the cancellation of 19,976,442 shares, representing 1.1% of total shares outstanding was approved.

(\"Trican\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce its first quarter results for 2023. The following news release should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&amp;A\"), the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes of Trican for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as well as the Annual Information Form (\"AIF\") for the year ended December 31, 2022. All of these documents are available on SEDAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS //st * Trican's results for the quarter were significantly improved with continued strong industry and moderating inflation leading to a more sustainable margin profile resulting in improvements in all major financial categories:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Revenue was $297.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a 36% increase compared to $218.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.</p><p>* Adjusted EBITDAS1 and adjusted EBITDA1 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $82.9 million and $81.6 million, compared to $42.0 million and $38.9 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2022.</p><p>* Free cash flow1 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $69.5 million compared to $30.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.</p><p>* Profit for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $46.0 million compared to $13.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. * The Company's balance sheet remains in excellent shape with positive working capital, including cash, of $180.6 million at March 31, 2023 compared to $169.4 million at December 31, 2022, providing significant financial flexibility. * Trican operates the newest, most technologically advanced fleet of fracturing equipment in Canada and successfully deployed Canada's first next generation fracturing fleets in 2022. This was accomplished by significantly upgrading existing equipment and incorporating CAT Tier 4 Dynamic Gas Blending (\"DGB\") engine technology. The Tier 4 DGB engine displaces up to 85% of the diesel used in a conventional pumper with cleaner burning and less expensive natural gas resulting in lower overall fuel cost and reduced carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions. The upgrades also include industry leading continuous duty pumps (3,000 HHP) and idle reduction technology packages which enable longer pumping times and improved operating efficiencies.</p><p>* Trican began the year operating three fleets of Tier 4 DGB equipment for a total of 126,000 HHP and is extremely pleased with the operational and financial performance of these assets.</p><p>* During the first quarter of 2023, Trican's fourth Tier 4 DGB fleet (42,000 HHP) was deployed into the field bringing Trican's total Tier 4 DGB fleet to 168,000 HHP.</p><p>* Upgrades to Trican's fifth Tier 4 DGB fleet (42,000 HHP) are underway with equipment anticipated to be field ready by early 2024 which will bring Trican's total tier 4 DGB fleet to 210,000 HHP.</p><p>* Tier 4 upgrades are a key component of Trican's Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") strategy. Our ongoing ESG initiatives, including fleet upgrades, will reduce our environmental impact, improve efficiency and reduce our emissions profile thereby improving the sustainability of our operations and supporting our key customers in achieving their ESG goals.</p><p>RETURN OF CAPITAL //st * The Company continues to be active in its normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") program as a key component of its return of capital strategy:</p><p>* During the three months ended March 31, 2023, Trican repurchased and cancelled 9,844,000 common shares, at a weighted average price of $3.31 per share, equating to approximately 4% of 229,776,553 outstanding shares at December 31, 2022.</p><p>* On October 3, 2022, the Company announced the renewal of its NCIB program, commencing October 5, 2022, to purchase up to 23.1 million common shares for cancellation before October 4, 2023, subject to the TSX NCIB rules. All common shares repurchased under the NCIB are returned to treasury for cancellation. As at March 31, 2023, the Company had repurchased and cancelled 12,867,900 common shares under the 2022-2023 program. Subsequent to March 31, 2023, the Company repurchased an additional 1,667,700 common shares.</p><p>* Since the initiation of our NCIB programs in 2017, Trican has repurchased 134,679,999 common shares, equating to approximately 39% of total shares outstanding at the start of the NCIB programs. * The Company has added an additional component to its return of capital strategy by instituting a quarterly dividend program:</p><p>* During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company paid a cash dividend of $0.04 per share, or approximately $8.9 million in aggregate to shareholders.</p><p>* On May 11, 2023, the Company's board of directors approved a dividend of $0.04 per share with distribution to be made on June 30, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2023. The dividends are designated as eligible dividends for Canadian income tax purposes.</p><p>FINANCIAL REVIEW //st ($ millions, except $ per share amounts.

The Company's preliminary 2023 growth, maintenance, and infrastructure capital budget has been set at $113.8 million. Capital expenditures are funded with available cash resources and free cash flow.</p><p>Financial Position</p><p>We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet with significant positive working capital including cash. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow and our financial flexibility will allow us to execute our strategic plans including investment in our Tier 4 DGB upgrade program, continued participation in our NCIB program, and the payment of a quarterly dividend as a part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy which includes a consistent return of capital to our shareholders.</p><p>OUTLOOK</p><p>Our outlook for the industry remains consistent with our views outlined in Trican's fourth quarter 2022 MD&amp;A. Global demand for oil and natural gas is expected to remain strong and will likely grow as the world's major economies continue to rely on petroleum products for many products that people use for modern day life. Oil and natural gas derivatives are used as the basis for a variety of products including mobile phones, life-saving medical supplies, fuel for cars and trucks, energy to power factories, heat homes and buildings. Ongoing geopolitical tensions have driven many countries to focus on securing reliable sources of energy that are developed in an environmentally sustainable manner. Given our high environmental and regulatory standards, Canada will play an increasingly important role as a supplier of choice for both oil and natural gas. Additional export capacity is in the late stages of construction through the Trans Mountain pipeline, the Coastal GasLink Pipeline and several LNG export facilities on the west coast of Canada to ensure that Canada is well positioned to provide a long-term supply of sustainably developed oil and natural gas to the world. These factors serve to provide a positive backdrop for oil and natural gas development activity in Western Canada and the associated oilfield services required as we move through 2023 and beyond.</p><p>Despite significant commodity price volatility, activity levels in the first quarter of 2023 were very strong. Financial sector stresses and perceived recessionary risk factors were somewhat mitigated by a proactive supply cut of oil from OPEC+ members coupled with issues involving Russian oil supply. Some customers were not able to complete their anticipated first quarter programs due to cold weather delaying operations at the beginning of 2023 and the relatively rapid onset of spring break-up conditions. In recent years, our customers have moved to completing more of their drilling and completions activity in the second quarter due to larger multi-well pad designs. As a result, we anticipate second quarter activity to be steady as work expected to be performed in the first quarter carries forward and is completed in Q2 2023.</p><p>Trican is closely monitoring the forest fires active in Alberta. At this time, Trican's operations have not been significantly impacted by fire interruptions. We will continue to monitor forest fire activity as there is the potential for ongoing fire activity to cause work planned for Q2 2023 to be moved into Q3 2023.</p><p>Canadian market fundamentals remain strong for fracturing, cementing and coiled tubing services for the remainder of the year. Based on our estimates for activity in 2023, we expect the Canadian fracturing market to effectively be in balance for the first half of 2023. Recent announcements from certain First Nations in Northeastern British Columbia have provided more certainty around sustainable access for our customers. This has resulted in a rebound in well licensing that should lead to an increase in development activity starting in the second half of 2023. The Montney reservoir in Northeastern British Columbia and Northwest Alberta remains one of the premier resource plays in North America and we expect that the combination of attractive economics, future demand from LNG export facilities and improved relations with First Nations will lead to ongoing and growing activity in the play. Montney development requires large, high-pressure fracturing, cementing and coiled tubing services which should directly benefit Trican.</p><p>Trican has invested significantly in our equipment fleet over the last two years to ensure that we are on the forefront of pressure pumping technology and design in Canada. Demand for our Canadian market leading low emissions Tier 4 DGB fracturing fleets is very robust and expected to grow in 2023 as more equipment is deployed in the field. We are currently in the process of upgrading our fifth fleet of Tier 4 DGB fracturing equipment containing high pressure pumps and is anticipated to be field ready in early 2024.</p><p>To further reduce emissions and fuel costs from diesel consumption, we continue to invest and enhance our equipment offering and have recently developed fully electric versions of certain ancillary equipment required for onsite fracturing operations and are deploying them into our operations going forward. This equipment includes sand handling, fracturing blending equipment and equipment used on-site for chemical blending. We believe these ongoing technological advancements will augment our differentiation strategy and add value for our customers. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow1 as well as our financial flexibility allows for continued progress in our Tier 4 DGB and electrification upgrade program.</p><p>Industry pricing fundamentals have improved significantly over the past 12 - 18 months and we have worked hard to offset significant inflation in our cost structure. We will work diligently to ensure that we mitigate supply chain challenges such as long lead times on key parts and components. We continue to experience inflationary pressures throughout our supply chain but at a much lower rate of change than experienced in 2022. Demand for Canadian pressure pumping services remains strong, we face significant challenges in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to the oilfield services industry which has increased our operating costs.</p><p>We will continue to serve our customers with state-of-the-art equipment and generate industry-leading returns in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. In turn, this will allow Trican to focus on returning capital to our shareholders both through our ongoing NCIB program and our quarterly dividend program. We believe our ability to deliver a multi-layered return of capital strategy while maintaining a strong balance sheet will lead to long-term value creation for our shareholders.</p><p>COMPARATIVE QUARTERLY INCOME STATEMENTS //st ($ thousands, except total job count, revenue per job and crews; unaudited) March 31, Percentage March 31, Percentage December 31, Percentage Three months ended 2023 of revenue 2022 of revenue 2022 of revenue Revenue 297,035 100% 218,911 100% 236,473 100% Cost of sales Cost of sales 205,380 69% 170,046 78% 168,355 71% Cost of sales - depreciation and amortization 19,930 7% 19,514 9% 19,852 8% Gross profit 71,725 24% 29,351 13% 48,266 20% Administrative expenses 10,230 3% 10,338 5% 9,021 4% Administrative expenses - depreciation 910 -% 880 -% 903 -% Other (income) / loss (1,081) -% (181) -% 44 -% Results from operating activities 61,666 21% 18,314 8% 38,298 16% Finance costs 945 -% 337 -% 996 -% Foreign exchange loss / (gain) 62 -% (131) -% (5) -% Profit before income tax 60,659 20% 18,108 8% 37,307 16% Current income tax expense 14,614 5% - -% - -% Deferred income tax expense 11 -% 4,771 2% 11,090 5% Profit for the period 46,034 15% 13,337 6% 26,217 11% Adjusted EBITDAS1 82,878 28% 41,990 19% 60,095 25% Adjusted EBITDA1 81,631 27% 38,949 18% 59,358 25% Total job count 2,089 2,257 1,985 Revenue per job 142,190 96,992 119,130 Total proppant pumped (tonnes) 440,000 375,000 286,000 Hydraulic pumping capacity (HHP) 529,000 576,000 529,000 Hydraulic fracturing - active crews 7.0 7.0 7.0 Hydraulic fracturing - parked crews 5.0 5.0 5.0 1 Refer to the Non-GAAP disclosure section of this news release for further details.</p><p>Sales Mix - % of Total Revenue //st Three months ended (unaudited) March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 December 31, 2022 Fracturing 76% 77% 72% Cementing 17% 15% 19% Coiled Tubing 7% 8% 8% Other -% -% 1% Total 100% 100% 100%</p><p>NON-GAAP MEASURES</p><p>Certain terms in this News Release, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDAS, adjusted EBITDA percentage, adjusted EBITDAS percentage and free cash flow, do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS and therefore, are considered non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAS</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP term and has been reconciled to profit / (loss) for the applicable financial periods, being the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Management utilizes adjusted EBITDA to translate historical variability in the Company's principal business activities into future financial expectations. By isolating incremental items from net income, including income / expense items related to how the Company chooses to manage financing elements of the business, taxation strategy and non-cash charges, management can better predict future financial results from our principal business activities.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDAS is a non-GAAP term and has been reconciled to profit / (loss) for the applicable financial periods, being the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Management utilizes adjusted EBITDAS as a useful measure of operating performance, cash flow to complement profit / (loss) and to provide meaningful comparisons of operating results.</p><p>The items included in this calculation of adjusted EBITDA have been specifically identified as they are non-cash in nature, subject to significant volatility between periods, and / or not relevant to our principal business activities. Items adjusted in the non-GAAP calculation of adjusted EBITDA, are as follows: //st * Non-cash expenditures, including depreciation, amortization, impairment of non-financial assets, and equity-settled share-based compensation; * Consideration as to how the Company chose to generate financial income and incur financial expenses, including foreign exchange expenses and finance costs; * Taxation in various jurisdictions; and * Other income / expense which generally results from the disposition of equipment, as these transactions generally do not reflect quarterly operational field activity.</p><p>The item adjusted in the non-GAAP calculation of adjusted EBITDAS from adjusted EBITDA, is as follows: //st * Cash-settled share-based compensation.

These measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers and should not be viewed as a substitute for measures reported under IFRS. These financial measures are reconciled to IFRS measures in the Non-GAAP disclosure section of this news release.

Maintenance capital are expenditures in respect of capital additions, replacements or improvements required to maintain ongoing business operations. Growth capital refers to expenditures primarily for new items and/or equipment that will expand our revenue and/or reduce our expenditures through operating efficiencies.

It was the worst of the 71 forest fires that broke out in various parts of Greece since late Tuesday.</p><p>The nearby towns of Anavyssos and Palia Fokea were ordered evacuated as a precaution as flames headed in their direction, together with some smaller settlements in the area. Authorities provided detailed escape routes by road and many evacuees were temporarily housed in local hotels.</p><p>Fire service and local authorities said it was unclear how many buildings had been damaged in the Keratea blaze, although there had been several reports of limited damage. Thick smoke in the area reduced visibility, but there were few immediate reports of severe damage.</p><p>The fire service said about 180 firefighters took part in the effort to contain the wildfire that raged through forest, olive groves, scrub and vineyards, assisted by eight water-dropping helicopters and five planes, as well as local volunteers.</p><p>All the firefighters were to remain in the area overnight to deal with potential flare-ups.</p><p>Early Thursday, a new forest fire broke out near the village of Aghios Konstandinos, a few kilometres farther south of Keratea. About 60 firefighters were sent to the spot. Officials said the blaze was not immediately threatening inhabited areas.</p><p>Other wildfires broke out Wednesday on the islands of Andros and Thassos, and in two locations in the southern Peloponnese region where authorities ordered the evacuation of a village. Firefighters contained a blaze at the seaside resort of Nea Makri east of Athens and on the island of Crete.</p><p>Wildfires are common during Greece's hot, arid summers. In 2018, a major blaze that swept through the seaside Mati resort, near Nea Makri, caused 102 deaths.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-912e425eccae7440866dea7d36695e0f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T7-RBH1-JBVR-34M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"359\"/><timeReceived>06:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 9, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Summers are long, winters are short and mild, and the amenities are superb. It\u2019s no wonder the population and development in the Okanagan and Interior of B.C. are soaring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many communities were built bordering or completely within wildland areas with homes positioned among the trees on the mountain slopes. However, there is an ever-looming risk of living in this paradise, one intensified in recent years with the changing climate. Nowhere in Canada have wildfires been \u2013 or have the potential to continue to be \u2013 quite as catastrophic in both human and economic toll as the Interior of British Columbia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mike Pritchard has seen the evolution of the Okanagan landscape and its wildfires first-hand. Growing up he spent his days on horseback on mountainous rangeland around Kelowna, where his ranching family had tenure to graze their cattle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today some the area\u2019s highest-end housing developments are nestled on the same slopes.</p><p>During a 30-year career with BC Wildfire Services, Mike led fuel management initiatives and fought fires throughout the Okanagan, while maintaining a small ranch on the side. Presently, in what he calls \u2018retirement\u2019, Mike works as a Project Coordinator for the British Columbia Cattlemen\u2019s Association (BCCA), marrying his experience by reducing wildfire risk with a little-known tool \u2013 cattle.</p><p>\u201cRanchers and those with wildfire experience have known for years that grazed areas can slow or turn a fire,\u201d said Pritchard, \u201cbut we needed to be able to prove this.\u201d An initiative led by the BCCA set out to put science to these claims. The association brought together municipalities, researchers and ranchers to collaborate on a series of targeted grazing pilot projects in areas at highrisk for wildfires like Kelowna, Cranbrook and Summerland.</p><p>Fuel management, then and now Over the past 20 years, the primary fuel management strategy in BC has been the thinning of dense conifer stands. After thinning, the ground between the remaining trees is exposed to more rain and sunlight allowing grass growth to take off. Without maintenance, grass becomes an extremely volatile fuel type, especially as it cures over the summer. Ac-cording to Pritchard, \u201cthinning conifers without follow up maintenance of grass essentially just traded one fuel type for another.\u201d</p><p>Other fuel management strategies like controlled burns don\u2019t work well close to urban settings. The practice is logistically difficult to carry out and there is always the inherent risk of unintended fire spread. Controlled burns are also smoky and unpopular with residents. Smoke can be a nuisance as well as a threat to human health, especially for certain at-risk populations.</p><p>Targeted grazing \u2013or turning out cattle for two to three weeks in an area needing fuel management-works where other common techniques do not. Grazed grass is far less likely to burn. \u201cThink of your lawn,\u201d explains Pritchard, \u201cif you don\u2019t mow it, the grass will grow, dry out and go to seed.</p><p>Mowing it encourages regrowth and keeps it in a vegetative state.\u201d Intense, short-term grazing mimics the natural disturbance of traditional grazers with which the land evolved. It also provides co-benefits like nutrient distribution through manure, as well as the formation of diverse grass canopy heights favoured by wildlife. Grazing cattle and wildlife cohabitate next to urban areas, preserving the nature that residents seek in the Okanagan, close to home.</p><p>Targeted grazing will not prevent a forest fire; it reduces the risk of a fire starting. If one does start, the grazed fuel break provides the opportunity for firefighters to bring the fire under control before it becomes a dangerous crown fire where the entire length of the tree burns. This is especially important in communities built on mountainsides like those around Lake Okanagan. Wind systems that form over mountainous terrain follow a diurnal cycle of heating and cooling, meaning air moves up the mountain during the day, and down the mountain at night. This natural phenomenon often leads fire to slip into communities at night unexpectedly and when firefighting resources are limited. Air resources like water bombers are unable to be used in the dark of night. By sunrise, destruction can be already widespread.</p><p>Fire fuels community spirit in ranchers Ranchers Keith and Marnie Manders were impacted by fire two years in a row. \u201cMy wife woke up at four o\u2019clock in the morning and saw flames coming down the mountain. You can imagine how we felt,\u201d said Keith. That night, the Manders experienced the dangerous combination of fire and the diurnal effect firsthand. They were lucky the structures on their property were spared, thanks to Keith\u2019s recent decision to graze up to the edges of their property.</p><p>The Manders\u2019 cattle made it to safety, but the family lost a significant amount of their spring grazing rangeland to fire. When Keith learned about the targeted grazing pilot projects, he was all hands on deck, offering his grazing leases and cattle. \u201cIt feels so good to be involved in something positive for the community and show that we can play a role in keeping its members safe.\u201d</p><p>Managing cattle so close to an urban area meant an extra workload for Keith. His personal cellphone number was displayed on signage around the community so people could call if they had questions about the cattle. Spring-loaded pedestrian and equine gates were installed in areas where recreation trails overlapped with targeted grazing land.</p><p>Watering stations for cattle were brought in where necessary and remained in place after cattle were moved out for use by horses and dogs.</p><p>The pilot projects saw cattle grazing right up to backyard fences of homes, the periphery of golf courses and borders around vineyards, all to reduce fire risk. \u201cPeople noticed the buffers grazing created,\u201d said Keith. \u201cOnce you show people, they\u2019re fully on board. It was the consultation process and creating awareness and buy-in ahead of grazing that was a challenge.\u201d</p><p>Scientific results from the projects are also becoming available, with preliminary data showing the fine fuel load was effectively reduced by 30 to 40 per cent without any degradation of the Okanagan ecosystem.</p><p>The \u2018when\u2019 not \u2018if \u2019 of fire in B.C. Over the past 10 years, B.C. has experienced several record-breaking fire seasons. Together, fires in 2017 and 2018 released three times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than from all the province\u2019s fossil fuel burning sources combined. As the occurrence and magnitude of wildfires have grown, the human and economic tolls have followed. The price of fires is largely borne by urban centres. While the government of BC continues to invest huge sums of money into wildfire mitigation, it\u2019s clear that a diverse array of strategies is needed, and that targeted grazing should be included.</p><p>There is tremendous potential to replicate this mitigation strategy in other parts of the province. Around Lake Okanagan alone, there are wildland areas in dire need of fine fuel management and brimming with urban interface areas. With fencing, access to water and a champion to lead local initiatives, cattle can graze nearly anywhere there\u2019s grass. Similar targeted grazing initiatives in Montana have even received investment from insurance companies, which have an inherent interest in reducing fire damage to homes. To move targeted grazing from a pilot project to routine practice in B.C. ,</p><p>more of such support is needed.</p><p>Targeted grazing makes sense. It protects forest infrastructure and ecology; it supports local food production; it also contributes to the protection of life and communities. You could say targeted grazing in interface areas is a match made in paradise, to protect paradise-such as the Okanagan.</p><p>The short documentary, \u201cToo Close to Home\u201d can be viewed at:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tooclosetohome.caLynsay\">www.tooclosetohome.caLynsay</url> Beavers writes about both the beef and dairy sectors in Canada.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BARSTR-news20220721PRDA0002852530</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BARSTR2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6603-TD01-F0HF-84FJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1330\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Thanks to B.C. hitting many heat records and a three to four week stretch without any rain, the wildfires kicked off fast.</p><p>\"Within a few days of that heat wave, there were over a hundred fires burning, most of them caused by lightning,\" he explained.</p><p>\"The first town to go was a historic British Columbian town in the interior,\" said Collins. \"The day after that last heat record, the town went up and was gone in hours. It was heartbreaking, and hit hard because I had been through that town three days before that, and then it was just gone.\"</p><p>The town, Lytton, is said to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the province. In early August, an article in the Toronto Star reported damages to the town were estimated at $78 million. Work has begun to rebuild the town.</p><p>Some of the largest fires, about 12 or 13 of them, Collins said, were all burning in the interior of the province and stretched thousands of kilometres.</p><p>\"They're affecting so many lives and properties, and you can only do so much - there's so many of them,\" he added. \"Some are in such a remote area and there is a lot of difficulty for emergency services to access them.\"</p><p>Collins' work travels didn't take him on the highways daily, but frequently enough to see the growth and destruction of the fires. He would travel up to Prince George for a couple of weeks and then back.</p><p>\"(One of my) rotations was the scariest one because they had just opened up Highway 97 North in the town of Lytton,\" he said. \"One of my trips up, some of the fires were burning right next to the highway.

Reporter Sarah Simpson has been combing through old newspapers with the assistance of the Kaatza Station Museum and Archives so we can jog your memory, give you that nostalgic feeling, or just a chuckle, as we take a look at what was making headlines this week around Cowichan Lake in years gone by.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week around the Cowichan Lake area\u2026 10 years ago It was beginning to look at lot like graduation time, a decade ago this week in Lake Cowichan. \u201cRaising funds for a dry grad event\u201d was the headline in the April 4, 2012 edition of the Lake Cowichan Gazette, and it seems the students did well with their bottle drive.</p><p>\u201cSaturday\u2019s dry-grad fundraiser went off without a hitch, collecting nearly $1,000 in bottles from local Cowichan Lake residents,\u201d wrote Tammy Caruso. \u201cJulie Foster, drygrad coordinator says the grads still have many fundraising activities planned to raise money before they head out from June 28 to June 30 to go white water rafting near Hell\u2019s Gate in the Fraser Canyon on the mainland. Volunteers and grad students attended Saturday\u2019s event to help drive and collect from all areas in and surrounding Lake Cowichan.</p><p>\u201cLCSS and the graduating class are appreciative for all of the continued support that aids in making the dry grad event a success.\u201d</p><p>Teenagers dominated the headlines of that paper, it seems as the second story was about teen hockey.</p><p>\u201cHigh performance players gather at the Lake,\u201d wrote Dennis Skalicky.</p><p>\u201cThere was a full house at the Cowichan Lake Sports Arena on the weekend as the male Under 16 Region Camp was held locally. Players from Vancouver Island and the Central Coast were in town at the camp that is designed to instruct and prepare players for future opportunities in the High Performance Program. This is a great opportunity for kids to play against players from outside their own association and for the best to play the best.</p><p>\u201cLake Cowichan was chosen because of the access to ice time and that it is a central location on the south part of the Island where most of the players come from. You could almost feel the tension in the air as the players waited for their final interviews on Sunday afternoon to see who made the team.\u201d</p><p>25 years ago \u201cSmall school district \u2018no longer justifiable\u2019 says former SB chair\u201d graced the front page of the April 2, Lake News. Things sure changed in between the announcement the boards would join and the actual combining of the two, the paper explained.</p><p>\u201cIt has been four months since School Boards #65 and #66 amalgamated to form Cowichan Valley School District #79. Our local trustees\u2019 opinions on amalgamation vary, with trustee Pat Weaver being the most outspoken opponent. With the exception of Weaver, what is now being said about amalgamation, is greatly different than one year ago.</p><p>\u201cTrustee Wilma Rowbottom has now a more optimistic attitude towards the amalgamation. Rowbot-tom, who was chairman of School District #66 prior to amalgamation, and who, just over a year ago described herself as \u2018dead\u2019 when she learned of the amalgamation announcement, says now that small school districts are no longer justifiable. The problems that have arisen with amalgamation such as the complexity of the changeover and the costs involved, will be worth the effort once things are worked out and running smoothly she says.\u201d</p><p>In other news of 25 years ago, the winners of the Lake News\u2019s Easter Colouring Contest were named. Do you recognize any of these folks? They\u2019ll be much older now! In the 5-6-year-old category, Jeannie Bogaards took first with Serene Zabok and Mandie Foster second and third.</p><p>In the 7-8-year-old group, Marissa McCallum won with Cari-lynn Yablonski and Matthew Foster second and third.</p><p>Jenny Johel took the 9-10-year-old group beating out runners-up Jocelyn Lundberg and Mark Edwards.</p><p>\u201cThe work was exceptional, and it was obvious that many children spent a lot of time on their projects,\u201d said the paper.</p><p>Wondering what those kids are up to today\u2026 40 years ago A hero got his due this week 40 years ago, according to the Lake News of March 31, 1982.</p><p>\u201cHero logger rewarded after local fire drama\u201d was the headline but it wasn\u2019t a soap opera type of drama. It was a matter of life and death and deserving of some serious kudos.</p><p>\u201cA Victoria logger who rescued a Mesachie Lake co-worker from a forest fire last October has been given an award for bravery by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board. Lyle Hallberg was fighting a fire at Harris Creek in the B.C. Forest Products Renfrew division when Will Goranson of Mesachie Lake was hit by a burning tree. Goranson\u2019s clothes caught fire and his hands and arms were burned. The wind changed direction, putting the men in danger. Gornanson couldn\u2019t make it to safety, because of his injuries, so Hallberg returned to drag him out. Witnessess said Goranson would have died if it were not [for] Hallberg\u2019s action. Hallberg received a plaque, a bronze medallion and a $1,000 cheque.\u201d</p><p>Wow! And finally, in the same edition, \u201cLake Cowichan village council has decided that the village should not have to pay $25,000 extra because a contracting firm ran into additional costs while constructing the new village water pump house. On the recommendation of its engineering firm, council decided March 23 not to accede to a claim by Standard General Construction Ltd.that the extra should be paid to cover a costly \u2018sheet-piling\u2019 experiment. The construction firm had taken a sample of the soil fairly close to the sight of the pumping station to determine what sort of ground it had to work with. Once excavation started, however, it was discovered that the ground was denser and wetter than had been expected.\u201d</p><p>The error cost the firm $25,000. Oops.</p><p>Reporting</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECG-news20220331PQSA0002558296</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECG2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6547-2M61-F0HF-84KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"951\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

I say was because on June 30 it burned to the ground,\" Trudeau's partial remarks read, referring to a devastating stretch of days in the central B.C. community where temperatures rose to 49.6 C before the town was ignited in a forest fire.</p><p>But Brown said that although many of the structures in the village's centre are gone, the community that made up Lytton is still here.</p><p>\"Lytton still exists. Yes, 90 per cent of the downtown core of the Village of Lytton and Lytton First Nation IR 17 and 18 burned in the fire on June 30, but the community of Lytton remains strong,\" she said, adding that at least 50 people whose homes did not burn down still live in Lytton.</p><p>\"The community of Lytton, in the direct vicinity of the exclusion zone, is still very much alive.\"</p><p>Brown was born in Lytton in a house that her parents moved into in 1990.</p><p>\"This is the same house they escaped from on June 30, 2021,\" she noted.</p><p>Brown also aimed her frustrations at what she called the \"bureaucratic red tape\" that has prevented the residents from rebuilding their lives. She cited a July 1 conversation that Trudeau had with Premier John Horgan where he \"assured Premier Horgan of the Government of Canada's support for the people of Lytton and all those affected by the fires.\"</p><p>However, Brown said that aid has not been forthcoming.</p><p>\"Though you committed that support, community members have not seen it,\" she said, adding that Trudeau also chose not to stop in Lytton for any of his recent trips to B.C., included to Surrey in July, Tofino in September and to Kamloops last month.</p><p>My letter to @JustinTrudeau regarding his comments at #COP26 that there \"was a town called #Lytton\".

But the reality is that housing solutions take time. There will be bumps along the road to recovery,\" Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth said in an Oct. 27 statement.</p><p>Earlier this summer, both the province and the feds pledged to match British Columbians' donations to the Canadian Red Cross wildfire fund, up to a total of $20 million, to help those affected by wildfires across B.C., including Lytton.</p><p>Many of the other efforts however, have been grassroots, whether at the local Lytton level or by fundraising efforts across the province that have ranged from lemonade stands to GoFundMes.</p><p>The prime minister's office said that the federal government has provided aid to Lytton and the surrounding areas, citing the matching funds for the Canadian Red Cross and the immediate presence of the Canadian Armed Forces on the ground in Lytton this past summer.</p><p>\"The Canada Revenue Agency implemented emergency tax measures to support Canadians whose primary concern was taking care of their families, homes and communities,\" the PMO said in a statement. \"</p><p>Indigenous Services Canada is working with local Indigenous communities and has provided millions to support the Lytton First Nation in immediate recovery.

The purpose of this capital is to be utilized to purchase modular equipment from Easy Energy Systems, Inc. , Easy Modular Manufacturing, Inc and the other subsidiaries of DUTV. This equipment will then be leased to end customers in the form of an operating lease via a revenue share agreement to end user customers with waste streams.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The end result is that the investors and the operators essentially share in the profits of the various waste conversion processes. Hence our slogan Converting Waste into Wealth. Easy Energy Finance, Inc. is a separate company, currently owned 100% by Mark Gaalswyk , that is NOT under the DUTV public company umbrella nor part of the planned Easy Energy Systems, Inc. merger with DUTV. Its sole purpose is to raise capital to fund Modular Projects for end customers. The initial vehicle to do this was called the Easy Energy Climate Token with first go live happening this past early summer.</p><p>The Easy Energy Climate Token, though well received, with over 300 interested investors signing up to invest amounts varying from $5,000 to $50,000 each - the actual funded amounts did not reach the $100,000 minimum.</p><p>After studying this closely, it was realized when talking to potential investors that they did not like the very intensive accredited investor background checks and supporting info required by the platform that we had selected. While the platform was an extremely reputable token-focused platform, we began to realize that the platform we had selected was more of an investor club that HAD to be VERY restrictive as investors were not just signing up for a one-time investment, but were actually joining a longtime investor club.</p><p>Thus, most of the new interested investors that were coming in and signing up via our offering, were stalled out and offended by the multi-day, tedious process of becoming approved to be part of the investor club versus just a one-time investor.</p><p>Meanwhile, even though we had structured our offering to be asset based and revenue sharing ( far DIFFERENT from other tokens and crypto) we became guilty by association and sign ups slowed as the crypto crash continued to occur in the marketplace.</p><p>Realizing this, we held up pushing too excessively for the investor type show that had already filmed us and that was planning on airing or segment. We did not want the possible thousands of investors to hit the same road block of the long and tedious frustrating sign up.</p><p>To solve the above problem, we spent the last couple of months signing on with a different platform that was recommended to us by the show itself. It is much quicker and easier for investors to sign up and invest. Furthermore, on that platform we can now be a NON-block chain focused offering.</p><p>Investors will sign up initially to a traditional non crypto type investment, but the plan is to provide them the option (in the future) to tokenize it if they so choose. Thus, we should now be attractive to BOTH types of investors.</p><p>The new name of this offering is Easy Energy Climate Capital. We now have completed signing on with the new Platform and will be going live very soon with an updated PPM. Stay tuned for its release. The new offering will also lower minimum investment to $2,000.</p><p>Sales and Easy FEN Update</p><p>On the sales side, while we have many different disruptive modules for our customers in need, the fertilizer and drought conditions worldwide have led us to FIRST focus primarily on the Easy FEN and its capability to create within local coops and rural villages the exciting Liquid Microbial Fertilizer Terreplenish . To aid in this, in this past early Summer, we brought the company that owned this microbial technology (Feed Earth Now) in under our DUTV public company umbrella . That agreement has been fully executed and is in escrow while we are making the required payments. The final payment is currently scheduled for the end of this year.</p><p>While we had initially anticipated using the funds from the Easy Energy Climate Token to fund our customers Easy FEN modular systems, we were EXTREMELY delighted when the federal government created a grant program with up to $500 million dollars to focus on funding exactly the type of Regenerative Agricultural Liquid Microbial Fertilizer Production system as the Easy FEN The grant will furnish our customers up to 60% of the funds needed for such a system. The good news is the USA came up with the perfect grant.</p><p>The bad news is that we believe this created a delay in purchasing as first award recipients will not be announced until year end followed by additional recipients in the first quarter of 2023. This will delay when we expect to receiver first revenue from this product, but as 60% of the systems price could potentially be paid for by this grant - the longer term sales could likely be much greater than if we had only relied on the Easy Energy Finance, Inc. funding. To capture this opportunity, we partnered with a world class grant writing firm to begin working with our various customers.</p><p>As a sales update, we currently have approximately 30 of these $1-to-1.4-million-dollar Easy FEN systems that are in various stages of the sales, financing, grant funded pipeline. The interested customers are in the USA, Central America, South America, Africa, India, Canada, Europe and the Middle East. Along with proceeding through the sales steps, we are also signing up numerous Independent sales reps for various sales territories that are now actively seeking more customer prospects.</p><p>Sales and Auto Segmentation Update</p><p>We currently have (now two) large $86 million dollar Auto Segmentation projects that we are in the sales process with . We already announced the letter of intent project in Tennessee and we are stepping through that project. This will include applying for numerous federal grants for the project. The project should qualify nicely for Fertilizer Production Grants, various recently announced forest fire mitigation-related grants and advanced bio-fuels grants. We plan to have the matching funds provided by the Easy Energy Climate Capital investors.</p><p>In addition to the already announced Tennessee project, we have also been working the last few months on a second $86 million dollar project that is located in a foreign country. That country is having a severe problem with an open garbage disposal site attracting birds that then interfere with incoming airplanes at a large international airport. The country is also experiencing a severe fertilizer shortage crisis along with tremendous drought, and is at risk of having its foreign supplied electricity reduced.</p><p>We were approached for a solution and we believe our combined Auto Segmentation and Easy FEN modular technologies was a bulls eye solution. As 25% of municipal waste is food (birds dig in trash for food) only 4 of our Easy FEN modules could immediately help with the bird problem, allow the airport to reopen, while also creating Terreplenish to solve the pending food crisis in the country if the fertilizer shortage is not solved immediately.</p><p>The Terreplenish liquid microbial fertilizer product created locally by the Easy FEN would provide 1/3 of the fertilizer needs for 750,000 acres of crop land, while reducing water needs for crops by up to 20%!</p><p>The Auto Segmentation Modules would also convert all the remaining trash into bio fuels, low to negative carbon bio electricity, bio char, and a bio coal additive that can be mixed 1/3 with 2/3 regular coal allowing coal fired power plants to meet the Paris accords.</p><p>While doing so, it would also be sequestering up to 50,000 tons per year of CO2. It is our believe that such a project would be a model project for landfills across the world.</p><p>While we have been told that there is a strong desire for the system by the leaders of the country, the project is now awaiting final funding to become a formal order. The project is now seeking investment capital. We will let you know more on this project.</p><p>Funding</p><p>With the addition of Moe Vela as a board advisor, the doors are beginning to open up to potential world class investors. As stated before, the plan is for these investors to each invest into the sub technology verticals under the main DUTV Umbrella. Some are interested in the Easy FEN, others are excited about mitigating forest fires, others for cleaning water and still others for our coal additive to give the coal mines some longer-term value in the back up power arena. Discussions are ongoing with all of these investor groups. It is very possible that this increasing global exposure is helping some with the DUTV stock price.</p><p>Merger</p><p>As stated before, we were honored to be selected to be featured on a widely watched global television investor show. The show was recorded last June. We were told it was going to air first in July, then Sept 28. We were then told it was delayed as they did not want their other featured companies attempting to go public in the down public market.</p><p>Thus, we have been waiting for the show to air since this summer. As previously stated, this has been an impetus for delaying the merger, per previous agreements. However, a decision to move forward, regardless of the show airing or the air datesis imminent. We will let you know more on this as soon as we are able.</p><p>The management team at DUTV, as well as Easy Energy Systems and Easy Energy Finance, appreciates the continued confidence and support as we continue our vision: To convert waste into wealth .. while fueling the world, feeding the famished, and fostering environmental sustainability</p><p>About Digital Utilities Ventures Inc.:</p><p>Digital Utilities Ventures, Inc. is working to become a formidable presence in the green solutions marketplace.

After residing in Vancouver and North Vancouver for 34 years, my husband and I decided to move to a quieter, more peaceful, unpopulated area, with more green space, less traffic and more property space, and purchased a four-acre vineyard in Naramata.</p><p>We have enjoyed our 13 years here so far, but have noticed way more traffic on our only single lane Naramata Rd., loss of green space when looking east up into the hills above us, and less wildlife sighted.</p><p>The thoughts of having to contend with a very large subdivision on the Bench, more cars and people, road work, unsightly view, etc. is not what I want here.</p><p>Now the orchard at 880 Naramata Rd. has been replaced with hills of dirt for the last two years. A winery with vineyard decision would be acceptable but certainly not 300+ homes and double the cars. Heaven forbid we Naramatians have to pick up and leave in case of a forest fire in our area with only our one lane road to evacuate us. We would never get out alive. Also, delays if anyone in Naramata needed an ambulance from Penticton to Naramata and return and be stopped, delayed or detoured due to any upcoming roadwork for this site.</p><p>I hope the Penticton mayor and council members now take a good look at this new proposal and see how this will impact us Naramatians in a very negative way.</p><p>Let's keep the Naramata Bench beautiful, and peaceful with its green hills and bluffs, and not 'suburbia'. I urge everyone to 'get the word out' to all those who will be affected by this ridiculous scheme.</p><p>Sincerely and respectfully,</p><p>Barbara Smallwood, Naramata.</p><p>Do you have more to add to this?

<br/>Major blazes can also be devastating for wildlife, pushing some endangered species closer to the brink of extinction. <br/>Nearly three billion mammals, reptiles, birds and frogs were killed or harmed, for example, by Australia's devastating 2019-20 bushfires, scientists have calculated. <br/>Wildfires are made worse by climate change. <br/>Heatwaves, drought conditions and reduced soil moisture amplified by global warming have contributed to unprecedented fires in the western United States, Australia and the Mediterranean basin just in the last three years. <br/>Even the Arctic \u2014 previously all but immune to fires \u2014 has seen a dramatic increase in blazes, including so-called 'zombie fires' that smoulder underground throughout winter before bursting into flames anew. <br/>But wildfires also accelerate climate change, feeding a vicious cycle of more fires and rising temperatures. <br/>Last year, forests going up in flames emitted more than 2.5 billion tonnes of planet-warming CO2 in July and August alone, equivalent to India's annual emissions from all sources, the European Union's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reported. <br/>Compiled by 50 top experts, the report called for a rethink on how to tackle the problem. <br/>'Current government responses to wildfires are often putting money in the wrong places,' investing in managing fires once they start rather than prevention and risk reduction, said UN Environment chief Inger Andersen. <br/>'We have to minimise the risk of extreme wildfires by being prepared.' <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fworld-must-brace-for-more-extreme-wildfires-un%2Farticle&amp;linkname=World%20must%20brace%20for%20more%20extreme%20wildfires%3A%20UNhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fworld-must-brace-for-more-extreme-wildfires-un%2Farticle&amp;linkname=World%20must%20brace%20for%20more%20extreme%20wildfires%3A%20UNhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fworld-must-brace-for-more-extreme-wildfires-un%2Farticle&amp;linkname=World%20must%20brace%20for%20more%20extreme%20wildfires%3A%20UNhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fworld-must-brace-for-more-extreme-wildfires-un%2Farticle&amp;linkname=World%20must%20brace%20for%20more%20extreme%20wildfires%3A%20UNhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fworld-must-brace-for-more-extreme-wildfires-un%2Farticle&amp;title=World%20must%20brace%20for%20more%20extreme%20wildfires%3A%20UN\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fworld-must-brace-for-more-extreme-wildfires-un%2Farticle&amp;linkname=World%20must%20brace%20for%20more%20extreme%20wildfires%3A%20UNhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fworld-must-brace-for-more-extreme-wildfires-un%2Farticle&amp;linkname=World%20must%20brace%20for%20more%20extreme%20wildfires%3A%20UNhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fworld-must-brace-for-more-extreme-wildfires-un%2Farticle&amp;linkname=World%20must%20brace%20for%20more%20extreme%20wildfires%3A%20UNhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fworld-must-brace-for-more-extreme-wildfires-un%2Farticle&amp;linkname=World%20must%20brace%20for%20more%20extreme%20wildfires%3A%20UNhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fworld-must-brace-for-more-extreme-wildfires-un%2Farticle&amp;title=World%20must%20brace%20for%20more%20extreme%20wildfires%3A%20UN</url><br/>The post World must brace for more extreme wildfires: UN[1] appeared first on Digital Journal[2]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/world-must-brace-for-more-extreme-wildfires-un/article\">https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/world-must-brace-for-more-extreme-wildfires-un/article</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com\">https://www.digitaljournal.com</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

What the hell \u2014 and I would probably use a different four-letter word \u2014 what the hell are they doing?\"</p><p>Airpura donated the UV air purifiers, which range in price from $900 to $1,150, to Cloverdale Traditional Elementary School after it won a contest in September. There were 10 runner-up schools that received one HEPA air purifier each, with George Greenaway Elementary in Surrey also being selected.</p><p>However, the Surrey school district confirmed to the Now-Leader that all the air purifiers were shipped to Cloverdale Traditional and are being stored there.</p><p>The district claims that \"most spaces\" in the district do not warrant additional filters for ventilation, but that doesn't sit well with Cloverdale Traditional School's Parents Advisory Council.</p><p>READ ALSO: 'Extremely discouraging': 20 donated HEPA filters sitting unused at Surrey school, Feb. 16, 2022</p><p>\"Parents are very frustrated that the 20 air purifiers are still in storage, and just waiting to be plugged in. Our hands are tied because of the Surrey school district's decision to not allow them for use,\" reads an emailed statement from the PAC.</p><p>\"We feel the district is making a blanket policy district-wide, and not on a case by case basis. We really just want better indoor air quality for our children.\"</p><p>In an emailed statement from district spokesperson Ritinder Matthew, she said the filters the PAC won \"were not approved for use at that school by our health and safety department.</p><p>\"We considered this request carefully \u2013 taking into account all of the controls in place within the space, including ventilation, how the space is utilized, time spent in proximity to others, etc. The physical layout of the space was also an important consideration as these units must be sized, placed correctly and maintained according to manufacturer's directions.\"</p><p>Matthew added \"another important factor to consider with any UV units is the potential for by-products (like ozone and possible respiratory irritants).\"</p><p>The district previously said that in \"most spaces\" portable HEPA air filtration is \"not indicated because we have layers of controls in place to prevent transmission. These include optimized ventilation, maximizing use of available space, wearing masks, limiting mixing of people, and limiting time spent in close proximity to others.\"</p><p>Last fall, the Surrey school district released an online ventilation database that lists what ventilation systems are used in different areas of each school site.</p><p>Out of 20 areas listed for Cloverdale Traditional, 18 spaces used MERV-11. The two remaining locations, the hall and the gym, use a pad filter and MERV-13, respectively.</p><p>Pedro said the HEPA filters he provided in the contest is MERV-14, and \"in essence it's way better than the standards it is at the district.\"</p><p>The district said that where the equipment can accommodate, it had upgraded filters in HVAC equipment to MERV-13s. However, in cases where the manufacturer specifications do not accommodate MERV-13s, the district has installed the next highest filters that can be accommodated \u2013 either MERV-11s or MERV-8s.</p><p>MERV stands for minimum efficiency reporting values. According to the Government of Canada's guidance on indoor ventilation during the pandemic, filters with higher MERV ratings \"are more efficient at removing particles.\"</p><p>When the district released the database, it said it was also changing filters at an increased frequency \u2013 four times a year \u2013 to ensure efficient operation and to date in the 2021-22 school year, $674,000 has been invested in HVAC upgrades and $250,000 in MERV-rated filter maintenance.</p><p>READ ALSO: Surrey school district releases online ventilation database, but critics say more needs to be done, Oct. 16, 2021</p><p>The school's PAC says the air purifiers are \"the added layer of protection for the children,\" especially as masks are no longer mandatory in schools.</p><p>\"This is not just for filtering out COVID-19, but also other viruses/bacteria, allergens, and smoke during forest fire season. The school building itself is 100 years old and all classrooms are using MERV-11 filtration system, so any additional filtration would assist in cleaning the air.\"</p><p>Pedro agrees.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, it's not just a one-off investment,\" he says. \"If you improve the air quality across the 75,000 students in the district, generally speaking, you're not just improving the protection against COVID, you're also improving the long-term aspects.\"</p><p>That's part of the reason why Pedro says he's working with the PAC to hopefully convince the district and the school to use the donated HEPA filters.</p><p>Pedro emailed the PAC last week directing them to use two arguments when trying to encourage the use of the air purifiers.</p><p>The first, he said, is to \"attack the science that is being used to justify the inaction and the refusal of using the product.\" While the other looks at \"reasonable accommodations\" for people with pre-existing conditions. But Pedro described the district's reasoning as \"asinine.\"</p><p>\"They need to be challenged.\"</p><p>When asking the district if it plans to return the filters, Matthew said \"they were won by the PAC so this is a decision that group would need to make. Our school is storing them for the PAC.\"</p><p>For now, Pedro said he's working toward a solution.</p><p>\"Look, originally we gave 30 days but since we're working with them, I'm obviously going to give them a lot more than 30 days,\" he acknowledged, but the intended purpose of the contest was for the air purifiers to be used in schools, which they're not.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, if they warehouse some place, we'd like to give it to the second-prize winner.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:lauren.collins@surreynowleader.com\">lauren.collins@surreynowleader.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram and follow Lauren on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2022 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20220323PAB4298410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:652H-8H11-F0HF-8487-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1011\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Group Ltd.

The flight was traveling from Kunming in the southwestern province of Yunnan to the industrial center of Guangzhou along the east coast, it added.</p><p>China Eastern flight 5735 had been traveling 455 knots (523 mph, 842 kph) at around 30,000 feet when it entered a steep dive around 2:20 p.m. local time, according to data from flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com. The plane stopped transmitting data 96 seconds later.</p><p>Local villagers were first to arrive at the forested area where the plane went down and sparked a blaze big enough to be seen on NASA satellite images. Hundreds of rescue workers were swiftly dispatched from Guangxi and neighboring Guangdong province.</p><p>The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, the CAAC said, correcting earlier reports that 133 people had been on board.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an \u201call-out effort\u201d by the rescue operation, as well as for an investigation into the crash and to ensure complete civil aviation safety. </p><p>Relatives of crew members arrived at a China Eastern office near the Kunming airport where the plane took off, state broadcaster CCTV reported. On Monday night, an Associated Press journalist saw police officers and security guards patrolling outside the office with flashlights, ordering journalists to leave. </p><p>At a hotel near the airport, about a dozen people, some in jackets identifying them as members of China's aviation agency, huddled around tables and read documents.</p><p>State media reported all 737-800s in China Eastern\u2019s fleet were ordered grounded. Aviation experts said it is unusual to ground an entire fleet of planes unless there is evidence of a problem with the model.</p><p>Boeing 737-800s have been flying since 1998, and Boeing has sold more than 5,100 of them. They have been involved in 22 accidents that totaled the planes and killed 612 people, according to data compiled by the Aviation Safety Network, an arm of the Flight Safety Foundation.</p><p>\u201cThere are thousands of them around the world. It\u2019s certainly had an excellent safety record,\u201d the foundation\u2019s president, Hassan Shahidi, said of the 737-800.</p><p>China\u2019s air-safety record has improved since the 1990s as air travel has grown dramatically with the rise of a burgeoning middle class. Before Monday, the last fatal crash of a Chinese airliner occurred in August 2010, when an Embraer ERJ 190-100 operated by Henan Airlines hit the ground short of the runway in the northeastern city of Yichun and caught fire. All 44 people on board were killed. Investigators blamed pilot error.</p><p>Aviation experts said they expect that China will ask the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for help, although a safety board spokesman said Monday that had not happened yet. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the 737-800 in the 1990s, said it was ready to help in the investigation if asked. </p><p>Chicago-based Boeing Co. said it was in contact with U.S. investigators \u201cand our technical experts are prepared to assist with the investigation led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.\u201d Boeing shares fell more than 4% in afternoon trading in New York.</p><p>Crash investigations are usually led by officials in the country where the crash occurred, but they typically include the airplane\u2019s manufacturer and the investigator or regulator in the manufacturer\u2019s home country.</p><p>Shahidi said he expects investigators to comb through the maintenance history of the plane and its engines, the training and records of the pilots, air traffic control discussions and other topics.</p><p>Headquartered in Shanghai, China Eastern is one of the country\u2019s top three airlines, operating scores of domestic and international routes serving 248 destinations.</p><p>The aircraft was delivered to the airliner from Boeing in June 2015 and had been flying for more than six years. China Eastern Airlines uses the Boeing 737-800 as a workhorse of its fleet \u2014 the airline has more than 600 planes, and 109 are Boeing 737-800s.</p><p>Broadcaster CCTV said China Eastern set up nine teams to deal with aircraft disposal, accident investigation, family assistance and other pressing matters. </p><p>The CAAC and China Eastern both said they had sent officials to the crash site in accordance with emergency measures.</p><p>China Eastern online made its website have a black-and-white homepage after the crash.</p><p>The accident quickly became a leading topic on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo platform, with 1.34 billion views and 690,000 discussions. Many posts expressed condolences to the families of victims, while others questioned the planes\u2019 safety.</p><p>The twin-engine, single-aisle Boeing 737 in various versions has been flying for more than 50 years and is one of the world\u2019s most popular planes for short and medium-haul flights.</p><p>The 737 Max, a later version, was grounded worldwide for nearly two years after two crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people. China\u2019s aviation regulator cleared the Max to return to service late last year, making the country the last major market to do so.</p><p>The deadliest crash involving a Boeing 737-800 came in January 2020, when Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard accidentally shot down a Ukraine International Airlines flight, killing all 176 people on board.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press researcher Yu Bing and news assistant Caroline Chen in Beijing, researcher Si Chen in Shanghai, videographer Dake Kang in Kunming, China, writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, video producer Penny Wang and writer Adam Schreck in Bangkok and airlines writer David Koenig in Dallas also contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-b0644cb141eb7313bfa4e1e250033017</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6521-F3P1-JBVR-32DC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1002\"/><timeReceived>03:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>March 21, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But this is very much like a dry forest. And there is a forest fire risk that if we do get an uptick, it can spread fast and far with low vaccine rates.\"</p><p>Jenne said Alberta has one of the lowest rates of vaccination in the country, despite previously leading the way.</p><p>Nearly 75 per cent of eligible Albertans have received at least one dose, while more than 60 per cent are fully vaccinated. By comparison, Ontario is nearing 80 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively.</p><p>For effective herd immunity, Jenne said more than 80 per cent of the total population needs to be fully vaccinated. Otherwise, he said Alberta could see a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.</p><p>\"We will not be able to achieve herd immunity, which is a powerful aspect of public health due to vaccination, unless some of these vaccine hesitant people do get vaccinated,\" he said.</p><p>Jenne encouraged those who are unsure about the vaccines to talk to health-care professionals. </p><p>Hinshaw said the two mRNA vaccines \u2014 Moderna and Pfizer \u2014 are performing slightly better than AstraZeneca in protecting against symptomatic infection, but all have been effective in combating severe outcomes.</p><p>With the Delta variant, which was first detected in India, she said one dose of vaccine is 57 per cent effective and two doses are 85 per cent effective.</p><p>Hinshaw said two doses of vaccine have also proven 91 per cent effective against the Alpha variant, first identified in the United Kingdom.</p><p>\"This latest information is encouraging and underscores again the importance of getting fully vaccinated as soon as you can,\" Hinshaw said in a Twitter post.</p><p>Alberta Health's website shows more than 5,128,000 vaccine doses have been administered in the province, as of Wednesday.</p><p>On Thursday, Premier Jason Kenney said 90 per cent of those most vulnerable to COVID over the age of 65 are fully vaccinated.</p><p>He said the threat of COVID overwhelming the health system has been sharply curtailed.</p><p>\u201cWe can move forward with confidence,\u201d Kenney said Thursday during a news conference in Camrose. </p><p>\u201cThe virus will continue to circulate. Numbers will go up and they\u2019ll go down, but what matters most is that the widespread protective effect of vaccines is real.\"</p><p>Alberta reported 106 new cases of COVID Thursday, bringing the active case count to 676. There are 93 Albertans currently in hospital, with 26 of those patients in intensive care.</p><p>The provincial death toll now sits at 2,320 after two additional deaths were reported.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published on July 22, 2021.</p><p>\u2014 With files from Dean Bennett in Edmonton</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-b363a4b3f7ab4ce181250150c3b38f13</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:636M-JXH1-JBVR-30KT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><timeReceived>07:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 22, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Any permanent change to staffing levels to further reduce forestry-related expenses will be contemplated in future budget years, if required by the outcome of the forestry review\u2026and once the future-state service levels in relation to the municipal forest reserve and forestry-related activities are better understood.\u201d</p><p>Stewart said that balancing the 2021 budget, as mandated for local governments under legislation, will require either using the forest reserve fund, increasing taxes or some other combination.</p><p>He said if logging were to be suspended indefinitely upon conclusion of the ongoing review in 2021, the forest reserve fund has only enough money to offset the forestry-related costs for approximately two more years at the current level of operations.</p><p>Stewart said that if council decides to continue to use the fund to cover costs in the forest reserve until it is conceivably used up in the coming years, other funding sources, or a significant reduction in service levels concerning the forest reserve, will need to be considered.</p><p>He also cautioned council that while using the funding from the forest reserve fund is a viable option for 2021, continuing depletion of the fund in future budget years will present a risk to the municipality in the event of a forest fire within the forest reserve.</p><p>Stewart said staff have submitted a grant application to the FireSmart Community Funding and Supports Program to conduct \u201ctreatment prescriptions for the identified high-risk areas and critical infrastructure\u201d in the forest reserve that may include some logging opportunities in the forest reserve.</p><p>\u201dA summary of the treatment prescriptions results will be presented to council for consideration in the third quarter of 2021,\u201d he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COWCIT-news20210121PPYA0001556315</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COWCIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61VW-TS51-F0HF-8559-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438285</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"467\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

(the Company or Emerita) is pleased to announce that it continues to accelerate drilling at its wholly owned Iberia Belt West project (IBW or the Project). Presently there are 9 drills on the La Romanera deposit delineation and 1 rig continues to drill at Infanta. Assay results have been received from drill holes at the La Romanera deposit (3 drill holes) and the La Infanta deposit (2 drill holes) reported below. To date, 23 drill holes have been completed on the La Romanera deposit which is the main focus of the IBW program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Joaquin Merino, P.Geo., President of Emerita: The additional drills will ensure the Company stays on track to meet our objectives with respect to delineating the La Romanera deposit. Restrictions on drilling between 2-8 PM, related to high temperatures and resulting forest fire index, are also expected to end by September 21 as temperatures moderate which will allow 24 hour operations to resume and boost productivity as well. Hunting season, which commences October 15, is not expected to impact the drill program at the La Romanera deposit.</p><p>David Gower, P.Geo., CEO of Emerita, points out, We continue to intersect wide thicknesses of massive sulphide and are excited to see the results continue to build toward a maiden NI 43-101 resource estimate. The Company is in a strong financial position with more than $20 million in the treasury which is well above the budget for completing the campaign. Presently, there are 8 additional drill holes in the lab and 8 additional drill holes in progress at La Romanera (one rig is under repair). At La Infanta, there are 3 drill holes at the lab and one hole is in progress.</p><p>La Romanera:</p><p>Drill holes LR009, LR013 and LR015 intercepted massive sulphide mineralization between 200 and 450 meters below surface. Holes LR013 and LR009 are along section 6700, and about 250 m apart and returned excellent widths and grades. The deposit in this area is very continuous in thickness and grades including elevated grades of gold and silver. Hole LR015, located at the western edge of the historical drilling, intercepted 20.5 m of massive pyrite but no significant base or precious metal values metals were obtained in this drill hole. The sulphide lens is thick and it is characteristic of the sulphide deposits in the Iberian volcanic massive sulphide belt to have barren sulphide zones. Additional drilling will be required in this area given the thick sulphide intercept.</p><p>Hole LR009 intercepted two lenses. The Upper Lens occurs from 560.7 m with 6.7 m grading 0.3 % Cu; 1.4 % Pb; 4.2 % Zn; 0.8 g/t Au and 102.4 g/t Ag (including 1.2 m grading 0.2 % Cu; 3.8 % Pb; 6.3 % Zn; 2.5 g/t Au and 150.8 g/t Ag). The Lower Lens was intercepted at 581.3 m depth and comprises 16.5 m grading 0.2 % Cu; 3.1 % Pb; 3.6 % Zn; 2.3 g/t Au and 254.7 g/t Ag (including 2.7 m grading 0.5 % Cu; 5.1 % Pb; 0.4 % Zn; 6.0 g/t Au and 776.2 g/t Ag and a second including 2.4 m grading 0.1 % Cu; 4.2 % Pb; 10.5 % Zn; 1.0 g/t Au and 140.4 g/t Ag).</p><p>Hole LR013 intercepted two lenses. The Upper Lens occurs from 223.0 m (200 m below surface) with 4.2 m grading 0.1 % Cu; 1.5 % Pb; 1.1 % Zn; 0.9 g/t Au and 43.5 g/t Ag (including 1.3 m grading 0.1 % Cu; 4.1 % Pb; 3.3 % Zn; 2.7 g/t Au and 98.0 g/t Ag). The Lower Lens was intercepted at 267.0 m and comprises 20.6 m grading 0.9 % Cu; 0.5 % Pb; 0.8 % Zn; 0.5 g/t Au and 46.9 g/t Ag (including 2.0 m grading 0.3 % Cu; 2.0 % Pb; 2.9 % Zn; 2.4 g/t Au and 125.0 g/t Ag and a second including 2.1 m grading 2.6 % Cu; 0.2 % Pb; 1.1 % Zn; 0.3 g/t Au and 27.0 g/t Ag).</p><p>Figure 1: Location map showing drill holes LR009, LR013 and LR015 of the La Romanera Deposit. Hole LR015 is the western-most hole drilled by the Company to date.</p><p>La Infanta:</p><p>The 2 drill holes reported below are located on the eastern and western side respectively of the La Infanta deposit, and about 650 m apart along strike. Both holes are part of the delineation program used to demonstrate continuity of mineralization in support of a NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate.</p><p>Hole IN060 intercepted sulphide mineralization in the North Block.

Forward-looking information includes, without limitation, the mineralization of the IBW Project; the prospectivity of the Project; the exploration of the Project; the timing and ability of the Company to produce an NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate and the Companys future plans. Generally, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as plans, expects or does not expect, is expected, budget, scheduled, estimates, forecasts, intends, anticipates or does not anticipate, or believes, or variations of such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results may, could, would, might or will be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward- looking information is subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of Emerita, as the case may be, to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including but not limited to: general business, economic, competitive, geopolitical and social uncertainties; the actual results of current exploration activities; risks associated with operation in foreign jurisdictions; ability to successfully integrate the purchased properties; foreign operations risks; and other risks inherent in the mining industry. Although Emerita has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. Emerita does not undertake to update any forward-looking information, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.</p><p>NEITHER TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE NOR ITS REGULATION SERVICES PROVIDER (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN THE POLICIES OF THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE) ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.</p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2022 Market News Publishing Inc.
