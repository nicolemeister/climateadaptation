Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Aug. 8 ...</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What we are watching in Canada ...</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wildfires are raging throughout Canada, with a long-burning forest fire in central Newfoundland prompting a state of emergency, a so-called \"zombie fire\" flaring up in the Northwest Territories and fire crews conducting controlled burns in an effort to control a raging wildfire in B.C.'s southern Okanagan region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Newfoundland's state of emergency initially covered the areas of Grand Falls-Windsor, Bishop's Falls and the Connaigre Peninsula, but was extended to the area of Botwood on Sunday afternoon, and an outdoor fire ban prohibiting the setting of fires on or within 300 metres of forestland was also expanded provincewide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Premier Andrew Furey said the current predictive path of the blaze itself does not directly impact any communities, but changing wind patterns were making the situation difficult to handle. </p><p>The fire has been burning for close to two weeks in central Newfoundland and has prompted road closures, including the Bay d'Espoir Highway, which is the only road connecting the communities of Harbour Breton, Hermitage and Conne River to the Trans-Canada Highway, the main thoroughfare across the province.</p><p>The BC Wildfire Service says it is using a combination of tools to control a nearly 60-square-kilometre wildfire about 21 kilometres southwest of Penticton.</p><p>Information officer Mikhail Elsay had said controlled burns were scheduled for Sunday in a bid to rein in the large blaze that has been burning for more than a week.</p><p>The fire has prompted an evacuation order of more than 500 properties and put more than 1,000 others under orders to be ready to leave at short notice.</p><p>Authorities in the Northwest Territories are keeping a close eye on a fire on the west side of Marian Lake that flared back up after being dormant underground for a long time.</p><p>The Department of Environment and Natural Resources says the holdover fire, also known as a \"zombie fire,\" has grown to about 65 square kilometres and is burning about 38 kilometres southeast of Whati. </p><p>It says heavy winds from the south are expected to cause extreme fire behaviour and significant growth, which can result in large amounts of smoke and ash in the Tlicho region, especially in Whati, but no cabins, communities or infrastructure is at risk because of this blaze.</p><p>---</p><p>Also this ...</p><p>Provincial politicians are heading back to the Ontario legislature today for the start of a new session.</p><p>It's the first time they are sitting since the Progressive Conservatives won a second majority government in early June.</p><p>The first order of business is electing a Speaker, and two Tories are vying for the job \u2013 Ted Arnott, who has held the role for the past four years, and Nina Tangri, who served as associate minister of small business and red tape reduction.</p><p>On Tuesday, there will be a throne speech, which outlines a government's new agenda, followed by the budget, which is expected to be largely unchanged from when it was introduced but not passed in the spring before the election.</p><p>But it is being reintroduced amid a health-care staffing crisis that has seen emergency rooms across the province close for hours or days at a time, as well as much higher inflation than when it was first introduced.</p><p>The throne speech is expected to address those changing circumstances, but it's unclear if any new measures will be added to deal with them.</p><p>Nursing groups and opposition politicians have been calling on the government to repeal legislation passed in 2019 that capped wage increases for nurses and other public sector workers for three years, as a way to ease the staffing crunch.</p><p>---</p><p>What we are watching in the U.S. ...</p><p>SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Months after they were sentenced to life in prison for murder, the three white men who chased and killed Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighbourhood faced a second round of criminal penalties Monday for federal hate crimes committed in the deadly pursuit of the 25-year-old Black man.</p><p>U.S. District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Wood scheduled back-to-back hearings to individually sentence each of the defendants, starting with Travis McMichael, who blasted Arbery with a shotgun after the street chase initiated by his father and joined by a neighbour.</p><p>Arbery's killing on Feb. 23, 2020, became part of a larger national reckoning over racial injustice and killings of unarmed Black people including George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky. Those two cases also resulted in the Justice Department bringing federal charges.</p><p>When they return to court Monday in Georgia, McMichael, his father Greg McMichael and neighbour William \"Roddie'' Bryan face possible life sentences after a jury convicted them in February of federal hate crimes, concluding that they violated Arbery's civil rights and targeted him because of his race. All three men were also found guilty of attempted kidnapping, and the McMichaels face additional penalties for using firearms to commit a violent crime.</p><p>Whatever punishments they receive in federal court could ultimately prove more symbolic than anything. A state Superior Court judge imposed life sentences for all three men in January for Arbery's murder, with both McMichaels denied any chance of parole.</p><p>All three defendants have remained jailed in coastal Glynn County, in the custody of U.S. marshals, while awaiting sentencing after their federal convictions in January.</p><p>The McMichaels armed themselves with guns and jumped in a truck to chase Arbery after spotting him running past their home outside the port city of Brunswick on Feb. 23, 2020. Bryan joined the pursuit in his own truck, helping cut off Arbery's escape. He also recorded cellphone video of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery at close range as Arbery threw punches and grabbed at the shotgun.</p><p>The McMichaels told police they suspected Arbery had been stealing from a nearby house under construction. But authorities later concluded he was unarmed and had committed no crimes. Arbery's family has long insisted he was merely out jogging.</p><p>Still, more than two months passed before any charges were filed in Arbery's death. The McMichaels and Bryan were arrested only after the graphic video of the shooting leaked online and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from local police.</p><p>---</p><p>What we are watching in the rest of the world ...</p><p>BEIJING _ The capital of China's Hainan province has locked down its residents for 13 hours on Monday as a COVID-19 outbreak grows on the tropical island during the summer school holidays.</p><p>The temporary lockdown of Haikou city from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. follows an ongoing and indefinite lockdown of the beach resort of Sanya since Saturday _ which is confining vacationers to their hotels for a week _ and lockdowns that started in four other cities in Hainan on Sunday.</p><p>More than 470 new cases were recorded in the province on Sunday, of which 245 did not show symptoms. Overall, China reported more than 760 new daily cases, the National Health Commission said Monday.</p><p>Some 80,000 tourists have reportedly been stranded by the lockdown in Sanya. Those wanting to depart have to test negative five times over seven days.</p><p>China has stuck steadfastly to a \"zero-COVID'' policy, despite the economic and social costs. It has credited that approach with keeping hospitalization and death rates lower than in other countries that have opened up amid high vaccination rates and more effective treatments.</p><p>Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese city, announced Monday that it would reduce a mandatory hotel quarantine for overseas arrivals to three days from the current one week. The new policy takes effect Friday.</p><p>---</p><p>On this day in 1989 ...</p><p>The lawyer for Chantal Daigle, who went to the Supreme Court of Canada to argue her right to have an abortion against her boyfriend's wishes, told the court his client had had the procedure despite a court injunction against it. Daniel Bedard apologized to the court but warned there could be legal chaos if courts allowed men to stop women from having abortions.</p><p>---</p><p>In entertainment ...</p><p>NEW YORK _ The stylized action romp \"Bullet Train,'' starring Brad Pitt, arrived with a $30.1 million opening weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday, as the last big movie of Hollywood's summer recovery landed in theatres.</p><p>The \"Bullet Train'' debut for SonyPictures was solid but unspectacular for a movie that cost $90 million to make and was propelled by Pitt's substantial star power. Even if it holds well in coming weeks, movie theatres have no major studio releases on the horizon for the rest of August, and few sure things to look forward to in early fall.</p><p>While late summer is always a quiet period in theatres, it will be especially so this year _ and likely to sap some of the momentum stirred by \"Top Gun: Maverick,'' \"Jurassic World: Dominion,'' \"Minions: The Rise of Gru'' and others. After a comeback season that pushed the box office close to pre-pandemic levels, it's about to get pretty quiet in cinemas.</p><p>\"It's definitely going to be quieter, like the calm after the storm,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. \"But that doesn't mean there's not going to be great movies out there and perhaps the good will generated by some of those films might be enough to buoy the box office until we get into the blockbuster corridor with 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' and 'Avatar 2' down the road. We have to expect that we're not going to be able to keep up the pace we had this summer.''</p><p>As the last big summer movie to leave the station, \"Bullet Train'' hopes to keep riding for the coming weeks. That would be in line with the playbook of some other original, August-released summer movies like \"Free Guy'' and \"Crazy Rich Asians.'' Directed by David Leitch (\"Atomic Blonde,'' \"Deadpool 2''), \"Bullet Train'' gathers a number of assassins (co-stars include Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry) together on a speeding train running from Tokyo to Kyoto.</p><p>The weekend's other new wide release, \"Easter Sunday,'' struggled to catch on. The Universal Pictures comedy, starring comic Jo Koy as an actor attending his family's Easter Sunday celebration, won praise for its Filipino representation but drew even worse reviews than \"Bullet Train.'' It opened with $5.3 million in ticket sales.</p><p>Instead, \"Bullet Train'' was trailed by a number of holdovers, including Warner Bros.' \"DC League of Pets.'' The animated release grossed $11.2 million in its second week of release.  </p><p>Jordan Peele's \"Nope,'' the Universal sci-fi horror release, continued to perform well, earning $8.5 million in its third weekend. With $98 million in tickets sold, \"Nope'' will soon surpass $100 million at the domestic box office.</p><p>---</p><p>Did you see this?</p><p>OTTAWA _ A parliamentary committee will begin exploring the RCMP's use of spyware on Monday, diving deeper into an issue that's sounded alarms for privacy and civil liberties groups across the country.</p><p>The House of Commons ethics and privacy committee called for a summer study after the RCMP revealed its use of tools that covertly obtain data from devices like phones and computers.</p><p>In response to a written question tabled in the House of Commons in June, the RCMP disclosed it had obtained warrants to use tools that collect text messages and emails and can remotely turn on cameras and microphones in 10 investigations.</p><p>\"We are talking about the most intrusive thing that exists,'' said privacy and technology lawyer David Fraser. \"This would be like an order allowing the police to kind of put on an invisibility cloak and sit on your living room couch, or on your bedside table.''</p><p>As an alternative approach, Fraser said the committee could look to the methods used when the Canadian Security Intelligence Service seeks a warrant for its investigations.</p><p>\"(CSIS officials) go to a bunker in Ottawa and they meet in what amounts to a secret court,'' he said. \"It's designated judges of the Federal Court who, ex parte _ so without anybody on the other side _ review applications for warrants under the CSIS Act that can be incredibly intrusive.''</p><p>The committee has the opportunity to decide whether the current laws are sufficient to protect Canadians' privacy. It could decide the RCMP needs to submit annual reports for further transparency.</p><p>Witnesses appearing during the scheduled two days of hearings include Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino, the current federal privacy commissioner and his deputy, and RCMP officers who oversaw the use of spyware.</p><p>---</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 8, 2022</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-78ce220302904555950eca35a302aa48</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:663W-BM11-JBVR-3415-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2112\"/><timeReceived>04:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 8, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That said, the fire may have had further reach if not for previous mitigation efforts.</p><p>Randy Harris is a registered professional forester who is now retired after 38 years with the BC Forest Service. During the</p><p>last eight years of his career, he was the ecosystem restoration leader for the Rocky Mountain District in Cranbrook.</p><p>Harris explained that the final control of Bill Nye was made easier by the fact that the wildfire mitigation</p><p>team tied the south boundary of the fire to an existing ecosystem restoration (ER) unit near Lakit Lake, on July 22nd.</p><p>He adds that after speaking with fire crews, the ecosystem restoration burn served as a good anchor point for their back burn.</p><p>\u201cThis tie in, through a prescribed burn, linked a fuel reduced area with good fire guards to the wildfire and reduced the risk that the fire could have run off the mountain and into the housing around Campbell Meyer road,\u201d Harris explained. \u201cWhile the ER burn did not truly reduce fire suppression, it saved a lot of time to have a ready constructed fire guard to burn from. Also, if the guard was breached in the ER project [area], fire control would be very simple in grass fuel type.\u201d</p><p>He adds that crews plan to tour the area after the burn season is over, to see what further information they can gain.</p><p>In terms of the mitigation work that was done for the Lakit Lake burn, Harris explained that there were several different efforts and projects over the course of some years.</p><p>\u201cThe Lakit Lake logical burn unit (LBU) was treated in three stages and totalled 400 hectares,\u201d Harris said. \u201c24 hectares were harvested by Tembec (now Cafor) in 2004. 53.6 hectares [of forest fuel] was spaced and pile burnt in 2008, and six small units were funded by the Government Forest Investment account. The whole 400 hectare unit (with some 63 hectares of untreated Wildlife Tree units) was prescribed burnt in 2009.\u201d</p><p>Harris says that the Rocky Mountain Forest District staff oversaw the prescription spacing and prescribed burn operations, while actual onground work was completed by local contractors.</p><p>Marc Trudeau is a coordinator with the Rocky Mountain Trench Natural Resources Society, which was involved in the Lakit Lake LBU.</p><p>He explained that the society is a nine-member organization that was established in 1996 to tackle to problem of declining grasslands and open forest ecosystems in the Rocky Mountain Trench. Their ecosystem restoration projects also help to reduce forest fire fuels and protect areas against wildfires.</p><p>The Rocky Mountain Trench Natural Resources Society coalition consists of the following organizations: Cranbrook Community Forest Society, East Kootenay Invasive Species Council, East Kootenay Wildlife Association, Kootenay Livestock Association, Rocky Mountain Naturalists, Southern Guides &amp; Outfitters, Waldo Stockbreeders Association, Wildsight and the Windermere District Farmers Institute.</p><p>\u201cGrasslands and open forests are major contributors to our region\u2019s exceptional biodiversity. They provide grazing for elk, bighorn sheep, white-tailed deer, and domestic livestock,\u201d Trudeau explained. \u201cThese ecosystems also provide habitat for many wildlife species, including the majority of the region\u2019s rare and endangered species such as Lewis\u2019s woodpecker, American badger and long-billed curlew.\u201d</p><p>Trudeau said that using an existing ER treatment area as a defendable boundary would make sense, because of the reduction in available fuel to burn and/or to provide a logical tie in point for a burn off.</p><p>\u201cGrasslands and open forests con\u00ac</p><p>tribute to a healthy environment in other ways too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey offset the effects of greenhouse gases by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They preserve and enrich soil by preventing erosion and adding nutrients. They discourage the spread of insects that attack and kill trees, and they form natural firebreaks that can help stop the advancement of catastrophic wildfire. Many also value grasslands and open forests for their recreational, aesthetic and spiritual values.\u201d</p><p>Trudeau adds that the total funds raised by the Trench Society to prepare the Lakit Face for prescribed burn was approximately $107,583.</p><p>The main funders included the Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program at $71,000, Provincial Land Base Investment Funds of $21,583, Columbia Basin Trust $10,000 and Wild Sheep Society of BC at $5,000. Prescribed burn planning and ignitions are conducted by the BC Wildfire Service.</p><p>As stated in the Rocky Mountain Trench Ecosystem Restoration Program\u2019s five year plan for 2019 to 2023, prepared in 2018, the plan is</p><p>a continuation of the longstanding ecological restoration process that has been active since 1997.</p><p>\u201cRegardless of the program, almost all projects proposed involve spacing by mechanical thinning and/ or prescribed burning, with the primary objective of converting dense forests to a more open canopy,\u201d says the report, prepared by Harris. \u201cThis thinning is necessitated by the interruption of the historic fire regime of the local forests and grasslands by more effective fire suppression that has occurred since the Second World War.\u201d</p><p>He explains that most forests in the district have been affected, to some extent, by ingrowth. Ingrowth increases fuel loads that feed wildfires. It also creates denser canopies that shade out the grass and shrub forage that wildlife and cattle depend on.</p><p>The goal of the program is to restore the designated 109,400 hectares of the Trench and support the native and historical condition matrix of trees, plants and animals - while create sustainable forage for wild and domestic grazing animals.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRANDT-news20210907PPZ192187</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRANDT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63JH-0T91-F0HF-846T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

That said, the fire may have had further reach if not for previous mitigation efforts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Randy Harris is a registered professional forester who is now retired after 38 years with the BC Forest Service. During the last eight years of his career, he was the ecosystem restoration leader for the Rocky Mountain District in Cranbrook.</p><p>Harris explained that the final control of Bill Nye was made easier by the fact that the wildfire mitigation team tied the south boundary of the fire to an existing ecosystem restoration (ER) unit near Lakit Lake, on July 22nd.</p><p>He adds that after speaking with fire crews, the ecosystem restoration burn served as a good anchor point for their back burn.</p><p>\"This tie in, through a prescribed burn, linked a fuel reduced area with good fire guards to the wildfire and reduced the risk that the fire could have run off the mountain and into the housing around Campbell Meyer road,\" Harris explained. \"While the ER burn did not truly reduce fire suppression, it saved a lot of time to have a ready constructed fire guard to burn from. Also, if the guard was breached in the ER project [area], fire control would be very simple in grass fuel type.\"</p><p>He adds that crews plan to tour the area after the burn season is over, to see what further information they can gain.</p><p>In terms of the mitigation work that was done for the Lakit Lake burn, Harris explained that there were several different efforts and projects over the course of some years.</p><p>\"The Lakit Lake logical burn unit (LBU) was treated in three stages and totalled 400 hectares,\" Harris said. \"24 hectares were harvested by Tembec (now Cafor) in 2004. 53.6 hectares [of forest fuel] was spaced and pile burnt in 2008, and six small units were funded by the Government Forest Investment account. The whole 400 hectare unit (with some 63 hectares of untreated Wildlife Tree units) was prescribed burnt in 2009.\"</p><p>Harris says that the Rocky Mountain Forest District staff oversaw the prescription spacing and prescribed burn operations, while actual on-ground work was completed by local contractors.</p><p>Marc Trudeau is a coordinator with the Rocky Mountain Trench Natural Resources Society, which was involved in the Lakit Lake LBU.</p><p>He explained that the society is a nine-member organization that was established in 1996 to tackle to problem of declining grasslands and open forest ecosystems in the Rocky Mountain Trench. Their ecosystem restoration projects also help to reduce forest fire fuels and protect areas against wildfires.</p><p>The Rocky Mountain Trench Natural Resources Society coalition consists of the following organizations: Cranbrook Community Forest Society, East Kootenay Invasive Species Council, East Kootenay Wildlife Association, Kootenay Livestock Association, Rocky Mountain Naturalists, Southern Guides &amp; Outfitters, Waldo Stockbreeders Association, Wildsight and the Windermere District Farmers Institute.</p><p>\"Grasslands and open forests are major contributors to our region's exceptional biodiversity. They provide grazing for elk, bighorn sheep, white-tailed deer, and domestic livestock,\" Trudeau explained. \"These ecosystems also provide habitat for many wildlife species, including the majority of the region's rare and endangered species such as Lewis's woodpecker, American badger and long-billed curlew.\"</p><p>Trudeau said that using an existing ER treatment area as a defendable boundary would make sense, because of the reduction in available fuel to burn and/or to provide a logical tie in point for a burn off.</p><p>\"Grasslands and open forests contribute to a healthy environment in other ways too,\" he said. \"They offset the effects of greenhouse gases by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They preserve and enrich soil by preventing erosion and adding nutrients. They discourage the spread of insects that attack and kill trees, and they form natural firebreaks that can help stop the advancement of catastrophic wildfire. Many also value grasslands and open forests for their recreational, aesthetic and spiritual values.\"</p><p>Trudeau adds that the total funds raised by the Trench Society to prepare the Lakit Face for prescribed burn was approximately $107,583.</p><p>The main funders included the Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program at $71,000, Provincial Land Base Investment Funds of $21,583, Columbia Basin Trust $10,000 and Wild Sheep Society of BC at $5,000. Prescribed burn planning and ignitions are conducted by the BC Wildfire Service.</p><p>As stated in the Rocky Mountain Trench Ecosystem Restoration Program's five year plan for 2019 to 2023, prepared in 2018, the plan is a continuation of the longstanding ecological restoration process that has been active since 1997.</p><p>\"Regardless of the program, almost all projects proposed involve spacing by mechanical thinning and/or prescribed burning, with the primary objective of converting dense forests to a more open canopy,\" says the report, prepared by Harris. \"This thinning is necessitated by the interruption of the historic fire regime of the local forests and grasslands by more effective fire suppression that has occurred since the Second World War.\"</p><p>He explains that most forests in the district have been affected, to some extent, by ingrowth. Ingrowth increases fuel loads that feed wildfires. It also creates denser canopies that shade out the grass and shrub forage that wildlife and cattle depend on.</p><p>The goal of the program is to restore the designated 109,400 hectares of the Trench and support the native and historical condition matrix of trees, plants and animals - while creating sustainable forage for wild and domestic grazing animals.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:corey.bullock@cranbrooktownsman.com\">corey.bullock@cranbrooktownsman.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

This phenomenon was noticed across the battlefields of Europe in the wake of the terrible loss of life and environmental devastation of the First World War.</p><p>In a story on \"CBC What on Earth,\" Meneka Raman-Wilms asks why - of all plants - \"were poppies the first to grow there? And why did they grow in such abundance?\"</p><p>Raman-Wilms reaches out to Egan Davis for answers. Davis is the principal instructor for the horticultural training program at the University of British Columbia's Botanical Garden.</p><p>\"A poppy is one of those pioneer, ruderal plants,\" explains Davis. \"Their role is basically to patch (a) site after a major disturbance.\"</p><p>Davis explains that seeds from these pioneer plants, like fireweed in Canada, are waiting in the soil to respond to a disturbance that removes most trees and vegetation, like a forest fire, flood, or human activity.</p><p>\"I can't imagine anything more disturbing to the earth and to human society than war,\" Davis says. \"But when poppies germinate after the war, that's a sign of promise.\"</p><p>Hence, the red poppy as a symbol that helps us remember both the devastation of war and the promise of peace.</p><p>Did you know that the poppy is actually considered a weed? The beautiful red poppy is known by common names like the corn poppy or field poppy because of its propensity for being first and fast to take over agricultural fields shortly after they've been tilled and new crops have been planted.</p><p>Studies suggest that poppies can regenerate poor-quality soil, making way for the return of other plant species.</p><p>\"I love growing poppies,\" said Jill Bishop, whom you may know from the Nourish Project, and as the Urban Tomato Lady. \"They are very beautiful, both the flowers and the seed heads that they create. They are incredibly abundant. Each seed head generally contains dozens of seeds. They are pretty easy to grow and don't need rich soil. They will self-seed and come back year after year. In my opinion, a worthwhile addition to any garden!\"</p><p>The species of poppy that John McCrae described has variations in pink, orange, yellow, white, blue and purple.</p><p>There is also variation in the commemorative poppies that people may choose to wear in addition to the traditional red poppy on Remembrance Day. White poppies - sometimes controversial - are symbols of peace and remembrance for all victims of war, including civilians, and as a challenge to the glamorization or justification of war.</p><p>Purple poppies are sometimes worn to remember the millions of horses, donkeys, and other animals that served and lost their lives in war.</p><p>This delicate nature of the poppy also symbolizes the fragility of life itself.</p><p>\"I appreciate the delicate beauty of the poppy,\" Bishop said. \"They grow great in the garden, but they wilt quickly as cut flowers and in storms. Fleeting beauty to be enjoyed while in full bloom.\"</p><p>That delicate nature also presented a bit of a challenge when, 100 years ago, the precursor to the Canadian Legion first proposed that the poppy be Canada's official flower of remembrance.</p><p>How can people wear a poppy at Remembrance Day ceremonies if they wilt so quickly as cut flowers?</p><p>Silk or cloth poppies were the original solution.

These projects will help build more resilient communities, and protect both people and existing infrastructure.</p><p>Among these projects, the Village of Lions Bay will construct a 2-storey addition to the emergency building. The addition will expand the apparatus bays and retrofit the Emergency Operations Centre, BC Ambulance, and Search and Rescue Services. Once completed, multiple emergency services will have additional space to store equipment and hold meetings.</p><p>The Resort Municipality of Whistler will create fuel breaks as barriers to slow or stop the spread of wildfires in the \u00a0Nesters Hill area. This will help manage the impacts and extent of wildfires and associated risks to residences and critical infrastructure in the community.</p><p>The Government of Canada and the Province of British Columbia are investing nearly $1 million in these projects through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program's new COVID-19 Resilience Infrastructure Stream.

This phenomenon was noticed across the battlefields of Europe in the wake of the terrible loss of life and environmental devastation of the First World War.</p><p>In a story on \"CBC What on Earth,\" Meneka Raman-Wilms asks why - of all plants - \"were poppies the first to grow there? And why did they grow in such abundance?\"</p><p>Raman-Wilms reaches out to Egan Davis for answers. Davis is the principal instructor for the horticultural training program at the University of British Columbia's Botanical Garden.</p><p>\"A poppy is one of those pioneer, ruderal plants,\" explains Davis. \"Their role is basically to patch (a) site after a major disturbance.\"</p><p>Davis explains that seeds from these pioneer plants, like fireweed in Canada, are waiting in the soil to respond to a disturbance that removes most trees and vegetation, like a forest fire, flood, or human activity.</p><p>\"I can't imagine anything more disturbing to the earth and to human society than war,\" Davis says. \"But when poppies germinate after the war, that's a sign of promise.\"</p><p>Hence the red poppy as a symbol that helps us remember both the devastation of war and the promise of peace.</p><p>Did you know that the poppy is actually considered a weed? The beautiful red poppy (Papaver rhoeas) is known by common names like the corn poppy or field poppy because of its propensity for being first and fast to take over agricultural fields shortly after they've been tilled and new crops have been planted.</p><p>Studies suggest that poppies can regenerate poor-quality soil, making way for the return of other plant species.</p><p>\"I love growing poppies,\" shares Jill Bishop, whom you may know from the Nourish Project, and as the Urban Tomato Lady. \"They are very beautiful, both the flowers and the seed heads that they create. They are incredibly abundant. Each seed head generally contains dozens of seeds. They are pretty easy to grow and don't need rich soil. They will self-seed and come back year after year. In my opinion, a worthwhile addition to any garden!\"</p><p>The species of poppy that John McCrae described has variations in pink, orange, yellow, white, blue, and purple.</p><p>There is also variation in the commemorative poppies that people may choose to wear in addition to the traditional red poppy on Remembrance Day. White poppies - sometimes controversial - are symbols of peace and remembrance for all victims of war, including civilians, and as a challenge to the glamorization or justification of war.</p><p>Purple poppies are sometimes worn to remember the millions of horses, donkeys, and other animals that served and lost their lives in war.</p><p>This delicate nature of the poppy also symbolizes the fragility of life itself.</p><p>\"I appreciate the delicate beauty of the poppy,\" shares Jill Bishop. \"They grow great in the garden, but they wilt quickly as cut flowers and in storms. Fleeting beauty to be enjoyed while in full bloom.\"</p><p>That delicate nature also presented a bit of a challenge when, 100 years ago, the precursor to the Canadian Legion first proposed that the poppy be Canada's official Flower of Remembrance. How can people wear a poppy at Remembrance Day ceremonies if they wilt so quickly as cut flowers?</p><p>Silk or cloth poppies were the original solution. Today, the Royal Canadian Legion is in charge of manufacturing the plastic poppies we wear each year. Proceeds from sales go to the Legion's Poppy Trust Fund to support veterans.</p><p>Many First Nations artisans and leaders find it meaningful to create beaded poppies to commemorate lost loved ones and all veterans. As Laurie Leclair points out in an article in Anishinabek News, this practice is a bit controversial in regards to how poppy production and sales are regulated by the Legion.</p><p>First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit are too often overlooked in colonial narratives and commemorations of war.

(\"Sparton\" or the \"Company\") reported that it has raised approximately $600,000 in new capital through the exercise of outstanding warrants and incentive stock options. Ninety-five percent (95%) of the outstanding warrants from the 2020 Company financing (see Sparton news release dated August 3rd, 2020) were exercised, as well as seventy-four (74%) percent of the outstanding incentive stock options. Funds will be used to support Company exploration programs, retire a portion of corporate debt and for general corporate purposes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Exploration Update</p><p>Exploration programs have continued during this field season despite local Covid restrictions, manpower shortages and forest fire work bans in certain areas. At Bruell in Quebec, Eldorado Gold has completed mapping and soil geochemical surveys over the entire property and is in the process of compiling all of the results. Depending on equipment availability, drilling is planned for this coming fall.</p><p>At the Oakes and Matachewan Area precious metal and copper properties a surface trenching program has been laid out in the field and is expected to begin shortly, when local contractor equipment is available. In addition, initial planning is underway for a possible three-dimensional IP (Induced Polarization) survey covering part of the Oakes area using the 3D Distributed Array System. This IP method reduces the necessity for line cutting on the property and will be used to interpret targets in conjunction with the detailed magnetic survey completed last season.</p><p>VRB Energy</p><p>VRB Energy continues working on final certification of its advanced Gen3 flow battery system and negotiations for new contracts. The initial 100Mh phase of the Hubei \"Giga factory\" project has begun with cell stack manufacturing underway at VRB Energy's Beijing area factory. We anticipate a series of major announcements relating to program developments over the coming months.</p><p>Dr. Mynyr Hoxa Joins Advisory Board</p><p>Sparton is delighted to welcome Dr. Mynyr Hoxa to its Technical Advisory Board. Dr. Hoxha is a Professional Geoscientist with more than 30 years of mining and exploration industry experience. In 2004, he joined FNX Mining as Senior Geologist and in 2008 was promoted to Chief Geologist. Since 2015, he served as Chief Geologist at the Young Davidson Gold Mine, for Alamos Gold. The Young Davidson Mine is located less than 3 km from Sparton's Oakes Property. Dr. Hoxha's experience at Young Davidson will be very valuable to the Company in its work in the Matachewan area. He is very familiar with Sparton's past work at the Oakes property and understands the geologic controls on mineralization in the area. He has a wealth of relevant experience and a noteworthy track record of base and precious metal discoveries in this region.</p><p>Edcor Drilling Services - New Contracts</p><p>The Company's subsidiary, Edcor Drilling, a diamond core drilling service organization, has recently executed contracts for 3,000 meters of new work and is expected to contribute revenue to Sparton in the coming months. Several other contacts are under negotiation and Edcor is expected to be operational at least through year end. Currently the drilling industry is confronted with a major shortage of skilled workers and equipment and the demand has created new opportunities.</p><p>New Stock Options</p><p>The Sparton board has approved effective August 24th, 2021, the issuance of a total of 2,700,000 incentive stock options priced at $0.10 per common share, to its directors, advisors, consultants, and officers. Thirty percent (30%) of the options will vest immediately, 30% will vest on August 24th, 2022, and 40% will vest on August 24th, 2023.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>\"The Company wishes to thank its stakeholders for their support in exercising the warrants from the 2020 financing as well as the exercise of most of the outstanding stock options. Sparton is looking forward to positive developments on all fronts in the coming months,\" stated Lee Barker, Company CEO.</p><p>For more information</p><p>Contact Information:</p><p>A.

Higher earnings were also due to higher levels of inflation in Australia, which positively impacted earnings in Canadian Utilities' International Natural Gas Distribution segment, and continued strong performance from our Structures and Neltume segments.</p><p>IFRS earnings attributable to Class I and Class II Shares were $52 million in the third quarter of 2021, $2 million lower compared to 2020. Earnings attributable to Class I and Class II Shares include timing adjustments related to rate-regulated activities, unrealized gains or losses on mark-to-market forward and swap commodity contracts, one-time gains and losses, impairments, and items that are not in the normal course of business or a result of day-to-day operations. These items are not included in adjusted earnings.</p><p>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</p><p>ATCO Structures //st * Completed work on the LNG Canada Cedar Valley Lodge project, a joint venture with Bird Construction and the Haisla Nation.

Tidal provides full-scale marine operation services, focused primarily on stevedoring, hold cleaning, and port captaincy on the US West Coast, with operations in California, Oregon, and Washington.</p><p>Canadian Utilities //st * Announced a partnership with Future Fuel Ltd. to build and operate the Two Hills renewable natural gas (RNG) facility north of Vegreville, Alberta. The facility is Canadian Utilities' first commercial RNG production facility and is a strategic investment in our clean fuels strategy. The facility will combine organic waste from nearby municipalities with agricultural byproducts to produce approximately 230,000 gigajoules per year of renewable natural gas (enough to fuel 2,500 homes). * Completed Canada's most northerly off-grid solar project in Old Crow, Yukon with the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation, reducing diesel use by 189,000 litres annually and providing a clean energy source for decades to come. * Acquired the rights to the Empress Solar project, a 39-MW solar facility under development near Empress, Alberta. The project will provide enough renewable electricity to power more than 11,000 homes. * Acquired the development rights to build two solar projects with a combined capacity of 64-MW in Calgary, Alberta.

Reynolds left early this morning for a days fishing at the lake in Highland Valley. It will probably take them a day to go and return, but we bet they catch a large number of fish as they have never failed to on one of their other trips. We hope they will have a pleasant day. Will give full particulars next issue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FISHING PARTY (2):A party of three left town last Saturday \u2014 four o\u2019clock in the morning \u2014 fishing excursion \u2014 lake \u2014 Highland valley \u2014 fifteen miles \u2014 Returned eleven o\u2019clock at night \u2014 no fish \u2014 tired \u2014 hungry \u2014 sore \u2014 cranky \u2014 horses played out \u2014 Highland valley is now fifty miles \u2014 didn\u2019t find lake.</p><p>100 YEARS AGO:AUG. 12 and 19, 1921 MINING NEWS:M.J. Cameron, of Vancouver, is developing a copper property in Highland Valley known as the Kathleen. Much difficulty is experienced in the Highland for want of transportation, although it is one of the most promising copper camps in the province.</p><p>LANDSLIDE BLOCKS THOMPSON RIVER NEAR ASHCROFT:A landslide with about half a mile frontage came down without warning on the west side of the Thompson river at Basque, about six miles south of Ashcroft on Saturday morning last, and has changed completely the aspect of the country in that section, it is reported. The river was entirely blocked, and several miles up stream a rise of about twelve feet took place. No damage was done to either the C.P.R.or the C.N.R., fortunately, as the two lines follow parallel along the east side of the river at the point where the slide occurred. The Hammond ranch at Basque is the scene of the landslide, and, during the afternoon the ground was still falling down at intervals. At this writing no damage to the right-of-way, or to traffic is reported from either railway.</p><p>75 YEARS AGO:AUG. 10 and 17, 1946 796 FOREST FIRES SO FAR THIS YEAR:A total of 796 forest fire outbreaks have cost B.C. $84,518 so far this year, forest branch officials revealed at Victoria. The figures compare with those up to August 1 last year, which show 878 outbreaks costing $68,479 to overcome. Officials pointed out that heavy rains this season have helped to keep forest hazards at a minimum although the province has just passed through one dangerous period. They added that August is often a dangerous month for forest fires, and urged the public to remember the danger is not over. [As of Aug. 1, 2021 there had been 1,275 wildfires reported in the province this year.]</p><p>CACHE CREEK TO GET ELECTRIC LIGHT:Poles are being placed along the road from the Ashcroft Water, Electric power plant on the Bonaparte in preparation for the installation of a power and light line to Cache Creek. Cedar poles are being imported for the work at a cost, we understand, of approximately $10 each. They will run along the Boston Flat, and Cache Creek will be put on an up-to-date basis, so far as electric light is concerned. The installation will include not only the T.U. Auto Camp and homes there, but will take in the surrounding farms.</p><p>NEW ROUTE:Ashcroft businesses notice quite a difference in business since the cut-off has been opened behind Elephant mountain.</p><p>50 YEARS AGO:AUG. 12 and 19, 1971 CACHE CREEK SCHOOL DEBRIS DIS-APPEARING:Casadio and Son Holding Co. Ltd.has been awarded the contract to clean up the debris of the recent Cache Creek school fire. This work will be completed by August 17th. On August 18th, Atco Industries of Calgary will commence moving six portable classrooms onto the Cache Creek school site and 2 more units onto the Ashcroft Secondary site\u2026 The Board of School Trustees, immediately after the fire, commissioned their architects to proceed with new plans and specifications for rebuilding the school, using cement block construction rather than wood frame. These plans are proceeding favourably and the new construction should be in progress by early fall.</p><p>TAL FOR HOME:The Ashcroft and Cache Creek Old Age Pensioners Organization has set their sights on using the most modern wing of Lady Minto Hospital for a senior citizens rest and convalescent home once the new hospital is in use\u2026 The group, formed in November 1970 under the leadership of Mr.and Mrs. Fred Langler of Scotty Creek, is drawing public support to its ambition by circulating a petition throughout the area extending from Spences Bridge to Savona and north to Clinton.</p><p>BETHLEHEM DISCOVERS NEW ORE BODY:A report released this morning in Vancouver by Patrick M. Reynolds, president of Bethlehem Copper Corporation Ltd., advised shareholders that a major ore discovery had been made on the Company\u2019s Highland Valley property. In his report the president stated:\u201cOur Exploration Department has discovered an important copper ore zone approximately two miles southeast of our mill in Highland Valley\u2026 It is too early to estimate ore tonnage but indications are that the deposit will be of substantial proportions.\u201d</p><p>LYTTON LIONS HELP LILLOOET FIRE VICTIMS WITH DONA-TIONS:A goodwill caravan consisting of 5 vehicles loaded with household furniture, clothing, bedding and cooking utensils, left for Lillooet on Sunday, after Lytton Lions assembled a work crew to collect donations of articles on Saturday night. Excellent response was given by local citizens and the Parish Hall at Lytton soon was partly filled with useful articles for the burned out folk at Lillooet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASHCCJ-news20210819PPIA0002067972</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASHCCJ2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63DF-KJ81-F0HF-82GC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

It is a tale of two stories \u2013 the mid-level elevation snow is gone, the higher elevation snow is still there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rainfall patterns will have a significant influence going forward on streamflow conditions for the remainder of the year.\u201d</p><p>Doug Lundquist, warning preparedness meteorologist for Environment Canada, said the dryer than normal spring has placed a heightened need for the Okanagan\u2019s May-July rainy season to come through.</p><p>\u201cJune is the wettest month by far in the Okanagan and we need that to happen again this year. It looks the forecast is for the rains to start up next week so we\u2019ll be watching for that\u2026to help us get through the summer fire season,\u201d Lundquist said.</p><p>Bob Warner, with BC Wildfire, said as of May 10, 177 wildfires fi had burned just over 2,000 hectares across the province.</p><p>Warner said it\u2019s still early to read anything into those numbers yet, citing that in historically high fire seasons in 2017 and 2018, there was virtually no fire activity in May for either of those years.</p><p>He said forest conditions remain very dry through Kelowna, Penticton, Vernon, Merritt and Salmon Arm. \u201cThe June rains generally dictate the level of wildfire season we will see in July and August.

The resource estimate presented for the Huronian Project is historic in nature. Kesselrun Resources' qualified person has not completed sufficient work to confirm the results of the historical resource. Kesselrun Resources is not treating this as a current mineral resource but is considering it relevant as a guide to future exploration and includes it for reference purposes only. The historic resource was estimated by Minescape Exploration Inc. in 1998. Further drilling will be required by Kesselrun Resources to verify the historic estimate as current mineral resources.</p><p>As well, the Huronian Gold Project hosts the same lithological package of rocks, as interpreted from both Government of Ontario and Kesselrun Resources mapping, compilation and modelling, on strike from the Goldshore Resources adjacent Moss Lake Gold Deposit with an historic resource estimate of 1,377,300 oz Au at an average grade of 1.1 g/t Au in the indicated category and 1,751,600 oz Au at an average grade of 1.1 g/t Au in the inferred category as outlined in Wesdome Gold Mines' 2013 PEA (1). Mineralization hosted on adjacent and/or nearby properties is not necessarily indicative of mineralization hosted on Kesselrun Resources' property.</p><p>(1) Moss Lake Gold Mines (a subsidiary of Wesdome Gold Mines at the time) news releases February 20, 2013 and September 9, 2013. On January 26, 2021, Wesdome Gold Mines announced that the Moss Lake Project would be purchased by Goldshore Resources Inc. (see Wesdome and Goldshore news releases dated January 26, 2021).</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Michael Thompson, P.Geo., President and CEO of Kesselrun, is the Qualified Person responsible for the project as defined by National Instrument 43-101 and has approved the technical information in this news release.</p><p>Health and Safety</p><p>The health and safety of our personnel and contractors is always top priority to Kesselrun.

Known as Gua Sha, this ancient practice found among many East Asian countries is believed to help improve circulation and ease tension by manually applying pressure with a tool such as a spoon or coin wrapped in a towel. I can recall them sitting one behind the other and applying even and deliberate strokes to the back and neck, leaving behind faint red streaks on the skin like new earth after a forest fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nowadays, Gua Sha stones have become a top beauty trend retailing anywhere between $18 to $80. The jade, amethyst or rose quartz stones are marketed as a must-have tool by wellness influencers to accompany any \"clean\" beauty routine, and can be found on almost any skin-care commerce platform. Gua Sha how-to tutorials by beauty influencers have multiplied online, ranging from free videos on TikTok and YouTube to $110 for a one-hour virtual workshop.</p><p>Not limited to beauty trends, other elements of East Asian culture have grown increasingly popular over the past few years. This includes holidays such as Lunar New Year and Dragon Boat Festivals, integrative health practices rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine such as acupuncture and qi gong, and culinary traditions including bao and bubble tea.</p><p>While we see the increasing popularity and commodification of Asian culture, we've simultaneously witnessed an unprecedented rise in anti-Asian racism with all Asians scapegoated as the perpetrators of COVID-19, an extension of historical views that Asian people pose a danger to public health.</p><p>What began as reports of harassment and verbal abuse at the start of the pandemic led to physical altercations, and escalated inevitably to the shootings in Atlanta in March and the murder of eight people, six of whom were women of East Asian descent.</p><p>While the rise in popularity in practices rooted in Asian cultural traditions could be positive and lead to cultural understanding and acceptance, often cultural origins and intentions are stripped away, rewritten or erased for profitability. It feels as though some have capitalized on the popular elements of Asian culture while leaving out Asian communities. The popularity disguises the reality that our communities face racial violence, leaving us out of the conversation about racism and discrimination. Trendy, yet invisible.</p><p>Living with these duelling and contradictory narratives is frustrating and exhausting.</p><p>On one hand, the potential of acceptance by mainstream society is being dangled in front of us, making us believe we are tantalizingly close to gaining their acceptance. But it is a myth that keeps us placated and silent. Cultural appropriation is the false hope of acceptance, the broken promise of belonging as it strips our already lacking representation for the price of a trendy $80 Gua Sha.</p><p>We need to start by recognizing that everything that we consume is not in a vacuum but is within a system that is rife with inequities and discrimination. In the same way that the environmental movement has us assessing the origins of our food and clothing, whether it's locally made and sustainably sourced, we need to start understanding and learning about the cultural origins of what we consume.</p><p>So, what are ways to respectfully engage in cultural traditions?</p><p>First, educating yourself. Researching cultural goods such as food, clothing, art, beauty practices and educate their historical context that brought it to your e-commerce platform, local shop, or restaurant.</p><p>Supporting businesses and organizations that pay proper respect to cultural origins, including a way to give back and support the communities where those cultures come from. Call out and voice your concerns when you see culturally extractive practices.</p><p>Lastly, businesses need to adopt practices that give back and support the cultures they are sourcing from. This could include an emphasis on hiring certain artists for designing packaging or murals, consulting with cultural experts and paying them for their expertise or appointing them to decision-making positions or donating to causes that support the biggest challenges facing the communities they are sourcing from.</p><p>We can no longer claim that \"borrowing\" culture of historically underserved populations is harmless. Over the past year, we've seen first-hand how this leads to cultural erasure and readily turns into societal scapegoating. It is time to move toward a future where we adopt respectful practices when it comes to consumption of other cultures.</p><p>Tiffanie Tri is a community builder, advocate and social entrepreneur.

Now, 36, Case is well into his first year as president of the 100 Mile Lions Club, having taken the reins last summer in the midst of a global pandemic that posed many challenges for his and other community groups.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThe 100 Mile Lions has been a huge part of building this community for families,\u201d Case told the Free Press. \u201cThat\u2019s part of why I always wanted to get involved.\u201d</p><p>With the encouragement of several longtime Lions members, Case first joined the club in 2019. One member who has been especially helpful with his transition to his presidential role is Lion Ron Graves, who has been with the club for decades, \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve really enjoyed doing over the various years,\u201d Graves said. \u201cEspecially the camaraderie that goes along with being a member of a group that has common interests.\u201d</p><p>The club\u2019s motto is \u201cwe serve,\u201d and as Graves notes, each individual club \u2013 of which there are 42,000 worldwide \u2013 decides how their community might be best served by their work.</p><p>Local projects involving the 100 Mile Lions Club include the development of the soccer fields, construction of Centennial Park, forest fire relief and annual schol-arships offered to Peter Skene Ogden students.</p><p>Funds are raised in the community by way of barbecues, raffles and the club\u2019s annual dinner and auction. The latter event was cancelled last year due to COVID-19 restrictions, which has impacted the club\u2019s fundraising efforts and posed the biggest pandemic-related challenge, according to Case.</p><p>\u201cThe community usually supports us hugely with donations, but right now, going to a busi-ness that has had its income cut in some cases by 80 per cent, I personally couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Case explained. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, this community is known for helping out a lot.\u201d</p><p>Another big adjustment for the club and its 32 members has been moving their twice-monthly meetings online, which Case notes took some time to get used to. While the club is grateful to be able to stay connected via Zoom, Case admits that without being able to gather in person, the sense of togetherness is not quite the same.</p><p>Looking ahead to the future of the 100 Mile Lions, Case said he is grateful for the support and mentorship of long-term members who can reflect on the club\u2019s 63year history and the changes that have taken place over the decades.</p><p>When asked what some of the biggest changes have been during his many years with the Lions, Graves is quick to respond.</p><p>\u201cThe realization that we were leaving out half the population,\u201d Graves said, referring to the club\u2019s former men-only policy within its membership, which was revoked more than 20 years ago.</p><p>Graves recalled some resistance to the change \u2013 and even the departure of a handful of members over it \u2013 but said the benefit of including women in the club has been immense.</p><p>\u201c100 Mile would not have a Lions Club in any form if they had not opened up the membership to women,\u201d Graves said, adding that more than half of the current members are women.</p><p>Next up for the 100 Mile Lions is a cash raffle that kicks off today (April 1). Just 2,000 tickets will be for sale at various business fronts, including Midori Day Spa, Exquisite Florals and Gifts and the Free Press and directly from club members. The lottery, which runs until Aug. 14 has three prizes up for grabs:$7,000, $2,000 and $1,000.</p><p>Case hinted at another project in the works to help local seniors, but says details can\u2019t be fully revealed until the plans are solidified.</p><p>The group is always welcoming new members of all ages, Case said, and more information can be found on its Facebook page.</p><p>\u201cI think some people can be a little put off by the amount of time commitment it would take to be involved, but because we\u2019re such a big group, the volunteering is really spread out throughout the group,\u201d Case said. \u201cAll of our members contribute in different ways.\u201d</p><p>Special to the Free Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AVLNWS-news20210401UAEA0001740517</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62CT-8RF1-JD2C-J0DH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

It is a tale of two stories \u2013 the mid-level elevation snow is gone, the higher elevation snow is still there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rainfall patterns will have a significant influence going forward on streamflow conditions for the remainder of the year.\u201d</p><p>Doug Lundquist, the warning preparedness meteorologist for Environment Canada, said the dryer than normal spring has placed a heightened need for the Okanagan\u2019s May-July rainy season to come through.</p><p>\u201cJune is the wettest month by far in the Okanagan and we need that to happen again this year. It looks the forecast is for the rains to start up next week so we\u2019ll be watching for that\u2026 to help us get through the</p><p>summer fire season,\u201d Lundquist said.</p><p>Bob Warner, with BC Wildfire, said as of May 10, 177 wildfires had burned just over 2,000 hectares across the province.</p><p>Warner said it\u2019s still early to read anything into those numbers yet, citing that in historically high fire seasons in 2017 and 2018, there was virtually no fire activity in May for either of those years.</p><p>He said forest conditions remain very dry through Kelowna, Penticton, Vernon, Merritt and Salmon Arm.</p><p>\u201cThe June rains generally dictate the level of wildfire season we will see in July and August. So we keep our fingers crossed we will get some rain in June,\u201d Warner said.</p><p>Karilyn Alex, Okanagan Nation Alliance fisheries biologist, says said sockeye salmon, kokanee and rainbow trout spawning numbers remain in line with recent historical markers while the chinook salmon spawning resurgence contin-</p><p>ues to show positive gains.</p><p>Alex said of the 110,000 to 170,000 fish spawning return in the Columbia River system, about 80 per cent find their way back to the Okanagan River, reflecting the historic significance of that salmon run and the need to provide tributary habitat and streamflows to support the revitalization of the fishery.</p><p>Central Okanagan residents and property owners are invited to share their experience and ideas to help reduce the risks from flooding and high water in a series of upcoming Zoom \u2018community conversations.\u2019</p><p>The first two forums \u2013May 26, 12-1 p.m.; and May 27, 5:50-6:15 p.m. \u2013 address what do you care about regarding flooding in your home community.</p><p>The second pair of forums -June 23, 5:15-6:15 p.m., and June 24, 12-1 p.m. \u2013 will focus on which flood mitigation options do you want to see in your community.</p><p>For more information or to register as a forum participant, visit rdco.com/flood.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECC-news20210520PQRA0001867875</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62R2-7SD1-F0HF-80Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438265</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Known as Gua Sha, this ancient practice found among many East Asian countries is believed to help improve circulation and ease tension by manually applying pressure with a tool such as a spoon or coin wrapped in a towel. I can recall them sitting one behind the other and applying even and deliberate strokes to the back and neck, leaving behind faint red streaks on the skin like new earth after a forest fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nowadays, Gua Sha stones have become a top beauty trend retailing anywhere between $18 to $80. The jade, amethyst or rose quartz stones are marketed as a must-have tool by wellness influencers to accompany any 'clean' beauty routine, and can be found on almost any skin care commerce platform. Gua Sha \"how to\" tutorials by beauty influencers have multiplied online, ranging from free videos on TikTok and YouTube to $110 for a one-hour virtual workshop.</p><p>Not limited to beauty trends, other elements of East Asian culture have grown increasingly popular over the past few years. This includes holidays such as Lunar New Year and Dragon Boat Festivals, integrative health practices rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine such as acupuncture and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">qi gong</emphasis>, and culinary traditions including bao and bubble tea.</p><p>While we see the increasing popularity and commodification of Asian culture, we've simultaneously witnessed an unprecedented rise in anti-Asian racism with all Asians scapegoated as the perpetrators of COVID-19, an extension of historical views that Asian people pose a danger to public health. What began as reports of harassment and verbal abuse at the start of the pandemic led to physical altercations, and escalated inevitably to the shootings in Atlanta in March 2021 and the murder of eight people, six of whom were women of East Asian descent.</p><p>While the rise in popularity in practices rooted in Asian cultural traditions could be positive and lead to cultural understanding and acceptance, often cultural origins and intentions are stripped away, rewritten or erased for profitability. It feels as though some have capitalized on the popular elements of Asian culture while leaving out Asian communities. The popularity disguises the reality that our communities face racial violence, leaving us out of the conversation about racism and discrimination. Trendy, yet invisible.</p><p>Living with these duelling and contradictory narratives is frustrating and exhausting. On one hand, the potential of acceptance by dominant society is being dangled in front of us, making us believe we are tantalizingly close to gaining their acceptance. But it is a myth that keeps us placated and silent. Cultural appropriation is the false hope of acceptance, the broken promise of belonging as it strips our already lacking representation for the price of a trendy $80 Gua Sha.</p><p>We need to start by recognizing that everything that we consume is not in a vacuum but is within a system that is rife with inequities and discrimination. In the same way that the environmental movement has us assessing the origins of our food and clothing, whether it's locally made and sustainably sourced, we need to start understanding and learning about the cultural origins of what we consume.</p><p>So, what are ways to respectfully engage in cultural traditions?</p><p>First, educating yourself. Researching cultural goods such as food, clothing, art, beauty practices and educate their historical context that brought it to your e-commerce platform, local shop, or restaurant.</p><p>Supporting businesses and organizations that pay proper respect to cultural origins, including a way to give back and support the communities where those cultures come from. Call out and voice your concerns when you see culturally extractive practices.</p><p>Lastly, businesses need to adopt practices that give back and support the cultures they are sourcing from. This could include an emphasis on hiring certain artists for designing packaging or murals, consulting with cultural experts and paying them for their expertise or appointing them to decision-making positions or donating to causes that support the biggest challenges facing the communities they are sourcing from.</p><p>We can no longer claim that \u2018borrowing' culture of historically underserved populations is harmless. Over the past year, we've seen first-hand how this leads to cultural erasure and readily turns into societal scapegoating. It is time to move toward a future where we adopt respectful practices when it comes to consumption of other cultures.</p><p>Tiffanie Tri is a community builder, advocate and social entrepreneur.

nitf:lede=\"true\">Aug 12, 2021( Digital Journal: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com\">http://www.digitaljournal.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> Hundreds of firefighters battled Thursday to contain new flare-ups in wildfire-ravaged areas of Greece, where summer infernos have caused what the prime minister described as the country's 'greatest ecological disaster in decades'. </p><p><br/> However, rain overnight in some areas and falling temperatures appeared to have eased the situation after two weeks of devastating blazes, and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said 'we can be more optimistic today' than previous days. <br/>Greece's most severe heatwave in decades has fanned blazes that have destroyed more than 100,000 hectares of forests and farmland, the country's worst wildfire damage since 2007, the European Forest Fire Information System said Thursday. <br/> The fires have left three dead, hundreds homeless, forced thousands to flee, and caused economic and environmental devastation. <br/>Greece is just one of a number of countries in the Mediterranean region that have been hit by a savage fire season which authorities have blamed on climate change. <br/> Mitsotakis on Thursday described the 'mega fires' as Greece's 'greatest ecological disaster in decades'. <br/> 'Climate crisis is here and it tells us that everything must change,' he told reporters, pointing to other devastating fires in Turkey, Italy and Algeria. <br/> The prime minister said firefighters, volunteers and locals had saved 'countless' homes and businesses, but dozens of properties had been lost nonetheless. <br/> Mitsotakis said that 150 homes have been lost in greater Athens over the last week, while the count is ongoing on the island of Evia, which accounts for more than half of the area burned nationwide. <br/><br/>- 'Can't take it anymore' - <br/><br/>A fire service official told AFP on Thursday that 'the fire fronts are still active' on Evia and in the Arcadia region of the Peloponnese peninsula and 'fires are constantly flaring up' in both areas. <br/> In the north of Evia, where hundreds have been evacuated by boat, 858 firefighters including reinforcements from Ukraine, Romania and Serbia, were battling the flames. <br/> And there was fresh concern in Athens after a new fire broke out on Thursday morning in the industrial zone of Aspropyrgos, 20 kilometres (12 miles) northwest of the capital. <br/> At the height of the fires in early August, the flames had reached the gates of Athens, filling the sky of the city of four million inhabitants with grey smoke. <br/> But after weeks of punishing temperatures often well over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), a lower 33 degrees Celsius was forecast for Thursday. <br/> The falling temperatures and overnight rain in Evia, thePeloponnese and central Greece had helped improve the situation, said Stathis Koulis, the mayor of Gortynia. <br/> The village of Gortynia in a mountainous area of Arcadia 200 kilometres (120 miles) west of Athens has become the primary focus in the Peloponnese, with deep ravines posing a challenge to firefighters. <br/> Twenty villages have been evacuated in the area over the past few days and 680 firefighters, including more than a hundred sent to help from France, and five water-dropping aircraft have been relentlessly battling the flames. <br/> 'I can't take it anymore,' said farmer Kostis Angelou as he wandered between the corpses of his goats, all 372 of them burnt by a fire that devoured forests on Evia. <br/> The 44-year-old managed to survive by spending hours under an irrigation water pipe, surrounded by flames. <br/> 'A saint saved me,' he said. <br/><br/>- Climate 'code red' - <br/><br/>The latest extreme weather events come after a 'code red' report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was published on Monday warning that the world is warming far faster than previously feared. <br/> The Mediterranean has been singled out as a 'climate change hotspot', with increasing temperatures and aridity lengthening fire seasons and doubling the areas potential burnt, according to draft IPCC assessment seen exclusively by AFP. <br/>Algeria announced three days of national mourning starting Thursday for the 69 dead killed in blazes there. <br/> Five have died in fires in Italy, where what is believed to be a new European record of 48.8 degrees Celsius (119.8 Fahrenheit) was registered in Sicily on Wednesday \u2014 beating the previous high recorded in Greece in 1977. <br/> Eight people were killed in fires in Turkey's south earlier in the month, while in the north the death toll rose to five on Thursday from flash floods that have swept across several Black Sea regions. <br/><url

That's the first step in making change, to respect each other and I hope we can go out there and do that today,\" he said.</p><p>He added that he hopes the event will remain \"strictly peaceful\" and he will not be preventing any essential workers from getting through.</p><p>\"I'm strictly trying to protect my land against squatters and tourists,\" he said. \"The starting point of it was seeing the amount of people that are taking the land that we have and quite frankly not caring about it and destroying it&amp;#x26;#8230;For me, it's so hard to see that so many of these spiritual places are getting taken over and they're getting commercialized, something that you can just give away.\"</p><p>He said he and his family used to visit the area often, but repeatedly had their hearts broken at what they've seen as they've had to extinguish abandoned fires and pick up garbage each time they've visited.</p><p>\"In the past few months, there have been so many tourists coming to Tofino and Ucluelet and with that there has been a lack of vacancies at hotels and campsites and people are flocking to the backroads,\" he said. \"The amount of people driving their cars and camping on the riverbank is so hard to see because that is a salmon bearing river. To see the amount of people driving on the river and disturbing that ground, for me, it's so dangerous with the salmon disappearing so fast right now we have to try to protect the areas where they will come back.\"</p><p>He added he was driving past the area several days ago and was shocked by the amount of cars turning onto West Main.</p><p>\"It was so shocking, but also made me quite angry to see as well because this territory that we live in is so beautiful, but the amount of people that are there is a recipe for a forest fire and it's a recipe for more pollution on our lands and this is something that I could not just stand by and let happen,\" he said.</p><p>\"We have to try to stop this. We have to make a change, but we can't do it alone, we have to do it together as all our communities. This influx of tourists is, from my point of view, a direct cause of Parks Canada and the tourism of Tofino and Ucluelet trying to invite more and more people to come, but we don't have enough infrastructure to support it. In the past 10 years, we've been making Tofino and Ucluelet a place to be, we've been making it a destination and this is something we really should have been trying to plan out and we should have anticipated the amount of people that would be coming.\"</p><p>Along with being hit hard by tourism, the backroads have also become a point of contention because the housing crisis in both Tofino and Ucluelet has forced seasonal workers to camp in the area while working in town.</p><p>\"I personally have a lot of trouble with people squatting on the backlands. I do understand this really is a housing problem that we can't just solve at the snap of our fingers.

The drilling program resulted in the intersection of two banded iron formations not previously known in this area and only 18 km NNW of Newmont's giant Musselwhite gold mine which is hosted by a tightly folded iron formation. </p><p><br/>Highlights: A number of new targets have come to light as a result of the recent drilling including two banded iron formations not previously known in this area.The folded portion of the iron formation is now a high-priority drill target for Musselwhite-type gold mineralization.9 holes totalling 1,756 metres were drilled from 8 sites to test the on-strike projections of the three VMS-style base metal zones and the high-grade gold vein (8.64 g/t Au over 4.75 m) discovered on the property (See Press Release Dec. 5, 2019[1]).All assays are currently pending and will be reported on once they have been received and analyzed by the Company.The diamond drill rig has been left on the property in order to carry out further follow-up drilling in 2022. \"In addition to testing the aforementioned base metal and gold targets, the 2021 drill program was the first to test 2 major EM conductors along the western side of the property, resulting in the intersection of two banded iron formations not previously known in this area and only 18 km NNW of Newmont's giant Musselwhite gold mine which is hosted by a tightly folded iron formation,\" stated John Biczok, VP of Exploration.  <br/>\"We are quite excited by the intercepts of these 2 iron formations, with drilled widths up to 13.6 m, as they occur just 300 m along strike from a well-developed fold,  &gt;800 m long, which is evident on historic aeromagnetic maps of the area. This folded portion of the iron formation presents an ideal structural setting for the potential development of Musselwhite-type gold mineralization and has become a high-priority target for the next phase of drilling,\" he continued. <br/>The three VMS (volcanogenic massive sulphide) style base metal zones intersected in 2019 assayed up to 2.4 g/t Au and 1.26% Cu over 3.25 m with locally significant silver, lead and zinc values. These zones were discovered by following a  &gt;7 km long alteration pathway through a combination of geophysical surveys and diamond drilling as there are virtually no outcrops of this alteration zone. Five holes targeted the VMS zones in 2021, including two drilled from the same setup. <br/>Gold-bearing veins found on the Lundmark-Akow Lake property to date are of 2 types, which may be genetically related: gold-bearing quartz + pyrrhotite veins assaying up to 8.64 g/t Au over 4.75 m, and \"epithermal-looking\" calcite +/- dolomite-pyrite-pyrrhotite-chlorite veins up to 7.5 m wide that are locally auriferous, assaying up to 2.96 g/t Au over 1.0 m. These calcite veins are thought to be formed from deep-seated, high-pressure fluids potentially related to the nearby gold-quartz veins. Similar veins are found in the Red Lake gold mines. The 2021 drilling intersected more of these unusual veins up to 2.3 m wide in three holes while 2 holes specifically targeted the extension of the main gold-bearing quartz vein intersected in 2019. <br/>\"This latest drill program was completed under considerable time pressures after unavoidable delays caused by an industry-wide shortage of drillers and the severe forest fire situation in NW Ontario,\" commented Stephen Burega, President of Romios. \"The pending drill results will be used to guide our next phase of drilling in the core area of this mineral rich property covering an area that is 5 km x 1.2 km. To date, the Company has drilled only 16 holes but has intersected 4 different styles of overlapping gold and base metal mineralization with numerous geophysical targets still to be tested and known zones to be fully delineated.\" <br/>Qualified Person <br/>The technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by John Biczok, P.

I do understand this really is a housing problem that we can't just solve at the snap of our fingers. This is something that our local communities have to sit down and work together&amp;#x26;#8230;We have to try to figure this out,\" he said. \"I find it so tough when people are squatting on Tla-o-qui-aht lands because these lands I hold so close to my heart&amp;#x26;#8230;.My goal is to shut that off until we can properly find a solution to the problem.\"</p><p>He added his main focus on Tuesday will be to prevent tourists from accessing the area.</p><p>\"I just want to try to stop that for now and then we can try to figure out the problem of those people that are living out there and we can hopefully find that solution,\" he said. \"We draw these lines between Ucluelet and Tofino and different residents, but this a problem that we're all facing and we have to come up with that solution not as a Ucluelet resident or a Tofino resident or a Tla-o-qui-aht member, we have to do it together. We all live here on the West Coast.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:andrew.bailey@westerlynews.caLike\">andrew.bailey@westerlynews.caLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>READ MORE: Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District looks at enforcement of illegal camping</p><p>READ MORE: Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation says more resources needed to keep Tribal Parks open</p><p>READ MORE: Ucluelet Secondary School graduate earns TD Scholarship for Community Leadership</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NANWSB-4197293</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NANWSB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63H3-PJM1-F103-3082-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438304</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"795\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors.

Fortunately, they recovered their gear downstream and were able to pry open the logs to free Paddy. At Rainbow Lake (now called Spectrum), they quickly built rafts to fish and explore the island and the shoreline.</p><p>From their base at Peters Lake where they intended to spend two nights, they toured the surrounding area on foot as the horses grazed happily at the lake. Burnett was so impressed with the area, he mused about its potential as a future golf course and tourist resort. On their way to Margie Lake on the first day, they were fortunate to sight caribou, three young yearlings and an old bull.</p><p>Amazed at the beauty of the alpine, Burnett also found it a \"botanist paradise\" as some plants were in seed in the valley but were still flowering at higher elevations. He describes \"a tiny glade among the balsam\" where \"every square foot of space of which was carpeted with a mixture of Indian paintbrush and silvery-green plumes of the anemones\" and \"the blending of colours and the lighting were perfect.\"</p><p>Read more: Column - Remembering the famed Lee Creek Harvest Festival</p><p>Read more: Column - In search of the Shuswap's most significant trees</p><p>When they attempted to hike up Mt. Fraser on day two, which Bill had named after himself in 1928, they were blocked by a rockslide with a glacier behind it, \"which only well-equipped mountaineers would tackle.\" They had fun trying out some boot-skiing and when it began to rain, they headed back to camp for another night. The following day they hiked up to scenic Blue Lake and found floating islands of snow in the intense blue water. That night as stories were being told by the fire, they heard a scratching sound behind them and discovered a porcupine chewing a hole in a packsack, which was soon shot with a twenty-two with the help of a flashlight.</p><p>The area Burnett explored became Monashee Provincial Park in 1962, in part because of concern over caribou hunting that was decimating the herd.</p><p>Many of the names have changed, including the mountain; now Mt. Fosthall that was renamed in the 1950s after an early surveyor.</p><p>Peters Lake is now a hiker's paradise accessed by trails that begin at logging roads either from Sugar Lake or Arrow Lake.</p><p>Much of The Shuswap Country includes photos and stories from the Lumby and Cherryville region for good reason, as the nearby mountains offer so much to explore and fortunately Burnett lived close by in Coldstream. On an earlier trip, he joined another Bill Fraser-guided horseback trip up to the Park Mountain lookout, where they met the lookout man who had not seen a visitor in weeks. At 7,000 feet, he was on watch for smoke and when a plume was spotted, he phoned in the location, which was pinpointed thanks to the directions provided by another lookout from a nearby mountain.</p><p>The Sugar Lake logging road was under construction then, and Burnett predicted that one day it would follow the trail over the pass below Joss Mountain to the TransCanada highway at Three-Valley Gap, which fortunately never happened. When Bill Fraser first arrived, he found traces of the camp made by geological surveyor George Mercer Dawson, who followed this ancient Indigenous trail in 1878.</p><p>Hopefully one day, Burnett's scrapbook journal could be published so it can be appreciated by many more people, as it provides a captivating and intriguing window into our region's rich history.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsroom@saobserver.net\">newsroom@saobserver.net</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 Salmon Arm Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALARM-news20210326PSB4134891</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALARM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6299-TRX1-JD2C-J03Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438273</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"731\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

(\"Romios Gold\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to report that it has successfully completed its fall drilling program on the Lundmark-Akow Lake gold and base metals project in northwestern Ontario. The drilling program resulted in the intersection of two banded iron formations not previously known in this area and only 18 km NNW of Newmont's giant Musselwhite gold mine which is hosted by a tightly folded iron formation.</p><p>Highlights: //st * A number of new targets have come to light as a result of the recent drilling including two banded iron formations not previously known in this area. * The folded portion of the iron formation is now a high-priority drill target for Musselwhite-type gold mineralization. * 9 holes totalling 1,756 metres were drilled from 8 sites to test the on-strike projections of the three VMS-style base metal zones and the high-grade gold vein (8.64 g/t Au over 4.75 m) discovered on the property (See Press Release Dec. 5, 2019). * All assays are currently pending and will be reported on once they have been received and analyzed by the Company. * The diamond drill rig has been left on the property in order to carry out further follow-up drilling in 2022.</p><p>\"In addition to testing the aforementioned base metal and gold targets, the 2021 drill program was the first to test 2 major EM conductors along the western side of the property, resulting in the intersection of two banded iron formations not previously known in this area and only 18 km NNW of Newmont's giant Musselwhite gold mine which is hosted by a tightly folded iron formation,\" stated John Biczok, VP of Exploration.</p><p>\"We are quite excited by the intercepts of these 2 iron formations, with drilled widths up to 13.6 m, as they occur just 300 m along strike from a well-developed fold, )800 m long, which is evident on historic aeromagnetic maps of the area. This folded portion of the iron formation presents an ideal structural setting for the potential development of Musselwhite-type gold mineralization and has become a high-priority target for the next phase of drilling,\" he continued.</p><p>The three VMS (volcanogenic massive sulphide) style base metal zones intersected in 2019 assayed up to 2.4 g/t Au and 1.26% Cu over 3.25 m with locally significant silver, lead and zinc values. These zones were discovered by following a )7 km long alteration pathway through a combination of geophysical surveys and diamond drilling as there are virtually no outcrops of this alteration zone. Five holes targeted the VMS zones in 2021, including two drilled from the same setup.</p><p>Gold-bearing veins found on the Lundmark-Akow Lake property to date are of 2 types, which may be genetically related: gold-bearing quartz + pyrrhotite veins assaying up to 8.64 g/t Au over 4.75 m, and \"epithermal-looking\" calcite +/- dolomite-pyrite-pyrrhotite-chlorite veins up to 7.5 m wide that are locally auriferous, assaying up to 2.96 g/t Au over 1.0 m. These calcite veins are thought to be formed from deep-seated, high-pressure fluids potentially related to the nearby gold-quartz veins. Similar veins are found in the Red Lake gold mines. The 2021 drilling intersected more of these unusual veins up to 2.3 m wide in three holes while 2 holes specifically targeted the extension of the main gold-bearing quartz vein intersected in 2019.</p><p>\"This latest drill program was completed under considerable time pressures after unavoidable delays caused by an industry-wide shortage of drillers and the severe forest fire situation in NW Ontario,\" commented Stephen Burega, President of Romios. \"The pending drill results will be used to guide our next phase of drilling in the core area of this mineral rich property covering an area that is 5 km x 1.2 km. To date, the Company has drilled only 16 holes but has intersected 4 different styles of overlapping gold and base metal mineralization with numerous geophysical targets still to be tested and known zones to be fully delineated.\"</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>The technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by John Biczok, P.

A traffic stop was initiated where suspicion formed that the driver had been previously drinking. An approved screening device demand was read where the male failed to provide a proper breath sample multiple times. The driver was issued a 90-day immediate roadside prohibition and his vehicle was towed.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; July 26, 5:01 p.m., Pinewood Drive and Briarwood Crescent: Complainant reported that a driver was driving erratically by speeding and drifting in the area. Police contacted the registered owner by phone, who admitted to driving and apologized for his driving. Police warned the driver of the possibility of receiving violation tickets if police received any more driving complaints related to his driving.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; July 26, 8:16 p.m., 10000 Dunlop Rd.: Complainant reported a possible lost/stray dark brown Labrador wandering around at a nearby park. Police attended, conducted foot patrols in the park and surrounding trails, but were unable to locate the dog. Area patrols of the surrounding streets were negative for the dog or anyone looking for a dog.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; July 27, 3:15 p.m., location withheld: Complainant called police wanting them to collect three rifles he inherited from his grandfather . Police attended the male's residence and collected the firearms. The male advised that he did not know anyone who wants them and wanted to turn them into police. The male was advised the firearms would be destroyed if he didn't want to sell/give them to somebody with a valid firearms licence. Police were able to put the male in touch with an independent buyer, whom the male advised he would sell to. The firearms returned to the male at his request.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; July 28, 4:45 p.m., 8100-block 120th St.: A loss prevention officer from a nearby store reported that a female had taken a cart full of groceries and left the store without paying. The loss prevention officer followed the female out of the store, arrested her and held her for police. Police arrived and arrested, chartered and warned the female for theft. The store was not interested in pressing any charges. The female was verbally warned and was told that she is not welcome at the store for one year.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; July 29, 7:55 p.m., 12100-block 64th Ave.: Police were conducting proactive patrols when a vehicle travelling at a high rate of speed was observed passing the police vehicle. A traffic stop was conducted where empty beer cans were visible behind the seat and there was a distinct odour of liquor coming from the driver. An approved screening device demand was read and the driver advised that he had one beer two hours prior. The driver was given multiple attempts to provide a sample before being charged with refusal. The male was given a 90-day immediate roadside prohibition, a ticket for lane changing without signalling, a ticket for failing to display his \"N\" sign, and the vehicle was impounded.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; July 30, 5:45 p.m., 6400-block 116A St.: Complainant reported a male driving in the nearby area was discarding cigarettes around a forest. Police contacted the registered owner, who admitted to smoking in the area but advised that he discards the used cigarettes in a container.. The male was educated about the potential of a forest fire/littering tickets. The male advised that he understood and would not smoke in the forest area and would continue to discard the cigarettes in a container.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; July 31, 5:10 a.m., 11700-block Cowley Dr.: Complainant reported hearing what she thought was a cougar or bobcat fighting another animal in her backyard one hour prior.

Police attended the area and observed a group of males in the laneway, watching TV outside. The males were outside due to the heat inside of their residence. They were advised to bring the gathering inside of their residence and keep the noise down, to which they agreed. It was explained that if police had to re-attend due to the noise there may be a bylaw ticket issued. The males were co-operative.</p><p>RELATED: South Delta crime beat, week of July 26</p><p>SEE ALSO: North Delta crime beat, week of July 19</p><p>SEE ALSO: South Delta crime beat, week of July 19</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editor@northdeltareporter.comLike\">editor@northdeltareporter.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NDREP-4196802</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NDREP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63H3-W5S1-F103-34WH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459604</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"875\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>North Delta Reporter</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 9, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00093PY</classCode><className>PROPERTY CRIMES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000112</classCode><className>ARRESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001788</classCode><className>VANDALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001982</classCode><className>WEAPONS &amp; ARMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000959S</classCode><className>CRIMINAL OFFENSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000820</classCode><className>GUN CONTROL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000525</classCode><className>DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00092U2</classCode><className>DRIVER BEHAVIOR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX001567</classCode><className>SHOPLIFTING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00092U2</classCode><className>DRIVER BEHAVIOR</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It is submitted weekly by the Delta Police Department. If you see anything occurring that you believe to be suspicious, call 911 for in progress crimes and emergencies or 604-946-4411 for other assistance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The following are some of the calls police responded to in the previous week:</p><p>\u07e6 July 26, 4:21 p.m., 11800-block Nordel Way: Complainant reported observing a male stumble into his vehicle and swerve along the highway. A traffic stop was initiated where suspicion formed that the driver had been previously drinking. An approved screening device demand was read where the male failed to provide a proper breath sample multiple times. The driver was issued a 90-day immediate roadside prohibition and his vehicle was towed.</p><p>\u07e6 July 26, 5:01 p.m., Pinewood Drive and Briarwood Crescent: Complainant reported that a driver was driving erratically by speeding and drifting in the area. Police contacted the registered owner by phone, who admitted to driving and apologized for his driving. Police warned the driver of the possibility of receiving violation tickets if police received any more driving complaints related to his driving.</p><p>\u07e6 July 26, 8:16 p.m., 10000 Dunlop Rd.: Complainant reported a possible lost/stray dark brown Labrador wandering around at a nearby park. Police attended, conducted foot patrols in the park and surrounding trails, but were unable to locate the dog. Area patrols of the surrounding streets were negative for the dog or anyone looking for a dog.</p><p>\u07e6 July 27, 3:15 p.m., location withheld: Complainant called police wanting them to collect three rifles he inherited from his grandfather . Police attended the male's residence and collected the firearms. The male advised that he did not know anyone who wants them and wanted to turn them into police. The male was advised the firearms would be destroyed if he didn't want to sell/give them to somebody with a valid firearms licence. Police were able to put the male in touch with an independent buyer, whom the male advised he would sell to. The firearms returned to the male at his request.</p><p>\u07e6 July 28, 4:45 p.m., 8100-block 120th St.: A loss prevention officer from a nearby store reported that a female had taken a cart full of groceries and left the store without paying. The loss prevention officer followed the female out of the store, arrested her and held her for police. Police arrived and arrested, chartered and warned the female for theft. The store was not interested in pressing any charges. The female was verbally warned and was told that she is not welcome at the store for one year.</p><p>\u07e6 July 29, 7:55 p.m., 12100-block 64th Ave.: Police were conducting proactive patrols when a vehicle travelling at a high rate of speed was observed passing the police vehicle. A traffic stop was conducted where empty beer cans were visible behind the seat and there was a distinct odour of liquor coming from the driver. An approved screening device demand was read and the driver advised that he had one beer two hours prior. The driver was given multiple attempts to provide a sample before being charged with refusal. The male was given a 90-day immediate roadside prohibition, a ticket for lane changing without signalling, a ticket for failing to display his \"N\" sign, and the vehicle was impounded.</p><p>\u07e6 July 30, 5:45 p.m., 6400-block 116A St.: Complainant reported a male driving in the nearby area was discarding cigarettes around a forest.

That's the first step in making change, to respect each other and I hope we can go out there and do that today,\" he said.</p><p>He added that he hopes the event will remain \"strictly peaceful\" and he will not be preventing any essential workers from getting through.</p><p>\"I'm strictly trying to protect my land against squatters and tourists,\" he said. \"The starting point of it was seeing the amount of people that are taking the land that we have and quite frankly not caring about it and destroying it\u2026For me, it's so hard to see that so many of these spiritual places are getting taken over and they're getting commercialized, something that you can just give away.\"</p><p>He said he and his family used to visit the area often, but repeatedly had their hearts broken at what they've seen as they've had to extinguish abandoned fires and pick up garbage each time they've visited.</p><p>\"In the past few months, there have been so many tourists coming to Tofino and Ucluelet and with that there has been a lack of vacancies at hotels and campsites and people are flocking to the backroads,\" he said. \"The amount of people driving their cars and camping on the riverbank is so hard to see because that is a salmon bearing river. To see the amount of people driving on the river and disturbing that ground, for me, it's so dangerous with the salmon disappearing so fast right now we have to try to protect the areas where they will come back.\"</p><p>He added he was driving past the area several days ago and was shocked by the amount of cars turning onto West Main.</p><p>\"It was so shocking, but also made me quite angry to see as well because this territory that we live in is so beautiful, but the amount of people that are there is a recipe for a forest fire and it's a recipe for more pollution on our lands and this is something that I could not just stand by and let happen,\" he said.</p><p>\"We have to try to stop this. We have to make a change, but we can't do it alone, we have to do it together as all our communities. This influx of tourists is, from my point of view, a direct cause of Parks Canada and the tourism of Tofino and Ucluelet trying to invite more and more people to come, but we don't have enough infrastructure to support it. In the past 10 years, we've been making Tofino and Ucluelet a place to be, we've been making it a destination and this is something we really should have been trying to plan out and we should have anticipated the amount of people that would be coming.\"</p><p>Along with being hit hard by tourism, the backroads have also become a point of contention because the housing crisis in both Tofino and Ucluelet has forced seasonal workers to camp in the area while working in town.</p><p>\"I personally have a lot of trouble with people squatting on the backlands. I do understand this really is a housing problem that we can't just solve at the snap of our fingers. This is something that our local communities have to sit down and work together\u2026We have to try to figure this out,\" he said. \"I find it so tough when people are squatting on Tla-o-qui-aht lands because these lands I hold so close to my heart\u2026.My goal is to shut that off until we can properly find a solution to the problem.\"</p><p>He added his main focus on Tuesday will be to prevent tourists from accessing the area.</p><p>\"I just want to try to stop that for now and then we can try to figure out the problem of those people that are living out there and we can hopefully find that solution,\" he said. \"We draw these lines between Ucluelet and Tofino and different residents, but this a problem that we're all facing and we have to come up with that solution not as a Ucluelet resident or a Tofino resident or a Tla-o-qui-aht member, we have to do it together.

(NOCSDC) is partnering with Keepers of the Circle on establishing the hub. </p><p>It will be operated out of the former public school in Charlton, a small community on Highway 11 near Englehart. The centre's concept was inspired by successful sustainability hubs in Europe, specifically Denmark. </p><p>The centre\u2019s teaching and modelling programs will focus on five pillars: reversing youth out-migration, renewable energy, food security, reclaiming traditional ecological knowledge and transitioning to a new green economy. </p><p>The school, powered by solar net metering energy, will have computer offices, a community kitchen and a gym, which will be used for community space. </p><p>CHS will also provide short-term accommodations for 30 people. According to Ambrose Raftis, NOCSDC chairman, people who stay at the hub will be immersed in a low-carbon environment. </p><p>\"Part of the reason for the centre is to bring young people, school-aged children and youth in and show them like, \u2018Here\u2019s an alternative way of living, you can live with renewable energy and local food with high quality of life. And you can do it in your community,\u2019\u201d Raftis said. </p><p>Once renovations are done, the hub is expected to officially open to the public in the fall of 2021 or early 2022. </p><p>According to the hub's website, the centre will offer guided tours, tailored courses, online and hands-on programs. </p><p>\u201cWe supply training information and support at a cost-recovery rate, so people who don\u2019t have a lot of money can afford to learn more and be a part of the economy and the change,\u201d Raftis said. \u201cBecause the reason they want a change is the economy is not working for them including Indigenous communities.\u201d </p><p>The Keepers of the Circle will also be located on-site delivering traditional land-based skills, teaching how to grow and preserve food, how to start green businesses and live off the grid, said Rachel Lachance, the hub\u2019s Indigenous liaison. </p><p>In February, the first initiative was launched through the hub. It was a federally-funded program called Pathways to Resilience: Intro to Emerging and Established Careers for Indigenous Women. </p><p>Lachance said the feedback and the data the organizers received from the seven-week program were \u201cphenomenal.\u201d She said more than 175 Indigenous women from northeastern Ontario applied for the program but only 100 people could be accepted.  </p><p>\"It's an actual reconciliation project where you're dealing with co-operative and dealing with an Indigenous organization, so it's a really great partnership in that way because we really focus on Calls to Action and MMIWG's Calls to (Justice),\" she said. </p><p>During the first week, there was a virtual job fair where participants were introduced to career opportunities in sectors like construction, entrepreneurship, security and policing, green living, and environmental impact assessment. </p><p>The following six weeks focused on curriculum-based pre-employment training in each of the five sectors. There were expert speakers from each of the sectors who talked more about how to get into those careers as well as assignments and competency training. </p><p>To help participants during the course, they were offered laptops and printers, help with the internet, childcare services and weekly honorariums, according to Lachance. </p><p>Currently, the Pathways program is in Phase 3 as the Keepers of the Circle are working on personal and professional development plans with each participant. </p><p>\"For the whole rest of the year, we're going to be supporting each of these women to reach those goals,\" Lachance said. </p><p>With the internet on-site and as a non-profit with charitable status, the centre can connect and bring people together, Raftis said. </p><p>\u201cWe may bring six or eight people down from one community and connect the rest of the community via the internet and have community training sessions,\u201d Raftis said. </p><p>The site can also be used to house community members in the event of a forest fire, drought or power failure. </p><p>\u201cWe have a backup system, we can bring people in there and feed them and stuff like that, from local communities,\u201d Raftis said. </p><p>The collective applied for community outreach funding and is waiting to hear back from FedNor and the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corp., Raftis said. The funding will help gather input from local municipalities and Indigenous communities on the development of the project.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-064f5b0635a34773b4d713602e57f305</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62P4-K171-DY9S-T1Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><timeReceived>02:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 15, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Officials and experts have linked such intense weather events to climate change. <br/> A UN draft report seen by AFP labelled the Mediterranean region a 'climate change hotspot', warning that heatwaves, droughts and fires would become more fierce in the future, supercharged by rising temperatures. <br/> The fires have killed two people in Greece, including Konstantinos Michalos, the president of the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry. <br/> He was found unconscious in a factory in Krioneri near Athens and was later confirmed dead in hospital. <br/> In Turkey, eight people have been killed and dozens more hospitalised during 10 days of fires. <br/><br/>- Rain in Turkey - <br/><br/>But officials in the Turkish coastal city of Antalya said the blazes were under control in the southwestern province, where it was raining on Saturday. <br/> Heavy rainfall was expected to continue until the afternoon in areas including Manavgat, one of the most affected by the fires. <br/> However, the situation appears to be serious still around the tourist hotspot of Mugla, where firefighting efforts continue and at least three neighbourhoods have been ordered to evacuate. <br/> There have been over 200 fires in 47 of Turkey's 81 provinces, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Bekir Pakdemirli tweeted early on Saturday. Thirteen fires continue in five provinces. <br/> The Greek fire service said Saturday blazes were raging in the Attica peninsula that includes Athens, in Evia, the country's second largest island and located east of the capital, and the Peloponnese region in the southwest. <br/> North of Athens, a fierce blaze tore through vast areas of pine forest, forcing yet more evacuations of villages overnight and blowing thick, choking smoke and ash all over the Greek capital. <br/> Part of a motorway linking Athens to the north of the country has been shut down as a precaution and migrant camps were evacuated. <br/><br/>- Arson suspects held - <br/><br/>In the Evia village of Limni, more than 1,300 people fled the fires on ferry boats. Another 23 were evacuated Saturday morning from the beach at Rovies. <br/> Local authorities on the island called for more air support in the firefighting efforts. <br/> Around 5,000 tourists and residents were also forced to flee another fire in the Peloponnese region. <br/> Eleni Drakoulakou, the mayor of East Mani, told ERT TV on Saturday that 50 percent of the Peloponnese town has been burnt, blaming a lack of water-dropping air support during the critical first hours of the wildfire. <br/> Meanwhile, the ANA news agency said two people were being held on suspicion of arson. <br/> In Athens, police arrested a woman in a park on Friday as she was carrying two lighters, petrol and flammable materials,a few minutes after a fire broke out there. <br/> Authorities have banned visits to parks and forests through Greece, according to ANA. <br/> A 43-year-old man was arrested in the area of Krioneri and charged with arson, according to ANA. <br/><url

nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Aug 06, 2021( Digital Journal: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com\">http://www.digitaljournal.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> Hundreds of firefighters battled a blaze on the outskirts of Athens on Friday as dozens of fires raged in Greece in what the prime minister dubbed a 'critical situation,' while neighbouring Turkey came under increasing pressure over its handling of wildfires. </p><p><br/>Greece and Turkey have been fighting blaze upon blaze over the past week, hit by the worst heatwave in decades, a disaster that officials and experts have linked to increasingly frequent and intense weather events caused by climate change. <br/>French firefighters arrived in Greece on Thursday night to help, while Switzerland, Sweden, Romania and Israel are due to send back-up. <br/> 'Our country is facing an extremely critical situation,' Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said late Thursday, putting six out of 13 regions in the country under high alert. <br/> 'We're facing unprecedented conditions after several days of heatwave have turned the country into a powder keg.' <br/> Some 30 kilometres (19 miles) north of Athens, a fierce blaze ate through vast areas of pine forest, forcing yet more evacuations of villages overnight and blowing thick, choking smoke all over the Greek capital. <br/> In the small town of Afidnes, firefighters were seen standing on their truck in the dead of night, dousing flames that leapt high above them. <br/> Part of a motorway linking Athens to the north of the country has been shut down as a precaution. <br/><br/>- Foreign help - <br/><br/>Deputy Civil Protection Minister Nikos Hardalias said that out of 99 fires reported on Thursday, 57 were still active during the night, notably on the island of Evia where monks who refused to leave their monastery had been forcibly evacuated. <br/> Around 82 French firefighters \u2014 both military and civilian \u2014 arrived on Thursday evening, a French official said. <br/>France was also due to send two water-bombing planes, as was Sweden, while Romania was to dispatch 112 firefighters and 23 vehicles and Switzerland three helicopters, a spokesman for the Greek firefighters told AFP. <br/>Israel, too, said it is planning to dispatch an aircraft carrying 15 firefighters and a large cargo of flame retardant. <br/> Given the extreme danger, the Greek authorities have issued a blanket ban on any visits to forests, national parks or nature spots until Monday. <br/> 'If some people still doubt if climate change is real, let them come and see the intensity of phenomena here,' Mitsotakis said Thursday while inspecting the ruins where the first Olympic Games were held in ancient times, also threatened by flames. <br/> The blazes also forced the government of North Macedonia to declare a 30-day state of emergency and the defence ministry in its Balkan neighbour Albania to declare the situation 'critical' because of the threat to village homes. <br/><br/>- Erdogan under fire - <br/><br/>In Turkey, 208 fires have lit up since July 28, and 12 were still ablaze on Friday, according to the Turkish presidency. <br/> Eight people have died and dozens have been hospitalised across the southern coasts of the country. <br/> In one particularly critical event earlier this week, winds whipped up a flash fire that subsumed the grounds of an Aegean coast power plant in Turkey storing thousands of tonnes of coal. <br/>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office said an initial inspection conducted after the flames had been doused showed 'no serious damage to the main units in the plant'. <br/> The government is facing rising pressure after the opposition referred to a report which showed only a fraction of the budget for forest fire prevention had been spent. <br/> The General Directorate of Forestry (OGM) spent only 1.75 percent ofnearly 200 million Turkish lira ($23 million) allocated for forest fires in the first six months of 2021, main opposition party MP Murat Emir said, referring to numbers apparently from the state agency's own report, which he submitted in a parliamentary question. <br/> 'This is a situation that could one could go as far as to describe as treachery,' he told AFP. <br/> Erdogan has come under especially withering criticism for being slow or unwilling to accept some offers of foreign assistance after revealing that Turkey had no functioning firefighting planes. <br/> The government has defended itself by blaming the Turkish Aeronautical Association, which Erdogan said at the weekend had not been able to update its fleet and technology. <br/> The crisis has posed an unexpected challenge to the powerful Turkish leader two years before he faces an election that could extend his rule into a third decade. <br/> burs/mbx/spm <br/><url

Modern day humans have become hooked on constant stimulation by endless distractions, whether from screens, games or travelling to new places. Now, with the travel option gone, people are flocking to the local trails where they can experience the beneficial power of nature.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are many books and studies written about the benefits of walking in forests, including the 1984 classic, The Biophilia Hypothesis by Edward O. Wilson, that describes how humans possess an innate need to seek connections to nature.</p><p>The Japanese practice called shinrin youku, or forest bathing, is a proven therapy that reduces stress, increases happiness, frees up creativity, boosts recovery from illnesses and lowers heart rate and blood pressure.</p><p>A recent discovery for me was learning about the medicinal values of breathing in the forest aroma that is filled with pinene aerosols. These chemicals flow from our lungs into our circulatory system where they boost our immune systems. Indigenous peoples were well aware of the antibiotic and antiviral properties of trees and utilized the compo-nents in their medicines.</p><p>Then, of course, there are the psychological values of experiencing nature, as there is nothing like a meditative meander through the woods to clear your mind of anxiety, inspire your creativity and feel more at one with the world around you.</p><p>While it is always fun to explore new places, there are many benefits to experiencing the same natural surroundings daily. If one lives within walking distance of a forest path, there is much joy in repeating one\u2019s visits. Our need for stimulation from something new everyday can also be achieved by witnessing the changes that are constantly occurring, including the weather, the trail conditions, the wildlife and the seasonal variations, at different times of the day.</p><p>As well, there is always something new to discover or become aware of during each visit by using all of our senses.</p><p>For the last few years, my wife Kathi and I have made it a goal to hike every day that we are not somewhere else on the trail behind our property up to the Lee Creek bluffs where there are extraordinary views of Shuswap Lake, from Copper Island to beyond Chase.</p><p>Some days we have to slog through deep snow using snowshoes, or tread carefully on the ice using boot crampons. The hike can vary from one hour to three, depending on the conditions and how long we sit on a bench at the top to contemplate, chat and admire the view.</p><p>The focus changes daily, from inner thoughts to admiring the trees to observing the new growth in the spring.</p><p>There are the very special trees that command our attention, including some massive old growth Douglas fir vets with their blackened thick bark from a longago forest fire, the giant leaners that defy gravity, the large, two-foot diameter fir that splits into two trunks just a few feet off the ground, the wizened, twisted and bent scrub tree and the wildlife-rich snags that are slowly decaying.</p><p>It is a steep, challenging climb up the hillside, but well worth it as these hikes are such a great way to exercise.</p><p>Last year, I was able to do the hike 142 times and this year it could be even more this winter, given that warm temperatures deter us from skiing. One day, the Lee Creek Bluffs will hopefully become well-used by the public as part of the CSRD trail network, as it has been in the parks plan for more than a decade and the Trail Alliance has prepared the initial design.</p><p>We are privileged to live in the Shuswap where there is so much accessible public land to explore and so many diverse trails to enjoy.</p><p>Despite the pandemic, the good times are always here to experience during any stroll into the forest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SHMANE-news20210122HBUA0001559907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SHMANE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61VW-TS61-F0HF-81CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

'I don't want to leave, my whole life is here.' <br/> Part of a motorway linking Athens to the north of the country has been shut down as a precaution. <br/><br/>- Foreign help - <br/><br/>Deputy Civil Protection Minister Nikos Hardalias said that out of 99 fires reported on Thursday, 56 were still active. <br/> At least 450 Greek firefighters were fighting the blaze. <br/> Around 82 French firefighters \u2014 both military and civilian \u2014 arrived on Thursday evening, a French official said. <br/>France was also due to send two water-bombing planes, as was Sweden, while Romania was to dispatch 112 firefighters and 23 vehicles and Switzerland three helicopters, a spokesman for the Greek firefighters told AFP. <br/>Israel, too, is planning to send back-up. <br/> In neighbouring Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has come under withering criticism for being slow or unwilling to accept some offers of foreign assistance after revealing that Turkey had no functioning firefighting planes. <br/> According to the presidency, 208 fires have flared up since July 28, and 12 were still ablaze on Friday. <br/> More evacuations took place on Friday in five Turkish provinces, including tourist hotspots Antalya and Mugla, according to NTV. <br/><br/>- 'Treachery' - <br/><br/>The Turkish government is also facing pressure after the opposition referred to a report which showed only a fraction of the budget for forest fire prevention had been spent. <br/> The General Directorate of Forestry (OGM) spent only 1.75 percent ofnearly 200 million Turkish lira ($23 million) allocated for forest fires in the first six months of 2021, main opposition party MP Murat Emir said, referring to numbers apparently from the state agency's own report, which he submitted in a parliamentary question. <br/> 'This is a situation that one could go as far as to describe as treachery,' he told AFP. <br/> Events like these will become even worse, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a draft report due out next year seen by AFP. <br/> The draft predicts that temperatures across the Mediterranean are likely to rise faster than the global average in the decades to come. <br/> 'Every heatwave occurring today is made more likely and more intense by human-caused climate change,' Friederike Otto, associate director at the University of Oxford's Environmental Change Institute, told AFP. <br/> Extreme heat is the most pressing threat facing the Mediterranean region as heatwaves 'are by far the deadliest extreme events in Europe,' he said. <br/> 'Climate change is forcing Mediterranean landscapes into a flammable state more regularly by drying out vegetation and priming it to burn,' said Matthew Jones, research fellow at the University of East Anglia's Tyndall Centre for ClimateChange Research. <br/> burs/mbx/dl <br/><url

(\"Vermilion\", \"We\", \"Our\", \"Us\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: VET) (NYSE: VET) is pleased to report operating and condensed financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, a 33% dividend increase and our Return of Capital Framework.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The unaudited interim financial statements and management discussion and analysis for the three and six months endedJune30, 2022 will be available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (\"SEDAR\") at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>, on EDGAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml\">www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml</url>, and on Vermilion's website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.vermilionenergy.com\">www.vermilionenergy.com</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights</p><p> Q2 2022 fund flows from operations (\"FFO\")(1) was $453 million ($2.75/basic share)(2) and free cash flow (\"FCF\")(3) was $340 million ($2.07/basic share)(4), an increase of 16% and 12%, respectively from the prior quarter. The increases were primarily due to higher commodity prices. Cash flow from operating activities was $530 million in Q2 2022, including the impact from asset retirement obligations settled and changes in non-cash operating working capital.Pro forma Q2 2022 FFO and FCF incorporating the incremental 36.5% ownership in Corrib was $536 million ($3.26/basic share) and $422 million ($2.56/basic share), respectively. As a reminder, all FCF from the Corrib acquisition accrues to Vermilion as at January 1, 2022 and will be netted off the approximate $600 million purchase price at the time of closing which we expect to occur in Q4 2022.With clear line of sight to achieving our next mid-cycle(5) debt target, we are pleased to outline our formal return of capital framework. We intend to return an increasing amount of capital to shareholders as debt levels decrease using a debt grid to guide near-term Return of Capital allocation decisions.In conjunction with our Q2 2022 release, we announced a 33% increase to our Q3 2022 quarterly cash dividend to $0.08 CDN per share which equates to an annual dividend of $0.32 CDN per share, or approximately $53 million. Dividends will remain a key component of our return of capital framework as we seek to provide shareholders with a resilient and increasing base dividend; however, we will limit the annual cash dividend to approximately 10% of our mid-cycle FFO.Based on our Return of Capital Allocation Grid, recent commodity strip(6) and internal estimates, we anticipate returning up to 25% of FCF in 2H 2022 and up to 50% - 75% of FCF in 2023. We will consider various options to return capital; including share buybacks, regular and special dividends and a potential substantial issuer bid. Based on our review of a number of valuation data points, we expect the majority of the incremental capital return to be in the form of share buybacks initially.In early July 2022, we announced the approval of a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") for the purchase of up to 16,076,666 common shares, representing approximately 10% of Vermilion's public float as at June 22, 2022. To date, we have repurchased 1.25 million common shares for $35 million.Net earnings were $363 million in Q2 2022, an increase of 28% from the prior quarter due to higher commodity prices and net hedging gains.Cash flow used in investing activities totaled $613 million in the second quarter including exploration and development (\"E&amp;D\") capital expenditures(7) of $113 million and acquisition capital of $522 million.The Leucrotta acquisition closed on May 31, 2022 and the assets have been successfully integrated into Vermilion. We are now focused on completing the 6-well Montney pad that was drilled in Q2 2022. The Mica asset significantly increases the depth and quality of our North American inventory and is expected to add multiple decades of development that will enhance FCF to the business.Long-term debt in Q2 2022 was $1.5 billion and net debt(8) was $1.6 billion, resulting in our net debt to trailing FFO ratio decreasing to 1.1 times(9) compared to 1.2 times in the prior quarter.Production in Q2 2022 averaged 84,868 boe/d(10) a decrease of 2% from the previous quarter, primarily due to planned and unplanned downtime.Production from our North American operations averaged 58,027 boe/d(10) in Q2 2022, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter primarily due to the Leucrotta acquisition, which closed on May 31, 2022.Production from our International operations averaged 26,840 boe/d(10) in Q2 2022, a decrease of 9% from the prior quarter primarily due to natural decline, offshore drilling delays and unplanned downtime in Australia.As a result of forest fire related downtime in France, offshore drilling delays in Australia, combined with inflationary pressure, we are increasing our 2022 capital budget by $50 million to $550 million. Annual production guidance, excluding the Corrib acquisition volumes, remains unchanged at 86,000 to 88,000 boe/d. Our exit rate forecast of 95,000 to 100,000 boe/d, including the Corrib acquisitions volumes, also remains unchanged.We released the annual update to our online sustainability report in July 2022. Notable highlights include the decrease in our Scope 1 emission intensity to .018 tCO2e per throughput operated boe, in line with our target to reduce our 2019 baseline of .019 tCO2e per throughput operated boe by 15% to 20% by 2025, and coverage of our Corrib Biodiversity Action Plan achievements.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"592\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">(1)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Fund flows from operations (FFO) is a total of segment measures comparable to cash flows from operating activities that is comprised of sales less royalties, transportation, operating, G&amp;A, corporate income tax, PRRT, interest expense, and realized loss (gain) on derivatives, plus realized gain (loss) on foreign exchange and realized other income.

FFO was $453 million (cash flows from operating activities of $530 million), representing a 16% increase over the prior quarter. Exploration and development (\"E&amp;D\") capital expenditures were $113 million in Q2 2022, resulting in quarterly FCF of $340 million. Free cash flow in Q2 2022 was used to partially fund the Leucrotta acquisition which closed on May 31, 2022. The remainder of the Leucrotta purchase price was funded with debt which resulted in a slight increase in Q2 2022 net debt to $1.6 billion; however, with the increase in FFO our net debt to trailing FFO ratio decreased to 1.1x.</p><p>We have successfully integrated the Leucrotta assets and assembled a Mica asset team which is now focused on completing the 6-well Montney pad that was drilled in Q2 2022. We are excited to have these assets in our portfolio and look forward to scaling up development in the years ahead. The Mica asset significantly increases the depth and quality of our North American inventory and is expected to add multiple decades of development and enhance FCF to the business.</p><p>Closing of the Corrib acquisition continues to progress as we move closer to obtaining all remaining partner and government approvals. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter with an estimated closing cash payment in the range of $100 to $150 million after adjusting for the FCF accrued throughout the year. Pro forma Q2 2022 FFO and FCF incorporating the incremental 36.5% ownership in Corrib was $536 million and $422 million, respectively.</p><p>We remain on track to achieve our next debt target of $1.2 billion by the end of 2022, and with this clear line of sight we are pleased to outline our formal return of capital framework which will see an increasing proportion of FCF returned to shareholders as debt levels decrease. Over the past two years we have been focused on balancing debt reduction and portfolio enhancement, all with the goal of maximizing value and the return of capital to our shareholders over the long term. Vermilion is in a very strong position from both an asset base and financial perspective. We announced two strategic acquisitions over the past year, funded with free cash flow, and will have reduced debt by approximately $1 billion, relative to Q2 2020 debt levels, by the end of this year(1). While we will continue to keep a close eye on debt and reduce it even further to ensure we maintain a strong balance sheet through all commodity cycles, we are now in a position to increase our return of capital to shareholders. We are confident that our globally diversified asset base combined with our disciplined approach to capital allocation will generate value for our shareholders over the long-term. Further details on our return of capital framework is outlined below.</p><p>Return of Capital</p><p>Vermilion declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 CDN per share in Q2 2022 which was paid on July 15, 2022. With two strong quarters now behind us and a clear line of sight to achieving our next mid-cycle(2) debt target of $1.2 billion, we are now in a position to return a greater proportion of free cash flow to our shareholders. Vermilion has a long history of returning capital to its shareholders primarily through dividends. Dividends will remain a key component of our return of capital framework as we seek to provide shareholders with a resilient and increasing base dividend; however, we will limit the annual cash dividend outlay to approximately 10% of our mid-cycle FFO. In conjunction with our Q2 2022 release, we announced a 33% increase to our Q3 2022 quarterly cash dividend to $0.08 CDN per share which equates to an annual dividend of $0.32 CDN per share or approximately $53 million based on the current number of shares outstanding. At this dividend per share level, we have significant capacity to increase the base dividend and plan to provide ratable increases over time.</p><p>In addition to strengthening our balance sheet, Vermilion has made other structural improvements to its business by increasing our International production weighting through European natural gas exposure while also enhancing our North American inventory with a high quality long-life Montney asset. These structural improvements, combined with the strong fundamental outlook for global commodities will further underpin our ability to return capital to shareholders. The amount of FCF available for return of capital will increase as debt levels decrease based on the illustrative grid outlined below. This grid is not intended to be prescriptive quarter-to-quarter but will be used as a tool to guide near-term Return of Capital allocation decisions while taking into account other capital requirements such as further debt reduction, asset retirement obligations and acquisitions.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"224\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Return of Capital Allocation Grid</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mid-Cycle D/FFO</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Ratio</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.5x</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.0x - 1.5x</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.5x - 1.0x</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net Debt</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$MM</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1,500</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1,000 - 1,500</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">500 - 1,000</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">FCF Distribution</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">up to 25%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">up to 50%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">up to 75%</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">up to 90%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Based on our Return of Capital Allocation Grid, recent commodity strip(3) and internal estimates, we anticipate returning up to 25% of FCF in 2H 2022 and up to 50% - 75% of FCF in 2023 while reducing debt to a target of $850 million by the end of 2023, which implies an undrawn $1.6 billion credit facility. We will consider various options to return capital; including share buybacks, regular and special dividends and a potential substantial issuer bid. Based on a number of datapoints reviewed, we expect the majority of the incremental capital return to be in the form of share buybacks initially. In early July 2022, we announced the approval of a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") for the purchase of up to 16,076,666 common shares, representing approximately 10% of Vermilion's public float as at June 22, 2022. To date, we have repurchased 1.25 million common shares for $35 million. We look forward to providing continued updates on our return of capital initiatives through the second half of this year and throughout 2023 as we carefully weigh capital allocation decisions against various uses of excess free cash flow with a view of acting in the long-term interests of shareholders.</p><p>Q2 2022 Operations Review</p><p>North America</p><p>Production from our North American operations averaged 58,027 boe/d(4) in Q2 2022, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter primarily due to the Leucrotta acquisition which closed on May 31, 2022. Drilling and completion activity in west-central Alberta and south-east Saskatchewan was limited during the second quarter due to spring breakup. During the second quarter, we completed one (1.0 net) well and brought on production one (0.6 net) condensate-rich Mannville natural gas well in west-central Alberta, and we drilled one (1.0 net) well and completed two (2.0 net) wells in south-east Saskatchewan. Following the announcement of the Leucrotta acquisition in late March 2022, we assembled our Mica asset team and focused on integrating the assets and working closely with the Leucrotta team in drilling the first six (6.0 net) well Montney pad. Drilling was successfully completed during the second quarter and the team is now focused on completion activities. While we remain optimistic that an agreement on natural resource activity reviews will be reached between the BC Government and the Blueberry River First Nations in due course, our team has a plan to continue drilling on the Alberta side of the Mica property in 2023 should we see further delays in permit approvals.</p><p>In the United States, we drilled four (3.8 net) wells of our planned six (5.8net) operated Turner wells and completed two (2.0 net) wells during the second quarter. Three (2.8 net) wells are two-mile lateral wells which are significantly more economic than one-mile laterals. One (1.0 net) well was brought on production during the second quarter while the remaining wells will be completed and brought on production during the third quarter. In addition, one (0.4 net) two-mile non-operated Turner well is planned for drilling in Q4 2022.</p><p>International</p><p>Production from our International operations averaged 26,840 boe/d(4) in Q2 2022, a decrease of 9% from the prior quarter primarily due to natural decline and offshore drilling delays in Australia. In Australia, the drilling of our two-well program was delayed by approximately one month due to unexpected maintenance and repairs on the third-party contracted rig. Drilling commenced late in the second quarter and is expected to finish in early September with production to start shortly thereafter. In Europe, much of our activity during the second quarter was focused on preparing for our 2H 2022 drilling campaign which will include two (1.1 net) wells in Netherlands, three (3.0 net) wells in Hungary and two (2.0 net wells) in Croatia.</p><p>Outlook and Guidance Update</p><p>Our Q3 2022 capital program is well underway as we finish up the drilling program in Australia, complete and tie in the remaining Turner wells in the US, execute our south-east Saskatchewan drilling program and complete the 6-well Montney pad at Mica. In Europe, we are making final preparations for an active drilling campaign to commence in the third quarter and continue through the fourth quarter. Early in the third quarter, a forest fire near our Cazaux field in southern France resulted in approximately 1,500 bbl/d of production being temporarily shut-in which will impact Q3 production in France.</p><p>Our Q3 2022 production will include a full quarter contribution from the Leucrotta acquisition and new production from the US and south-east Saskatchewan drilling programs; however, these volumes will be partially offset by the Australia drilling delay and fire related downtime in France. Taking all this into account, we expect Q3 2022 production to be in-line with Q2 2022.</p><p>As a result of forest fire related downtime in France, offshore drilling delays in Australia, combined with inflationary pressure, we are increasing our 2022 capital budget by $50 million to $550 million. We are maintaining our annual production guidance of 86,000 to 88,000 boe/d, excluding the Corrib acquisition volumes. We plan to update our production guidance once we have greater certainty on timing of the Corrib close. Our exit rate forecast of 95,000 to 100,000 boe/d, including Corrib acquisition volumes, remains unchanged.</p><p>Commodity Hedging</p><p>Vermilion hedges to manage commodity price exposures and increase the stability of our cash flows. In aggregate, as of August 9, 2022, we have 36% of our expected net-of-royalty production hedged for the remainder of 2022. With respect to individual commodity products, we have hedged 64% of our European natural gas production, 20% of our oil production, and 41% of our North American natural gas volumes for the remainder of 2022, respectively.

Such forward-looking statements or information typically contain statements with words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"expect\", \"plan\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"propose\", or similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. Forward looking statements or information in this document may include, but are not limited to: capital expenditures and Vermilion's ability to fund such expenditures; Vermilion's additional debt capacity providing it with additional working capital; the flexibility of Vermilion's capital program and operations; business strategies and objectives; operational and financial performance; sustainability (Environment, Social, and Governance or ESG) data and performance; estimated volumes of reserves and resources; petroleum and natural gas sales; future production levels and the timing thereof, including Vermilion's 2022 guidance, and rates of average annual production growth; the effect of changes in crude oil and natural gas prices, changes in exchange rates and significant declines in production or sales volumes due to unforeseen circumstances; the effect of possible changes in critical accounting estimates; statements regarding the growth and size of Vermilion's future project inventory, and the wells expected to be drilled in 2022; exploration and development plans and the timing thereof; Vermilion's ability to reduce its debt; statements regarding Vermilion's hedging program, its plans to add to its hedging positions, and the anticipated impact of Vermilion's hedging program on project economics and free cash flows; the potential financial impact of climate-related risks; acquisition and disposition plans and the timing thereof; operating and other expenses, including the payment and amount of future dividends; royalty and income tax rates and Vermilion's expectations regarding future taxes and taxability; and the timing of regulatory proceedings and approvals.</p><p>Such forward looking statements or information are based on a number of assumptions, all or any of which may prove to be incorrect. In addition to any other assumptions identified in this document, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things: the ability of Vermilion to obtain equipment, services and supplies in a timely manner to carry out its activities in Canada and internationally; the ability of Vermilion to market crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas successfully to current and new customers; the timing and costs of pipeline and storage facility construction and expansion and the ability to secure adequate product transportation; the timely receipt of required regulatory approvals; the ability of Vermilion to obtain financing on acceptable terms; foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; future crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices; and management's expectations relating to the timing and results of exploration and development activities.</p><p>Although Vermilion believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements or information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because Vermilion can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Financial outlooks are provided for the purpose of understanding Vermilion's financial position and business objectives, and the information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward looking statements or information are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by Vermilion and described in the forward looking statements or information. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the ability of management to execute its business plan; the risks of the oil and gas industry, both domestically and internationally, such as operational risks in exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas; risks and uncertainties involving geology of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas deposits; risks inherent in Vermilion's marketing operations, including credit risk; the uncertainty of reserves estimates and reserves life and estimates of resources and associated expenditures; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production and associated expenditures; potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects; Vermilion's ability to enter into or renew leases on acceptable terms; fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; health, safety, and environmental risks; uncertainties as to the availability and cost of financing; the ability of Vermilion to add production and reserves through exploration and development activities; the possibility that government policies or laws may change or governmental approvals may be delayed or withheld; uncertainty and current evolutions with relation to sustainability/ESG reporting methodologies; uncertainty in amounts and timing of royalty payments; risks associated with existing and potential future law suits and regulatory actions against Vermilion; and other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this document or in Vermilion's other filings with Canadian securities regulatory authorities.</p><p>The forward looking statements or information contained in this document are made as of the date hereof and Vermilion undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by applicable securities laws.</p><p>This document contains metrics commonly used in the oil and gas industry. These oil and gas metrics do not have any standardized meaning or standard methods of calculation and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used and should therefore not be used to make comparisons. Natural gas volumes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent. Barrels of oil equivalent (boe) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.</p><p>This document may contain references to sustainability/ESG data and performance that reflect metrics and concepts that are commonly used in such frameworks as the Global Reporting Initiative, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, and the Value Reporting Foundation (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board). Vermilion has used best efforts to align with the most commonly accepted methodologies for ESG reporting, including with respect to climate data and information on potential future risks and opportunities, in order to provide a fuller context for our current and future operations. However, these methodologies are not yet standardized, are frequently based on calculation factors that change over time, and continue to evolve rapidly. Readers are particularly cautioned to evaluate the underlying definitions and measures used by other companies, as these may not be comparable to Vermilion's. While Vermilion will continue to monitor and adapt its reporting accordingly, the Company is not under any duty to update or revise the related sustainability/ESG data or statements except as required by applicable securities laws.</p><p>Financial data contained within this document are reported in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.</p><p> View original content to download multimedia:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vermilion-energy-inc-announces-results-for-the-three-and-six-months-ended-june-30-2022-33-dividend-increase-and-return-of-capital-framework-301604639.html\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vermilion-energy-inc-announces-results-for-the-three-and-six-months-ended-june-30-2022-33-dividend-increase-and-return-of-capital-framework-301604639.html</url></p><p>SOURCE  Vermilion Energy Inc.</p><p> View original content to download multimedia: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/August2022/11/c2167.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/August2022/11/c2167.html</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNW-20220811C2167</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNW2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664J-KMM1-JC8H-P525-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7624\"/><timeReceived>4:11 PM Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 CNW Group</copyright><publicationName>Canada NewsWire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 11, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The increases were primarily due to higher commodity prices. Cash flow from operating activities was $530 million in Q2 2022, including the impact from asset retirement obligations settled and changes in non-cash operating working capital. * Pro forma Q2 2022 FFO and FCF incorporating the incremental 36.5% ownership in Corrib was $536 million ( $3.26 /basic share) and $422 million ( $2.56 /basic share), respectively. As a reminder, all FCF from the Corrib acquisition accrues to Vermilion as at January 1, 2022 and will be netted off the approximate $600 million purchase price at the time of closing which we expect to occur in Q4 2022. * With clear line of sight to achieving our next mid-cycle(5) debt target, we are pleased to outline our formal return of capital framework. We intend to return an increasing amount of capital to shareholders as debt levels decrease using a debt grid to guide near-term Return of Capital allocation decisions. * In conjunction with our Q2 2022 release, we announced a 33% increase to our Q3 2022 quarterly cash dividend to $0.08 CDN per share which equates to an annual dividend of $0.32 CDN per share, or approximately $53 million . Dividends will remain a key component of our return of capital framework as we seek to provide shareholders with a resilient and increasing base dividend; however, we will limit the annual cash dividend to approximately 10% of our mid-cycle FFO. * Based on our Return of Capital Allocation Grid, recent commodity strip(6) and internal estimates, we anticipate returning up to 25% of FCF in 2H 2022 and up to 50% - 75% of FCF in 2023. We will consider various options to return capital; including share buybacks, regular and special dividends and a potential substantial issuer bid. Based on our review of a number of valuation data points, we expect the majority of the incremental capital return to be in the form of share buybacks initially. * In early July 2022 , we announced the approval of a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") for the purchase of up to 16,076,666 common shares, representing approximately 10% of Vermilion's public float as at June 22, 2022 . To date, we have repurchased 1.25 million common shares for $35 million . * Net earnings were $363 million in Q2 2022, an increase of 28% from the prior quarter due to higher commodity prices and net hedging gains. * Cash flow used in investing activities totaled $613 million in the second quarter including exploration and development (\"E&amp;D\") capital expenditures(7) of $113 million and acquisition capital of $522 million . * The Leucrotta acquisition closed on May 31, 2022 and the assets have been successfully integrated into Vermilion. We are now focused on completing the 6-well Montney pad that was drilled in Q2 2022. The Mica asset significantly increases the depth and quality of our North American inventory and is expected to add multiple decades of development that will enhance FCF to the business. * Long-term debt in Q2 2022 was $1.5 billion and net debt(8) was $1.6 billion , resulting in our net debt to trailing FFO ratio decreasing to 1.1 times(9) compared to 1.2 times in the prior quarter. * Production in Q2 2022 averaged 84,868 boe/d(10) a decrease of 2% from the previous quarter, primarily due to planned and unplanned downtime. * Production from our North American operations averaged 58,027 boe/d(10) in Q2 2022, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter primarily due to the Leucrotta acquisition, which closed on May 31, 2022 . * Production from our International operations averaged 26,840 boe/d(10) in Q2 2022, a decrease of 9% from the prior quarter primarily due to natural decline, offshore drilling delays and unplanned downtime in Australia . * As a result of forest fire related downtime in France , offshore drilling delays in Australia , combined with inflationary pressure, we are increasing our 2022 capital budget by $50 million to $550 million . Annual production guidance, excluding the Corrib acquisition volumes, remains unchanged at 86,000 to 88,000 boe/d. Our exit rate forecast of 95,000 to 100,000 boe/d, including the Corrib acquisitions volumes, also remains unchanged. * We released the annual update to our online sustainability report in July 2022 . Notable highlights include the decrease in our Scope 1 emission intensity to .018 tCO2e per throughput operated boe, in line with our target to reduce our 2019 baseline of .019 tCO2e per throughput operated boe by 15% to 20% by 2025, and coverage of our Corrib Biodiversity Action Plan achievements.

(8) Please refer to Supplemental Table 4 \"Production\" of the accompanying Management's Discussion and Analysis for disclosure by product type.</p><p>Message to Shareholders</p><p>Global commodity prices continued to strengthen through the second quarter, driving another quarter of record fund flows from operations (\"FFO\") and free cash flow (\"FCF\") for Vermilion. FFO was $453 million (cash flows from operating activities of $530 million), representing a 16% increase over the prior quarter. Exploration and development (\"E&amp;D\") capital expenditures were $113 million in Q2 2022, resulting in quarterly FCF of $340 million. Free cash flow in Q2 2022 was used to partially fund the Leucrotta acquisition which closed on May 31, 2022. The remainder of the Leucrotta purchase price was funded with debt which resulted in a slight increase in Q2 2022 net debt to $1.6 billion; however, with the increase in FFO our net debt to trailing FFO ratio decreased to 1.1x.</p><p>We have successfully integrated the Leucrotta assets and assembled a Mica asset team which is now focused on completing the 6-well Montney pad that was drilled in Q2 2022. We are excited to have these assets in our portfolio and look forward to scaling up development in the years ahead. The Mica asset significantly increases the depth and quality of our North American inventory and is expected to add multiple decades of development and enhance FCF to the business.</p><p>Closing of the Corrib acquisition continues to progress as we move closer to obtaining all remaining partner and government approvals. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter with an estimated closing cash payment in the range of $100 to $150 million after adjusting for the FCF accrued throughout the year. Pro forma Q2 2022 FFO and FCF incorporating the incremental 36.5% ownership in Corrib was $536 million and $422 million, respectively.</p><p>We remain on track to achieve our next debt target of $1.2 billion by the end of 2022, and with this clear line of sight we are pleased to outline our formal return of capital framework which will see an increasing proportion of FCF returned to shareholders as debt levels decrease. Over the past two years we have been focused on balancing debt reduction and portfolio enhancement, all with the goal of maximizing value and the return of capital to our shareholders over the long term. Vermilion is in a very strong position from both an asset base and financial perspective. We announced two strategic acquisitions over the past year, funded with free cash flow, and will have reduced debt by approximately $1 billion, relative to Q2 2020 debt levels, by the end of this year(1). While we will continue to keep a close eye on debt and reduce it even further to ensure we maintain a strong balance sheet through all commodity cycles, we are now in a position to increase our return of capital to shareholders. We are confident that our globally diversified asset base combined with our disciplined approach to capital allocation will generate value for our shareholders over the long-term. Further details on our return of capital framework is outlined below.</p><p>Return of Capital</p><p>Vermilion declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 CDN per share in Q2 2022 which was paid on July 15, 2022. With two strong quarters now behind us and a clear line of sight to achieving our next mid-cycle(2) debt target of $1.2 billion, we are now in a position to return a greater proportion of free cash flow to our shareholders. Vermilion has a long history of returning capital to its shareholders primarily through dividends. Dividends will remain a key component of our return of capital framework as we seek to provide shareholders with a resilient and increasing base dividend; however, we will limit the annual cash dividend outlay to approximately 10% of our mid-cycle FFO. In conjunction with our Q2 2022 release, we announced a 33% increase to our Q3 2022 quarterly cash dividend to $0.08 CDN per share which equates to an annual dividend of $0.32 CDN per share or approximately $53 million based on the current number of shares outstanding. At this dividend per share level, we have significant capacity to increase the base dividend and plan to provide ratable increases over time.</p><p>In addition to strengthening our balance sheet, Vermilion has made other structural improvements to its business by increasing our International production weighting through European natural gas exposure while also enhancing our North American inventory with a high quality long-life Montney asset. These structural improvements, combined with the strong fundamental outlook for global commodities will further underpin our ability to return capital to shareholders. The amount of FCF available for return of capital will increase as debt levels decrease based on the illustrative grid outlined below. This grid is not intended to be prescriptive quarter-to-quarter but will be used as a tool to guide near-term Return of Capital allocation decisions while taking into account other capital requirements such as further debt reduction, asset retirement obligations and acquisitions. //st Return of Capital Allocation Grid Mid-Cycle D/FFO Ratio )1.5x 1.0x - 1.5x 0.5x - 1.0x (0.5x Net Debt $MM )1,500 1,000 - 1,500 500 - 1,000 (500 FCF Distribution % up to 25% up to 50% up to 75% up to 90%</p><p>Based on our Return of Capital Allocation Grid, recent commodity strip(3) and internal estimates, we anticipate returning up to 25% of FCF in 2H 2022 and up to 50% - 75% of FCF in 2023 while reducing debt to a target of $850 million by the end of 2023, which implies an undrawn $1.6 billion credit facility. We will consider various options to return capital; including share buybacks, regular and special dividends and a potential substantial issuer bid. Based on a number of datapoints reviewed, we expect the majority of the incremental capital return to be in the form of share buybacks initially. In early July 2022, we announced the approval of a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") for the purchase of up to 16,076,666 common shares, representing approximately 10% of Vermilion's public float as at June 22, 2022. To date, we have repurchased 1.25 million common shares for $35 million. We look forward to providing continued updates on our return of capital initiatives through the second half of this year and throughout 2023 as we carefully weigh capital allocation decisions against various uses of excess free cash flow with a view of acting in the long-term interests of shareholders.</p><p>Q2 2022 Operations Review</p><p>North America</p><p>Production from our North American operations averaged 58,027 boe/d(4) in Q2 2022, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter primarily due to the Leucrotta acquisition which closed on May 31, 2022. Drilling and completion activity in west-central Alberta and south-east Saskatchewan was limited during the second quarter due to spring breakup. During the second quarter, we completed one (1.0 net) well and brought on production one (0.6 net) condensate-rich Mannville natural gas well in west-central Alberta, and we drilled one (1.0 net) well and completed two (2.0 net) wells in south-east Saskatchewan. Following the announcement of the Leucrotta acquisition in late March 2022, we assembled our Mica asset team and focused on integrating the assets and working closely with the Leucrotta team in drilling the first six (6.0 net) well Montney pad. Drilling was successfully completed during the second quarter and the team is now focused on completion activities. While we remain optimistic that an agreement on natural resource activity reviews will be reached between the BC Government and the Blueberry River First Nations in due course, our team has a plan to continue drilling on the Alberta side of the Mica property in 2023 should we see further delays in permit approvals.</p><p>In the United States, we drilled four (3.8 net) wells of our planned six (5.8 net) operated Turner wells and completed two (2.0 net) wells during the second quarter. Three (2.8 net) wells are two-mile lateral wells which are significantly more economic than one-mile laterals. One (1.0 net) well was brought on production during the second quarter while the remaining wells will be completed and brought on production during the third quarter. In addition, one (0.4 net) two-mile non-operated Turner well is planned for drilling in Q4 2022.</p><p>International</p><p>Production from our International operations averaged 26,840 boe/d(4) in Q2 2022, a decrease of 9% from the prior quarter primarily due to natural decline and offshore drilling delays in Australia. In Australia, the drilling of our two-well program was delayed by approximately one month due to unexpected maintenance and repairs on the third-party contracted rig. Drilling commenced late in the second quarter and is expected to finish in early September with production to start shortly thereafter. In Europe, much of our activity during the second quarter was focused on preparing for our 2H 2022 drilling campaign which will include two (1.1 net) wells in Netherlands, three (3.0 net) wells in Hungary and two (2.0 net wells) in Croatia.</p><p>Outlook and Guidance Update</p><p>Our Q3 2022 capital program is well underway as we finish up the drilling program in Australia, complete and tie in the remaining Turner wells in the US, execute our south-east Saskatchewan drilling program and complete the 6-well Montney pad at Mica. In Europe, we are making final preparations for an active drilling campaign to commence in the third quarter and continue through the fourth quarter. Early in the third quarter, a forest fire near our Cazaux field in southern France resulted in approximately 1,500 bbl/d of production being temporarily shut-in which will impact Q3 production in France.</p><p>Our Q3 2022 production will include a full quarter contribution from the Leucrotta acquisition and new production from the US and south-east Saskatchewan drilling programs; however, these volumes will be partially offset by the Australia drilling delay and fire related downtime in France. Taking all this into account, we expect Q3 2022 production to be in-line with Q2 2022.</p><p>As a result of forest fire related downtime in France, offshore drilling delays in Australia, combined with inflationary pressure, we are increasing our 2022 capital budget by $50 million to $550 million. We are maintaining our annual production guidance of 86,000 to 88,000 boe/d, excluding the Corrib acquisition volumes. We plan to update our production guidance once we have greater certainty on timing of the Corrib close. Our exit rate forecast of 95,000 to 100,000 boe/d, including Corrib acquisition volumes, remains unchanged.</p><p>Commodity Hedging</p><p>Vermilion hedges to manage commodity price exposures and increase the stability of our cash flows. In aggregate, as of August 9, 2022, we have 36% of our expected net-of-royalty production hedged for the remainder of 2022. With respect to individual commodity products, we have hedged 64% of our European natural gas production, 20% of our oil production, and 41% of our North American natural gas volumes for the remainder of 2022, respectively.

These oil and gas metrics do not have any standardized meaning or standard methods of calculation and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used and should therefore not be used to make comparisons. Natural gas volumes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent. Barrels of oil equivalent (boe) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.</p><p>This document may contain references to sustainability/ESG data and performance that reflect metrics and concepts that are commonly used in such frameworks as the Global Reporting Initiative, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, and the Value Reporting Foundation (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board). Vermilion has used best efforts to align with the most commonly accepted methodologies for ESG reporting, including with respect to climate data and information on potential future risks and opportunities, in order to provide a fuller context for our current and future operations. However, these methodologies are not yet standardized, are frequently based on calculation factors that change over time, and continue to evolve rapidly. Readers are particularly cautioned to evaluate the underlying definitions and measures used by other companies, as these may not be comparable to Vermilion's. While Vermilion will continue to monitor and adapt its reporting accordingly, the Company is not under any duty to update or revise the related sustainability/ESG data or statements except as required by applicable securities laws.</p><p>Financial data contained within this document are reported in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2022 Market News Publishing Inc.

(AP) \u2014 The prosecutor overseeing the case against the student accused in last week\u2019s deadly Michigan school shooting and who took the rare step of charging his parents has left open the possibility that school officials could also face charges. Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said Monday on ABC's \u201cGood Morning America\" that the investigation into Tuesday's attack at Oxford High School will determine whether school officials will face charges. She noted that three hours before 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley opened fire, killing four students and wounding six others and a teacher, he was sent back to class after his parents and school counselors met about a drawing a teacher found on his desk showing a bullet and the words \u201cblood everywhere.\u201d</p><p>SCHOOL SHOOTING-MICHIGAN-Q&amp;A</p><p>Could others be charged, liable in Michigan school shooting?</p><p>A prosecutor continues to criticize the decision to keep a teenager in a Michigan school before a shooting that killed four students last week.

The Powers North Central quarterback understands that being the leader of a state championship football program takes more than a strong arm and fleet feet. So when good friend and teammate Dylan Plunger started his ACL rehab program, Gorzinski started it right alongside him.

(AP) \u2014 A new Michigan law makes more firefighters with cancer eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Many in active service already qualify for the wage loss and medical benefits if they get certain types of cancer presumed to have been caused by hazards on the job. Legislation signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last week extends eligibility to forest fire officers and fire/crash officers at military airfields.

(AP) \u2014 A judge has imposed a combined $1 million bond for the parents of the Michigan teen charged with killing four students at Oxford High School, hours after police said they were caught hiding in a commercial building. James and Jennifer Crumbley entered not guilty pleas to each of the four involuntary manslaughter counts against them during a hearing Saturday held on Zoom.

(AP) \u2014 A Michigan school leader says a third party will investigate events at Oxford High School leading up to a school shooting that left four students dead and six other students and a teacher wounded. Oxford schools Superintendent Tim Throne said in a statement that he called for the outside investigation because parents have asked questions about the school\u2019s version of events leading up to the shooting this week. He also elaborated on interactions with the student leading up to the shooting. His comments came after a news conference Friday by Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald that detailed numerous warning signs from the student charged in the shooting. </p><p>FIREFIGHTER COMPENSATION</p><p>More Michigan firefighters with cancer eligible for benefits</p><p>LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 A new Michigan law makes more firefighters with cancer eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Many in active service already qualify for the wage loss and medical benefits if they get certain types of cancer presumed to have been caused by hazards on the job. Legislation signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last week extends eligibility to forest fire officers and fire/crash officers at military airfields. Jeff Roberts, president of the Michigan Association of Fire Chiefs, said many people may not realize the health effects that can occur years later due to exposure to contaminants and carcinogens while fighting fires and rescuing people.</p><p>SCHOOL SHOOTING-MICHIGAN-TIMELINE</p><p>Key moments surrounding Michigan high school shooting</p><p>OXFORD TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) \u2014 The parents of the 15-year-old suspect in the fatal shooting of four students at a Michigan high school have entered not guilty pleas to involuntary manslaughter charges. James and Jennifer Crumbley entered their pleas during a Zoom hearing, hours after police said they were arrested while hiding in a commercial building in Detroit. A judge set bond at $500,000 for each. Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald says Ethan Crumbley's mother wrote on social media that her husband bought a handgun last week as a Christmas present for the boy. The next day, a teacher found an alarming note and drawings on his desk.</p><p>SCHOOL SHOOTING-MICHIGAN-EXPLAINER-CHARGING PARENTS</p><p>EXPLAINER: How unusual to charge parents in school shooting?</p><p>Experts say guns used in U.S. school shootings have often come from the homes of young perpetrators. But parents are rarely charged for the violence that occurs. That\u2019s what makes the case against Ethan Crumbley\u2019s parents unusual, following the fatal shooting of four students at Oxford High School in southeastern Michigan. Jennifer and James Crumbley were taken into custody early Saturday and later ordered held on $500,000 bond each after pleading not guilty. They are charged with involuntary manslaughter, while their son is charged with murder, terrorism and other crimes. Oakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald says the Crumbleys ignored opportunities to intervene, just a few hours before the bloodshed.</p><p>MINIMUM WAGE</p><p>Michigan hourly minimum wage will rise 22 cents to $9.87</p><p>LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Michigan\u2019s minimum wage will rise by 22 cents to $9.87 an hour in January. State law requires annual increases in the wage until it reaches $12.05 in a decade. The 22-cent hike was supposed to occur in 2021 but was automatically delayed because of high unemployment early in the coronavirus pandemic. The state announced last week that the minimum wage for 16- and 17-year-olds will increase by 19 cents to $8.39 an hour. Employees who make tips will earn a base wage of $3.75 per hour, 8 cents more.</p><p>AUTO WORKERS-ELECTION</p><p>UAW votes for direct election of leaders in wake of scandal</p><p>DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Members of the United Auto Workers union have overwhelmingly approved picking their leaders by direct ballot elections. In doing so they have rejected a system that many blamed for corruption in the union\u2019s top ranks. The so-called \u201cone member, one vote\u201d measure got nearly 64% of 140,586 valid ballots that were received by Monday\u2019s mail-in deadline. About 36% favored the current system of leadership picked by delegates to a convention. That's according to results released Thursday. The results are not official until approved by the Labor Department and a federal judge. The election of the union\u2019s 13-member International Executive Board is likely to take place next summer or fall. </p><p>AP-US-EPA-ENVIRONMENTAL-JUSTICE</p><p>EPA head: 'Journey to Justice' tour 'really personal for me'</p><p>RESERVE, La. (AP) \u2014 EPA Administrator Michael Regan says a recently completed \u201cJourney to Justice\u201d tour from Mississippi to Texas enabled him to put \u201cfaces and names with this term that we call environmental justice.\u201d The five-day tour in mid-November highlighted low-income, mostly minority communities adversely affected by industrial pollution. A former environmental regulator in his native North Carolina, Regan has made environmental justice a top priority since taking over as EPA chief in March. The trip included visits to historically marginalized communities such as St. John and St. James parishes in Louisiana, along with cities such as New Orleans, Jackson, Mississippi, and Houston.</p><p>VIRUS OUTBREAK-MICHIGAN</p><p>3rd military medical team sent to Michigan amid COVID surge</p><p>LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 A third 22-member medical team from the U.S. military is being deployed to Michigan, where hospitals are grappling with record-high numbers of COVID-19 patients amid the state\u2019s fourth surge of infections. The nurses, doctors and respiratory therapists will assist Covenant Healthcare in Saginaw starting Dec. 12. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer calls it \u201cmuch-needed relief.\u201d Two other 22-member teams began treating patients in Grand Rapids and Dearborn this week. More than 4,500 people, most of them unvaccinated, were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases as of Wednesday. The 4,269 adults with confirmed infection surpassed the previous pandemic high that was reported two days earlier.</p><p>AP-US-VIRUS-OUTBREAK-US</p><p>'The fire that's here': US is still battling delta variant</p><p>While all eyes are on the new and little-understood omicron variant, the delta form of the coronavirus isn\u2019t finished wreaking havoc in the U.S., sending record numbers of patients to the hospital in some states, especially in the Midwest and New England. The U.S. recorded its first known omicron infection on Wednesday, in a fully vaccinated person who had returned to California from South Africa, where the variant was first identified just over a week ago. For now, the extra-contagious delta variant accounts for practically all cases in the U.S. and continues to inflict misery at a time when many hospitals are struggling with shortages of nurses and a backlog of patients. And now the fear is that omicron will foist more patients, and perhaps sicker ones, onto hospitals.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-5e035ac8b5a34da4d95b7cece918f3e9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:647D-PW41-DY9S-T4S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1268\"/><timeReceived>11:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 5, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Now, with the travel option gone, people are flocking to the local trails where they can experience the beneficial power of nature.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are many books and studies written about the benefits of walking in forests, including the 1984 classic, The Biophilia Hypothesis by Edward O. Wilson, that describes how humans possess an innate need to seek connections to nature. The Japanese practice called shinrin youku, or forest bathing, is a proven therapy that reduces stress, increases happiness, frees up creativity, boosts recovery from illnesses and lowers heart rate and blood pressure.</p><p>A recent discovery for me was learning about the medicinal values of breathing in the forest aroma that is filled with pinene aerosols. These chemicals flow from our lungs into our circulatory system where they boost our immune systems. Indigenous peoples were well aware of the antibiotic and antiviral properties of trees and utilized the components in their medicines.</p><p>Read more: Volunteers step up during pandemic to work on Shuswap trails</p><p>Then, of course, there are the psychological values of experiencing nature, as there is nothing like a meditative meander through the woods to clear your mind of anxiety, inspire your creativity and feel more at one with the world around you.</p><p>While it is always fun to explore new places, there are many benefits to experiencing the same natural surroundings daily. If one lives within walking distance of a forest path, there is much joy in repeating one's visits. Our need for stimulation from something new everyday can also be achieved by witnessing the changes that are constantly occurring, including the weather, the trail conditions, the wildlife and the seasonal variations, at different times of the day. As well, there is always something new to discover or become aware of during each visit by using all of our senses.</p><p>Read more: Popular Okanagan/Shuswap hiking guide updated</p><p>For the last few years, my wife Kathi and I have made it a goal to hike every day that we are not somewhere else on the trail behind our property up to the Lee Creek bluffs where there are extraordinary views of Shuswap Lake, from Copper Island to beyond Chase. Some days we have to slog through deep snow using snowshoes, or tread carefully on the ice using boot crampons. The hike can vary from one hour to three, depending on the conditions and how long we sit on a bench at the top to contemplate, chat and admire the view.</p><p>The focus changes daily, from inner thoughts to admiring the trees to observing the new growth in the spring. There are the very special trees that command our attention, including some massive old growth Douglas fir vets with their blackened thick bark from a long-ago forest fire, the giant leaners that defy gravity, the large, two-foot diameter fir that splits into two trunks just a few feet off the ground, the wizened, twisted and bent scrub tree and the wildlife-rich snags that are slowly decaying.</p><p>It is a steep, challenging climb up the hillside, but well worth it as these hikes are such a great way to exercise. Last year, I was able to do the hike 142 times and this year it could be even more this winter, given that warm temperatures deter us from skiing. One day, the Lee Creek Bluffs will hopefully become well-used by the public as part of the CSRD trail network, as it has been in the parks plan for more than a decade and the Trail Alliance has prepared the initial design.</p><p>We are privileged to live in the Shuswap where there is so much accessible public land to explore and so many diverse trails to enjoy. Despite the pandemic, the good times are always here to experience during any stroll into the forest.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsroom@saobserver.net\">newsroom@saobserver.net</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 Salmon Arm Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALARM-news20210112PSB4101299</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALARM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61VW-TS61-F0HF-852K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438273</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Not because they knew their work would make a difference, but because they knew that unless people got to work, we'd be lost.</p><p>When faced with the existential threat of climate change and our so-often inadequate global response - the prolonged failure of governments, international bodies and industry to lead - it can be easy to lose sight of the ways we are making progress.</p><p>Though many of the commonly cited solutions involve sacrifice and belt-tightening, many others will bring widespread benefits, more convenience, better health and less expense.</p><p>It's a future where instead of paying $30 to park downtown, you get paid to park your electric car and feed electricity into the grid; where, instead of a gas stove pumping toxic chemicals into your house and turning your kitchen into a sauna, your induction stove boils a pot of water in a cool 90 seconds; where you can buy fresh local strawberries year-round rather than rock-hard berries flown in from halfway across the world.</p><p>Most importantly, it's a future where the most disadvantaged benefit the most, from better transit, cheaper food and cleaner air.</p><p>\"Sustainability doesn't have to involve sacrifice,\" says Corey Ellis, the co-founder of Growcer, an Ottawa-based company that builds closed-loop hydroponic farms in shipping containers to grow fresh produce anywhere.</p><p>The company has been successful in Churchill, Man., which lost its link to the south after a flood washed out the rail line in 2017. Locals now get weekly boxes of locally grown produce for 40 per cent less than they paid when food was shipped in, Ellis said. In a country where the growing season lasts barely more than six months, this isn't just a solution for isolated northern communities - it really could make everyone's lives better.</p><p>\"We need to move forward in a positive way, to build resiliency into what we're doing in all parts of the economy,\" said Ellis. \"In that complexity and challenge, there's massive opportunity for people who want to be part of building solutions. By no means are we perfect or have we figured it all out. But we are definitely making steady progress and it's all about one foot in front of the other, marching toward that end goal.\"</p><p>This story marks the launch of the Star's new climate change beat. Readers are going to see more climate coverage every day. This will involve reporting on extreme weather events and international summits, on the efforts of governments and industry, on climate anxiety and the looming mental health crisis. But it will also seek to meet people where they are, exploring the ways individuals and communities are coping with climate change and building a better world.</p><p>Focusing on the positive doesn't mean ignoring the perils of climate change. But it does mean telling the kinds of stories that bring people on board rather than push them away or scare them into paralysis, says Tom Rand, a Montreal-based cleantech venture capitalist.</p><p>\"There are lots of embedded cognitive structures that prevent us from really engaging with climate as a risk because it runs against our narrative of who we are,\" says Rand, who also has a PhD in philosophy and cognitive science.</p><p>\"A future underwritten by technology as an economic stimulus that relies on our ingenuity and brings boundless clean energy - this is a narrative that speaks to the world view we want to have of ourselves. And so our defences are not up when we engage with climate on that basis,\" he said.</p><p>\"You have to start from a narrative about the future that people want and agree with and see themselves in. And you work backwards from that.\"</p><p>The Star spoke with a dozen people involved in the Canadian cleantech industry and heard a dizzying mix of optimism and pessimism, of practicality and fanciful conjecture. But one thing they all had in common was insight into the technologies just around the corner that will revolutionize our lives in ways we can only begin to imagine.</p><p>\"A future that's based on efficiency and renewables is actually a better future than the one we get with fossil fuels in so many different ways,\" says Ralph Torrie, a longtime emissions researcher who pioneered the methods used by governments to plan greenhouse gas reductions.</p><p>\"When cities or countries really take a serious attempt at making the transition to sustainability and renewable energy, all these other benefits reveal themselves, which end up being more valuable to people than the greenhouse-gas emission reductions.\"</p><p>There will be more employment in manufacturing, engineering and the trades, said Torrie. There will be cleaner air, less traffic and more livable cities. Electric cars are just better cars - anyone who has been in one knows, he said. And converting office buildings and condos to electric heat will make them not just more comfortable, they could actually end up consuming less electricity.</p><p>\"Our only hope is that a future that saves us will be a better place. Because if it's going to be 'eat your spinach,' it's going to be a tough sell.\"</p><p>Take the electric vehicle (EV). In many ways, it's the most visible, widespread cleantech that is already here. But like swapping your landline with a smartphone, we are only just beginning to understand how much more they can do than the technology they're replacing.</p><p>Thinking of an EV as a really good car ignores their real potential. Due to their massive batteries, EVs can act as portable power plants. En masse, they can provide more power than a nuclear reactor. Soon, EVs will not just draw electricity from the grid, but feed electricity into it. If current trends continue, in a decade the power available from plugged-in EV batteries will exceed the current total generation supply of the entire province of Ontario.</p><p>\"EVs will fundamentally change the way the electricity system works,\" says Mabel Fulford, director of innovation execution at Peak Power Energy, a Toronto-based cleantech company that has developed software to manage EV battery charging.</p><p>At the most basic level, the technology, called Peak Drive, ensures cars are charged to the owners' preferences - getting electricity when it's the cheapest or when it's the cleanest - and only get as much as they need. Next, the software ensures that cars aren't all charging at the same time, to avoid overloading the grid. Peak Drive can use demand information from the grid and charge data from the cars to become a player in the electricity market, charging the cars up when power is cheap and plentiful and selling electricity back into the grid at peak demand, typically on hot summer days when everyone has their A/C cranked.</p><p>Deployed strategically, EVs could reduce electricity demand at peak moments, avoiding blackouts and eliminating the need to turn on the carbon-emitting gas plants - our dirtiest form of generation. This is such a valuable service, the grid pays users to reduce demand when demand is peaking. Only large industrial and commercial consumers are currently eligible, but Peak Power has pilot projects that are showing enough EVs can make the same impact. Their calculations show a single EV owner could be paid $8,000 per year if they received the same incentives as the car manufacturers and shopping malls.</p><p>This means EV owners could soon stroll down to the underground parking at the end of the day and get paid to have parked all day, rather than paying for the space. And they'll have enough juice to pick up groceries on the way home.</p><p>\"This technology is going to democratize the grid because it will allow individuals to participate,\" said Fulford.</p><p>These kinds of game-changing technologies have clear environmental benefits. But that's not why people are going to buy them. They're going to buy them because they're better, said Marty Reed, a former Silicon Valley investor who is now a partner at Evok Innovations, a Vancouver-based cleantech accelerator.</p><p>Reed isn't convinced you can shame people into giving up things they like for the sake of the planet. Instead, he sees a future where people buy into climate solutions because they provide a better way of life.</p><p>\"We can hope that people will change behaviours or we can make experiences that are better and then they will adopt it quite willingly,\" he said. \"Our desire is just overall to enrich your world and allow you to keep doing what you're doing. But to do that with a much lower impact on the planet.\"</p><p>It's a contentious position to take among those seeking to solve the climate crisis. Most activists, technologists and policy experts say we will not be able to consume at our current rate and live sustainably. The minerals needed for EV batteries, for example, will require far more mining in the future, an activity which is far from being decarbonized. Even if all these technologies are rapidly adopted, it's still not going to prevent the extreme climate events that are already baked in due to the century of carbon already emitted.</p><p>But that isn't a reason for despair, said Chris Turner, a cleantech journalist who just published the book, \"How to be a Climate Optimist.\"</p><p>In more than 20 years of reporting on renewable energy and zero-carbon technologies, Turner says almost everything he's seen has panned out. Not only that, these technologies have been adopted faster, become cheaper and had a greater impact than even the most optimistic projections predicted.</p><p>More solar energy is installed in China every year than existed worldwide 10 years ago, Turner says in his book. Globally, almost as many electric vehicles will be bought this year than exist on the road today. High-emissions industries like concrete and steel that were long said to be impossible to decarbonize now have viable net-zero manufacturing techniques.</p><p>\"That's real evidence there,\" said Turner. \"It was not inevitable and it didn't even look likely a decade ago ... If none of that had happened, it would be very hard to sit here and go, well, actually, we can feel pretty optimistic.\"</p><p>None of this is to ignore the very real challenges ahead, he said.</p><p>There needs to be global action and decisive leadership to avoid the worst outcomes of climate change.</p><p>But we forget how rapid technological innovations can revolutionize society. Fifteen years ago, smartphones didn't exist. Now, not only have they changed every industry in the world, they've spawned entire industries unto themselves.</p><p>\"Will we get to where we need to by 2030? Well, it's questionable, but we could get pretty close. And what comes after that? Another 10 years of really, really rapid, unpredictable innovation. Do we get all kinds of places we can't even imagine? I think we probably do,\" said Turner.</p><p>Or as Thunberg said: \"The climate crisis has already been solved. We already have all the facts and solutions. All we have to do is wake up and change.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-news20220619TTAWaeea4e5d193d41f58a30bdfb693cba62</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65R8-NJS1-JDV5-F4VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1950\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Although it was burning into forest land, evacuation orders remained in effect for the western Antelope Valley because erratic winds in the forecast could push the fire toward homes, fire spokesman Jake Miller said.</p><p>Fire crews managed to stop the fire's movement down to the desert floor when it flared up Friday afternoon. In one dramatic moment, several firefighters ran to safety when a longhorn bull that was apparently escaping the blaze charged at them.</p><p>The Lake Fire was just 12% contained as of Saturday morning, and after threatening more than 5,400 homes, it had charred more than 23 square miles (59.5 square kilometres) of brush and trees. Fire officials said 21 buildings had been destroyed, including at least five homes.</p><p>Firefighters were struggling in steep, rugged terrain amid scorching temperatures. The National Weather Service warned temperatures could hit 111 degrees (44 Celsius) in the Antelope Valley Saturday, and winds gusting 15-20 mph (24-32 kph) was expected later in the afternoon.</p><p>\"In addition to that, we have a very unstable air mass over the Lake Fire that's going to allow for a pyrocumulus (cloud) development later today so that will create extreme fire behaviour,\" meteorologist Matt Mehle said.</p><p>Many areas of the state saw record-breaking heat through the weekend, with triple-digit temperatures and unhealthy air predicted for many parts of the state. There also was a chance of isolated thunderstorms worsening the fire threat by creating dry lightning and strong downdrafts, fire officials said.</p><p>North of Lake Tahoe, the Loyalton Fire has burned 31 square miles (80 square kilometres) east of Reno, Nevada. Weather service officials said the fire was showing extreme behaviour such as gusty winds and blowing smoke similar to a deadly Northern California fire that destroyed more than 1,000 homes and killed 8 people. That fire was just 5 per cent contained Saturday night.</p><p>There was also no containment of a blaze that blackened foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. It churned through 2.3 square miles (5.96 square kilometres) of brush on Thursday and was moving away from homes. Evacuation orders issued to residents were lifted early Friday.</p><p>Azusa police said they were looking for a homeless man suspected of starting the fire. He was identified as Osmin Palencia, 36, and was last known to be living in a riverbed encampment near the site where the fire started.</p><p>Police said Palencia was believed to be violent and urged people to use caution if they see him.</p><p>Another blaze came dangerously close to a neighbourhood in the city of Corona, east of Los Angeles, before crews controlled it. And a Northern California fire in the community of Sloughhouse, near Sacramento, burned about 500 acres (202 hectares) before firefighters stopped its forward spread.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-696c4b975ab8b879335e8f9ada0caee1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KX-F3N1-JBVR-3462-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"554\"/><timeReceived>10:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 15, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The truck was hauling 38,000 litres of gasoline in one tank and 15,000 litres of diesel in the rear tank.</p><p>When crews arrived, they made an attempt to fight the blaze, but as the fire grew with intensity, and with the lack of water supply and inability to sustain an attack, Blackpool Fire Rescue ordered an emergency pull back.</p><p>\u201cIt was unsafe for our crews to remain,\u201d Chief Mike Savage told The Times.</p><p>Crews retreated 800 metres from the scene. A family home nearby was evacuated, and given sprinkler protection, while three other families in homes near the 800-metre mark were told to shelter in place. Highway 24 was closed to traffic in both directions.</p><p>About 10 minutes after the team was told to retreat, the gasoline tanker blew.</p><p>As anyone who has used gasoline to light a campfire knows, it\u2019s not the gasoline itself that ignites the flame \u2014 it\u2019s the vapours. The 38,000 litres of gasoline were emitting vapours that are three to four time heavier than air with the ability to travel long distances along the ground.</p><p>The flames from the brakes mixed with the fumes from the gasoline tank, causing an explosion and what\u2019s known as a flash.</p><p>\u201cThat flash can basically bum everybody around it,\u201d said Savage. \u201cThat\u2019s why we pulled our crews back because it was getting to that point where it was unsafe, and within 10 minutes of the pull back, she blew. It was 100 feet in the air, huge fireball.\u201d</p><p>When they were certain the fire wouldn\u2019t do anything more than just burn, they opened the highway to singlelane traffic, with a pilot vehicle to ensure there was no risk to responders and also to prevent travellers from slowing down to look or to stop.</p><p>While the highway was closed, however, sirens from an ambulance could be heard travelling towards the scene. While an ambulance is on stand-by for any structural or serious fire, this particular ambulance was travelling from 100 Mile House to Royal Inland Hospital in Kamloops with an emergency patient transfer. Crews were able to get them through the scene safely.</p><p>Savage reminds those watching any emergency scene from afar to not speculate what may be happening. Rumours such as an emergency responder needing medical attention or an ambulance can unnecessarily worry family members, sending panic throughout the community.</p><p>After the blaze had been roaring for most of the day, emergency responders were able to get local drone footage of the truck. This allowed them to see they had an opening for an attack.</p><p>\u201cThe drone footage showed that we had an opening for a tactical advantage to make a second attempt,\u201d said Savage. \u201cBased on that on-site intel, we were able to move crews in and hit the fire with a large monitor with foam at distance, cooling the rear tanker trailer and skipping foam into the open flame with the last of the small amount of product.\u201d</p><p>They extinguished the fire and made it safe enough to move in with hand lines and ground crews and save the rear tanker.</p><p>With the fire out, it\u2019s up to the company to dispatch a hazmat team to pump out the diesel, assess the wreckage and take the truck away. They were to do that today (June 14), according to Savage.</p><p>Seventeen firefighters, with two engines, two tender trucks and a bush truck, along with members of the RCMP and BC Ambulance were on scene. The Fire Commissioner\u2019s Office and local governments also were notified and BC Wildfire brought in, in the event one or both of the tankers blew and sparked a forest fire. Fortunately, there was minimal wind, allowing the flames and smoke to rise upwards.</p><p>Despite the uncertainty of those on the outside, all emergency crews and the driver of the truck were safe when fire crews officially packed up and left the scene at about 9:00 p.m. Savage said that while it was a bit stressful at the start when the fire was unpredictable, the call to bring crews back was good as the blaze did exactly what they had feared.</p><p>\u201cIf the risk isn't reasonable for what you're going to benefit, then get your people out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we work by. That\u2019s our golden rule.\u201d</p><p>Clearwater Times \u201cThat flash can basically burn everybody around it.\"</p><p>Chief Mike Savage</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLETME-news20210617PRGA0001945563</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLETME2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62Y5-3BX1-JD2C-J51Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438212</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Once we start to act, hope is everywhere. So instead of looking for hope, look for action. Then - and only then - hope will come.\"</p><p>While the clock to climate disaster has ticked down, people have been rolling up their sleeves and getting to work. Not because they knew their work would make a difference, but because they knew that unless people got to work, we'd be lost.</p><p>When faced with the existential threat of climate change and our so-often inadequate global response - the prolonged failure of governments, international bodies and industry to lead - it can be easy to lose sight of the ways we are making progress.</p><p>Though many of the commonly cited solutions involve sacrifice and belt-tightening, many others will bring widespread benefits, more convenience, better health and less expense.</p><p>It's a future where instead of paying $30 to park downtown, you get paid to park your electric car and feed electricity into the grid; where, instead of a gas stove pumping toxic chemicals into your house and turning your kitchen into a sauna, your induction stove boils a pot of water in a cool 90 seconds; where you can buy fresh local strawberries year-round rather than rock-hard berries flown in from halfway across the world.</p><p>Most importantly, it's a future where the most disadvantaged benefit the most, from better transit, cheaper food and cleaner air.</p><p>\"Sustainability doesn't have to involve sacrifice,\" said Corey Ellis, the co-founder of Growcer, an Ottawa-based company that builds closed-loop hydroponic farms in shipping containers to grow fresh produce anywhere.</p><p>The company has been successful in Churchill, Man., which lost its link to the south after a flood washed out the rail line in 2017. Locals now get weekly boxes of locally grown produce for 40 per cent less than they paid when food was shipped in, Ellis said. In a country where the growing season lasts barely more than six months, this isn't just a solution for isolated northern communities - it really could make everyone's lives better.</p><p>\"We need to move forward in a positive way, to build resiliency into what we're doing in all parts of the economy,\" Ellis said. \"In that complexity and challenge, there's massive opportunity for people who want to be part of building solutions. By no means are we perfect or have we figured it all out. But we are definitely making steady progress and it's all about one foot in front of the other, marching toward that end goal.\"</p><p>This story marks the launch of the Star's new climate change beat. Readers are going to see more climate coverage every day. This will involve reporting on extreme weather events and international summits, on the efforts of governments and industry, on climate anxiety and the looming mental health crisis. But it will also seek to meet people where they are, exploring the ways individuals and communities are coping with climate change and building a better world.</p><p>Focusing on the positive doesn't mean ignoring the perils of climate change. But it does mean telling the kinds of stories that bring people on board rather than push them away or scare them into paralysis, says Tom Rand, a Montreal-based cleantech venture capitalist.</p><p>\"There are lots of embedded cognitive structures that prevent us from really engaging with climate as a risk because it runs against our narrative of who we are,\" says Rand, who also has a PhD in philosophy and cognitive science.</p><p>\"A future underwritten by technology as an economic stimulus that relies on our ingenuity and brings boundless clean energy - this is a narrative that speaks to the world view we want to have of ourselves. And so our defences are not up when we engage with climate on that basis,\" he said. \"You have to start from a narrative about the future that people want and agree with and see themselves in. And you work backwards from that.\"</p><p>The Star spoke with a dozen people involved in the Canadian cleantech industry and heard a dizzying mix of optimism and pessimism, of practicality and fanciful conjecture. But one thing they all had in common was insight into the technologies just around the corner that will revolutionize our lives in ways we can only begin to imagine.</p><p>\"A future that's based on efficiency and renewables is actually a better future than the one we get with fossil fuels in so many different ways,\" says Ralph Torrie, a longtime emissions researcher who pioneered the methods used by governments to plan greenhouse gas reductions. \"When cities or countries really take a serious attempt at making the transition to sustainability and renewable energy, all these other benefits reveal themselves, which end up being more valuable to people than the greenhouse-gas emission reductions.\"</p><p>There will be more employment in manufacturing, engineering and the trades, Torrie said. There will be cleaner air, less traffic and more livable cities. Electric cars are just better cars - anyone who has been in one knows, he said. And converting office buildings and condos to electric heat will make them not just more comfortable, they could actually end up consuming less electricity.</p><p>\"Our only hope is that a future that saves us will be a better place. Because if it's going to be 'eat your spinach,' it's going to be a tough sell.\"</p><p>Take the electric vehicle (EV). In many ways, it's the most visible, widespread cleantech that is already here. But like swapping your landline with a smartphone, we are only just beginning to understand how much more they can do than the technology they're replacing.</p><p>Thinking of an EV as a really good car ignores their real potential. Due to their massive batteries, EVs can act as portable power plants. En masse, they can provide more power than a nuclear reactor. Soon, EVs will not just draw electricity from the grid, but feed electricity into it. If current trends continue, in a decade the power available from plugged-in EV batteries will exceed the current total generation supply of the entire province of Ontario.</p><p>\"EVs will fundamentally change the way the electricity system works,\" says Mabel Fulford, director of innovation execution at Peak Power Energy, a Toronto-based cleantech company that has developed software to manage EV battery charging.</p><p>At the most basic level, the technology, called Peak Drive, ensures cars are charged to the owners' preferences - getting electricity when it's the cheapest or when it's the cleanest - and only get as much as they need. Next, the software ensures that cars aren't all charging at the same time, to avoid overloading the grid. Peak Drive can use demand information from the grid and charge data from the cars to become a player in the electricity market, charging the cars up when power is cheap and plentiful and selling electricity back into the grid at peak demand.</p><p>Deployed strategically, EVs could reduce electricity demand at peak moments, avoiding blackouts and eliminating the need to turn on the carbon-emitting gas plants. This is such a valuable service, the grid pays users to reduce demand when demand is peaking. Only large industrial and commercial consumers are currently eligible, but Peak Power has pilot projects that are showing enough EVs can make the same impact. Their calculations show a single EV owner could be paid $8,000 per year if they received the same incentives as the car manufacturers and shopping malls.</p><p>This means EV owners could soon stroll down to the underground parking at the end of the day and get paid to have parked all day, rather than paying for the space. And they'll have enough juice to pick up groceries on the way home.</p><p>These kinds of game-changing technologies have clear environmental benefits. But that's not why people are going to buy them. They're going to buy them because they're better, said Marty Reed, a former Silicon Valley investor who is now a partner at Evok Innovations, a Vancouver-based cleantech accelerator.</p><p>\"We can hope that people will change behaviours or we can make experiences that are better and then they will adopt it quite willingly,\" he said. \"Our desire is just overall to enrich your world and allow you to keep doing what you're doing. But to do that with a much lower impact on the planet.\"</p><p>It's a contentious position to take among those seeking to solve the climate crisis. Most activists, technologists and policy experts say we will not be able to consume at our current rate and live sustainably. The minerals needed for EV batteries, for example, will require far more mining in the future, an activity which is far from being decarbonized. Even if all these technologies are rapidly adopted, it's still not going to prevent the extreme climate events that are already baked in due to the century of carbon already emitted.</p><p>But that isn't a reason for despair, said Chris Turner, a cleantech journalist who just published the book \"How to be a Climate Optimist.\"</p><p>In more than 20 years of reporting on renewable energy and zero-carbon technologies, Turner says almost everything has he's seen has panned out. Not only that, these technologies have been adopted faster, become cheaper and had a greater impact than even the most optimistic projections predicted.</p><p>More solar energy is installed in China every year than existed worldwide 10 years ago, Turner says in his book. Globally, almost as many electric vehicles will be bought this year than exist on the road today. High-emissions industries like concrete and steel that were long said to be impossible to decarbonize now have viable net-zero manufacturing techniques.</p><p>\"That's real evidence there,\" said Turner. \"It was not inevitable and it didn't even look likely a decade ago.\"</p><p>None of this is to ignore the very real challenges ahead, he said.</p><p>There needs to be global action and decisive leadership to avoid the worst outcomes of climate change.</p><p>But we forget how rapid technological innovations can revolutionize society. Fifteen years ago, smartphones didn't exist. Now, not only have they changed every industry in the world, they've spawned entire industries unto themselves.</p><p>\"Will we get to where we need to by 2030? Well, it's questionable, but we could get pretty close. And what comes after that? Another 10 years of really, really rapid, unpredictable innovation. Do we get all kinds of places we can't even imagine? I think we probably do,\" said Turner.</p><p>Or as Thunberg said: \"The climate crisis has already been solved. We already have all the facts and solutions. All we have to do is wake up and change.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20220618TTA2022061864767833</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65R0-DGG1-F197-5271-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1860\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

It uses factors such as the relative humidity, temperature, previous 24-hour rain amount, wind directions and wind speed in combination with the forest fuel type and loads to determine the risk of the forest to certain fire types. From this calculation the Forest Fire Danger Rating is made in consultation with the Fire Chiefs of the six area municipalities and the Ministry of Natural Resources. The Muskoka fire season runs from April 1 to Oct. 31 each year. The rating is verified daily and updated whenever the rating changes. \\r\\n A Twitter List by MuskokaRegion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20210616TMUW1125699587598308411749354</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62XT-D9P1-F197-525T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"805\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The truck was hauling 38,000 litres of gasoline in one tank and 15,000 litres of diesel in the rear tank.</p><p>When crews arrived, they made an attempt to fight the blaze, but as the fire grew with intensity, and with the lack of water supply and inability to sustain an attack, Blackpool Fire Rescue ordered an emergency pull back.</p><p>\u201cIt was unsafe for our crews to remain,\u201d Chief Mike Savage told Black Press Media.</p><p>Crews retreated 800 metres from the scene. A family home nearby was evacuated, and given sprinkler protection, while three other families in homes near the 800-metre mark were told to shelter in place. Highway 24 was closed to traffic in both directions.</p><p>About 10 minutes after the team was told to retreat, the gasoline tanker blew.</p><p>As anyone who has used gasoline to light a campfire knows, it\u2019s not the gasoline itself that ignites the flame \u2014 it\u2019s the vapours. The 38,000 litres of gasoline were emitting vapours that are three to four time heavier than air with the ability to travel long distances along the ground.</p><p>The flames from the brakes mixed with the fumes from the gasoline tank, causing an explosion and what\u2019s known as a flash.</p><p>\u201cThat flash can basically burn everybody around it,\u201d said Savage. \u201cThat\u2019s why we pulled our crews back because it was getting to that point where it was unsafe, and within 10 minutes of the pull back, she blew. It was 100 feet in the air, huge fireball.\u201d</p><p>When they were certain the fire wouldn\u2019t do anything more than just burn, they opened the highway to single-lane traffic, with a pilot vehicle to ensure there was no risk to responders and also to prevent travellers from slowing down to look or to stop.</p><p>While the highway was closed, however, sirens from an ambulance could be heard travelling towards the scene. While an ambulance is on stand-by for any structural or serious fire, this particular ambulance was travelling from 100 Mile House to Royal Inland Hospital in Kamloops with an emergency patient transfer. Crews were able to get them through the scene safely.</p><p>Savage reminds those watching any emergency scene from afar to not speculate what may be happening. Rumours such as an emergency responder needing medical attention or an ambulance can unnecessarily worry family members, sending panic throughout the community.</p><p>After the blaze had been roaring for most of the day, emergency responders were able to get local drone footage of the truck. This allowed them to see they had an opening for an attack.</p><p>\u201cThe drone footage showed that we had an opening for a tactical advantage to make a second attempt,\u201d said Savage. \u201cBased on that on-site intel, we were able to move crews in and hit the fire with a large monitor with foam at distance, cooling the rear tanker trailer and skipping foam into the open flame with the last of the small amount of product.\u201d</p><p>They extinguished the fire and made it safe enough to move in with hand lines and ground crews and save the rear tanker.</p><p>With the fire out, it\u2019s up to the company to dispatch a hazmat team to pump out the diesel, assess the wreckage and take the truck away. They were to do that on last Monday, June 14, according to Savage.</p><p>Seventeen firefighters, with two engines, two tender trucks and a bush truck, along with members of the RCMP and BC Ambulance were on scene. The Fire Commissioner\u2019s Office and local governments also were notified and BC Wildfire brought in, in the event one or both of the tankers blew and sparked a forest fire. Fortunately, there was minimal wind, allowing the flames and smoke to rise upwards.</p><p>Despite the uncertainty of those on the outside, all emergency crews and the driver of the truck were safe when fire crews officially packed up and left the scene at about 9:00 p.m. Savage said while it was a bit stressful at the start when the fire was unpredictable, the call to bring crews back was good as the blaze did exactly what they had feared.</p><p>\u201cIf the risk isn\u2019t reasonable for what you\u2019re going to benefit, then get your people out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we work by.

It is the world's first portfolio-scale TCFD reporting tool covering counterparty company assets.</p><p>XDI analyzed 1.8 millions assets associated with 1,800 listed companies in the US, Canada, Europe, Africa, the UK and Australia against climate risk hazards including flooding, coastal inundation, heat, drought and forest fire. XDI's data and analysis are the basis for the physical risk quantification in the new framework launched in London today.</p><p>\"XDI now offers the finance sector the most comprehensive climate risk assessment available in line with TCFD physical risk reporting,\" said XDI CEO Rohan Hamden. \"The new tool allows investors and potential buyers to carry out detailed analysis on companies and their assets independently.\"</p><p>\"The ability to assess a company's climate risk independently is a game-changer. A company can no longer hide risk and potential costs of impacts from extreme weather,\" Hamden said. \"Our new framework means that those who haven't assessed and reported climate risk are vulnerable in a market where detailed, counterparty assessment is now being carried out.\"</p><p>\"We at XDI hope the new framework will provide a more objective understanding of business climate risk and show that independent climate analysis -- not just self disclosure -- is now possible,\" Hamden said. \"Investors like L&amp;G can now undertake climate change risk analysis across a target company's assets anywhere globally.\"</p><p>Background:XDI: <url normalizedValue=\"http://xdi.systems\">http://xdi.systems</url>/\u00a0 Legal &amp;

(AP) \u2014 David Shapiro and his wife brought their two young kids to enjoy the Independence Day parade in their hometown north of Chicago, snagging a spot in front of a boutique winery. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The children's parade in downtown Highland Park had already gone by, with about 50 school-age children riding bikes, scooters and tricycles. The musicians of the Maxwell Street Klezmer Band, complete with full drum set and brass section, were starting to play atop a flatbed trailer. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then came the sound that Shapiro knew did not fit: pop pop pop pop pop. </p><p>Before he knew what was happening, parade-goers from farther down the route began running toward the 47-year-old and his family, screaming about someone with a gun. </p><p>\u201cIt was chaos,\u201d Shapiro recalled. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t know right away where the gunfire was coming from, whether the gunman was in front or behind you chasing you.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>In major blow, 2 key ministers quit Boris Johnson government</p><p>LONDON (AP) \u2014 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was clinging to power Tuesday after two of his most senior Cabinet ministers quit, saying they had lost confidence in Johnson\u2019s leadership amid shifting explanations about his handling of a sexual misconduct scandal.</p><p>Treasury chief Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid resigned within minutes of each other, costing Johnson the support of the men responsible for tackling two of the biggest issues facing Britain \u2014 the cost-of-living crisis and surging COVID-19 infections.</p><p>Both cited Johnson\u2019s credibility after a day in which the prime minister was forced to backtrack on earlier statements about the scandal that has rattled his government for the past six days.</p><p>The debacle is only the latest to hit Johnson, who last month narrowly survived a vote of no confidence triggered by similarly shifting stories about lockdown-breaking parties in government offices.</p><p>In his letter of resignation, Javid said the confidence vote showed a large number of Conservative Party lawmakers had lost trust in Johnson.</p><p>___</p><p>Judge won\u2019t block law banning most Mississippi abortions</p><p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) \u2014 As attorneys argued about abortion laws across the South on Tuesday, a Mississippi judge rejected a request by the state\u2019s only abortion clinic to temporarily block a law that would ban most abortions. </p><p>Without other developments in the Mississippi lawsuit, the clinic will close at the end of business Wednesday and the state law will take effect Thursday.</p><p>One of the clinic's attorneys, Hillary Schneller of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the judge should have blocked the law.</p><p>\u201cPeople in Mississippi who need abortions right now are in a state of panic, trying to get into the clinic before it\u2019s too late,\" Schneller said. \"No one should be forced to live in fear like that.\u201d</p><p>Mississippi legislators passed the \u201ctrigger\u201d law before the U.S. Supreme Court recently overturned the 1973 Roe v.

(AP) \u2014 A man charged Tuesday with seven counts of murder after firing off more than 70 rounds at an Independence Day parade in suburban Chicago legally bought five weapons, including the high-powered rifle used in the shooting, despite authorities being called to his home twice in 2019 for threats of violence and suicide, police said.</p><p>Lake County State\u2019s Attorney Eric Rinehart said the suspect, if convicted of the first-degree murder charges, would receive a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole. He promised that dozens more charges would be sought.</p><p>A spokesman for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force said the suspected shooter, who was arrested late Monday, used a rifle \u201csimilar to an AR-15\" to spray more than 70 rounds from atop a commercial building into a crowd that had gathered for the parade in Highland Park, an affluent community of about 30,000 on the Lake Michigan shore.</p><p>A seventh victim died of their injuries Tuesday. More than three dozen other people were wounded in the attack, which Task force spokesman Christopher Covelli said the suspect had planned for several weeks.</p><p>The assault happened less than three years after police went to the suspect's home following a call from a family member who said he was threatening \u201cto kill everyone\u201d there. Covelli said police confiscated 16 knives, a dagger and a sword, but said there was no sign he had any guns at the time, in September 2019.</p><p>___</p><p>Ukrainian governor urges evacuation of 350,000 residents</p><p>KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 The governor of the last remaining eastern province partly under Ukraine's control urged his more than 350,000 residents to flee as Russia escalated its offensive and air alerts were issued across nearly the entire country.</p><p>Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said that getting people out of Donetsk province is necessary to save lives and enable the Ukrainian army better to defend towns from the Russian advance. </p><p>\u201cThe destiny of the whole country will be decided by the Donetsk region,\u201d Kyrylenko told reporters in Kramatrosk, the province's administrative center and home to the Ukrainian military's regional headquarters.</p><p>\u201cOnce there are less people, we will be able to concentrate more on our enemy and perform our main tasks,\u201d Kyrylenko said.</p><p>The governor\u2019s call for residents to leave appeared to represent one of the biggest suggested evacuations of the war, although it's unclear whether people will be willing and safely able to flee. According to the U.N. refugee agency, more than 7.1 million Ukrainians are estimated to be displaced within Ukraine, and more than 4.8 million refugees left the country since Russia's invasion started Feb. 24.</p><p>___</p><p>A survivor of the migrant trailer: 'They couldn't breathe'</p><p>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) \u2014 Simple advice from a friend to stay near the door may have saved Yenifer Yulisa Cardona Tom\u00e1s from the deadly fate that befell 53 other migrants when they were abandoned trapped in a sweltering semi-trailer last week on the edge of San Antonio.</p><p>Speaking by phone from her hospital bed Monday, the 20-year-old from Guatemala\u2019s capital said it was already hot on June 27 when she stepped out of the warehouse on the Texas side of the Mexico border where she had been waiting and climbed into the back of the trailer. </p><p>She said the smugglers confiscated their cellphones and covered the trailer\u2019s floor with what she believes was powdered chicken bouillon, apparently to throw off any dogs at checkpoints. As she sat stuffed inside the stifling trailer with dozens of others, the powder stung her skin. </p><p>Remembering her friend's caution to stay near the door where it would be cooler, Cardona Tom\u00e1s shared the advice with another friend she had made during the journey. </p><p>\u201cI told a friend that we shouldn\u2019t go to the back and should stay near (the entrance), in the same place without moving,\u201d said Cardona Tom\u00e1s, who is being treated at Methodist Hospital Metropolitan in San Antonio. That friend survived, too. </p><p>___</p><p>Georgia subpoenaing Giuliani, Graham in Trump election probe</p><p>ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The Georgia prosecutor investigating the conduct of former President Donald Trump and his allies after the 2020 election is subpoenaing U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and other members of Trump's campaign legal team to testify before a special grand jury.</p><p>Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis on Tuesday filed petitions with the judge overseeing the special grand jury as part of her investigation into what she alleges was \"a multi-state, coordinated plan by the Trump Campaign to influence the results of the November 2020 election in Georgia and elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>The move marks a major escalation in a case that could pose a serious legal challenge to the former president as he weighs another White House run. While the special grand jury has already heard from top state officials, Tuesday's filings directly target several of Trump's closest allies and advisers, including Giuliani, who led his campaign's legal efforts to overturn the election results.</p><p>\u201cIt means the investigation is obviously becoming more intense because those are trusted advisers, those are inner circle people,\u201d said Robert James, former district attorney in DeKalb County, which neighbors Fulton.</p><p>The special grand jury has been investigating whether Trump and others illegally tried to meddle in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia as he desperately tried to cling to power after Democrat Joe Biden's victory. Trump continues to insist that the election was stolen, despite the fact that numerous federal and local officials, a long list of courts, top former campaign staff and even Trump's own attorney general have all said there is no evidence of the fraud he alleges.</p><p>___</p><p>Parents of boy, 2, found alone at parade shooting among dead</p><p>Aiden McCarthy's photo was shared across Chicago-area social media groups in the hours after the July 4 parade shooting in Highland Park, accompanied by pleas to help identify the 2-year-old who had been found at the scene bloodied and alone and to reunite him with his family. </p><p>On Tuesday, friends and authorities confirmed that the boy's parents, Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35, were among seven people killed in the tragedy. </p><p>\u201cAt two years old, Aiden is left in the unthinkable position; to grow up without his parents,\u201d wrote Irina Colon on a GoFundMe account she created for the family and Aiden, who was reunited with his grandparents Monday evening. </p><p>Friends of the McCarthys said Irina\u2019s parents would care for the boy going forward. </p><p>Four of other others who were killed were identified Tuesday as Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; and Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78. Every victim was from Highland Park except for Toledo-Zaragoza, who was visiting family in the city from Morelos, Mexico.</p><p>___</p><p>New evacuations for communities near California forest fire</p><p>JACKSON, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Evacuation orders were expanded Tuesday for remote California communities near a wildfire that may have been sparked by fireworks or a barbecue on the Fourth of July in a mountainous region that's a top tourism destination. </p><p>The Electra Fire in Sierra Nevada Gold Country broke out Monday afternoon and tripled in size to more than 4.7 square miles (12.2 square kilometers) by Tuesday.</p><p>\u201cThe rate of spread isn\u2019t what it was like yesterday, but it is still spreading,\u201d said Amador County Sheriff Gary Redman. He said firefighters were working to keep flames confined to unpopulated canyon areas. </p><p>Mandatory evacuation orders and warnings combined affected up to 700 residents in Amador County and 300 to 400 people in Calaveras County, Redman said. Evacuation centers were set up for people and animals. </p><p>The fire started at a recreation area that was packed with people, forcing 85 to 100 celebrating the holiday at a river to take shelter at a Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. facility, Redman said. All were later safely evacuated.</p><p>___</p><p>Judge throws out Trump-era rollbacks on endangered species</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday threw out a host of actions by the Trump administration to roll back protections for endangered or threatened species, a year after the Biden administration said it was moving to strengthen such species protections.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in Northern California eliminated the Trump-era rules even as two wildlife agencies under President Joe Biden are reviewing or rescinding the regulations. The decision restores a range of protections under the Endangered Species Act \u2014 including some that date to the 1970s \u2014 while the reviews are completed. Environmental groups hailed the decision, which they said sped up needed protections and critical habitat designations for threatened species, including salmon in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Tigar's ruling \u201cspoke for species desperately in need of comprehensive federal protections without compromise,\u201d said Kristen Boyles, an attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice. \u201cThreatened and endangered species do not have the luxury of waiting under rules that do not protect them.\u201d </p><p>The court ruling comes as two federal agencies \u2014 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service \u2014 review five Endangered Species Act regulations finalized by President Donald Trump's administration, including critical habitat designations and rules requiring federal agencies to consult with the wildlife or fisheries services before taking actions that could affect threatened or endangered species. </p><p>Fish and Wildlife also said it will reinstate the decades-old \u201cblanket rule,\u201d which mandates additional protections for species that are newly classified as threatened. Those protections were removed under Trump.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-07c55b81b295cba1ef2f52779afd9bb0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65VM-BMJ1-DY9S-T4S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2155\"/><timeReceived>11:04 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 5, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
