The bulletin was issued Thursday (Feb. 8).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Drought hazards are especially pronounced in areas with low snowpack, including Vancouver Island, the South Coast and the Lower Fraser.</p><p>\u201cExtremely low seasonal runoff forecasts for the Okanagan, Kalamalka-Wood, Nicola Lake and Nicola River are also indicative of elevated seasonal drought hazards,\u201d it reads.</p><p>The report points out that two to three months still remain in the snow season, but its tone is not optimistic.</p><p>\u201cWhile conditions may change slightly over this period, current trends in low snowpack are expected to persist,\u201d it reads.</p><p>While the latest figures mark an improvement from the first bulletin of 2024, January\u2019s snow event was not enough to create seasonal conditions, never mind make up the gap from the previous survey. The Jan. 1 figures showed snowpack levels below 44 per cent.</p><p>All basins (minus the Northwest with no data available) are below norms with the Stikine (minus 10 per cent) closest to the norm. The Okanagan (minus 14 per cent) and the South Thompson (minus 19 per cent) also recorded snowpacks above 80 per cent of normal.</p><p>The gaps in the snowpack are especially pronounced in B.C. \u2019s most populated parts. Vancouver Island is 70 below normal, while the South Coast is down 59 per cent from normal.</p><p>The Skagit basin at the border between the Fraser Valley and the Similkameen is at 100 per cent below normal. Overall, nine snow stations measured all-time lows for their period of record.</p><p>A historical look back underscores the widespread lack of snow. Last year, on Feb. 1, the average of all snow stations in British Columbia was 79 per cent of normal, compared to 61 per cent on Feb. 1, 2024.</p><p>\u201cSnow basin indices are much lower this year compared to 2023 due to very dry and warm conditions through the snow accumulation season,\u201d it reads.</p><p>Looking ahead, the report speaks of \u201cvery high likelihood (60 to 100 per cent chance)\u201d of above normal temperatures across all of B.C. over the February through April period to prevailing climatic conditions, including the current El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon.</p><p>Speaking Thursday morning at an unrelated event, Premier David Eby said he is really worried about the summer ahead.</p><p>\u201cThe weather that we are having is so unpredictable and so extreme right now, that the economic\u2026and human impacts in our province, feel so much more acute,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the early warning sign for the rest of Canada with what is coming with climate change.\u201d</p><p>He added preparations for the summer continue. They include implementing recommendations emerging from the wildfire task force appointed last year, he added. B.C. will also look to the federal government for continued support around military resources, he said, adding that B.C. will also do what it can to support other jurisdictions.</p><p>\u201cWe know they help us when we are in our forest fire season as well and we do what we can to help each other out in this remarkable time we live in,\u201d he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BURNSL-news20240214PPMA0004194297</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BURNSL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BBC-86R1-F0HF-808R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438230</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"552\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Alberta has been battling multiple severe fires since early May and there are still 63 fires burning, 18 of them out of control.<br/><br/> The Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported that as of Friday afternoon, there were 324 fires burning across the country, and 167 are considered out of control. That includes the Tantallon fire near Halifax that has destroyed or damaged 151 homes so far. <br/><br/> That's a big jump from Thursday, when the agency reported 209 fires, with 87 out of control.<br/><br/> Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said Friday that cooler weather is expected in Western Canada and rain in Nova Scotia, which will help. But the severe fire warnings are likely to continue in most provinces for another four to five weeks at least.<br/><br/> \"The situation remains severe across the country,\" Blair said. \"We are hopeful that the improving weather conditions and that rain will assist in the firefighting efforts, but there's still a great deal of work that needs to be done.\"<br/><br/> More than 27,000 square kilometres of land has burned in Canada over the last two months, more than 10 times the average amount of land burned by fires over the last decade.<br/><br/> Thus far, more than 96 per cent of the burned land was in Western Canada and Northwest Territories, but last weekend the situation became more severe in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and now parts of Ontario and Quebec are also burning.<br/><br/> \"There are a number of very significant - over 100 wildfires - that have now popped up in Quebec and some of them are out of control and quite serious,\" Blair said.<br/><br/> The Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre database added 113 fires in Quebec since Thursday, and 76 of them are classified as being out of control.<br/><br/> The Canadian Armed Forces deployed several hundred troops to Alberta to help in May and is training more to help in Nova Scotia now, Blair said. The military and the Canadian Coast Guard is also helping with equipment, he said.<br/><br/> The number of fires, their size and severity, as well as the number of places affected are straining Canada's resources, so the Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre has requested help from international partners.<br/><br/> Since the season began, 443 firefighters and other workers from Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. have flown to Canada to help, mostly in Alberta. Some have gone to Northwest Territories and a small number have landed in Nova Scotia.<br/><br/> Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. are all sending more firefighters in the coming days, Blair said. Most are again heading to Alberta, but some will fly to Nova Scotia. As well, six water bombers from Montana are expected to arrive in Nova Scotia to help on Friday and Saturday, after getting clearance to use the airstrip at Canadian Armed Forces Base Greenwood.<br/><br/> The South African High Commission in Ottawa said Friday 200 firefighters and 15 managers would leave South Africa Saturday, and they are heading to Alberta for 35 days.

Although this is a necessary and difficult task, during heavy forest fire season these resources could be better used for fighting more dangerous and potentially immense forest fires.</p><p>Helicopters may be used with buckets or belly tanks and other uses. And the skill to do these tasks is similar to military tasks.</p><p>A very experienced pilot who also flew water bombers in B.C. for 10 years, Peter Lauren has tried to convince the federal and provincial government to implement this idea for many years. The governments have given him little or no response.</p><p>Understandably it will not be easy to accomplish this. The military will be reluctant because they are heavily tasked, understaffed and underfunded.</p><p>The federal government will be reluctant because forests are a provincial responsibility, and the provinces are often reluctant to ask for support from the federal government. But perhaps this could be accomplished to work smoothly through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>In order to convince governments to do this, the public has to contact many politicians and offi-cials to show support for an idea that is overdue for implementation. As many people as possible have to contact public servants and tell them to get this done.</p><p>Contact your MP, your MLA, the Minister of Forests, Public Safety communicatiosn via email at communications@ps-sp.</p><p>gc.ca, fill out the Natural Resources contact form at contact-contactez.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca, email the Minister of National Defence <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:DND_MND@forces.gc.ca\">DND_MND@forces.gc.ca</email>, and even the Prime Minister\u2019s contact form at pm.gc.ca/en/connect/contact.</p><p>If we all get together, we can convince our governments to work together a little more to be more efficient and effective.</p><p>Fred Trudell and Peter Lauren Speak up!

(\"Sleep Country\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: ZZZ), Canada's leading specialty sleep retailer, is pleased to announce a partnership with veritree a climate tech enterprise that plants trees around the world in an effort to mitigate climate change. Through this partnership, they aim to plant over 150,000 trees this year in Canadian forests that have been devastated by recent wildfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For every Green Glove Delivery service that Sleep Country provides, veritree will plant one tree in British Columbia, where Sleep Country sources the wood for its box springs, with plans to reforest in Quebec in the future. The Green Glove Delivery service is an eco-friendly option that recycles old mattresses and packaging materials, reducing landfill waste and greenhouse gas emissions. 150,000 trees are equal to 75 hectares (185 acres), equivalent to the area of 140 football fields. Once matured, these trees will sequester an average of 137,700 metric tons of carbon dioxide, comparable to removing nearly 35,000 gasoline-powered cars from the road for one year.</p><p>\"Sleep Country is committed to supporting the environment and the communities we serve. By partnering with veritree, we are not only helping our customers sleep better but also contributing to the restoration and preservation of our natural resources,\" saidStewart Schaefer, President and CEO, Sleep Country. \"We'll continue to collaborate with organizations like veritree to implement innovative solutions to reduce our carbon footprint while also supporting the communities through which this partnership is reforesting.

Veritree ensures that every tree planted is verified, measured, and monitored, and that the local communities benefit from the social and economic impacts of reforestation.

They will be taken to Pessamit, an Innu community southwest of Baie-Comeau.</p><p>Two fires are burning near Sept-\u00celes, which has a population of just over 25,000. One of those fires progressed quickly overnight, said Isabelle Gariepy, a spokeswoman for Quebec's forest fire prevention organization, known as SOPFEU.</p><p>Beaupr\u00e9 said the fire's rapid growth wasn't anticipated. \"Last night, according to the latest information, it was not going in that direction, but the fire has progressed a lot,\" Beaupr\u00e9 said in justifying the evacuation order. \"There could be a junction between the two fires that are currently active.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, another out-of-control forest fire in northern Quebec forced the evacuation of about 500 homes in Chapais, east of Chibougamau.</p><p>Chapais Mayor Isabelle Lessard said Friday would be decisive in determining whether residents could return home, and she warned that even without visible signs of fire, there can still be danger.</p><p>\"It remains an invisible enemy,\" Lessard told a briefing on Friday. \"We don't currently see the fire from the city, we don't see any smoke either, but ... it's still there, it's still big, it's still out of control.\"</p><p>Late Friday, Public Security Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bonnardel confirmed on Twitter that he has asked Ottawa for Canadian Armed Forces assistance to deal with the forest fires in Quebec.</p><p>Federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair acknowledged the request and said Ottawa was working to identify the \"appropriate federal resources.\"</p><p>Quebec has also sought firefighting help from other countries, notably the United States, Portugal and Mexico, said Natural Resources and Forestry Minister Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Blanchette V\u00e9zina.</p><p>About 400 firefighters with the province's forest fire prevention organization are deployed, and the province's civil security department is fully mobilized. </p><p>According to SOPFEU, there were 119 active fires in the province as of Friday afternoon, a figure that has been continuously in flux due to the hot, dry temperatures enveloping the province.</p><p>Earlier, Bonnardel said about 20 fires have been deemed priorities to protect homes and Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec infrastructure.</p><p>Bonnardel said about 10,000 people are affected by the evacuation order on Quebec's north shore and 1,000 in Chapais.</p><p>The province's Natural Resources and Public Security departments issued a notice Thursday asking people to avoid travelling in forests as much as possible due to the high fire risk. Earlier this week, authorities issued a ban on fires in or near forests across the province.</p><p>Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault on Friday urged people to follow the advice of authorities. \"I'm asking all Quebecers not to go into forests, and if you're asked to evacuate to follow that guidance,\" he told reporters.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 2, 2023.</p><p>Note to readers: This is a corrected story.

We need to have more resources available to react quickly and effectively.<br/><br/> And Canada's military has helicopters that are being used mostly to prepare for war. Although this is a necessary and difficult task, during heavy forest fire season these resources could be better used for fighting the more dangerous and potentially immense forest fires. </p><p><br/><br/> Helicopters may be used with buckets or belly tanks and other uses. The skill to do these tasks is similar to military tasks.<br/><br/> A very experienced pilot who also flew water bombers in B.C. for 10 years, Peter Lauren has tried to convince the federal and provincial government to implement this idea for many years. The governments have given him little or no response. <br/><br/> Understandably it will not be easy to accomplish this. The military will be reluctant because they are heavily tasked, understaffed and underfunded. <br/><br/> The federal government will be reluctant because forests are a provincial responsibility. And the provinces are often reluctant to ask for support from the federal government. But perhaps this could be accomplished to work smoothly through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.<br/><br/> In order to convince the governments to do this, the public has to contact many different politicians and officials to show support for an idea that is overdue for implementation. As many people as possible have to contact public servants such as the following and tell them to get this done. <br/><br/> Contact your MPP, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, Public Safety (<url normalizedValue=\"mailto:communications@ps-sp.gc.ca\">communications@ps-sp.gc.ca</url>), federal Natural Resources (<url normalizedValue=\"https://protect-ca.mimecast.com/s/Ije-CD1j3qiLxRqCW8pHA?domain=contact-contactez.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca\">https://contact-contactez.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca</url>), the Minister of National Defence (<url normalizedValue=\"mailto:DND_MND@forces.gc.ca\">DND_MND@forces.gc.ca</url>) and the Prime Minister (<url normalizedValue=\"https://protect-ca.mimecast.com/s/S8msCE8k3qi8qQLhw-IpN?domain=pm.gc.ca\">https://pm.gc.ca/en/connect/contact</url>).<br/><br/> If we all get together, we can convince our governments to work together a little more to be more efficient and effective.<br/><br/> Fred Trudell and Peter Lauren, Victoria, B.C.<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2023060168053409</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68C6-SV01-JDV5-F1R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"332\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario) Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 1, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Rotorcraft</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDI1Rjc4RTRCNEEyNEFEMjlCMTVGODg5OTg3NTZFQzE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkEyRTREQTdBRjkzNDE5OTk4ODAzMEY5MDkzRjlGRTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

Surprisingly, not all of them involve tragedy or loss. Brendan Grant, the outgoing chief of Pass Lake's volunteer department, said he recalls the time his crew was called to a forest fire nearby Sleeping Giant Provincial Park. </p><p>\"It turns out there wasn't really a fire \u2014 it was just the glow of the sun setting on Lake Superior,\" Grant said with a chuckle on Thursday. Grant, who has been chief for nine of the 18 years he's put in at the fire department, is candid about why he's decided to retire: he's burned out, no pun intended. \"When I joined I was still in my 20s and had all this enthusiasm to get involved with my community,\" he said. \"But I'm at the point now where I just don't want to go out on emergency calls anymore.\" Grant, who has a farm to run, said he'll keep his firefighting gear at the Pass Lake fire hall for a bit longer in case he's needed in a major emergency. The Pass Lake department \u2014 one of nearly 50 volunteer fire departments across the North not affiliated with a municipality \u2014 responds to up to 60 calls a year. A dozen volunteer members are trained to respond to chimney fires, medical emergencies and vehicle crashes. More than half of the time, volunteer firefighters are the first on the scene when someone calls for help in Pass Lake. A fire truck and firefighting gear are provided by the Ontario Fire Marshal, which oversees independent, rural fire departments like the one in Pass Lake. Grant said the training becomes more onerous every year. Volunteers don't have to pay for a 10-day training stint away from home, but they often have to give up some vacation time to do so, Grant noted. One area that has improved in the last five years or so, Grant said, is a recognition that like their professional counterparts, volunteer firefighters can experience post traumatic stress. That's not unusual when calls involve death or serious injuries. Unlike when Grant started, there are now agencies available, such as the charity Boots On the Ground, that can arrange for peer support after stressful calls. \"For when we come back from a call and we're all shook up,\" Grant said. Volunteer firefighters are on call 24 hours and are often exposed to a greater variety of emergencies, and more frequently, than their professional counterparts, Grant said. \"There is a high risk for PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) in this line of work,\" he said. Though Grant is departing from his role as department chief, he plans to keep a hand in firefighting, perhaps becoming a volunteer prevention officer. Many fire-related tragedies could have been prevented by the use of working smoke alarms or greater attentiveness when using cooking appliances, Grant said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-92afdb7305244db2992c933641bd86a6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B7W-NG01-DY9S-T16D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"466\"/><timeReceived>12:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 2, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Researchers will return every 10\u00a0days to retrieve footage and collect the hair.</p><p>Researchers will also analyze aromas, hoping to assess which scents might be most attractive to bears.\u00a0</p><p>For years, the researchers have relied on the smell of rancid cow blood. Bears love the stench, but the blood is often a pain for the humans involved, Fern\u00e1ndez-Bellon said.</p><p>\"Cow blood is obviously messy. There are health concerns. It's not a thing you can go round to your corner shop and buy so we are testing different attractants,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>This year, his team is trying some alternative bait options, including scent lures designed for hunting.</p><p>Cow's blood will be on the menu, but there will also be a commercial-grade fish fertilizer and bear bait, both molasses-scented and a berry mix. Researchers will also try two anise oil options that smell distinctly of licorice - one store-bought, the other homemade.</p><p>\"That's part of our work toward\u00a0fine-tuning our methods,\" Fern\u00e1ndez-Bellon said.</p><p>\"We're letting the bears have a vote and decide which one they like best.\"\u00a0</p><p>Gordon Stenhouse, a grizzly bear biologist who founded the hair-snag research project decades ago, said consistent monitoring is critical to ensuring the species can thrive.\u00a0</p><p>Habitat loss remains a threat and the province must meet its commitment to track grizzlies, he said.</p><p>\"We need to monitor because we continue to see landscape change through not only industrial development, forest harvesting and oil and gas, but also now with major forest-fire events and climate change,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>Stenhouse said the genetic database is a rare scientific asset that took years of labour and investment and should be maintained.</p><p>\"Ultimately we want to continue,\" he said. \"If we just stop, in 10 or 15 years\u00a0we'll be back to Square 1, and no one wants that.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadaedmontongrizzlybearhairdnaresearchalberta17212773</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C40-D061-JCMC-W4KM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1081\"/><timeReceived>12:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

But finding a contractor to do the work will be a challenge for most woodlot owners who hold about 90 per cent of Island forests. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThere are some clients, I really can\u2019t say when I\u2019ll get to them,\u201d said forester and contract harvester Dan Dupont of Montague. He has been in the business for more than 25 years.  </p><p>He estimates, based on rough numbers, if all the Island\u2019s harvesting crews work at full capacity over the next year or so they might harvest 30 per cent of the demand. He suspects it wouldn\u2019t make financial sense for crews from out of province to assist and they are likely occupied with post-Fiona clean-up on the mainland. </p><p>A low volume of snow over the winter increases the risk of fire spreading quickly through fallen trees. </p><p>\u201cSnowpack will push trees to the ground over the winter,\u201d Mr Dupont said. \u201cWhen they hit the ground they\u2019ll start to rot immediately rather than dry out.\u201d </p><p>He says in some respects this is a positive; there will be a slightly longer period of time to harvest fallen trees before they rot and lose value. </p><p>Jim Prime, a meteorologist with Climate Change and Environment Canada, confirmed that January through April saw less precipitation than usual on PEI and certainly less snow. As of April 30, western PEI was experiencing a moderate drought and eastern PEI was abnormally dry. </p><p>As for a long range forecast, above average temperatures are expected from May through September, Mr Prime said. But the finer details in how that plays out along with humidity and precipitation will be significant factors contributing to forest fire risk. He said it is generally too soon to say what we\u2019ll experience through the summer. Precipitation and humidity will be major factors along with fuel loads which may reduce fire risks. </p><p>Alongside private contractors, workers with the forest and wildlife division of the Department of Environment and Climate Change will be busy this summer. </p><p>Mike Montigny is the manager of field services for the division and FireSmart Canada\u2019s Prince Edward Island liaison. </p><p>He says he would absolutely hire more people with qualifications to contribute to tree clearing and harvesting work in the province if they applied. </p><p>The division is actively working to assess the most efficient and strategic way to reduce forest fire risk with the resources available, all with public safety as the main priority. </p><p>\u201cIf you drive across the Island, you can see as you get down to eastern Queens County into the southeast Kings, and then if you look at the north shore from St Peter\u2019s east, there\u2019s significant changes in landscape,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cThose are areas where we\u2019re trying to work with communities and local fire departments to help educate and get ahead of fires.\u201d </p><p>Woodlot owners can access some technical and financial support to hire a contractor through the province\u2019s forest enhancement program.  </p><p>Public can help </p><p>In addition to woodlot management there are actions every member of the public can take to avoid forest fires, Mr Montigny said.  </p><p>Following careful safety precautions when lighting and tending fires outdoors and heeding any outdoor fire restrictions are key. </p><p>As the most densely populated province in the country, it is relatively likely an out of control forest fire would threaten the safety of people and their property. Property owners can take a number of actions to prevent their house from catching in the event of a fire such as trimming grass regularly, piling firewood at least 10 metres from a house and storing combustibles at least 1.5 metres away from any houses or decks. More information can be found on FireSmart Canada\u2019s webpage. </p><p>Fires in the province are rarely if ever considered part of the Island\u2019s forests\u2019 natural life cycle, according to Mr Montigny. They are almost always caused by people. Considering the Island is so densely populated, protecting public safety will typically result in preventing significant habitat loss and conserving Island forests. </p><p>The Climate Lab at the University of Prince Edward Island has examined forest fires as a potential hazard under climate change. Results show that seeing the Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) in the \u2018extreme\u2019 and \u2018high\u2019 danger classes has become twice as common over the past 60 years, from seven to 14 days per year. </p><p>It is expected to increase an additional seven days per year over the next 60 years. </p><p>Mr Montigny says the department is always evaluating staff and equipment needs. </p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re constantly looking at our own staff and as new staff come on, we\u2019re training them and getting more capacity into this industry.\u201d </p><p>Mr Montigny couldn\u2019t say if there are more wildfire fighting staff employed now compared to the past or if the budget would be available if he were to present a need for more paid firefighters. </p><p>The province plans to rely more heavily on volunteer firefighters by providing more training and education on wildland fires. </p><p>The government has begun to replace all five wildland fire trucks and one of two tracked machines but has not indicated plans to increase its fleet of equipment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-093090e88c204b8583f37c424be58888</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CD-NB61-JBVR-32YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><timeReceived>04:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 1, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Cree Nation Government\u2019s Climate Change unit hopes to make this an annual event to develop Cree-led climate strategies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThere\u2019s no boundaries to climate change,\u201d said CNG climate change manager Olivier K\u00f6lmel. \u201cIt goes beyond the region so broader collaboration is needed for the future of the communities. The big work is yet to come, but it\u2019s exciting work.\u201d </p><p>About 150 participants came from most Cree communities, along with some First Nations in Ontario and selected representatives from provincial and federal governments and academia. The forum\u2019s three themes were community engagement, adaptation planning and climate leadership.  </p><p>The day after a spectacular solar eclipse, the conference began by taking stock of recent climate impacts and current mitigation initiatives. Last summer\u2019s wildfires sought to redefine the Cree relationship with Eeyou Istchee\u2019s forests.   </p><p>\u201cClimate adaptation asks Cree Nation members to change their way of living because of the environment,\u201d Grand Chief Mandy Gull-Masty said in her keynote speech. \u201cRegeneration is not just one season but sometimes decades. The risk is incredibly high for the upcoming fire season.\u201d </p><p>With fires impacting 60% of traplines and forcing many communities to evacuate, Gull-Masty emphasized that the climate had made them refugees. The province was vastly unprepared for the extent of damage. Gull-Masty said a province-wide approach would better support First Nations safety and potential displacements.  </p><p>Besides loss of wildlife and long-term effects on land and water, fires resulted in emissions equivalent to 140 million vehicles running year-round. While the hazardous smoke reaching New York City made international headlines, the Cree Nation will be releasing a documentary next month to illustrate its aftermath in Eeyou Istchee. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a realization everything is intertwined,\u201d said K\u00f6lmel. \u201cYou may be breathing in smoke a day or two, but the communities had it for months. We went north of Waswanipi by the Broadback to film the impacts and the camps and cabins lost.\u201d </p><p>Deputy Grand Chief Norman Wapachee moderated the forum\u2019s forest fire panel featuring CNG fire marshal Lee-Roy Blacksmith, Thomas Stevens of the Cree Trappers\u2019 Association and federal and provincial representatives. Among proposed solutions was making better use of satellite imagery.  </p><p>Blacksmith is arranging training and equipment for first responders in each community, although there are currently lodging complications in Whapmagoostui. George Cox will replace Blacksmith during his medical leave this summer.  </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve sent out a memo to local fire departments to start preparing for Fire Smart campaigns,\u201d said Blacksmith. \u201cPeople talked about southern animals like raccoons, cougars and deer coming in our region, which we never had.\u201d </p><p>The warming climate is changing the distribution of many animal and plant species. Polar bears are moving south while black bears are moving north. Eelgrass vital for migrating geese has long been declining along the coast, but appears to be increasing further north, which introduces new food-security concerns as seals come ashore less often.  </p><p>Waswanipi\u2019s delegation noted abandoned forestry roads become highways for wolves, which are predators for caribou and moose. They propose restoring them with deciduous trees, which are natural habitat for species like moose and beaver while being more fire-resistant than the conifers favoured by the forestry industry. </p><p>Recent studies suggest revising logging methods to support forest resilience and conserve old-growth areas that are critically important for slowing climate change. The Cree Nation has pushed for over 20 years to implement the Paix des Braves agreement\u2019s wildlife directives.  </p><p>\u201cIt would support more species on the ground and the balance of how the forest is being sustained,\u201d K\u00f6lmel explained. \u201cThe province was asking how to balance economic interests \u2013 priorities are not always shared. There are difficult choices to make in moments of crisis.\u201d </p><p>The forum focused on constructive initiatives to make Cree communities more resilient. Workshops discussed the adoption of electric vehicles but most agreed that necessary infrastructure is still lacking in the north. They also considered the possible benefits of climate change, such as harvesting maple syrup.  </p><p>Several communities shared inspiring developments in their greenhouse, garden and composting projects. Whitney Blacksmith said Mistissini\u2019s greenhouse will deliver affordable food while promoting agricultural education for youth. Stevens said that all local CTAs will receive community freezers, where local harvesters can store traditional food for families in need. </p><p>The Grand Chief suggested that the Cree way of life contributes to the reduction of emissions through actions that avoid processed meats and leathers. She believes the Cree Nation could create an innovative carbon credit system that could serve as a model throughout Canada. </p><p>\u201cThese activities we carry out as Indigenous people are good carbon offsets,\u201d Gull-Masty asserted. \u201cI\u2019d like to see your ideas. When you\u2019re doing traditional activities, ask yourself, \u2018What is my contribution to reducing emissions?\u2019\u201d </p><p>The CNG collaborates with research institutions to establish eddy co-variance towers uniquely designed for the territory. This new environmental monitoring technology measures water evaporation and greenhouse gases absorbed or emitted throughout the year \u2013 useful for calculating carbon credits.  </p><p>A declaration was drafted on the forum\u2019s final day, titled Wanishkaakwh or \u201cWake Up!\u201d It set the tone for a permanent regional advisory committee on climate change and the direction for each community. </p><p>\u201cCree ancestors always found ways to adapt to changes in the environment and thrive in these conditions,\u201d said K\u00f6lmel. \u201cThe overall message is one of hope and working together to face the oncoming challenges.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-dcd84ec6a4f54c58a501d8e09d5f942e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C04-R1K1-DY9S-T0YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1036\"/><timeReceived>01:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 7, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As another difficult wildfire season is underway, the Governments of Canada and Manitoba will support Canadians and Manitobans threatened by wildfires while strengthening our ability to adapt to a changing climate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the Honourable Harjit Sajjan, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada, Minister of Emergency Preparedness and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada, was joined by the Honourable Dan Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs, on behalf of the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, to make an announcement with the Honourable Jamie Moses, Manitoba Minister of Economic Development, Investment, Trade and Natural Resources, to jointly invest $38.4 million over four years underthe Government of Canada's Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate Program   Equipment Fund (FMWCC)to support Manitoba's efforts to purchase wildland firefighting equipment to enhance provincial readiness and capacity to prepare for and respond to wildland fires.</p><p>Funding announced today will help Manitoba purchase and upgrade firefighting equipment to increase wildland fire preparedness and response efforts, improve safety for communities and firefighters alike, and strengthen capacities and capabilities for resource exchange across Canada. In addition, the funding will support the purchase of additional training equipment and materials to improve training and increase the number of skilled wildland firefighters and other staff.</p><p>Keeping Canadians safe and healthy is the government's top priority. Working together with provinces, territories, Indigenous communities and international allies, the federal government continues to address and support the fight against wildfires whilecombatting the effects of climate change while ensuring public safety and protecting homes, livelihoods and lives.</p><p> Quotes</p><p>\"After experiencing the most destructive forest fire season in our nation's history in 2023, Canadians across the country are witnessing another spring of intense, early wildfires. The federal government is urgently working to respond to these fires by providing provinces, territories and partners with the support they need to meet the needs of Canadians where and when wildfires occur. Today's announcement with the Government of Manitoba underscores our commitment to continue working with provinces and territories to bolster the procurement of life-saving equipment and personnel through theFMWCC. Through tangible and fast-flowing funding, the Government of Canada is helping firefighters respond to the current wildfire season and prepare for a future where the impact of climate change on the severity of wildfires is increasingly obvious.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jonathan WilkinsonMinister of Energy and Natural Resources</p><p>\"As we face another intense wildfire season, it's crucial that firefighters have the equipment and training they need to respond safely, quickly and effectively. This funding will help purchase critical equipment, upgrade existing resources and enhance training for firefighters, ensuring we're better equipped to protect communities and respond to the increasing threat of wildfires.\"</p><p>The Honourable Harjit SajjanPresident of the King's Privy Council for Canada Minister of Emergency Preparedness Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada</p><p>\"As we continue to see an increase in the severity of wildfires across the Prairies and North, protecting the health and safety of impacted communities is our government's top priority. Today's announcement with Manitoba will deliver necessary resources to mitigate the impacts of wildfires across the province while strengthening partnerships with provinces, territories and Indigenous communities to deliver solutions that will help keep communities safe.\"</p><p>The Honourable Dan VandalMinister of Northern Affairs</p><p>\"Ensuring the proper resources are available to our Wildfire Service is critical, as we can see right now in Manitoba. This investment will strengthen our ability to respond to these natural disasters that are increasingly more common. Our government will always prioritize the safety of Manitobans, and we are pleased to see this timely support from the federal government that will bolster our ability to fight these wildfires.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jamie MosesManitoba Minister of Economic Development, Investment, Trade and Natural Resources</p><p> Quick FactsBoth Canada and Manitoba are proving $19.2 million through a contribution agreement under the FMWCC   Equipment Fund.The FMWCC was launched in 2022 to support provinces and territories in strengthening fire management capacities and capabilities across the country by facilitating the purchase of wildland firefighting equipment, such as fire crew trucks and personal protective equipment, to increase capacity to respond to wildland fires.The Government of Canada is working with communities and organizations affected by wildfires to better understand the unique role the federal government plays in serving these communities; to offer nationally recognized equipment to support all firefighters to be better equipped to respond to wildland fires; and to support a more sustainable approach to training, employment and all hazards management in Indigenous communities and beyond.Under NRCan's FMWCC   Equipment Fund, provinces and territories can cost-share investments with the Government of Canada for equipment, such as vehicles, mobile units, avionics upgrades (parts), hoses, pumps, enhanced communications equipment, the repair of aging equipment and training.Related productsBoth Canada and Manitoba are proving $19.2 million through a contribution agreement under the FMWCC   Equipment Fund.The FMWCC was launched in 2022 to support provinces and territories in strengthening fire management capacities and capabilities across the country by facilitating the purchase of wildland firefighting equipment, such as fire crew trucks and personal protective equipment, to increase capacity to respond to wildland fires.The Government of Canada is working with communities and organizations affected by wildfires to better understand the unique role the federal government plays in serving these communities;

Carl Trepels said that this week the Coastal Fire Centre &amp;#x26;#8211; part of the BC Wildfire Service &amp;#x26;#8211; determined that the forest fire risk for most of the South Island is now 'extreme.' After three consecutive days of that rating, altered protocols are implemented for firefighters responding to calls and extra equipment is automatically sent to any wildland fires as they're more likely to spread when it's hot and dry.</p><p>READ ALSO: Chuck that cigarette butt, and face a fine</p><p>The increased response requires more resources so the community \"needs to be really diligent\" about not starting fires, Trepels explained.</p><p>He added that a complete burning ban has been in effect for some time now, but firefighters across the Island are reminding residents to be on alert. Smokers are reminded to extinguish their burning materials with water, drivers are asked to avoid parking on dry grass and anyone who spots smoke or fire is asked to call 911 immediately.</p><p>READ ALSO: Rural Saanich residents urged to take preventative steps ahead of wildfire season</p><p>He added that burning items like cigarette butts dropped in dry grass or mulch can smoulder for several hours if not doused in water and can spark fires long after being discarded &amp;#x26;#8211; which is why tossing a burning butt from a car window, for example, can lead to hefty fines.</p><p>According to Saanich police Const. Markus Anastasiades, someone caught doing so may be issued either an $81 fine under the Motor Vehicle Act for littering or a $575 fine in accordance with the B.C. Wildfire Act for the mishandling of a burning substance near a forested or grassy area.</p><p>For fire prevention tips and advice for protecting homes and other structures, check out the FireSmart Home Owners Manual &amp;#x26;#8211; available for free on the Government of B.C. website &amp;#x26;#8211; or contact the Saanich Fire Department at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fireprevention@saanich.ca\">fireprevention@saanich.ca</email> or 250-475-5500.</p><p>READ ALSO: Victoria airport sees driest Sept. 8 in 67 years</p><p>@devonscarlettLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:devon.bidal@saanichnews.com\">devon.bidal@saanichnews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SANNWS-4047822</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TP-8531-JDH1-C05M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438250</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Saanich News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 11, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLQ6</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE MATERIALS &amp; PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOA4</classCode><className>WEATHER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp; VIDEO SHARING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009T9T</classCode><className>SMOKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX002188</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION LAW</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp; VIDEO SHARING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX002188</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION LAW</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Boozman College of Public Health projected a daily average of 1,039 new cases over the next week. The model also predicted an average increase of 169 new cases per day in children under the age of 17.</p><p>Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The state also has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated.</p><p>\u201cCOVID is no longer smouldering. It has broken out into a raging forest fire that will grow in size and strength,\" according to the UAMS forecast. \u201cWe cannot stand still. We must act to reduce the consequences of this new surge to the extent possible.\"</p><p>The state's cases on Tuesday increased by 1,875 to 367,007 total since the pandemic began, the Department of Health said.</p><p>Dr. Jose Romero, the state's health secretary, said he was concerned about the possibility of a \u201csurge on top of this surge\" when school begins this fall. Laws enacted this year prevent schools from mandating face masks or from requiring students and teachers to be vaccinated.</p><p>\u201cI expect to see this year significant outbreaks within the school system,\" Romero said during a virtual discussion on vaccine hesitancy held by U.S. News &amp; World Report. \u201cWhat\u2019s already telling me that\u2019s going to happen are the number of day care closures that have occurred because of outbreaks occurring, and camp exposures and closures occurring.\"</p><p>Romero said the key to combatting those outbreaks will be parents stressing the importance of wearing masks.</p><p>Dr. Bechara Choucair, the White House's vaccinations co-ordinator, visited Arkansas on Tuesday to meet with Romero, hospital leaders and other health officials. Choucair said the medical community will play the key role in countering misinformation that has fueled vaccine hesitancy in places like Arkansas.</p><p>\u201cTo be able to counter all of this misinformation with facts, with answers to people's most commonly asked questions, the opportunity for people to talk to their doctors to make sure they have the credible, scientific information is going to be really critical to help us deal with this level of misinformation that we're seeing,\" he said.</p><p>Gov. Asa Hutchinson earlier this month began holding town halls around the state aimed at addressing people who have so far resisted getting vaccinated, and he planned more of the forums next week.</p><p>The state's virus hospitalizations on Tuesday increased by 28 to 815, with 313 in intensive care and 131 on ventilators. UAMS Chancellor Dr. Cam Patterson said the increases are straining hospital resources.</p><p>\u201cOur staffing is really stretched thin at this point,\" Patterson said. \u201cIt's not a matter of finding beds, it's a matter of finding people to take care of patients, whether they're COVID-19 positive or not.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-3b1adb89c919596f4a763140b1fe0b13</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6366-KYY1-DY9S-T1Y7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"521\"/><timeReceived>08:53 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 20, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It said the fire is dangerous and residents should prepare to leave at short notice.</p><p>Information posted Monday by the BC Wildfire Service said nine wildfires had started in the province in the previous 24 hours.</p><p>Officials have worried this year\u2019s wildfire season could be a challenging one, with much of the province continuing to experience significant drought.</p><p>Parker said those in his region, like much of the province, have been worried about the lack of snowpack which is at record lows in B.C. \u201cAnd then we just have had limited, limited amounts of precipitation in the last month,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo, that dry grass season, it\u2019s even drier than it normally would be. It\u2019s always a threat, and we\u2019ve always dealt with some grass fires during the early spring season, but this year they seem to be a lot more volatile, just from the dry conditions.\u201d</p><p>Last year\u2019s B.C. wildfire season saw more than 28,400 square kilometres of forest and land burned, hundreds of homes destroyed and tens of thousands of people forced to evacuate. Canada\u2019s 2023 wildfire season was the most destructive ever recorded, with the Interagency Forest Fire Centre reporting 18.5 million hectares of land was burned Langan, who lives on a remote property in the Cariboo alert zone with her daughters, says their nearest permanent neighbour is 15 kilometres away. Her property is powered by a generator.</p><p>\u201cAt times, there was a lot of smoke and you couldn\u2019t see where the fire actually was. The wind changed directions and at times the smoke would drift here over the ranch and you could definitely smell it,\u201d said Langan, whose ranch is at the north end of Ben Lake.</p><p>She said she had been watching helicopters fly over her house on their way to the fire.</p><p>Cariboo Regional District had called her to alert her about the fire, which she said was nice, but she said she had no plans to leave immediately and hadn\u2019t packed. She described herself as a \u201ccalm person.\u201d</p><p>Seeing wildfires up close isn\u2019t new to Langan, who worked with neighbours to put out wild fires in 2017.</p><p>\u201cOne of the local contractors brought over a dozer and helped with that. At that time, when they later on issued an evacuation order, nobody left because we knew that the only ones who were gonna save our homes were us,\u201d said Langan.</p><p>In northern Alberta, residents of Saprae Creek Estates, a hamlet near Fort McMurray, were told Sunday to prepare themselves for a possible evacuation RCMP asked on Monday members of the public to immediately stop flying drones over the fire, or risk charges. \u201cThis behaviour is a major public safety concern as helicopters are a key element to combating these fires and keeping them under control,\u201d Mounties said in a news release.</p><p>Another alert was issued in Alberta on Monday for the rural subdivision of Bilby Common in Lac Ste. Anne County, west of Edmonton, but it has since been rescinded.</p><p>CARIBOO, B.C.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20240424PTEA0004336238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BWB-P001-F0HF-81X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

(AP) \u2014 Damage assessment teams went out Saturday to determine how many buildings have burned in a forest fire that has displaced thousands of residents in Northern California. </p><p>Firefighters working in steep, drought-stricken terrain hope calmer weather over the next few days will help as they battle the Fawn Fire north of the city of Redding. </p><p>A fire update said winds were easing and temperatures were dropping, with rain expected to start Monday. </p><p>Initial assessments found that at least 100 homes and other structures had burned, officials said. But that number was likely to change as teams go street by street surveying the destruction in the Mountain Gate area. </p><p>Authorities have arrested a 30-year-old woman on suspicion of starting the blaze that erupted Wednesday and grew explosively in hot and gusty weather in the region about 200 miles (322 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco. </p><p>Alexandra Souverneva was charged Friday with felony arson to wildland with an enhancement because of a declared state of emergency in California, Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said. </p><p>The Palo Alto woman also is being investigated to see if she's started other fires in Shasta County and throughout the state, Bridgett said. It wasn\u2019t immediately known if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf.</p><p>The Fawn Fire has charred nearly 12 square miles (31 square kilometers) of heavy timber and was 10% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</p><p>Nearly 2,000 residents were under mandatory evacuation orders and an additional 7,400 were warned to be ready to leave if necessary, the California Highway Patrol said.</p><p>It's the latest destructive blaze to send Californians fleeing this year. Fires have burned more than 3,600 square miles (9,324 square kilometers) so far in 2021, destroying more than 3,200 homes, commercial properties and other structures.</p><p>Those fires include a pair of big forest blazes that have been burning for more than two weeks in the heart of giant sequoia country on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. More than 1,700 firefighters battled the KNP Complex Fires, which covered nearly 66 square miles (171 square kilometers) by Saturday.</p><p>A historic drought in the American West tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. It has killed millions of trees in California alone. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-2662a95697b7e1bfe0bb9bc10b596271</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63PG-R2K1-JBVR-3025-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"427\"/><timeReceived>01:04 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 25, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Smoke plumes from forest fires in Quebec and northeastern Ontario will continue to affect the area, resulting in deteriorated air quality. Conditions are expected to improve for some areas Tuesday night or Wednesday.<br/><br/> According to the statement, issued at 4:16 p.m. on Saturday, June 24 and ending at 5:51 for South River - Burk's Falls before being  re-issued at 7:01 a.m. and updated at 3:31 p.m. on June 27, high levels of air pollution are expected today and Wednesday due to smoke from forest fires. Smoke plumes from forest fires over northeastern Ontario and Quebec will move into the area this afternoon or tonight, resulting in deteriorated air quality. Conditions are expected to improve for some areas on Thursday.<br/><br/> Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerable from hour to hour. <br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.<br/><br/> For more details, please consult canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html.<br/><br/> Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.<br/><br/> People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.<br/><br/> Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.<br/><br/> Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.<br/><br/> If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.<br/><br/> If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.<br/><br/> Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.<br/><br/> Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.<br/><br/> If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA.<br/><br/> Visit airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.<br/><br/> Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for Almaguin, and here for North Bay - West Nipissing areas. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023062768319080</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K0-0KK1-F197-51P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 (NEW: JULY 29, 2024) Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95

The site and cost of the building are not yet known.</p><p>\u201cThis centre will ensure that we have people with the skills that we need to respond to this evolving threat in British Columbia,\u201d Eby said.</p><p>Ralston said the facility will attract students from around B.C. , Canada, and the world.</p><p>\u201cThompson Rivers University and Kamloops are a perfect training ground for people interested in wildland fire fighting,\u201d he said, noting it is home to the Kamloops Fire Centre, which covers the southern portion of the province, and is the wildfire service\u2019s provincial headquarters.</p><p>Ralston said the centre also enhances BC Wildfire Services\u2019 training capacities. BCWS, meanwhile, will transition some of its existing training programs and courses into the centre at TRU, and will eventually offer more than 1,000 workshops per year by 2028\u20132029, translating into 10,000 course registrations, Ralston added.</p><p>The centre is among what Eby called the \u201cflagship recommendations\u201d of the Premier\u2019s Task Force on Emergencies, which was established after last year\u2019s record-setting wildfire season, which affected 2.84 million hectares and destroyed or partially damaged 600 residences.</p><p>Almost 49,000 British Columbians received evacuation orders and 137,000 received evacuation alerts, while six firefighters lost their lives.</p><p>Overall, the task force made 31 recommendations organized around key themes, which were released on April 4. They include enhancing the use of current and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence; expanding wildfire training and prevention programs; better planning for the incorporation of local resources in responding to wildfires; and modernized and enhanced delivery of emergency support services, including post-wildfire support.</p><p>The province has already announced the implementation of several of the task force recommendations, with funding for them already in this year\u2019s budget. They include hiring more firefighters, including more from rural and remote regions of the province; expanding the available fleet of fixed-wing-aircraft and helicopters; and purchasing additional equipment, along with other measures designed to improve prevention of fires.</p><p>Other key recommendations from the task force were improving the integration of rural and municipal fire departments into BCWS response to wildfire urban interfaces; strengthening community participation in the FireSmart program; recognizing the value of, and applying, local and Indigenous knowledge; and defining clear pathways for organized and trained local people to play a role in wildfire preparedness and response.</p><p>\u201cLocal people with working knowledge of the land can play a role in partnership-based wildfire response,\u201d said the task force\u2019s recommendation about local response. \u201cSafety is paramount, and the work begins well before the season with organizing, training, and preparing, based on a foundation of communication, cooperation, and trust.\u201d</p><p>The task force also recommended clarifying, streamlining, and strengthening guidance, roles, and responsibilities for initial response for newly detected fires based on a \u201cnearest qualified crew\u201d principal.</p><p>\u201cThere is an opportunity to leverage partnerships to strengthen initial response capabilities by enabling trained and qualified firefighters from provincial agencies, First Nations, and local fire departments, and appropriately trained forestry contractors, to contribute to initial response.\u201d</p><p>Eby also stressed that B.C. will have the financial resources as the wildfire season unfolds.</p><p>The announcement on April 4 came as the province prepares for what officials say could be a challenging fire season, a point underscored by a wildfire deemed to be out of control burning south of Kamloops near Merritt on the day of the announcement.</p><p>Eby used his opening remarks to underscore the seriousness of the situation facing the province.</p><p>\u201cIn the the last three, we have seen two of the worst forest fire seasons our province has seen, and the trend is clear and profoundly concerning,\u201d he noted.</p><p>\u201cThe snowpack is much lower than normal, many parts of the province are at the highest level of drought, and the fire threat is very profound.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASHCCJ-news20240411PPIA0004310717</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASHCCJ2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BSF-DPN1-F0HF-8094-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"844\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 (NEW: JULY 29, 2024) Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95

Wildfires in Canada are increasingly large-scale events and threaten the health, safety, and economic stability of Canadians.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Minister Harjit S. Sajjan, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness, with Parliamentary Secretary, Sherry Romanado, Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, and Minister Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Minister responsible for Parks Canada, convened to share with Canadians the latest assessment of the 2024 wildfire season and the state of federal preparedness.</p><p>Environment and Climate Change Canada's (ECCC) meteorologists continue to predict weather conditions for spring and summer 2024 that could lead to greater wildfire risks. As we can expect with climate change, most parts of Canada have experienced warmer and drier spring conditions so far, with the added influence this year of El Ni\u00f1o. Drought conditions are expected to persist in high-risk regions in May, including the southern regions of the prairie and western provinces. ECCC is forecasting continued above-normal temperatures nationwide for the spring and summer period. Such conditions exacerbate the risk and intensity of both natural and human-caused wildfires.</p><p>In addition, Minister Sajjan highlighted efforts to bolster response capabilities for the 2024 wildfire season under the Humanitarian Workforce Program (HWF).</p><p>This initiative will test and strengthen the capabilities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) including Canadian Red Cross, St. John Ambulance, The Salvation Army, and the Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada (SARVAC) to ensure they can mobilize and rapidly deploy emergency responders and relief supplies to support Canadians in times of need. The initiative will focus on the needs of at-risk communities, with an initial focus on British Columbia and Northwest Territories.</p><p>Additionally, Minister Sajjan announced today the intention to work towards including the veteran-led humanitarian NGO, Team Rubicon, inthe HWF program to increase the program's urgent response capacity.</p><p>Building from lessons learned during the 2023 wildfire season, Public Safety Canada is working closely with the NGOs funded under the HWF program and provincial and territorial governments to identify needs and establish innovative ways to facilitate the rapid deployment of resources and respond to an emergency. As part of this initiative, NGOs will carry out activities which could help reduce response time and enhance planning and training that will include local organizations.</p><p>To counter the growing threat of wildfires in Canada, the federal government will continue to support provinces and territories in wildfire mitigation, response, and monitoring. Today, NRCan announced up to $1.2 million for the Canadian Interagency Forest Centreto expand the Centre's wildfire prevention and mitigation capacity. This investment will also enhance and expand the adoption of FireSmart Canada, a program funded through the Wildfire Resilient Futures Initiative(WRFI), in collaboration with provinces and territories. The WRFI invests in new programs and activities to reduce wildland fire risk in our communities and landscapes.</p><p>Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) are working with partners to help people in Canada manage the health risks from wildfires. This includes providing information and public health guidance relating to air pollution created by wildfire smoke, what to do if wildfires are occurring along with extreme heat, and the mental health impacts that may result from wildfires. For example, during wildfire smoke events, the Air Quality Health Index(AQHI) reports on air quality on a scale from 1 to 10+ and provides relevant health messages to help people make informed decisions to protect their health and the health of their loved ones.</p><p>In addition, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada are working alongside jurisdictions to provide technical expertise, health guidance, air quality monitoring assistance, and advice for establishing cleaner air spaces when air quality is poor. The Public Health Agency of Canada also stands ready to support impacted jurisdictions upon request, with the delivery of essential medical equipment and supplies through the National Emergency Strategic Stockpile (NESS) and public health-related assistance during evacuations.</p><p>Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) continues to work alongside First Nations to support the health, safety and well-being of their communities. As announced in Budget 2024, ISC proposes to allocate $57.2 million over five years to renew and expand ISC's FireSmart program to directly support First Nation communities and other eligible recipients with resources and preventative measures, especially those located in high-risk areas. We are also doing things differently this year by offering advance payments to all communities so they can prepare earlier and incorporate traditional knowledge in our strategies. We are also going forward with a pilot project in Alberta to fund Emergency Management Coordinators in all 48 communities.</p><p>We all have a part in preparing for the potential impact of wildfires in our communities. The Government of Canada, like our emergency management partners in all levels of government, non-government organizations, Indigenous Leaders and the private sector, has heightened our awareness of the risks and has taken steps to increase our preparedness. Our focus is on the health, safety and security of Canadians. We are making sure we have the capacity to support provinces and territories and mobilize resources when they are needed for the 2024 wildfire season.</p><p> Quotes</p><p>\"Our climate is changing and with every passing year, we experience more extreme weather events. Now, more than ever, we need greater collaboration among us. The Emergency Preparedness Week theme of Be Prepared. Know your risks.applies to all of us, as individuals, communities, and organizations. I can assure Canadians that even as climate change affects the world around us, we are adapting and working together so we can respond to whatever happens. I am pleased to be working with colleagues in national emergency management NGOs to improve our readiness to respond across the country. Together, we will continue to adapt and reinforce the emergency response system.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada, Minister of Emergency Preparedness and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada</p><p>\"Last year, Canadians experienced the most destructive forest fire season in our nation's history, and we know that climate change has been a root cause of their increased frequency and intensity. The federal government has been urgently working to prepare Canada for wildfires in 2024, including through an announcement today of $1.2 million in funding via the Wildfire Resilient Futures Initiative for the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre to expand the adoption of FireSmart. This investment buildson hundreds of millions of dollars we have invested in the past two years towards equipment and training for firefighters. Since last year alone, $22.5 million has flowed through the Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate (FMWCC) program to British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, the Northwest Territories and Yukon, and this is just the beginning of our work with provinces and territories to bolster procurement of lifesaving equipment and personnel through the FMWCC and FireSmart programs. By working with partners across the country, we are building skills, supporting scientific research, and helping firefighters prepare not only for the 2024 season, but for a future where the impact of climate change on the severity of wildfires is increasingly obvious.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources</p><p>\"The prospect of another active wildfire season simply drives the point home: we must take more action to combat and mitigate climate change and adapt to its very real and costly impacts. This is not a future problem. It is here now. Together - Canadians, communities, Indigenous peoples, organizations, utilities, businesses and governments - have the opportunity to work hand in hand, to deal with the climate crisis we see unfolding right before our eyes.\"</p><p>  The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Minister responsible for Parks Canada</p><p>\"Wildfires can have significant negative impacts on our physical and mental well-being, even when they are burning thousands of kilometres away from us. So many Canadians experienced this first-hand last year, with cities across the country blanketed in hazardous smoke. With the 2024 wildfire season approaching, our government is ensuring that people in Canada have the tools and information they need to understand and manage the health risks associated with wildfires.\"</p><p>  The Honourable Mark Holland, Minister of Health Canada</p><p>\"Because of climate change, the 2023 wildfire season was the most devastating ever recorded. This season could yet again historically affect First Nations, as they are living first-hand the impacts of climate change. We have already seen a first community being evacuated in April, which is notably early in the season. We will be by First Nations' side as they prepare for, face and recover from wildfires.\"</p><p>  The Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Indigenous Services and Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario</p><p> Quick factsThe Government of Canada Wildfires 2024 web page includes information about programs, policies and initiatives to keep Canadians informed about the wildfire situation and to support provincial and territorial efforts to combat wildfires.In Canada, emergencies are managed first at the local level: hospitals, fire departments, police and municipalities. If they need assistance at the local level, they request it from their province or territory. If an emergency escalates beyond the capabilities of a province or territory, they can seek assistance from the federal government by submitting a request for federal assistance (RFA).The Government Operations Centre (GOC), on behalf of the Government of Canada, is the lead for federal response coordination for emergency events affecting the national interest. The GOC has activated a wildfires response team to level 1: enhanced reporting. The GOC works in close collaboration with federal organizations, non-governmental organizations and provincial emergency management partners to:Coordinate whole of government response and preparedness.Provide 24/7 information on a wide range of risks that could affect the safety and security of Canadians at home or abroad.Provide senior decision makers and partners with national level understanding of events so each of them can deliver on their mandate.Ensure federal readiness to respond, including interdepartmental consultation and coordination of federal assets.Parks Canada manages and responds to wildfire in national parks with nearly 200 wildland firefighters and 100 incident management specialists who are trained to respond to wildfires and can manage all elements of complex incidents. Parks Canada collaborates with other jurisdictions and can provide equipment and firefighters when help is needed across the country and internationally.To access the latest weather, forecast and alert information Canadians can download the WeatherCAN app and get notifications wherever they are in Canada.To help people in Canada adapt to climate change and extreme weather, the Government of Canada has developed the National Adaptation Strategy with provincial and territorial governments, Indigenous partners, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, adaptation experts, and youth.The National Adaptation Strategy is a whole-of-society blueprint to reduce the risk of climate-related disasters, improve health outcomes, protect nature and biodiversity, build and maintain resilient infrastructure, and support a strong economy and workers.The long-range outlook for wildland fire activity is difficult to forecast early in the season and specific fire activity cannot be predicted. Instead, seasonal forecasts help identify areas that are at increased risk. The certainty of these projections will increase as we move towards the summer months. These forecasts anticipate risk and are not predictors of actual fire activity.Government of Canada analysis shows that climate-related impacts are costing average Canadian households $720 per year today and will rise to around $2,000 per year by 2050. In 2023, Canada's severe weather caused over $3.1 billion in insured damages.Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) is providing funding for preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery through the Emergency Management Assistance Program (EMAP). EMAP reimburses First Nations, provinces and territories and third-party emergency management providers 100 percent of eligible response and recovery costs, including evacuation costs.Associated linksThe Government of Canada Wildfires 2024 web page includes information about programs, policies and initiatives to keep Canadians informed about the wildfire situation and to support provincial and territorial efforts to combat wildfires.In Canada, emergencies are managed first at the local level: hospitals, fire departments, police and municipalities.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 (NEW: JULY 29, 2024) Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95

(\"Noble\" or the \"Company\") (TSX-V:NOB, FRANKFURT: NB7, OTCQB:NLPXF) is pleased to announce that after a delay due to inclement weather, Noble is now ready to initiate their drill program. Extreme hot, dry weather in mid June gave way to thunderstorms and in some cases tornadoes. Noble was concerned with potential forest fire risk and the health and welfare of their workers. With the coming of more stable weather in July, the company is now ready to start the drill program.</p><p>The drill program is planned on 214 claims in Way Township. The claims extend from about 4 to 15 km southwest of the town of Hearst, Ontario. The property area is equivalent to approximately 4,500 hectares or 45 sq km. The drill program follows geophysical surveys done to identify targets that may be the source of the mineralized boulder. The recent geophysical program was partially funded by the Ontario Junior Exploration Program and application has been made to the same program to fund the drill program. The Program will fund up to $200,000 on a $400,000 exploration program.</p><p>The mineralized boulder was on display at the highly successful Canadian Mining Expo in Timmins, Ontario in June.</p><p>Historically, a sample of a metalliferous boulder, brought to the Timmins Mining District Regional Resident Geologist in 2019 by a Mr. A. Cousineau, was submitted for chemical analysis to Geolabs in Sudbury to establish its metal and mineralogical makeup. Geolabs determined that the boulder contained: 71.8% copper; 3.5% lead, 1.09% zinc; 252 g/t of silver, 3.79 g/t of gold; 4.43 g/t of palladium; and 2.22 g/t of platinum and consisted primarily of cuprite (van Hees et al., 2020).</p><p>In 2021, Noble launched an exploration program to in an effort to identify the source of the boulder. Basal till samples collected from two fences of hand auger holes, located about 100 m and 1 km north of the boulder, produced 35 gold grains. These gold grains define a southeast-northwest trending dispersion train that indicate they were transported southeast by a glacial transport from a source area located to the northwest. The dispersion train begins near a northeast trending magnetic anomaly. The gold grains are predominantly reshaped (24) but also include modified (7) and pristine (4), supporting evidence of a local source.</p><p>In 2022 an airborne geophysical survey was flown over the property followed by a ground geophysical survey in November/December 2023. The ground geophysical surveys included 29 line-kilometers of Magnetic, VLF-EM and Induced Polarization Survey. The airborne data was successful in outlining a significant northeast trending magnetic high unit that was traced from the southwest section of the survey block to the northeast corner of the survey block. Compilation of the ground based; detailed magnetic survey was done to highlight the northwest trending fault structure that coincides with the location of the boulder. This structure extends at least 1,100 meters and is represented by a modest magnetic low signature commencing at the southeast corner of the grid. The structure can be traced across the grid, generally lying along the northern bank of the river, and has offset the modest magnetic high units in the same area. The western edge of the suspected fault terminates next to a northeast-southwest striking cross fault that also affects the strike of the river.</p><p>The approximate location of the mineralized, Cousineau Boulder appears to coincide with a slight bullseye high at the southeast end of one of the northwest striking cross dike like features. The dashed line is suggested at being a possible cross fault system. (See Figure 1).</p><p>The initial drill holes will be focussed in the vicinity of the boulder location in order to better understand the physical and fault related geology as defined by geophysics done in the Fall of 2023 (Figure 1). Additional drilling will be focussed on various chargeability and conductive anomalies detected during the recent ground surveys.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/59dbc56523159672949473ed9fd6fde2.pngClick\">https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/59dbc56523159672949473ed9fd6fde2.pngClick</url> Image To View Full Size</p><p>Figure 1: Location of the boulder and initial drill holes (DDH) with identified faulting on detailed magnetic background.</p><p>Vance White, President and CEO of Noble, said \"we are pleased with the progress on this property and to finally get underway the proposed drill program, the results of which may give us more clues as to the possible source of this rich boulder.

(\"Noble\" or the \"Company\") (TSX-V:NOB, FRANKFURT: NB7, OTCQB:NLPXF) is pleased to announce that after a delay due to inclement weather, Noble is now ready to initiate their drill program. Extreme hot, dry weather in mid June gave way to thunderstorms and in some cases tornadoes. Noble was concerned with potential forest fire risk and the health and welfare of their workers. With the coming of more stable weather in July, the company is now ready to start the drill program.</p><p>The drill program is planned on 214 claims in Way Township. The claims extend from about 4 to 15 km southwest of the town of Hearst, Ontario. The property area is equivalent to approximately 4,500 hectares or 45 sq km. The drill program follows geophysical surveys done to identify targets that may be the source of the mineralized boulder. The recent geophysical program was partially funded by the Ontario Junior Exploration Program and application has been made to the same program to fund the drill program.

Premier David Eby walked in to the Starbucks at Quinsam Crossing, he was followed by a coterie of other MLAs, assistants and RCMP.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He sat down after ordering a coffee, and remarked on how nice and new the building looked. It was Eby\u2019s first stop, albeit an unofficial one, on his trip to Campbell River to be part of the official signing of an agreement between the Nanwakolas Council and Western Forest Products to manage timber in the North Island.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThis is a celebration of a really important forestry agreement between Western Forest Products and the local First Nations and its really a template for what we hope to do across the province,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really a template for what we hope to do across the province:agreements between Nations and forestry supported by the local community where there\u2019s economic development and opportunity and stability particularly for the forest industry, which we know is facing a lot of challenges right now around price and availability of trees.</p><p>\u201cSo this is exactly what we\u2019re looking for that kind of alignment of interest where the community comes out the net winner and First Nations are recognized and environmental values are protected,\u201d he said.</p><p>The signing of the agreement comes after more than 2.84 million hectares of forest and land burned in 2023, and some fires carried on burning through the winter despite the snow. According to a report by the Auditor General of Cana-da, \u201cbecause of climate change, forest fires in Canada are expected to get bigger and happen more often. Canada\u2019s forests are becoming a net source of emissions because of forest fires and disturbances caused by insect outbreaks, such as the mountain pine beetle. In some recent years, forest fires and insect disturbances have released over 200 Mt CO2 eq per year to the atmosphere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty dire situation across the province,\u201d Eby said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of parts of the province in the most extreme level of drought we\u2019ve had a lot of fires burning over the winter under the snow.</p><p>\u201cThe really remarkable thing about wood products is that they\u2019re part of the climate solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cSo instead of using steel or concrete, which are very carbon-intensive, wood products have the potential to sequester carbon as well as reduce the carbon footprint of new buildings and construction. So we\u2019ve really been emphasizing mass-timber construction and developing mass timber industry here in British Columbia.\u201d</p><p>Eby said that so far, over 2,000 people have applied to fight forest fires for the upcoming season. The province recently updated the emergency preparedness act, part of which was discussed in a recently held BC Townhalls Event.</p><p>\u201cOne of the realities in an emergency \u2026 is that people might be away on vacation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might own a property that is a vacation home itself, and they\u2019re not there full-time. It\u2019s very difficult for firefighters to get permission to go on the land and fight the fire to protect those homes. The law has to provide them with a shield to be able to go in and fight the fire \u2026 I would be glad for firefighters to go in to any property that I would be so fortunate as to own, to fight a forest fire.\u201d</p><p>Wildfire and disaster management is not the only concern on the minds of North Islanders going into the 2024 election season. Eby acknowledged the overdose crisis, the healthcare crisis, affordability and housing, saying that these problems are bigger than even B.C. \u201cWe\u2019re regularly in contact with Alberta, Washington State and other jurisdictions that are dealing with (the opioid crisis) to find out are they trying something that\u2019s working really well and how can we learn from what they\u2019re doing? And we hope they\u2019re doing the same with us because nobody has found the silver bullet yet.\u201d</p><p>Despite some changes in B.C. \u2019s political landscape, Eby\u2019s NDP party is polling ahead with 43 per cent of undecided votes.</p><p>\u201cThe focus of our government right now is on the legislative session. We\u2019re in right now about dealing with the issues that are important to British Columbians. We\u2019ll be going with the fixed date election in October,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll present the direction that we\u2019re going and the progress that we\u2019ve made the piece we put in place. All the big issues are not going to be solved by October.</p><p>\u201cI want to under promise and over deliver,\u201d he said, laughing.</p><p>Eby posed for a photo outside of the coffee shop, and went back inside to prepare for the next stop on his itinerary.</p><p>Through the discussion, Eby had barely touched his coffee.</p><p>Campbell River Mirror</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPRIV-news20240410PPPA0004308916</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPRIV2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BSC-36F1-F0HF-801S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Maritime Employers Association and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Canada stalled yesterday.</p><p>The employers say the union's demands were \"outside any reasonable framework for settlement,\" and the union claims the employers have \"sabotaged the process.\"</p><p>A key issue for the 7,400 striking port workers appears to concern the definition and scope of maintenance work.</p><p>Former AFN chief seeking reinstatement</p><p>The former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations wants her job back -- and she's calling on supporters to tell their chiefs and councils to make it happen. </p><p>RoseAnne Archibald posted a five-minute video to Facebook on Monday from her car in a parking lot on B.C.'s north shore.</p><p>She said she wants to be reinstated to her job as national chief, and for members to ensure a forensic audit of the national advocacy organization goes forward.</p><p>Archibald claimed the pushback she's been receiving is because she's been fighting corruption at the AFN since October of 2020.</p><p>Here's what else we're watching ...</p><p>Corrections head flagged Bernardo move</p><p>The head of Canada's federal prison system asked bureaucrats to explain whether they had informed Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino about notorious serial killer Paul Bernardo's transfer to a medium-security prison.</p><p>Documents obtained by The Canadian Press show that Correctional Service of Canada Commissioner Anne Kelly had flagged the transfer to Public Safety Canada's top public servant, and then followed up when Mendicino suggested he hadn't been informed about the move.</p><p>Kelly also emailed Mendicino directly after he tweeted the decision was \"shocking and incomprehensible,\" which he posted one week after she had informed his department about the move.</p><p>The Opposition Conservatives have been demanding that Mendicino resign as details have emerged over the past month about the timeline of the prison transfer, and who knew what when.</p><p>Lac-M\u00e9gantic mayor fears another rail disaster</p><p>Ten years after a runaway train derailed and killed 47 people in Lac-M\u00e9gantic, Que., residents are still waiting for a promised railway bypass, and they fear the increasing number of railcars carrying hazardous materials through their town will lead to another disaster.</p><p>Mayor Julie Morin says the trains transporting such things as propane, diesel and sulphuric acid have got longer, threatening to turn the city's downtown area once again into a mess of charred ruins and twisted metal.</p><p>On July 6, 2013, a train carrying 72 tank cars filled with crude oil derailed in the area and exploded, killing 47 people and destroying entire city blocks.</p><p>Quebec forest fire situation continues to improve with rain but risks remain</p><p>Quebec's wildfire prevention agency says recent rain has been improving the forest fire situation in the province, but risk remains high in dry areas along James Bay.</p><p>The agency says rain that fell in the past few days over southern and eastern Quebec has helped contain some of the fires and control some others in two small parts of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region and in the province's northwest.</p><p>But it adds the large fires still burning are immense, including one near the twice-evacuated city of Lebel-sur-Quevillon that covers 4,000 square kilometres.</p><p>Nationally, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre says there are currently 615 active wildfires burning in Canada tonight, with 320 considered out of control.</p><p>Evacuation alerts end for Kelowna, B.C., residents as wildfire under control</p><p>Evacuation alerts and a state of local emergency caused by a wildfire on Knox Mountain in Kelowna, B.C., have ended.</p><p>A statement from the Central Okanagan Emergency Operations Centre says the fire is now under control at 6.5 hectares and emergency crews are still on scene managing several hot spots.</p><p>Residents in the Poplar Point, Knox Mountain, Magic Estates and Clifton areas near the fire were under an evacuation order on Canada Day that was later downgraded to an alert as crews fought the flames</p><p>Kelowna RCMP assisted with an evacuation of more than 400 properties.</p><p>---</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 4,

Premier David Eby walked in to the Starbucks at Quinsam Crossing, he was followed by a coterie of other MLAs, assistants and RCMP.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He sat down after ordering a coffee, and remarked on how nice and new the building looked.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was Eby\u2019s first stop, albeit an unofficial one, on his trip to Campbell River to be part of the official signing of an agreement between the Nanwakolas Council and Western Forest Products to manage timber in the North Island.</p><p>\u201cThis is a celebration of a really important forestry agreement between Western Forest Products and the local First Nations and its really a template for what we hope to do across the province,\u201d he said. \u201cIts really a template for what we hope to do across the province:agreements between Nations and forestry supported by the local community where there\u2019s economic development and opportunity and stability particularly for the forest industry, which we know is facing a lot of challenges right now around price and availability of trees.</p><p>\u201cSo this is exactly what we\u2019re looking for that kind of alignment of interest where the community comes out the net winner and First Nations are recognized and environmental values are protected,\u201d he said.</p><p>The signing of the agreement comes after more than 2.84 million hectares of forest and land burned in 2023, and some fires carried on burning through the winter despite the snow. According to a report by the Auditor General of Canada, \u201cbecause of climate change, forest fires in Canada are expected to get bigger and happen more often. Canada\u2019s forests are becoming a net source of emissions because of forest fires and disturbances caused by insect outbreaks, such as the mountain pine beetle. In some recent years, forest fires and insect disturbances have released over 200 Mt CO2 eq per year to the atmosphere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty dire situation across the province,\u201d Eby said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of parts of the province in the most extreme level of drought we\u2019ve had a lot of fires burning over the winter under the snow.</p><p>\u201cThe really remarkable thing about wood products is that they\u2019re part of the climate solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cSo instead of using steel or concrete which are very carbon-intensive with products have the potential to sequester carbon as well as reduce the carbon footprint of new buildings and construction. So we\u2019ve really been emphasizing mass-timber construction and developing mass timber industry here in British Columbia.\u201d</p><p>Eby said that so far, over 2,000 people have applied to fight forest fires for the upcoming season.</p><p>The province recently updated the emergency preparedness act, part of which was discussed in a recently held BC Townhalls Event.</p><p>\u201cOne of the realities in an emergency \u2026 is that people might be away on vacation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might own a property that is a vacation home itself, and they\u2019re not there full-time. It\u2019s very difficult for firefighters to get permission to go on the land and fight the fire to protect those homes. The law has to provide them with a shield to be able to go in and fight the fire \u2026 I would be glad for firefighters to go in to any property that I would be so fortunate as to own, to fight a forest fire.\u201d</p><p>Wildfire and disaster management is not the only concerns that are on the minds of North Islanders right now going into the 2024 election season.</p><p>Eby acknowledged the overdose crisis, the healthcare crisis, affordability and housing, saying that these problems are bigger than even B.C. \u201cWe\u2019re regularly in contact with Alberta, Washington State and other jurisdictions that are dealing with (the opioid crisis) to find out are they trying something that\u2019s working really well and and how can we learn from what they\u2019re doing? And we hope they\u2019re doing the same with us because nobody has found the silver bullet yet.\u201d</p><p>Despite some changes in B.C. \u2019s political landscape, Eby\u2019s NDP party is polling ahead with 43 per cent of undecided votes.</p><p>\u201cThe focus of our government right now is is on the legislative session. We\u2019re in right now about dealing with the issues that are important to British Columbians. We\u2019ll be going with the fixed date election in October,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll present the direction that we\u2019re going and the progress that we\u2019ve made the piece we put in place. All the big issues are not going to be solved by October.</p><p>\u201cI want to under promise and over deliver,\u201d he said, laughing.</p><p>Eby posed for a photo outside of the coffee shop, and went back inside to prepare for the next stop on his itinerary.</p><p>Through the discussion, Eby had barely touched his coffee.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NRTHIG-news20240410PRCA0004307581</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NRTHIG2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BS7-DXT1-F0HF-80GX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

The firefighters arriving from the U.S. are being sent to the area, he said in a Facebook Live video broadcast. <br/><br/> Vigneault said that with no rain expected before Tuesday, Monday will be difficult.<br/><br/> \"We've got to be really careful,\" he said. \"Tomorrow is going to be a challenge because there's been no rain for a while.\"<br/><br/> At least 2.5 millimetres of rain is needed to have an effect on an active fire, he said. \"So we need quite a lot of rain to have an impact on the fires that are ongoing right now.\" <br/><br/> More than 10,000 square kilometres of forest has burned so far in Quebec this year.<br/><br/> The Canadian Press <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023061268169135</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68FJ-FKF1-JDV5-F08K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"630\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

The aspect of saving nature is really heartwarming.\"</p><p>But it was saving homes and people that brought Charles and about two dozen others here for firefighting training put on by the Prince Albert Grand Council. Some are brand new to the craft while others, like Charles, have volunteered for years. After this training, he'll be able to work seasonally as a firefighter based in the north.</p><p>He first suited up after Stanley Mission, his own First Nation, was almost destroyed by a fire in 2015.</p><p>\"After getting evacuated, I felt helpless,\" he said.</p><p>\"Getting the training I needed to be able to put that fire out - I feel less helpless.\"</p><p>When it comes to remote wildfires, First Nations community members are often the first to feel the heat, smell the smoke and deal with the danger.\u00a0</p><p>The federal government suggests 80 per cent of First Nations are in areas prone to wildfires, and many communities are preparing for what they worry could be a catastrophic season.</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Minimum, standardized training for First Nations</emphasis></p><p>In Saskatchewan, there are different levels of firefighting training. Charles and the others won't fight fire from above, but they can help mop up sections doused by water bombers and work to control sections from the ground.</p><p>And in the north, you use what you can.</p><p>The group learns how to connect a small, cord-pull motor to a half-frozen lake for their hoses. They practice building fire breaks into the forest floor with pickaxes, since machines often can't get to their remote locations.</p><p>They've all had to travel for hours to get here, since there aren't enough trainers to get to each community in time.</p><p/><p>Access to firefighting training has been a longstanding issue for First Nations. In a\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/eng/1683892947884/1683892982915\">national, five-year strategy to protect First Nations from fire,</url> Ottawa and other groups hope to have minimum, standardized firefighting training for communities by 2025.\u00a0</p><p>That goal might be unrealistic, according to some, since many communities don't even have basic infrastructure.</p><p>\"Especially rural and remote communities, they don't even have access coming in and out to get training. There are many First Nations communities that don't even have Internet or cell service,\" said Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations.</p><p>\"We have to keep that all in the back of our minds that not everybody's in downtown Toronto.\"</p><p>While Ottawa dedicated<url normalizedValue=\"https://budget.canada.ca/2024/home-accueil-en.html\">$175 million in this year's budget</url> to help First Nations address this year's and future fire seasons, Woodhouse Nepinak hoped for more to get newer equipment for First Nations firefighting crews.\u00a0</p><p/><p>But even if funding had been higher, there are other barriers to getting systems set up quickly for this fire season.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"</emphasis>Most communities I deal with, there are no paved roads. There are no water resources like hydrants,\" said Jason Wigton, director of technical emergency services for the Kee Tas Kee Now Tribal Council, which serves five First Nations in northern Alberta. Four of those were forced to evacuate due to wildfire last year.</p><p>\"Getting a custom truck takes 18 to 24 months. I've ordered trucks last November that won't be ready until spring of 2025.\"</p><p>While Wigton and others are preparing as best they can, he says teaching fire prevention and safety will help the most this season.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First Nations in Alberta get emergency coordinators</emphasis></p><p>Last year, wildfires caused more than 90 evacuations in First Nations communities across Canada - many in northern Alberta. This year, Ottawa is giving each First Nation in that province money to hire an emergency management coordinator.</p><p>Other communities across Canada have these positions, but the Alberta jobs are unique since there will be one per community, and the position will be full-time. The funding lasts for three years.</p><p>The position could be crucial for the Athabasca Chipeywan First Nation, whose members were forced to flee their homes last year. Many residents can only leave in an emergency by air or water. It's a complex process only made worse this year since low water levels threaten to trap boats in the bay.</p><p/><p>\"People in the community say that they've never seen it this bad in their lifetime,\" Chief Allan Adam said.</p><p>\"The whole community is at risk if there was a forest fire that burned out of control.\"</p><p>Adam said the bulk of the new emergency management coordinator's urgent work would be fire prevention education, like teaching people how to clear debris from their homes and reminding them not to burn during bans.</p><p>But there will be emergencies to plan for, he said. Fires are pressing, but floods and dangerous cold snaps have all caused danger and damage in recent years.</p><p>So while the emergency coordinator position is welcomed, Adam says the three years of funding isn't enough to deal with these long-term problems.</p><p>\"Climate change is happening. It's not going away, and it's getting worse every year,\" he said.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we're not going to escape it either.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadasaskatchewanfirstnationswildfirefighting202417187234</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BXD-V0B1-JCMC-W38M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

The town's website said the fire was 24 times the size of the city of Montreal. <br/><br/> Four fires north of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon had not grown in 24 hours, Lafreni\u00e8re said, adding that another fire, burning near a mine around 115 kilometres east of the town, had been contained.<br/><br/> The northern Quebec town has been evacuated twice since June 2.<br/><br/> The Cree First Nation of Waswanipi, where poor air quality led officials to evacuate vulnerable people starting June 23, allowed all residents to return Friday.<br/><br/>Quebec officials said the only evacuation order that was not scheduled to lift by this weekend was in the city of Senneterre, where 60 cottages - located around 30 kilometres north of the city centre - remained off limits.<br/><br/> About 100 fires were burning in Quebec on Friday, according to the province's forest fire prevention agency - SOPFEU. Five fires were considered out of control. <br/><br/> The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre said there were 499 active fires burning across the country as of Thursday afternoon, with about 230 of them out of control. It said 67 were in Ontario.<br/><br/> Meanwhile, Environment Canada issued smog warnings Friday for the regions around the cities of Montreal and Gatineau and for western Quebec.<br/><br/>  It said poor air quality could also be expected in northern Quebec, including parts of the Far North, as well as in eastern and southern Ontario.<br/><br/> Real-time data from the United Nations Environment Programme showed that the level of pollutants in the air in Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto was at least 10 times higher than recommended.<br/><br/> Scott Weichenthal, a professor at McGill University's department of epidemiology and biostatistics who studies environmental risk factors for chronic illness, said the poor air quality will have the most short-term impact on the very young and very old, as well as on people with heart or lung diseases. <br/><br/> \"We will almost certainly see small increases in mortality and small increases in things like hospital admissions for, say, cardiovascular or respiratory outcomes,\" he said in an interview Friday. \"Not everyone is sensitive to the same extent, but there will be a measurable impact on health.\"<br/><br/> For healthier members of the population, exposure to air pollution from wildfires could damage health over the long term, especially if fires burn for extended periods, or if wildfires start to occur more frequently. <br/><br/> While there's a lack of studies on the long-term effects of air pollution from wildfires, he said, \"there's almost certainly a long-term health risk.\"<br/><br/> Weichenthal said his research group conducted a study last year that analyzed census data on the health effects of wildfires on Canadians. He said they found increases in the risk of lung cancer and brain tumours among people who lived near fires.<br/><br/> Air pollution may not cause significant individual risks, but because it impacts everyone, it increases risk at a population level, he said. \"We all have to breathe, so everyone is exposed.\" <br/><br/> The air quality-monitoring website IQAir said that as of 3 p.m. Friday, Toronto and Montreal ranked third and fourth for the worst air quality among major world cities, with only Jakarta, Indonesia and New York City faring worse. <br/><br/> Environment Canada has issued air quality alerts for northern Quebec almost every day this month, said Simon Legault, a meteorologist at the federal department.<br/><br/> \"Until the end of those fires, until they are completely put out, there won't be any real improvement close to those regions,\" he said in an interview Friday.<br/><br/> No significant rain is forecast in those areas for at least two weeks, he said, adding that the month of July is expected to be drier than usual.<br/><br/> The Canadian Press <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023070168350871</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68KK-X4C1-F197-50XS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

(AP) \u2014 Wisconsin archaeologists are crediting a man and daughter with discovering the remains of what could be a ship that ran aground during the deadly Peshtigo Fire more than 150 years ago.</p><p>Tim Wollak and his 6-year-old daughter, Henley, of Peshtigo, were fishing on Lake Michigan in the bay of Green Bay near Green Island this summer when their sonar picked up something Henley thought was an octopus, WLUK-TV reported Wednesday.</p><p>Wollak posted photos of the sonar images on Facebook, which eventually drew the attention of the Wisconsin Historical Society. The society posted a note Dec. 11 on Facebook saying an underwater remote vehicle surveyed the site Dec. 4 and confirmed the object is the wreck of a three-masted sailing ship submerged in 8 to 10 feet of water.</p><p>Archaeologists believe the ship may be the 122-foot-long George L. Newman. The ship was hauling lumber from Little Suamico on the evening of Oct. 8, 1871, when it became enveloped in thick smoke from the Peshtigo Fire and ran aground on the southeast point of Green Island.</p><p>The keeper of the island's lighthouse rescued the crew, according to the historical society's tweet, but the ship was abandoned and was eventually covered with sand and forgotten.</p><p>The historical society plans to survey the wreck again in the spring of 2024 and may push to list the site on the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p>\u201cI don't know how we top it,\u201d Wollak told WLUK. \u201cI told her (Henley) I'm pretty sure there's no one else in her school that has ever found a shipwreck that nobody had recorded before ... I guess we'll just have to fish more and see if we can find more shipwrecks.\u201d</p><p>The National Weather Service ranks the Peshtigo Fire as the most devastating forest fire in U.S. history, claiming more than 1,200 lives.</p><p>According to survivor accounts, railroad workers clearing land for tracks started a brush fire Oct. 8, 1871, that grew into an inferno that scorched between 1.2 million and 1.5 million acres. The fire skipped east over the waters of Green Bay and set fire to parts of Door and Kewaunee counties.</p><p>The city of Peshtigo was consumed in an hour, according to the National Weather Service's website. Sixteen other towns burned as well.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-8cac3324776de659a4cc012cc58b3331</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69X3-10P1-JBVR-31VW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"369\"/><timeReceived>04:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 18, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

New fires may start easily, burn vigorously, and challenge fire suppression efforts. Extreme caution must be used in any forest activities. Open burning and industrial activities may be restricted.\"</p><p>The fire danger, which is updated daily by the B.C.

She noted the forest receives a high forest fire danger rating most years, and this is late in the summer for the first high rating.</p><p>READ ALSO: Along the Fraser: Fire prevention at UBC research forest</p><p>There have not been major fires in the forest for a long time. In 1868, a large fire swept through the western side of the forest, burning everything but the wettest pockets of land around lakes and stream basins. Local historical records indicate the fire was accidentally started by local settlers clearing land, during a particularly dry season. In 1971, there was a large fire that burned approximately 70 hectares.</p><p>Assistant fire chief Michael Van Dop said the Maple Ridge fire department hasn't noted a significant uptick in terms of calls.</p><p>He said as the weather changes, with a low system coming into the Lower Mainland through the later part of this week, the fire danger rating could again go to low.</p><p>Fire officials are not at the point where they are considering doing a fire ban at any point.</p><p>\"We just urge the public to be wise about what they're doing in the backcountry and on their property, given that it is summer and people are enjoying themselves,\" said Van Dop.</p><p>\"Just be intelligent about what you're doing, and make sure you're being fire safe.\"</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>@NeilCorbett18 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ncorbett@mapleridgenews.comLike\">ncorbett@mapleridgenews.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MARNWS-4038367</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MARNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MK-0DT1-JDH1-C1M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438227</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"391\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Maple Ridge News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Alberta has been battling multiple severe fires since early May and there are still 63 fires burning, 18 of them out of control.</p><p>The Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported that as of Friday afternoon there were 324 fires burning across the country, and 167 are considered out of control. That includes the Tantallon fire in Halifax that has destroyed or damaged 151 homes so far.</p><p>That\u2019s a big jump from Thursday, when the agency reported 209 fires, with 87 out of control.</p><p>Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said Friday that cooler weather is expected in Western Cana-da and rain in Nova Scotia, which will help. But the severe fire warnings are likely to continue in most provinces for another four to five weeks at least.</p><p>\u201cThe situation remains severe across the country,\u201d Blair said. \u201cWe are hopeful that the improving weather conditions and that rain will assist in the firefighting efforts, but there\u2019s still a great deal of work that needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>More than 27,000 square kilometres of land has burned in Canada over the last two months, more than 10 times the average amount of land burned by fires over the last decade.</p><p>Thus far, more than 96 per cent of the burned land was in Western Canada and Northwest Territories, but last weekend the situation became more severe in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and now parts of Ontario and Quebec are also burning.</p><p>\u201cThere are a number of very significant \u2014 over 100 wildfires \u2014 that have now popped up in Quebec and some of them are out of control and quite serious,\u201d said Blair.</p><p>The Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre database added 113 fires in Quebec since Thursday, and 76 of them are classified as being out of control. The Canadian Armed Forces deployed several hundred troops to Alberta to help in May and is training more to help in Nova Scotia now, said Blair. The military and the Canadian Coast Guard is also helping with equipment, he said.</p><p>The number of fires, their size and severity, as well as the number of places affected are straining Canada\u2019s resources, so the Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre has requested help from international partners.</p><p>Since the season began, 443 firefighters and other workers from Australia, New Zealand and the U.S.have flown to Canada to help, mostly in Alberta. Some have gone to Northwest Territories and a small number so far have landed in Nova Scotia.</p><p>Australia, New Zealand and the U.S.are all sending more firefighters in the coming days, Blair said.

With only 75 individuals left, every Southern Resident birth is crucial to the population's survival.<br/><br/> But in a troubling sign, the researchers discovered the fish-eating apex predators are transferring carcinogenic PAHs to their unborn calves, according to the paper published Dec. 19 in the journal Scientific Reports.<br/><br/> \"It's really important for policymakers to take that into consideration when looking at oil and pipeline development along our coast,\" Lee said. PAHs associated with forest fires and other pyrogenic sources were found in marine mammal-eating Bigg's killer whales, also known as transient killer whales. A threatened species in Canada, Bigg's orcas roam the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Mexico and tend to live away from coastal infrastructure. Those migratory patterns, combined with the reach of windblown wildfire smoke, make the threat posed by PAHs particularly wide-ranging. <br/><br/> \"California has really been impacted by wildfires and so that could be a reason why we found that Bigg's killer whales had more PAHs that were linked to pyrogenic sources,\" said Lee.<br/><br/> Lee said it's not possible to attribute the pyrogenic PAH contamination specifically to wildfires, as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be generated by the burning of wood, grass and coal. But co-author Juan Jos\u00e9 Alava noted that the PAH fingerprint found in Bigg's orcas is characteristic of forest fire smoke that would be carried by the wind to the animals' more remote habitat.<br/><br/> The extent of PAH poisoning in orca populations is unknown, as are its exact health impacts - though the paper noted scientists have linked cancer in Canadian beluga whales to PAH contamination.<br/><br/> The study is \"an important new piece of work on a class of contaminants that have not been heavily studied in whales,\" said John Calambokidis, a senior research biologist and co-founder of the non-profit Cascadia Research Collective in Washington. <br/><br/>  Bloomberg <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2024010970237671</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B2J-FXJ1-JDV5-F18D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"488\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

New fires may start easily, burn vigorously, and challenge fire suppression efforts. Extreme caution must be used in any forest activities. Open burning and industrial activities may be restricted.\u201d   </p><p>The BC Wildfire Service operates roughly 260 weather stations around the province, which issue reports on an hourly basis. These weather observations, alongside data from agency stations, are used as part of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System. </p><p>Krista Minar, Merritt\u2019s FireSmart Representative and Wildfire Mitigation Specialist, said that while it isn\u2019t out of character to see a change in fire rating in the spring, people should be cautious and do their part to prevent further fires from sparking.  </p><p>\u201cThe fire danger rating being high right now is not unusual,\u201d said Minar.  </p><p>\u201cBecause we are coming off of the winter season a lot of our fuels have been cured, and so everything\u2019s already dry and obviously we haven\u2019t received any new precipitation, so something that we really are trying to encourage people to do when we\u2019re in this stage, is to use the fire danger rating as a call to action.\u201d </p><p>When the Fire Danger Rating is Low, Minar said that people should be thinking about how to FireSmart their homes, with information available on the Merritt Fire Rescue Department (MFRD) website, or the FireSmart BC website.   </p><p>At the Moderate stage, it\u2019s a good time to start preparing by implementing the FireSmart principles, such as removing combustible materials from within five feet of their home, making sure the yard is tidied and fine fuels are removed, as well as ensuring gutters are cleaned and the roof of your home is in good repair.  </p><p>During a High rating, Minar says that Merritt residents should be in a preparatory stage. It\u2019s time to ready a wildfire evacuation kit. Information about the kit can be found at getprepared.gc.ca. </p><p>\u201cWhen we move up into extreme, and we have had one extreme rating already this year, that\u2019s the stage where we want everybody to be paying attention, making sure that they\u2019re keeping up with any local fires that are occurring,\u201d said Minar.  </p><p>Merritt is environmentally very prone to fires, as there is a hot and dry climate, as well as strong winds and active use of the backcountry by many.  </p><p>\u201cWhen you live in a fire prone area, you know it\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d said Minar. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not if, it\u2019s when.\u201d  </p><p>Signs indicating fire danger are located at 1799 Nicola Ave, and approximately 1675 Juniper Drive, across from Pineridge Cemetery. One is also visible on Voght St. near the RCMP station. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-335e18911716441c902275649ccc1d0d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62JH-1KB1-JBVR-314T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"462\"/><timeReceived>06:03 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 28, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLQ6</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE MATERIALS &amp; PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DLZG</classCode><className>HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Dozens of houses were also destroyed, mostly holiday homes or small dwellings outside of villages. </p><p>The fire, which broke out late Wednesday near the village of Schinos, was fanned by gale-force winds that blanketed the Greek capital about 70 kilometers to the west with acrid smoke throughout the day Thursday.</p><p>\u201cDuring the night there were many fronts that were exceptionally dangerous for our forces,\u201d said Hardalias, adding that three settlements and one monastery were evacuated as a precaution during the night. </p><p>More than 300 firefighters, ground teams, members of the military and volunteers were fighting the flames, while 21 water-dropping planes and helicopters were deployed at first light Friday to assist from the air.</p><p>Despite \u201cexceptionally difficult circumstances,\u201d firefighting forces managed to prevent the flames from reaching a wildlife refuge south of the main fire, and from expanding further east towards the town of Megara, Hardalias said. </p><p>The fire destroyed power lines, causing local blackouts, and reached a nearby coastline. The Civil Protection Authority activated a cellphone-enabled alert service to help with evacuation efforts on Thursday and overnight to Friday. </p><p>Wildfires are common during Greece\u2019s hot, dry summers, but this blaze started well before the full heat of summer. The country had been experiencing unseasonably hot weather over the past week. In 2018, a blaze that hit the summer resort area of Mati east of Athens killed more than 100 people. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-8db83d3c158bbaaa5bf59405d750ed1a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62R6-FC41-DY9S-T3PH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"304\"/><timeReceived>03:41 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 21, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Introducing plans to municipal\u00a0councillors at budget committee\u00a0meetings last week, the department\u00a0said it wants\u00a0to add\u00a015 new firefighters\u00a0in Upper Tantallon\u00a0or Hammonds Plains.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That would allow\u00a0career firefighters to work around the clock,\u00a0supported by volunteers.

That work is going to\u00a0be a first for Canada, and a first on the Atlantic seaboard of North America,\" Stuebing said.</p><p>The budget report shows the fire department is close to hitting its targets for arriving on scene to fire and medical calls. But it meets the firefighting standard of 14 members on scene within 11 minutes just 57 per cent of the time, far below the 90 per cent target. Rural or suburban areas often see the longest\u00a0delays.\u00a0</p><p>Construction is also expected to begin\u00a0soon on a\u00a0new $40-million, four-bay fire station and headquarters in\u00a0Bedford West on Symonds Road, just off Hammonds Plains Road. Completion\u00a0is slated for\u00a0spring 2026.</p><p/><p>\"This is absolutely in the middle of an area that is growing, that is underserved,\" area Coun. Tim Outhit said in a recent interview.</p><p>Stuebing\u00a0also said some traffic-calming measures around Halifax are affecting\u00a0emergency response times because firefighters have to drive\u00a0over speed bumps to get to\u00a0fire hydrants. And fire trucks can't turn through some intersections\u00a0 with bumped-out\u00a0curbs, Stuebing said.</p><p>\"Our ability to navigate to a call is getting harder and harder,\" Stuebing said. \"Is it in fact affecting our response time? We think it is.\"</p><p>Coun. Sam Austin suggested using smaller fire trucks similar to\u00a0European ones, which could better navigate urban areas with narrower streets. Stuebing said they will look at those options, which might make sense to buy when Halifax eventually converts to an electrical fleet.</p><p>The overall Halifax budget will be passed in April.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORE TOP STORIES</emphasis>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanovascotiahalifaxconsidersfasttrackingnewuppertantallonfirefighters17134736</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BGM-T111-JCMC-W34S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"668\"/><timeReceived>12:27 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

One province over, officials warned flames could overtake a British Columbia town as emergency crews prepared for a \"last stand.\" And in northwest Manitoba, a fire was singeing one small community.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fires have been sending smoke across parts of Canada and the United States and sparking air quality warnings, as officials caution that the risk of hot, dry weather and severe fires this spring and summer remains high.</p><p>In the wake of last year's record-shattering Canadian wildfires, which saw the skies over much of the country, including Toronto, turn eerily hazy with air quality indexes hitting \"high-risk\" warning levels, the spectre of another smoke-choked season looms large.</p><p>Fire was burning Monday about 16 kilometres from Fort McMurray - a city of 68,000 that was infamously overrun by a blaze in 2016. Light rain was being counted on to help hinder the fire, after an evacuation alert went out Friday for the city as well as Saprae Creek Estates, Gregoire Lake Estates, Fort McMurray First Nation and Anzac.</p><p>About 4,700 people, meanwhile, have been ordered to leave Fort Nelson, B.C., and the surrounding area since that fire started Friday. </p><p>Calmer winds Sunday night and Monday morning prevented the Parker Lake wildfire from spreading into the town, although it had grown to 53 square kilometres in size, said Cliff Chapman, the B.C. Wildfire Service director of operations.</p><p>Forecasts called for winds to pick up again within a few days, Chapman said. Ground crews were focusing on protecting structures, while helicopters and bulldozers were being used on the fire line.</p><p>\"It's a joint effort, air and ground,\" said Chapman, noting 17 helicopters have been assigned to the area. \"We're seeing extreme fire behaviour.\"</p><p>Chapman said the fire situation has been worsened by dry conditions over the winter, which led to a number of holdover fires buried in the ground, lasting through the end of the year and re-emerging this spring.</p><p>Crews were also battling a wildfire in northwest Manitoba that had forced the evacuation of some 550 residents.</p><p>Earl Simmons, the province's wildfire director, said the blaze near Cranberry Portage was whipped by winds on the weekend, coming within 1,500 metres of the community.</p><p>Simmons said in the 40 years he's been working with wildfires, he'd never seeing a fire that moved so quickly.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre was reporting 139 active fires across the country as of Monday, including 38 out-of-control blazes - burning through nearly 230,000 hectares of land so far. In comparison, more than 200 fires were burning across the country around the same time last year, with roughly 50 out of control.</p><p>On Sunday, Environment Canada issued a special air quality alert extending from B.C. to Ontario.</p><p>The Air Quality Health Index showed a moderate risk for downtown Toronto and other parts of Ontario on Monday. With air quality at \"moderate risk,\" people with heart or breathing problems are urged to \"consider reducing or rescheduling strenuous activities outdoors\" if they are experiencing symptoms like difficulty breathing. People in the general population don't need to modify outdoor activities unless they experience symptoms like irritated throats or coughing.</p><p>Meanwhile, federal officials were predicting weather conditions for spring and summer that could lead to greater wildfire risks, including above-normal temperatures nationwide and an ongoing drought in Western Canada expected to persist through May.</p><p>This same drought, a result of the current El Ni\u00f1o weather system, also contributed to the early start of fire season this year, said Kent Moore, a professor of physics at the University of Toronto Mississauga researching the dynamics of our climate system and its long-term impacts.</p><p>As global temperatures continue to climb as a result of climate change, experts warn Canada must brace for longer and more intense wildfire seasons to come.</p><p>Although wildfires are a natural process that can be beneficial for the ecosystem, the events have been happening at an \"unprecedented level\" in recent years, said Ze'ev Gedalof, an associate professor researching forestry and climatology at the University of Guelph.</p><p>\"It's not rocket science,\" he continued. \"When it gets warmer and drier, we're going to see longer fire seasons and we're going to see hotter fires.\"</p><p>There are three main ingredients for a wildfire, according to John Innes, a professor of forestry at the University of British Columbia: its intensity hinges on the source of ignition (and how frequently they occur), the state of the fuel and the presence of conditions that spread the fire, like strong wind.</p><p>\"Climate change affects all of those,\" he said. Specifically, scientists expect more thunderstorms and windy conditions as the weather changes, which can spark and spread fires. Meanwhile, woods are drier as temperatures warm, providing excellent fuel, Innes said.</p><p>Innes said there are no longer fire seasons in parts of the southern U.S. because the risk of fire has become present year-round. In \"50 to 80 years,\" Innes sees the same thing happening to Canada.</p><p>If a wildfire grows intense enough, it can even generate its own weather, including thunder and lightning - potentially spawning more fires, according to Jeff Brook, an associate professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health.</p><p>Brook said climate change has impacted the seasons in which certain species are active - like mountain pine beetles, which usually get killed off by the cold but are now able to survive year-round due to warming winters. As a result, they've become an epidemic in the B.C. Interior, devastating forests - \"and dead forests are even more susceptible to burning,\" he said.</p><p>In 2023, Canada's record-shattering fires produced 23 per cent of the global annual wildfire carbon emissions. About 480 million tonnes of wildfire emissions were recorded, almost five times the national average for the past two decades.</p><p>With files from </p><p>The Canadian Press </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2024051471482218</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C1D-MPD1-JDV5-F0KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1037\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.
