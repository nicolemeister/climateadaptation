That fire is classified as out of control\u00a0at more than 18,900 hectares.</p><p>They have also been embedded into some of Alberta's incident management teams and are assisting in day-to-day operations, Story said.</p><p>\"The situation here in Alberta is very unique at this time of year,\" she said. \"We're seeing astronomical wildfire growth on the landscape right now, so all the help we can get is appreciated.\"</p><p>The province is now looking\u00a0internationally for further resources.</p><p>\"We have lots of dry dead vegetation on the landscape and the temperatures turned very quickly. We've had a lot of wind and a lot of hot dry conditions, which have just contributed to the wildfire situation here,\" she said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1 fire in northwestern Ontario</emphasis></p><p>Although smoke from western Canada has been visible in parts of Ontario, the situation is much different on the ground. As of Wednesday afternoon, there was one active wildfire in northwestern Ontario - called Kenora 5 -\u00a0 located about six kilometres north of Wabaseemoong Independent Nation.</p><p>The 0.3-hectare fire is currently under control, according to Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services.</p><p>\"We continue to see a slow start to the fire season in Ontario across both regions, both the northwest and the northeast regions,\" fire information officer Alison Bezubiak told CBC News.</p><p>\"So far this year, we've seen 16 fires in the province of Ontario compared to 25 at the same time last year, and compared to 64 in the 10-year average.\u00a0A total of 15.2 hectares have been burned this year in the province,\" she said.</p><p>The northern part of the region is under a moderate to high fire hazard while the hazard is low for the rest of northwestern Ontario, she said.</p><p>There are no active wildfires in the northeastern part of the province. While the fire hazard is moderate to high in the majority of the region as of Wednesday, it remains low across Manitoulin Island, the North Shore of Lake Huron and areas along Lake Superior.</p><p>Last year saw a cyclical pattern of warm weather followed by periods of significant rain, which mostly kept the fire hazard in check, said Bezubiak.</p><p>It is hard to predict the long-term fire forecast this season, since forest fires are heavily influenced by the\u00a0weather. However, \"some of the weather trends that have been observed give the indication that summer is trending toward normal seasonal values for both precipitation and temperature,\" she said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Day time burning restricted until end of October</emphasis></p><p>As people are cleaning up their yards, low humidity and rising temperatures are drying out grasses, pine needles and leaf litter, posing greater risks for human-caused fires in the springtime, Bezubiak explained.</p><p>The public is reminded that day time burning is banned from April 1 to Oct. 31. Burning should be done responsibly and people are asked to follow Ontario's outdoor burning regulations.</p><p>Among these rules are that fires are to be ignited no sooner than two hours before sunset and extinguished no later than two hours after sunrise, and that people should always have tools and water on hand to keep fires contained.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadathunderbaynorthernontariowildfiresalberta16838923</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69S1-5XC1-JCMC-W28Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CBC/Radio-Canada.

No water buckets can be seen in the videos.</p><p>Another video of the same scene shows the man drinking a Budweiser before digging the heart shape in the sand with his hands and then cuts to the paper towels placed in the indents and the man holding a stick wrapped in paper for a makeshift torch.</p><p>\u201cWould you do anything for the love of your life? Even if things aren\u2019t always perfect?\u201d the caption reads. \u201cBecause I would.\u201d</p><p>The three TikTok videos have over 4.7 million views combined and over 487,000 likes. The account that posted them has 21,000 followers.</p><p>The videos remained up on Wednesday with the vast majority of their over 2,000 comments lambasting the couple and expressing shock and anger over the large fire being purposely set during a heavily publicized fire ban and the province\u2019s worst wildfire season on record.</p><p>\u201cYou guys gotta be kidding me, I hope you get fined for this stunt during a fire ban,\u201d wrote one commenter.</p><p>\u201cAbsolute disrespect. Ignorance at its finest,\u201d wrote another.</p><p>\u201cI hope you get a fine for this. This is not cute, it\u2019s so irresponsible and disrespectful to the local community,\u201d wrote another.</p><p>Others pointed out that a wildfire near Port Alberni blocked access to the community as Hwy. 4 was shut down from June 6-23 and the damage done by the blaze continues to cause closures as the highway was shut down in both directions on Aug. 9. \u201cThere\u2019s a fire ban for a reason, don\u2019t promote this when our community was cut off for WEEKS due to a fire. Disrespectful at best,\u201d wrote a commenter.</p><p>\u201cShe literally had to drive through the aftermath of the Alberni forest fire to get to Tofino,\u201d wrote another.</p><p>Many of the comments note that Tofino is currently under Stage 3 water restrictions due to an ongoing and unprecedented drought.</p><p>During a town hall meeting held to discuss Tofino\u2019s water situation last month, the district\u2019s Director of Infrastructure and Public Works Aaron Rodgers suggested \u201ca large fire at any time in any summer, let alone this summer, would put us immediately into Stage 4.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReminder that there is currently a fire ban across the entire province of B.C. and a severe drought and water shortage in Tofino specifically,\u201d wrote a TikTok commenter.</p><p>\u201cThis is soooo tone deaf. Did you not see the massive signs saying Tofino is in a water restriction and a fire ban currently?,\u201d wrote another.</p><p>\u201cVisits a remote population during a DROUGHT and PUBLICIZED WATER SHORTAGE only to create the most bootleg fire using paper??\u201d wrote another.</p><p>Provincial law states that \u201cAnyone found in contravention of a fire prohibition may be fined up to $1,150. If your fire escapes and results in a wildfire, you may be fined anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million and be sentenced to one year in prison.\u201d</p><p>The video also caught the ire of Tofino resident and TikToker Hannah Tarrant.</p><p>\u201cAs a person who lives in Tofino full time, this is why we say we hate the tourists. You guys treat our beautiful bit of paradise like garbage,\u201d Tarrant commented.</p><p>Tarrant also posted a response to her own TikTok page, which has over 101,000 followers.</p><p>\u201cThis is not cute. This happened in TofinoB.C. during an all-summer fire ban and level 3 water restrictions,\u201d Tarrant said in her response video.</p><p>\u201cPlease guys, all I\u2019m asking for anyone who sees this video is that you don\u2019t do this without proper research. Honestly, this put the whole town at risk.\u201d</p><p>Tofino mayor Dan Law told the Westerly News there are no excuses for setting fires during the current ban.</p><p>\u201cIf more people do stuff like this they\u2019re going to regret it. That\u2019s for sure. Anybody, anywhere in B.C. that is lighting fires outside is just being completely irresponsible. The reason the ban is on and the fines are so high is because the potential for massive, catastripohic destruction is so high,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest wildfire season B.C. has ever had by far\u2026People that can read the news and be anywhere in B.C. and still light fires outside, I would say it\u2019s inexcusable.\u201d</p><p>He added that Tofino has put \u201cconsiderable energy into addressing beach fires\u201d and has seen success in cutting down on illegal flames.</p><p>\u201cWe have seen vast improvements,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vast majority of people on the beach are using propane rings or not having fires at all.\u201d</p><p>He noted the district has an RCMP Reservist as well as a bylaw enforcement team on patrol.</p><p>\u201cOur fines are quite high. So, people that do make the mistake of having a fire on the beach, or anywhere in Tofino are potentially facing hefty fines and they\u2019re not going to be able to get out of it,\u201d he said.</p><p>He declined to speculate on whether the TikTokers who set the fire will be caught, but noted that they recorded and posted their behaviour.</p><p>\u201cI can say that if people are going to do stupid, illegal things, I\u2019m kind of glad they filmed themselves in the act. It does certainly help enforcement,\u201d he said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:andrew.bailey@westerlynews.ca\">andrew.bailey@westerlynews.ca</email></p><p>\u201cIf more people do stuff like this they\u2019re going to regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u2013 Dan Law</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOFUWN-news20230816PTCA0003802361</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOFUWN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YP-BW81-F0HF-83GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438260</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"928\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

The federal backstop, according to the government, aims to incentivize Canadians to reduce their own emissions, while also providing quarterly rebates called the Canada carbon rebate.

When it's below $80 it comes back on. And so we're watching prices very closely. I told the committee I'd be more than happy if the federal government did the same thing, because with their carbon tax, their fuel tax, and the GST, they charge 35 cents on every tank of gas. And if they took the same approach, if they would eliminate it when gas prices got too high, then we probably wouldn't have any complaint.} \\par \\pard\\plain \\s0\\rtlch\\af8\\afs20\\alang1025 \\ltrch\\lang1033\\langfe1033\\hich\\af0\\loch\\ql\\nowidctlpar\\faauto\\hyphpar0\\ltrpar\\f0\\fs20\\lang1033\\cf0\\kerning1\\dbch\\af8\\langfe1033\\loch\\li0\\ri0\\lin0\\rin0\\fi0\\ltrpar\\rtlch\\afs24 \\ltrch\\hich\\af6\\loch\\fs24\\f6\\loch \\par \\pard\\plain \\s0\\rtlch\\af8\\afs20\\alang1025 \\ltrch\\lang1033\\langfe1033\\hich\\af0\\loch\\ql\\nowidctlpar\\faauto\\hyphpar0\\ltrpar\\f0\\fs20\\lang1033\\cf0\\kerning1\\dbch\\af8\\langfe1033\\loch\\li0\\ri0\\lin0\\rin0\\fi0\\ltrpar{\\rtlch\\afs24 \\ltrch\\hich\\af6\\loch\\fs24\\f6\\loch</p><p>KAPELOS: What I gather from that though is that you see there to be a purpose in the fuel tax you've applied in so far as that money goes to pay for roads.

You had the Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault say that he wasn't anticipating the carbon tax to make a difference until 2060. And so when you think about what behaviors are you trying to incent? Well part of it is you're trying to get people to buy zero emissions vehicles, which cost $60,000. You're trying to get them to change out their home heating systems, which can cost $10,000 to $20,000, and you're trying to get them to make really expensive changes to renovate their homes. And I just don't know that giving people a couple hundred bucks every quarter is going to incentivize that. There's other ways to be able to get those kinds of changes, but this looks like just a shell game. It's a matter of taking money away, giving some of it back, and pretending you're doing something about the environment.

There are some programs the federal government has and has partnered with us that do seem to be working, for instance the carbon capture utilization and storage tax credit. We've announced ours. We think that federal government will be putting some structure around those very soon. That has resulted in Pathways, which is our bitumen producers talking about creating a $16.5 billion carbon capture trunk line. We have partnered with the Strategic Investment Fund which is under the portfolio of Francois-Philippe Champagne on Dow Chemicals net zero petrochemical plant, Air Products net zero hydrogen, Heidelberg's net zero cement, Inter Pipeline on their ammonia project. Those are projects that are going to be net zero immediately after they're done, and I don't think that factors into anyone's modeling. But those are the kind of things that we need to do if we're going to make effective reductions in major industrial emissions.} \\par \\pard\\plain \\s0\\rtlch\\af8\\afs20\\alang1025 \\ltrch\\lang1033\\langfe1033\\hich\\af0\\loch\\ql\\nowidctlpar\\faauto\\hyphpar0\\ltrpar\\f0\\fs20\\lang1033\\cf0\\kerning1\\dbch\\af8\\langfe1033\\loch\\li0\\ri0\\lin0\\rin0\\fi0\\ltrpar\\rtlch\\afs24 \\ltrch\\hich\\af6\\loch\\fs24\\f6\\loch \\par \\pard\\plain \\s0\\rtlch\\af8\\afs20\\alang1025 \\ltrch\\lang1033\\langfe1033\\hich\\af0\\loch\\ql\\nowidctlpar\\faauto\\hyphpar0\\ltrpar\\f0\\fs20\\lang1033\\cf0\\kerning1\\dbch\\af8\\langfe1033\\loch\\li0\\ri0\\lin0\\rin0\\fi0\\ltrpar{\\rtlch\\afs24 \\ltrch\\hich\\af6\\loch\\fs24\\f6\\loch</p><p>KAPELOS: The issue though is that those don't come for free for taxpayers.

That's I think a sensible way of doing it. When we've looked at our ASIP program, that's our program for petrochemical incentives, we've determined that that has a payoff of about 10 years with the extra taxes that those companies will end up paying. So those are the kind of approaches that we think are going to make sense, as opposed to putting an immediate burden on people who can least afford to pay it, those who are seniors, those who are low income. That's where we believe that the focus should be on the industrial emissions reduction, pricing that out, and making sure that we're holding those companies to account. But I think it's just frustrating for people to continue to see a tax when the alternatives just simply aren't available to them.} \\par \\pard\\plain \\s0\\rtlch\\af8\\afs20\\alang1025 \\ltrch\\lang1033\\langfe1033\\hich\\af0\\loch\\ql\\nowidctlpar\\faauto\\hyphpar0\\ltrpar\\f0\\fs20\\lang1033\\cf0\\kerning1\\dbch\\af8\\langfe1033\\loch\\li0\\ri0\\lin0\\rin0\\fi0\\ltrpar\\rtlch\\afs24 \\ltrch\\hich\\af6\\loch\\fs24\\f6\\loch \\par \\pard\\plain \\s0\\rtlch\\af8\\afs20\\alang1025 \\ltrch\\lang1033\\langfe1033\\hich\\af0\\loch\\ql\\nowidctlpar\\faauto\\hyphpar0\\ltrpar\\f0\\fs20\\lang1033\\cf0\\kerning1\\dbch\\af8\\langfe1033\\loch\\li0\\ri0\\lin0\\rin0\\fi0\\ltrpar{\\rtlch\\afs24 \\ltrch\\hich\\af6\\loch\\fs24\\f6\\loch</p><p>KAPELOS: Is it though accurate to say that the industrial side of things will be more effective or less costly, I should say, for Albertans, or for Canadians writ large? Again, those come with a very specific cost. It's just not as naked as the carbon tax.

Not only do I think we can achieve that, I think, because I know our industry is so well, they'll strive to do it even faster.

And what they talk about is often, you know, reaching those targets in order to stop the warming that's happening that is increasing the frequency with which we are seeing the impacts of climate change, so fires, let's say, man-made in many instances, but taking up a wider swath of land that Albertans will be very familiar with and happening more frequently. In your last budget, spending, expenses are up $2.1 billion from the previous year largely due to $2.9 billion earmarked to deal with droughts, wildfires, and floods.

What stops the fires is, number one, education, because 60 percent of them are human-caused; number two, building firebreaks so that we can protect communities; number three, investing in water bomb equipment like De Havilland so that we can fight fires; number four, sharing resources with the rest of the country through the Canadian Forest Fire Association.

Every year I'm going to need to prepare for fires. We've got an aging forest structure. There's, our trees end up dying at about 100 years old. So we've got an aging forest infrastructure. We had the El Nino effect this year. We had a devastating fire season last year. It still means that I've got to pay for that. Like I can't just hope that a carbon tax is going to stop fires from burning in my province. We've got to be able to do both, and we have to be able to do both on a time scale that that makes sense. So I'm going to be planning for fires this year. We hope that they're not devastating. And over the course of the next 25 years we'll be reducing emissions by finding different alternatives, using innovation, and making sure that we get to carbon neutral by 2050, but I just don't think when we're in this, the middle of the affordability crisis, that increasing the cost of everything for individuals when they can't avoid those costs, I just don't think that's fair.

The northwest Galicia region posted a record temperature of 44 C (111 F) in the city of Ourense.</p><p>The extreme heat and lack of rain has caused many wildfires and worsened a drought in many areas. The European Forest Fire Information System says 2022 has been the worst year so far in terms of scorched territory and the number of fires for Spain. The agency says 240,000 hectares (585,00 acres) have been razed in more than 370 fires in Spain.</p><p>Neighbouring Portugal's weather service IPMA also said July was the hottest since national records began in 1931. The average temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius (77.3 degrees Fahrenheit), it said. That was almost 3 degrees C higher than the expected July average.</p><p>To the north in France, last month was the driest July since measurements began in 1959.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow all AP stories on climate change at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-caebe9e8e7679989c01525e1e8f11178</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6643-9P61-JBVR-34P9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"227\"/><timeReceived>01:02 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 8, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As nature dictates with living things, they get old, fall to disease and pests - mostly beetles- and burn, and are reforested with whatever species Mother Nature feels is appropriate for the time. We have seen part of that with nature's forest replacement strategy \u2014 the massive spruce, pine, and Douglas fir bark beetle infestations in mature forests (+/-100-140 years old or so), and forest fire events in the B.C. Interior - setting the stage for its reforestation process. That's nothing new. Fortunately, what is new, to the province's benefit, is that the forest industry and government have jumped in to salvage value and create employment from these events before the trees rot and burn in the previous old cycle of nature. Harvested areas are reforested as part of the forest renewal commitment for future generations. Harvested forest areas are still forest areas. They are full of trees. Young trees. Trees that are growing for our future. Harvested areas are full of biodiversity, too.</p><p>The forest management actions are instrumental in our conservation and protection strategy. Unfortunately, the high-altitude pictures do not tell the full story. You have to get down on the ground to be part of the action.\"</p><p>I would say this represents the opinions of many people involved with the forest industry.</p><p>While the title of the Sun article may infer that the forests will be lost and the Rachel Holt (an ecological consultant) stated in the article we have historically logged a lot of old growth which is never coming back. The article also points out a large area lost to recent wildfires may come back to the original forests in 200-plus years.</p><p>In reference to the logged areas Holt said the second growth of the logged old growth areas, however, will never be the same forest structure they were.</p><p>I think many foresters would agree with Holt that on the timber harvest land base second-growth forest will differ from old-growth since they will not likely be much older than 100 years before they are harvested again.</p><p>In conclusion both the concerned reader and Holt make valid observations about the state of our forests but pests, wildfires and climate change will no doubt impact the anticipated annual harvest calculated prior to these events.</p><p>Time will tell how much the infusion of $300 million dollars will impact the provincial forest industry while it is more likely that market conditions will have the major impact.</p><p>Do you have a comment about this story? email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editor@wltribune.comLike\">editor@wltribune.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Williams Lake Tribune</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-news20230312PWL4447415</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67S0-XRT1-F0HF-81RY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"527\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

More than 5,000 teenage athletes and their coaches from 756 Nations celebrated connections through sport and culture, including several young participants from the Cree Nation. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cree athletes joined other Indigenous youth throughout the province on Team Eastern Door and the North (EDN) at NAIG\u2019s 16 different sports, including the more traditional Indigenous events of canoe/kayak, lacrosse and 3D archery. Darlene Shecapio Macleod was a late replacement as Team EDN\u2019s athletics manager, accompanying the 10 participants from Mistissini. </p><p>\u201cIt was very exciting, especially seeing how proud our youth are,\u201d said Shecapio Macleod. \u201cThis is a great opportunity \u2013 for example, my daughter (Kaylene Shecapio) went there this year for running and she was asked to come and train in Montreal for Team Canada.\u201d </p><p>There was a relatively small contingent from Eeyou Istchee, perhaps due to a lack of promotion or the challenges of travelling to Kahnawake or Mashteuiatsh for tryouts. Forest-fire evacuations prevented some Eastmain athletes from attending. Most Cree participants were on EDN\u2019s basketball teams, including the bronze-medal-winning male U16 team. </p><p>\u201cI was extremely surprised Team EDN was so successful even though they only got together two weeks before for a tournament in Montreal that didn\u2019t go well,\u201d said Tim Matoush, father of 16-year-old Emery. \u201cThe kids started to click when they won their first game. We lost against BC in the first round so for the guys to beat them in the bronze-medal game was the icing on the cake.\u201d </p><p>Emery Matoush emerged as one of the team\u2019s biggest contributors at the Games, leveraging his experience playing Division 2 in Ottawa. Mistissini\u2019s Rupert Weistche and Nolan Gunner were also on the team, the highest ranking of Canada\u2019s entries. Emery spent most of his free time practicing on the courts and was amazed by the Indigenous talent at NAIG. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d never seen Indigenous kids in competition when Emery played for Ottawa,\u201d said Tim. \u201cFor him to see kids from all over North America was mind-blowing. He asked me: \u2018Are these Indigenous kids?\u2019\u201d </p><p>Misha Moses, Cailyn Moses and Anna Faith Iserhoff represented Waskaganish on the U16 female basketball team. \u201cI want youth from my community to try out more often,\u201d said 16-year-old Misha Moses. \u201cHave confidence in yourself. Don\u2019t hesitate about anything and just go for it.\u201d </p><p>Hunter Mianscum from Ouje-Bougoumou started playing golf about four years ago, when his father would take him after work every other day to a course in Chibougamau. Coaches observed that his swing showed promise, which he demonstrated with a top-five performance at his opening day at NAIG before eventually finishing at 16th.   </p><p>Mianscum learned much from his gold-medal-winning roommate Tehorahkwaneken Gary Albany from Kahnawake and made many new friends from across Turtle Island. He was surprised by how huge the Games were, parading with his team at the opening ceremonies like an Olympian before a speech from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. </p><p>\u201cIt was a nice experience staying downtown Halifax for a week,\u201d Mianscum told the Nation. \u201cEvery time we were done our 18 holes, we would head back to our hotel and then drive around on scooters for several hours and explore places none of us had seen before.\u201d </p><p>With most participants never previously witnessing an Indigenous gathering of such magnitude, cultural exchange was equally important as the competition. The young athletes reported an incredible sense of community, often making friends by trading pins at the cultural village. </p><p>With the Games held for the first time in Atlantic Canada, the Mi\u2019kmaq language and culture was prominent in signs, ceremonies and demonstrations at the NAIG cultural village. The cultural village hosted demonstrations of traditional cooking from chef Ray Bear and traditional medicine from Tuma Young along with the ancient Mi\u2019kmaq game of Waltes, beadwork, quillwork, drum making, basket weaving, storytelling and hide tanning.  </p><p>The marketplace at the Halifax Common featured vendors from across the continent while musical performances occurred nightly on the main stage. Unfortunately, catastrophic flooding forced the cancellation of Friday evening\u2019s closing ceremony and concert, which was to include Snotty Nose Rez Kids and Neon Dreams.  </p><p>While the first-ever NAIG were held in Edmonton in 1990, the idea for its creation dates back to the 1970s. Founders Willie Littlechild, Charles Wood and John Fletcher recognized the importance of sports to escape the hardships of residential schools.  </p><p>At an international Indigenous conference presenting the idea in 1977, Littlechild was gifted by a Brazilian Elder with a war arrow representing peace. Pointed downwards to direct anything evil toward the underground, it is now part of the event\u2019s sacred ceremonial run.  </p><p>NAIG 2023 President George (Tex) Marshall of Eskasoni Mi\u2019kmaw Nation explained that the Games provided a safe and welcoming space for teens. \u201cThrough the dark days, sport did save my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my whole purpose in life, to give back to sport because it saved mine and I believe it can save the lives of our youth.\u201d </p><p>Cree athletes suggested expanding the age limit to youth up to 21. Shecapio Macleod encouraged her team to persevere with their athletic dreams, which could take them to the Masters Indigenous Games for adults 20 and over. </p><p>At Mistissini\u2019s recent track meet, she told youth to start training now for the 2027 NAIG in Calgary. She believes the Cree Nation could field a full team, participating in a much wider variety of sporting events than are currently found in communities.  </p><p>\u201cEven though it was some of their last year, it doesn\u2019t stop there,\u201d asserted Shecapio Macleod. \u201cWe need the Cree Nation to introduce other sports besides broomball and hockey. We have a lot of youth who are very athletic, who have that passion for running or wrestling. We need to show our youth all these sports and support them \u2013 there\u2019s so much out there.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-6892aa3d4c14424d9b3cf7d7207a2b93</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YD-GST1-JBVR-33V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1021\"/><timeReceived>10:51 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 14, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp; TRAINERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000171</classCode><className>BASKETBALL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X7K</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000800</classCode><className>GOLF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A0LE</classCode><className>LACROSSE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D9GP</classCode><className>ARCHERY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX059</classCode><className>HALIFAX, NS, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX063</classCode><className>MONTREAL, QC, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX052</classCode><className>OTTAWA, ON, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS173</classCode><className>NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GR120</classCode><className>NORTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The owners of the Titanic used the law after the steamship smashed into an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland in April 1912, killing more than 1,500 people</p><p>Naylor says if a company files an action to protect itself under the act, families have just two months to launch a challenge, which forces them to take on complicated legal procedures in the thick of their grief.</p><p>---</p><p>Here's what else we're watching ...</p><p>Foreign firefighters battling Canada's flames</p><p>Firefighters from around the world have come to Canada to help battle one of the worst wildfire seasons on record.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre says there were nearly 15-hundred on the ground as of yesterday -- coming from 10 different countries on five continents.</p><p>The contingent of foreign firefighters in Canada include teams from the United States, Australia, Portugal, Spain, Chile and Mexico.</p><p>Canada's new wage-fixing ban takes effect today</p><p>New rules prohibiting wage-fixing and no-poaching agreements kick in today in an effort to crack down on companies undermining competition at employees' expense.</p><p>It is now a criminal offence for two or more employers to form deals that fix, maintain, decrease or control wages.</p><p>The same goes for agreements that prevent companies from hiring or soliciting each other's employees.</p><p>It comes after the federal government made amendments to the Competition Act's conspiracy provision in June 2022.</p><p>Charity receives donations after deadly Manitoba bus crash</p><p>Charities in a small Manitoba city say they have seen generosity in the darkest times after families of the 15 people killed in a bus crash donated food and clothing. </p><p>A minibus was carrying the group of seniors from Dauphin and the surrounding area to a casino a week ago, when it went into the path of a semi-trailer truck on the Trans-Canada Highway near the town of Carberry, some 190 kilometres to the south.</p><p>Wayne Olson, community minister for the Church of Christ in Dauphin, says the church\u2019s charities have received items from family members of the crash victims that will greatly benefit those in need in the city. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Dauphin and District Community Foundation started a new fund to support seniors to honour those who had died.

The fire is about half a kilometre to one kilometre from the nearest\u00a0building.</p><p>Schnurr said crews are concentrating their efforts along the edge closest to Highway 340.</p><p>Tingley said because of dry weather, fire departments are seeing an above-average\u00a0number of fires at this point in the season.\u00a0</p><p>\"You know, it's an indication of\u00a0an early start and\u00a0we'll certainly need some\u00a0patterns of rain to kind of moderate it,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Some residents 'a little anxious'</emphasis></p><p>Several homes voluntarily evacuated on Monday, but no official evacuation orders have been issued.</p><p>Wanda Mullen, who lives\u00a0on Highway 340 in\u00a0Hassett, said a fire truck was parked on\u00a0her property on\u00a0Monday evening and she watched as crews hosed\u00a0down\u00a0trees\u00a0to try and keep the perimeter damp and cool.</p><p>She said the crew\u00a0was gone by Tuesday morning, but a firefighter returned in the afternoon\u00a0to let her and her husband know the fire had reached the property next door.</p><p>\"I'm a little anxious, for sure,\"\u00a0said Mullen, who has lived in the area for 36 years. \"We can see a lot more smoke and the smell of smoke is very strong in the area.\"</p><p>The Havelock Wesleyan Church was being used as a comfort centre and\u00a0command centre for the operation.</p><p>Christy Allen Mullen has lived in Hassett for 25 years and said the community is extremely tight-knit - a place where \"everybody talks to everybody.\"</p><p>She said residents have been coming together to help any way they can.

The original equipment purchases had an approximate original value of $254,000 in 2021.  </p><p>Wolf said if a 35 per cent depreciation of the equipment was factored in the remaining value would be around $165,000.  </p><p>As well, the service contains a reserve of $112,000  \u2014 which is unspent money from the original equipment loan \u2014   </p><p>\u201cTherefore, a dissolving of the service at this point has to assume a deficit of approximately $35,000, plus any administrative costs expended in 2023,\u201d said Wolf. </p><p>A report will be brought back the board on how to distribute the deficit once all final costs are known.  </p><p>The next steps would be to tender the completion of the Fauquier project and initiate the sale of the equipment purchased for the pilot.  </p><p>Without the internal utilities construction crew in place some of the projects in the capital plan have to be tendered and delivered through external forces, Wolf explained. </p><p>Keeping it together </p><p>Three people formed the first construction crew in the spring of 2021 \u2014 a permanent site superintendent, a seasonal equipment operator and one labourer.  </p><p>The location for the pilot was chosen with the Fauquier water system, in an area where the regional district had difficulty obtaining bids from private industry.  </p><p>Wolf said the first pilot year was \u201cplagued by several setbacks through external circumstances (COVID-19, record heat in July and August, nearby forest fire with evacuation of the community and shut down of the project, etc.).\u201d  </p><p>The next construction season was greeted with the resignation of the site superintendent, followed by the utilities operations manager (managed the crew and the project).  </p><p>\u201cRecruitment efforts over the late spring and early summer period of 2022 did not provide the intended results to be able to put a new construction crew together on short notice and to be effective for the 2022 construction season,\u201d wrote Wolf.  </p><p>The department was re-structured for 2023 and the pilot was included with the senior project manager position.  </p><p>\u201cAdditional efforts were made to make the positions more attractive in order to increase chance of success in the hiring,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cIn spite of these additional efforts and extended periods of advertising the RDCK was not able to attract sufficient interest from applicants to put together a full crew with the required industry skills to feel comfortable to continue that pilot project in 2023.\u201d  </p><p>In the beginning </p><p>The need for the pilot and the creation of the service began in November 2019 with a report regarding continuing increasing costs in the construction sector and the difficulty receiving cost effective tenders or any tenders at all for utility related projects.  </p><p>\u201cRDCK water systems have a need to replace over 40 kilometres of pipe (specifically asbestos cement pipe) within the next 10 years with an estimated cost of over $40,000,000,\u201d said Wolf in his report.  </p><p>As a result, the board of directors supported the three-year pilot project to determine if some of the projects could be delivered through an in-house construction crew at a lower cost than through private industry.  </p><p>This resolution was the direction to staff in 2020: </p><p>\u201cThat staff be directed to establish an equipped construction crew including hiring of a site superintendent, labourer and equipment operator, and purchasing of an excavator, service trucks, portable office, and all associated equipment with a capital budget not to exceed $355,100 in 2021.\u201d  </p><p>Taking a tally </p><p>The main pieces of equipment and respective approximate purchase prices are:  </p><p>\u2022 excavator: $124,000;  </p><p>\u2022 two trucks: $84,000;  </p><p>\u2022 plate tamper: $16,000;  </p><p>\u2022 shoring cage: $13,000;  </p><p>\u2022 cargo trailer: $7,000; and  </p><p>\u2022 various handheld tools, signs: $10,000.  </p><p>Various departments of the RDCK have expressed interest in the purchase of the two trucks, Wolf explained.  </p><p>Source: RDCK May 18 agenda</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-90406073774f463da4ba1a95505f691f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68HX-2HP1-JBVR-3067-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><timeReceived>04:53 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 23, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

These shifts, combined with forestry policies and climate change effects, greatly increase the risk of catastrophic wildfire.\" - Keith Atkinson, Chair, BC Forest Practices Board (BCFPB)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forestry experts have long warned that forest practices and government policies are intensifying wildfire risk. But industry and government have disregarded numerous studies and persistent calls for action. Practices and policies are little changed. The results have been disastrous as expanses of forest, extensive infrastructure and numerous homes have been razed, and as the air has been fouled and fire suppression costs have multiplied. Increasingly, wildfire ravages more land in less time.</p><p>On June 26, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Service, reported that over 7,600,000 hectares had burned in Canada to date in 2023. That surpassed the previous annual record of 7,560,000 hectares in 1989. Six months of 2023 saw more area destroyed than 12 months of the record year. The average fire in 2023 was four times larger than in 1989. Extreme fire seasons have been common this century.</p><p>In British Columbia to July 4, 2023, 621 fires burned 1,042,000 hectares. In the record year of 2018, 1,354,000 hectares were lost to 2,117 fires. The area burned this year is almost certainly on track to exceed the record year, with most of the two peak fire months yet to be added to the tally. It is also likely that BC's loss to wildfire will top 2 million hectares. Some hope remains that extensive summer rain will intervene, but not much.</p><p>The BCFPB on June 29 released their report, \"Forest and Fire Management in BC\". The report relates that the 2021 wildfire season resulted in $800 million in fire suppression costs and indirect costs as high as $24 billion. Costs include damage to private property and infrastructure and extensive loss of soil productivity, timber supply and wildlife habitat. Since 2018, the province has spent $72 million on fuel reduction measures, says the report, \"almost exclusively\" within the wildland urban interface (WUI).</p><p>The budget for mitigation is dwarfed by fire suppression costs, and is almost non-existent relative to the extensive costs of wildfire, as areas impacted and severity of impact greatly expand. The largest fire in BC history now rages in BC's far north. The Donnie Creek Wildfire, at over 570,000 hectares, has burned an area equivalent to that of BC's entire fifth largest fire season. It is expected to continue to burn through to the end of the season. The destruction of timber and wildlife habitat is already immense.</p><p>Mike Flannigan, a professor of fire science at Thompson River University, told the CBC that without climate change this fire season would have been impossible. \"The warmer it gets, the more efficient the atmosphere is at sucking the moisture of the fuels \u2026 on the forest floor,\" he noted. BC forest scientists fear a loss in the diversity of tree species, and expect vast forested areas will be replaced by grasslands.</p><p>Flanigan co-authored a study concluding, \"Dryer and warmer weather, will increase the incidence of short-interval reburning and amplify the ecological changes such events cause, as wildfire activity and post-fire drought increase synergistically.\" This demands rapid action by government and industry.</p><p>Promisingly, techniques to mitigate risks in forests and reduce wildfire events exist. Governments need only adopt them, and of course pay for them. Forestry experts recommend that fuel reduction measures must be expanded and targeted beyond the WUI. Provincial policy and regulation should require all areas harvested to be reforested, not just with the most economically viable species, but with those species native to the area to improve resilience. Destructive forestry activities, like widespread salvage logging after disasters, should be prohibited. These measures and others provide only part of the solution.</p><p>The BCFPB report recommends \u2013 more accurately, urges \u2013 a comprehensive approach called landscape fire management (LFM). \"LFM is a way to proactively mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires on the broader landscape. It is a restoration approach to addressing forest fuel buildup and improving landscape resilience,\" the report reads. \"Achieving this paradigm shift will require bold and immediate action by the provincial government to align policies and programs across all levels of government with a vision of landscape resilience and co-existence with fire.\"</p><p>LFM will require major effort and a significant budget. Should the BC government continue to avoid the responsibility and the expense, the environment and economy of this province will be irretrievably damaged.</p><p>bruce</p><p>Bruce W Uzelman</p><p>I grew up in Paradise Hill, a village in Northwestern Saskatchewan. I come from a large family. My parents instilled good values, but yet afforded us, my seven siblings and I, much freedom to do the things we wished to do. I spent my early years exploring the hills and forests and fields surrounding the village, a great way to come of age.</p><p>I attended the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. I considered studying journalism at one point, but did not ultimately pursue that. However, I obtained a Bachelor of Arts, Advanced with majors in Economics and Political Science in 1982.</p><p>Contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:urbangeneral@shaw.ca\">urbangeneral@shaw.ca</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230710PAB4490238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68NK-DWT1-JD2C-J0VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"927\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

Unfortunately, the high-altitude pictures do not tell the full story. You have to get down on the ground to be part of the action.</p><p>I would say this represents the opinions of many people involved with the forest industry.</p><p>While the title of the Sun article may infer that the forests will be lost and the main author of the article, Rachel Holt (a ecological consultant), states that \u201cWe\u2019ve always logged (oldgrowth) forest. We\u2019ve lost a lot of it and it\u2019s never coming back.\u201d</p><p>As pointed out in the sun article, about 30 per cent of the 86,000 km2 loss was due to the recent wild fires which may come back to the original forests in 200-plus years.</p><p>In reference to the logged areas she states that, \u201cWhile some of the tree canopy will recover with time, it won\u2019t necessarily be the same forest that comes back. Logged old-growth forests, some of which were many thousands of years old, will never return, replaced instead with second-growth forests of a very different nature.\u201d</p><p>I think many foresters would agree with Rachel Holt that on the timber harvest land base, second-growth forest will differ from old-growth since they will not likely be much older than 100 years before they are harvested again.</p><p>In conclusion both authors make valid observations about the state of our forests, but pests, wild fires and climate change will no doubt impact the anticipated annual harvest calculated prior to these events. Time will tell how much the infusion of $300-million dollars will impact the provincial forest industry while it is more likely that market conditions will have the major impact.</p><p>FOREST INK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CALCOU-news20230309PPOA0003405830</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CALCOU2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67RF-7R11-F0HF-82T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"550\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Nearly 16,000 people have been ordered to leave their homes, say officials. </p><p><br/><br/> One province west in New Brunswick, officials have conceded <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/05/29/400-homes-evacuated-one-destroyed-by-forest-fires-in-southwestern-new-brunswick.html\">a wildfire near the towns of Bocabec and Chamcook will be a \"long, drawn-out firefight\"</url> as it remains uncontrollable as of Monday afternoon. And in Alberta, more than 5,000 residents were still displaced as of this Saturday, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/05/27/drying-conditions-return-in-alberta-crews-see-more-intense-fire-activity.html\">nearly 50 fires continue to ravage the province</url>, 14 of which are listed as out-of-control. <br/><br/> With even more fires expected this wildfire season - which lasts until the end of October in Ontario - here's how to keep safe if you live or are travelling to a fire-prone region. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pack a wildfire emergency kit</emphasis><br/><br/> Ensure you have everything you need if you are forced to evacuate by packing an emergency kit. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/emergency-preparedness/making-an-emergency-kit.html\">The Government of Canada</url> says an emergency kit should be easy to carry and that everyone in a household knows where it's located. A kit should include at least two litres of water per day per person, a flashlight, windup radio, first aid kit and non-perishable food items. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Store flammable material away from your home</emphasis><br/><br/> If you live in an area with a wildfire risk, do not store flammable materials near the perimeter of your house, recommends The Co-operators, a Canadian insurance company. Store wood at least 10 metres away from your house, keep your lawn trimmed to 10 centimetres or less and regularly clear debris, such as branches and leaves, from your gutter, roof and deck. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Follow all official warnings and emergency evacuation orders</emphasis><br/><br/> During wildfire season, it's especially important to stay on top of all advisories and evacuation orders as fires can start and spread rapidly. When outdoor conditions are extremely dry or if firefighting resources are limited, the Ontario government may enact <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov.on.ca/ForestFireInformationMap/index.html?viewer=FFIM.FFIM&amp;locale=en-CA\">a Restricted Fire Zone</url>, prohibiting open fires in certain areas of the province. <br/><br/> It's also imperative to stay informed of any evacuation alerts or orders. The former means you should be prepared to evacuate on short notice, while the latter means you are in danger and should evacuate immediately. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Build a campfire safely</emphasis><br/><br/> During the summer season, Ontario sees an average of one wildfire each day caused by an unextinguished or unattended campfire. Recreational forest users can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-prevent-forest-fires\">prevent wildfires by practicing good campfire safety</url>, including: picking a site sheltered from the wind and near water; clearing a space around the fire; keeping the flame small and never leaving it unattended; and ensuring the fire is properly put out. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Find water if you are outdoors during a wildfire</emphasis><br/><br/> In the unlikely event you are outside during a wildfire, don't outrun the fire, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/forest-fires-safety-information#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20indoors%20during%20a%20wildfire%3A&amp;text=close%20windows%2C%20vents%20and%20blinds,damper%20and%20close%20fireplace%20screens\">the Ontario government recommends</url>. Instead, find a river, pond or lake to crouch in. If you're not near water, head to a low-lying area and breath air closest to the ground, ideally through a moist cloth to avoid inhaling smoke. Cover yourself with soil, dirt or anything that can shield you from the heat of the fire. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What to do if you are forced to evacuate due to wildfire</emphasis><br/><br/> If you are told to evacuate, listen to the radio or TV and choose a route away from fire hazards, advises the provincial government. If possible, wear long-sleeve clothes and covered shoes to protect yourself from ashes and sparks. And if you have time before you leave, pack enough supplies for a week (see the tips for an emergency kit above), turn off the gas line, turn on your lawn sprinklers and move flammable items away from your dwelling. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Keep track of active wildfires</emphasis><br/><br/> You can stay informed and plan your trips properly this summer by keeping track of active wildfires. The Ontario government maintains <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov.on.ca/ForestFireInformationMap/index.html?viewer=FFIM.FFIM&amp;locale=en-CA\">a forest fire info map</url>. Google Maps also has a feature (under \"layers\") that shows users information about the major fires across the country. <br/><br/> Joshua Chong is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star's Express Desk.

Nearly 16,000 people have been ordered to leave their homes, say officials. </p><p><br/><br/> One province west in New Brunswick, officials have conceded <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/05/29/400-homes-evacuated-one-destroyed-by-forest-fires-in-southwestern-new-brunswick.html\">a wildfire near the towns of Bocabec and Chamcook will be a \"long, drawn-out firefight\"</url> as it remains uncontrollable as of Monday afternoon. And in Alberta, more than 5,000 residents were still displaced as of this Saturday, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/05/27/drying-conditions-return-in-alberta-crews-see-more-intense-fire-activity.html\">nearly 50 fires continue to ravage the province</url>, 14 of which are listed as out-of-control. <br/><br/> With even more fires expected this wildfire season - which lasts until the end of October in Ontario - here's how to keep safe if you live or are travelling to a fire-prone region. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pack a wildfire emergency kit</emphasis><br/><br/> Ensure you have everything you need if you are forced to evacuate by packing an emergency kit. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/emergency-preparedness/making-an-emergency-kit.html\">The Government of Canada</url> says an emergency kit should be easy to carry and that everyone in a household knows where it's located. A kit should include at least two litres of water per day per person, a flashlight, windup radio, first aid kit and non-perishable food items. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Store flammable material away from your home</emphasis><br/><br/> If you live in an area with a wildfire risk, do not store flammable materials near the perimeter of your house, recommends The Co-operators, a Canadian insurance company. Store wood at least 10 metres away from your house, keep your lawn trimmed to 10 centimetres or less and regularly clear debris, such as branches and leaves, from your gutter, roof and deck. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Follow all official warnings and emergency evacuation orders</emphasis><br/><br/> During wildfire season, it's especially important to stay on top of all advisories and evacuation orders as fires can start and spread rapidly. When outdoor conditions are extremely dry or if firefighting resources are limited, the Ontario government may enact <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov.on.ca/ForestFireInformationMap/index.html?viewer=FFIM.FFIM&amp;locale=en-CA\">a Restricted Fire Zone</url>, prohibiting open fires in certain areas of the province. <br/><br/> It's also imperative to stay informed of any evacuation alerts or orders. The former means you should be prepared to evacuate on short notice, while the latter means you are in danger and should evacuate immediately. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Build a campfire safely</emphasis><br/><br/> During the summer season, Ontario sees an average of one wildfire each day caused by an unextinguished or unattended campfire. Recreational forest users can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-prevent-forest-fires\">prevent wildfires by practicing good campfire safety</url>, including: picking a site sheltered from the wind and near water; clearing a space around the fire; keeping the flame small and never leaving it unattended; and ensuring the fire is properly put out. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Find water if you are outdoors during a wildfire</emphasis><br/><br/> In the unlikely event you are outside during a wildfire, don't outrun the fire, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/forest-fires-safety-information#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20indoors%20during%20a%20wildfire%3A&amp;text=close%20windows%2C%20vents%20and%20blinds,damper%20and%20close%20fireplace%20screens\">the Ontario government recommends</url>. Instead, find a river, pond or lake to crouch in. If you're not near water, head to a low-lying area and breath air closest to the ground, ideally through a moist cloth to avoid inhaling smoke. Cover yourself with soil, dirt or anything that can shield you from the heat of the fire. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What to do if you are forced to evacuate due to wildfire</emphasis><br/><br/> If you are told to evacuate, listen to the radio or TV and choose a route away from fire hazards, advises the provincial government. If possible, wear long-sleeve clothes and covered shoes to protect yourself from ashes and sparks. And if you have time before you leave, pack enough supplies for a week (see the tips for an emergency kit above), turn off the gas line, turn on your lawn sprinklers and move flammable items away from your dwelling. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Keep track of active wildfires</emphasis><br/><br/> You can stay informed and plan your trips properly this summer by keeping track of active wildfires. The Ontario government maintains <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov.on.ca/ForestFireInformationMap/index.html?viewer=FFIM.FFIM&amp;locale=en-CA\">a forest fire info map</url>. Google Maps also has a feature (under \"layers\") that shows users information about the major fires across the country. <br/><br/> Joshua Chong is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star's Express Desk.

A volunteer (above) dressed for the occasion, while other volunteers (left) helped direct donors when they arrived at the airport.

Waves of viruses tend to ease up on their own as immunity grows within a population, she says, which we haven't reached yet with COVID.</p><p>Instead, the ebb and flow of SARS-CoV-2 has been dictated by our own actions, Colijn added, for instance restrictive measures that limit the ability of the virus to spread.</p><p>\"This isn't a wave, it's a forest fire,\" Colijn said. \"We turn the hoses off and the flames build up again and we get exponential growth. Then we turn the hoses back on and cases decrease.\"</p><p>Colijn, whose modelling predicts steep rises in cases around the end of February in six of Canada's biggest provinces, says the challenge of \"wave language\" is that when waves recede, people think the threat has ceded with it.</p><p>But until we reach levels of herd immunity, she says, that's not going to happen.</p><p>\"We're not seeing a natural tailing off. We're seeing things drop because of restrictions &amp; - those fire hoses we put in front of the fire,\" she said. \"Then we turn the hoses off and we're surprised that this wave is coming back.\"</p><p>Canada's top doctors said Friday that eight provinces have reported cases of new COVID variants, with three of them showing evidence of community transmission.</p><p>Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said there had been 429 cases of the variant first identified in the U.K., 28 cases of the variant first identified in South Africa, and one of the variant first found in Brazil.</p><p>While it sounds like a small number compared to our population, University of Manitoba virologist Jason Kindrachuk says the heightened transmissibility of those variants makes the situation more alarming.</p><p>Compounding things further is that true prevalence of the variants nationwide is unknown, he added, though some jurisdictions have been doing point-prevalence studies to help determine that.</p><p>Kindrachuk says one or two cases, when caught early and isolated, aren't too concerning. But danger proliferates as more pop up.</p><p>\"You have that initial fire and then sparks start flying &amp;#x26;#8230; and that leads to a bunch of small fires,\" he said. \"If those start to catch, you lose the ability to necessarily keep things in control.\"</p><p>Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, says the presence of more transmissible variants means people should be more diligent in adhering to current safety measures aimed at slowing the spread of other COVID strains, including limiting contacts, mask-wearing and distancing.</p><p>The spike in variant cases comes at a time when Canada appears to be \"two-thirds of the way down the curve,\" Tam said, as overall COVID cases fall.</p><p>Some jurisdictions, like Ontario, have taken that as reason to reopen.

Waves of viruses tend to ease up on their own as immunity grows within a population, she says, which we haven't reached yet with COVID.</p><p>Instead, the ebb and flow of SARS-CoV-2 has been dictated by our own actions, Colijn added, for instance restrictive measures that limit the ability of the virus to spread.</p><p>\"This isn't a wave, it's a forest fire,\" Colijn said. \"We turn the hoses off and the flames build up again and we get exponential growth. Then we turn the hoses back on and cases decrease.\" </p><p>Colijn, whose modelling predicts steep rises in cases around the end of February in six of Canada's biggest provinces, says the challenge of \"wave language\" is that when waves recede, people think the threat has ceded with it.</p><p>But until we reach levels of herd immunity, she says, that's not going to happen.</p><p>\"We're not seeing a natural tailing off. We're seeing things drop because of restrictions \u2014 those fire hoses we put in front of the fire,\" she said. \"Then we turn the hoses off and we're surprised that this wave is coming back.\"</p><p>Canada's top doctors said Friday that eight provinces have reported cases of new COVID variants, with three of them showing evidence of community transmission.</p><p>Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said there had been 429 cases of the variant first identified in the U.K., 28 cases of the variant first identified in South Africa, and one of the variant first found in Brazil.</p><p>While it sounds like a small number compared to our population, University of Manitoba virologist Jason Kindrachuk says the heightened transmissibility of those variants makes the situation more alarming.</p><p>Compounding things further is that true prevalence of the variants nationwide is unknown, he added, though some jurisdictions have been doing point-prevalence studies to help determine that. </p><p>Kindrachuk says one or two cases, when caught early and isolated, aren't too concerning. But danger proliferates as more pop up.</p><p>\"You have that initial fire and then sparks start flying ... and that leads to a bunch of small fires,\" he said. \"If those start to catch, you lose the ability to necessarily keep things in control.\" </p><p>Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, says the presence of more transmissible variants means people should be more diligent in adhering to current safety measures aimed at slowing the spread of other COVID strains, including limiting contacts, mask-wearing and distancing.</p><p>The spike in variant cases comes at a time when Canada appears to be \"two-thirds of the way down the curve,\" Tam said, as overall COVID cases fall.</p><p>Some jurisdictions, like Ontario, have taken that as reason to reopen. Most of the province is moving away from its stay-at-home orders next week, even though projections released Thursday show a potentially rapid rise by late February. </p><p>Dr. Andrew Morris, an infectious disease expert with the University of Toronto, says reopening Ontario now could lead to further lockdowns in the province later.</p><p>\"I anticipate our numbers over the next two weeks are going to be pretty good, but it's four weeks from now, six weeks from now that I'm most concerned about,\" he said.</p><p>Troy Day, a COVID modeler out of Queen's University, says the problem with the variants is that they're still lurking beneath the surface.

Another major blaze on the outskirts of Athens torched homes, reducing some to piles of smoking rubble, and encroached into the national park on Mount Parnitha, one of the last green areas near the Greek capital. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From Friday to Tuesday, 355 wildfires broke out, Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said. On Wednesday, firefighters were tackling 99 blazes, fire department spokesman Ioannis Artopios said in an evening briefing, including 55 that had broken out in the previous 24 hours.</p><p>Authorities made 140 wildfire-related arrests, including 117 for negligence and 23 for deliberate arson, Artopios said, adding that nearly all were for heat-inducing or agricultural outdoor work. </p><p>Gale-force winds combined with hot, dry weather to whip up the flames, making the blazes exceptionally difficult to bring under control, authorities said.</p><p>Weather conditions this summer have been \u201cthe worst since meteorological data have been gathered and the fire risk map has been issued in the country,\u201d Kikilias told a news conference. Extensive parts of Greece have been placed at Level 5, the highest for fire risk, seven times this year, which Kikilias said was double the number of 2021, four times that of 2019 and seven times more than in 2012. </p><p>Authorities issued dozens of evacuation orders for villages, Alexandroupolis' outskirts and seaside areas, with the coast guard and private boats plucking some people from beaches and coasts. </p><p>Although winds were gradually abating in many parts of the country, the risk of new fires remained high.</p><p>\u201cConditions remain difficult and in many cases extreme,\u201d Artopios said.</p><p>Firefighters searching recently burnt areas in the Alexandroupolis region, which is near the border with Turkey, discovered the bodies of 18 people believed to be migrants in a forest Tuesday. </p><p>Alexandroupolis coroner Pavlos Pavlidis told The Associated Press all were male and two were minors between 10 and 15 years old. </p><p>Greece's Disaster Victim Identification Team was tasked with identifying the bodies and was setting up a telephone hotline that would operate 9am-5pm local time (0600GMT-1400GMT) from Thursday in English, Arabic, Pashto, Turkish and Urdu for potential relatives of the victims.</p><p>Two other people died Monday, one in northern and one in central Greece.</p><p>With firefighting forces stretched to the limit, Greece asked other European countries for assistance. Germany, Sweden, Croatia and Cyprus sent water-dropping aircraft. Romanian, French and Czech firefighters helped on the ground. </p><p>Evacuations were ordered for several neighborhoods and a migrant camp on the northwestern fringe of the Greek capital, as a wildfire that started Tuesday raced up a mountain toward Parnitha national park, threatened a military base and torched homes in the foothills.</p><p>More than 200 firefighters backed by volunteers, military and police forces, were battling the blaze, supported until nightfall by 12 planes and 14 helicopters. In Alexandroupolis, 17 planes and eight helicopters provided air support to the ground firefighting forces. </p><p>Supreme Court prosecutor Georgia Adilini asked the Alexandroupolis prosecutor to launch investigations into whether organized arson groups were operating in the region. Kikilias said the fire in the northeastern border region started in 15 different places inside a forest, with strong winds and dry conditions contributing to create a massive fire front.</p><p>\u201cAny firefighting forces, no matter how strong they were, would not have been able to bring it under control,\u201d Kikilias said. </p><p>Adilini also asked the Alexandroupolis prosecutor to investigate incidents of racist violence after police arrested three men on suspicion of imprisoning 13 migrants whom they accused of being linked to the wildfire.</p><p>One Albanian and two Greeks were charged Wednesday with a series of crimes, including kidnapping, and were being held pending a preliminary court hearing. A video posted online showed one of them referring to the migrants in terminology used for livestock and urging members of the public to round up migrants.</p><p>Across the border in Turkey\u2019s Canakkale province, strong winds fanned a wildfire for a second day. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said winds reaching 70 kilometers (40 miles) per hour at times were hampering efforts to extinguish the blaze but said firefighters had managed to halt its spread.</p><p>\u201cHopefully, we will get it under control soon,\u201d Erdogan said in a televised address.</p><p>Ibrahim Yumakli, Turkey\u2019s forestry minister, said firefighting teams and more than two dozen fire-dousing planes and helicopters had largely blocked the blaze from spreading beyond the 15 square kilometers (5.8 square miles) it had already affected. </p><p>Authorities suspended maritime traffic through the narrow Dardanelles Strait linking the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara, which the water-dropping aircraft were using to refill, the minister said.</p><p>Authorities evacuated an elderly care home and more than 1,250 people from nine villages and closed down a highway. Hospitals treated more than 80 people for the effects of smoke.</p><p>Erdogan urged citizens to exercise care and help prevent wildfires.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, more than 90% of fires in our country are caused by humans,\" he said. \"Negligence or carelessness lead to great disasters.\" </p><p>In Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands, authorities said a wildfire burning for more than a week was nearly under control after scorching 150 square kilometers (58 square miles).</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very tough battle that the firefighting teams are winning,\u201d said Canary regional government counselor Manuel Miranda. </p><p>Spain is sweltering under its fourth heat wave this summer. The country's weather service said up to 16 temperature records for August were broken Tuesday.</p><p>Sporadic fires were also reported in Italy, which has been engulfed in a heat wave expected to extend into the weekend with temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius (100 F) in many cities. </p><p>With their hot, dry summers, southern European countries are particularly prone to wildfires.</p><p>European Union officials have blamed climate change for the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in Europe, noting that 2022 was the second-worst year for wildfire damage on record after 2017.</p><p>___</p><p>Kantouris reported from Alexandroupolis.

(\"ALS GoldSpot\"), located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay territory in Quebec. Figure 1 illustrates QPM's land position and the location of high priority targets for the three projects based on the findings of the Study.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are very excited to sample the target areas to further demonstrate the lithium potential of our projects in a district that has some of the largest spodumene pegmatite resources in the world.</p><p>All our projects are highly prospective for lithium and are located near advanced projects and recent significant lithium discoveries\" commented Normand Champigny, CEO.</p><p>The Study began in the spring (see press release of March 27, 2023). Target generation was undertaken by an exhaustive compilation, extraction and integration of geochemical, geophysical and geological data using geoscience expertise coupled with ALS GoldSpot's proprietary data analytics workflows. The high priority targets were generated using a total of 52,289 rock samples and 8,278 sediment (soil and till) samples. The data compilation stems from over 150 technical reports using artificial intelligence to query relevant geochemical and geological signatures of lithium bearing formations. The analysis resulted in the generation of detailed maps showing targets, zones and areas of focus for further exploration. The Study is being supplemented by the acquisition and analysis of high resolution imagery and topography.</p><p>Sakami project (281 claims, 143 km2, 16 km2 high priority) and Elmer East project (889 claims, 467 km2, 45 km2 high priority) - The Sakami project is hosted within a volcano-sedimentary sequence of the Yasinski Group, which is metamorphosed to amphibolite facies and is strongly deformed by a regional west-southwest to east-northeast event in contact with sedimentary rocks of the Laguiche Group (Opinaca geological Subprovince) to the east (Figure 3). The Elmer East project consists of different parts of the Eastmain volcano-sedimentary belt. Two of the Elmer East claim blocks are located on the eastern edge of the Duxbury batholith and are composed of the Bernou and Pilipas formations (Figure 2).</p><p>For both projects, key mineral indicators and rock geochemistry highlight Li-Cs-Ta pegmatite anomalies and a favorable distinct felsic intrusion trend. Major ductile structures bordering volcanosedimentary domains control the distribution of Li-Cs-Ta mineralization. Li-Cs-Ta indicators are associated with known lithium deposits in the region. Small felsic intrusions proximal to the structures are also of interest. It is to be noted that for the Sakami project the lithium targets identified have sometimes overlapping potential for the discovery of both lithium-bearing pegmatites and gold mineralization. Approximately 10 km southwest of the Elmer East project, Brunswick Exploration Inc. recently disclosed lithium discovered through inaugural drilling at their Anatacau West project.</p><p>Cheechoo-Eleonore Trend project (128 claims, 66 km2, 64 km2 high priority) - Two main lithologic assemblages, are present: metasediments of the Laguiche complex and intrusive rocks associated with the granitic suite of the Vieux Comptoir. The latter is essentially formed of a series of granitic intrusions more or less rich in alkaline feldspar and generally poor in mafic minerals. Spodumene and K-feldspar granites have been observed. The abundance of pegmatites and geochemical anomalies suggest a strong lithium potential (Figure 4).</p><p>Follow-up field program</p><p>The access and travel restrictions imposed by the Government of Quebec in response to the unprecedented forest fire situation persisting since early June remain in place across a significant part of the region. The Company will be mobilizing in September field personnel to visit the high priority target areas and conduct surface sampling. Results are expected in the fall. All pegmatite samples will be assayed with the analytical method ME-MS89L (+ME-MS81D for Al, Zr and Sc).</p><p>Increased exposure to lithium</p><p>In addition to the lithium targets identified on its own projects, QPM owns 12 million shares of Champion Electric Metals Inc. (\"Champion Electric\"). These shares are currently valued at approximately $1.4 M and were received following the acquisition by Champion Electric in 2022 of the Blanche and Charles project located near Patriot Battery Metals' lithium discovery on its Corvette project. Champion Electric controls 1,036 claims covering 529 km2 in the lithium-rich James Bay region and is currently carrying out an extensive surface exploration program.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Normand Champigny, Eng., Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Qualified Person under NI 43-101 on standards of disclosure for mineral projects, has prepared and reviewed the content of this press release.</p><p>About ALS GoldSpot</p><p>ALS GoldSpot is a Canada-based group of expert geoscientists and data scientists who utilize computational methods (such as Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and numerical modelling) to assist mining and exploration clients. ALS GoldSpot offers unique processes to focus exploration efforts, minimize client risk related to exploration targeting, and optimize aspects of conventional resource exploration workflows. Its diverse geoscience and data science technical teams combine proprietary technology with in-depth expertise in mineral exploration, mineral resources, and mining to offer robust and actionable solutions to its clients and partners. While mineral exploration and mining have become data-rich environments, the value of data is lost when datasets become so large that they cannot effectively be integrated into decision making. Its expertise and solutions target such big data problems, processing or integrating underutilized data to better comprehend resource property potential.</p><p>About Quebec Precious Metals Corporation</p><p>QPM is primarily focused on advancing its Sakami gold project, located in Eeyou Istchee James Bay territory in Quebec, near Newmont Corporation's Eleonore gold mine. In addition the Company holds a 68% interest in the Kipawa/Zeus rare earths project located near Temiscaming, Quebec. This is the only rare earths project in North America which has a fully completed feasibility study.</p><p>For more information please contact:</p><p>Normand Champigny</p><p>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>Tel.: 514 979-4746</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:nchampigny@qpmcorp.ca\">nchampigny@qpmcorp.ca</email></p><p>Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2023 Market News Publishing Inc.

(\"ALS GoldSpot\"), located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay territory in Quebec. Figure 1 illustrates QPM's land position and the location of high priority targets for the three projects based on the findings of the Study.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are very excited to sample the target areas to further demonstrate the lithium potential of our projects in a district that has some of the largest spodumene pegmatite resources in the world. <br/>All our projects are highly prospective for lithium and are located near advanced projects and recent significant lithium discoveries\" commented Normand Champigny, CEO.</p><p>The Study began in the spring (see press release of March 27, 2023). Target generation was undertaken by an exhaustive compilation, extraction and integration of geochemical, geophysical and geological data using geoscience expertise coupled with ALS GoldSpot's proprietary data analytics workflows. The high priority targets were generated using a total of 52,289 rock samples and 8,278 sediment (soil and till) samples. The data compilation stems from over 150 technical reports using artificial intelligence to query relevant geochemical and geological signatures of lithium bearing formations. The analysis resulted in the generation of detailed maps showing targets, zones and areas of focus for further exploration. The Study is being supplemented by the acquisition and analysis of high resolution imagery and topography.</p><p>Sakami project (281 claims, 143 km2, 16 km2 high priority) and Elmer East project (889 claims, 467 km2, 45 km2 high priority) - The Sakami project is hosted within a volcano-sedimentary sequence of the Yasinski Group, which is metamorphosed to amphibolite facies and is strongly deformed by a regional west-southwest to east-northeast event in contact with sedimentary rocks of the Laguiche Group (Opinaca geological Subprovince) to the east (Figure 3). The Elmer East project consists of different parts of the Eastmain volcano-sedimentary belt. Two of the Elmer East claim blocks are located on the eastern edge of the Duxbury batholith and are composed of the Bernou and Pilipas formations (Figure 2).</p><p>For both projects, key mineral indicators and rock geochemistry highlight Li-Cs-Ta pegmatite anomalies and a favorable distinct felsic intrusion trend. Major ductile structures bordering volcanosedimentary domains control the distribution of Li-Cs-Ta mineralization. Li-Cs-Ta indicators are associated with known lithium deposits in the region. Small felsic intrusions proximal to the structures are also of interest. It is to be noted that for the Sakami project the lithium targets identified have sometimes overlapping potential for the discovery of both lithium-bearing pegmatites and gold mineralization. Approximately 10 km southwest of the Elmer East project, Brunswick Exploration Inc. recently disclosed lithium discovered through inaugural drilling at their Anatacau West project.</p><p>Cheechoo-Eleonore Trend project (128 claims, 66 km2, 64 km2 high priority) - Two main lithologic assemblages, are present: metasediments of the Laguiche complex and intrusive rocks associated with the granitic suite of the Vieux Comptoir. The latter is essentially formed of a series of granitic intrusions more or less rich in alkaline feldspar and generally poor in mafic minerals. Spodumene and K-feldspar granites have been observed. The abundance of pegmatites and geochemical anomalies suggest a strong lithium potential (Figure 4).</p><p>Follow-up field program</p><p>The access and travel restrictions imposed by the Government of Quebec in response to the unprecedented forest fire situation persisting since early June remain in place across a significant part of the region. The Company will be mobilizing in September field personnel to visit the high priority target areas and conduct surface sampling. Results are expected in the fall. All pegmatite samples will be assayed with the analytical method ME-MS89L (+ME-MS81D for Al, Zr and Sc).</p><p>Increased exposure to lithium</p><p>In addition to the lithium targets identified on its own projects, QPM owns 12 million shares of Champion Electric Metals Inc. (\"Champion Electric\"). These shares are currently valued at approximately $1.4 M and were received following the acquisition by Champion Electric in 2022 of the Blanche and Charles project located near Patriot Battery Metals' lithium discovery on its Corvette project. Champion Electric controls 1,036 claims covering 529 km2 in the lithium-rich James Bay region and is currently carrying out an extensive surface exploration program.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Normand Champigny, Eng., Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Qualified Person under NI 43-101 on standards of disclosure for mineral projects, has prepared and reviewed the content of this press release.</p><p>About ALS GoldSpot</p><p>ALS GoldSpot is a Canada-based group of expert geoscientists and data scientists who utilize computational methods (such as Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and numerical modelling) to assist mining and exploration clients.

That\u2019s not in the forecast, said operations director Cliff Chapman, although the recent showers gave crews an opportunity to use suppression tactics on several blazes in the northeast, including a massive fire burning within two kilometres of the Alaska Highway. Over the long term, he said, underlying drought means it won\u2019t take much warming to return the landscape to conditions \u201cvery prone\u201d to ignition and spread of wildfires. \u201cComing out of the winter with drought, breaking temperature records in late April, early May, doing it again in June \u2026 we\u2019re in a tricky spot,\u201d Chapman said. </p><p>The wildfire service is expecting up to 20 millimetres of rain in parts of B.C. over the coming days, and that could help in the short term, he said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be enough to knock down the hazard as we enter into July and August, which typically set up as our warmer, drier, hotter months.\u201d The BC Wildfire Service reports more than 80 active wildfires across the province on Wednesday, including four \u201cwildfires of note\u201d that are highly visible or pose a potential threat to public safety. Forests Minister Bruce Ralston said fires have scorched 7,620 square kilometres of land since April, mostly in the northeast, dwarfing the 20-year average of 180 square kilometres at the same stage of the season. Chapman said the province currently has enough capacity to manage the situation, although the wildfire service has notified the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre that it might need more support over the coming weeks. An incident management team could arrive from the United States as soon as this weekend to provide some rest for one of six B.C.-based teams, he said. The Peace River Regional District has posted an evacuation alert for a stretch of the Alaska Highway that connects Yukon and northern B.C. to the rest of the province as the 4,875-square-kilometre Donnie Creek fire burns south of Fort Nelson. If the out-of-control blaze \u2014 the second biggest in B.C.</p><p>history \u2014 cuts the highway, some northern residents could face a detour of more than 1,700 kilometres if they need to travel south on main roads. Little rain from recent storms reached the Donnie Creek blaze on Tuesday, but downpours around the community of Dawson Creek calmed the nearly 200-square-kilometre Kiskatinaw wildfire that\u2019s burning within a few kilometres of the community of Tumbler Ridge, which was evacuated six days ago. More than 2,750 people are currently under evacuation orders in Tumbler Ridge, the Peace River Regional District and the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality, Minister of Emergency management Bowinn Ma said Wednesday. Ma encouraged all B.C. residents to register with the province\u2019s Emergency Support Services program, saying evacuees who are registered will be processed more quickly at reception centres and be able to get help right away. The Chief of the Doig River First Nation near Fort Nelson said the Donnie Creek fire has claimed a handful of trapline cabins, and people are working to protect others. Chief Trevor Makadahay said Tuesday that his community is as ready as it can be to evacuate if winds push flames from the north. Residents, especially elders, are staying indoors and using air purifiers to cope with the heavy wildfire smoke blanketing the area, he said. On Vancouver Island, the wildfire that forced closure of the main highway connecting communities including Port Alberni, Tofino and Uclulet with the rest of the region is now classified as \u201cbeing held,\u201d meaning it\u2019s not likely to spread beyond the predetermined boundaries under current conditions. Wildfire crews have been establishing control lines around the roughly two-square-kilometre blaze that sent debris tumbling onto the highway east of Port Alberni. Safety concerns are expected to keep the stretch of Highway 4 closed until at least June 24, officials announced Tuesday. A lengthy and challenging detour is being used to allow people and supplies to reach the cut-off communities, but it\u2019s meant to be used only for essential travel. Janelle Staite with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure said the detour is working \u201cvery effectively,\u201d with convoys of trucks delivering supplies daily. \u201cWe\u2019ve been given the OK from (the) BC Wildfire Service to start some clean-up work below the fire slope, which is setting us on the trajectory to be able to re-open Highway 4 to single-lane alternating traffic by next weekend,\u201d she said Wednesday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20230616PTEA0003660991</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68GP-3S71-F0HF-80G4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

(the Company or Canada Silver Cobalt) is pleased to provide a significant update on the ongoing lithogeochemical mapping and exploration efforts in the St. Denis and Sangster claims located in Ontario directly south of James Bay near the Quebec border contiguous to Power Metals Case Lake Lithium properties and accessible by roads from Cochrane (38 km) and Timmins (85 km).</p><p>The St-Denis Project area is 26,373 hectares (including 24,036 hectares in the St-Denis Main block and 2,337 hectares in the Sangster block) and is one of the largest land holdings in the emerging Case Lake LCT (lithium-cesium-tantalum) pegmatite district of Northeastern Ontario. The property is strategically positioned over an ideal geological environment for pegmatite mineralization, as demonstrated by a number of observations of pegmatite in outcrop and drill core in the historic assessment work files and government mapping. The Project is supported by year-round ease of access, proximity to services and suppliers in the mining communities of Timmins and Cochrane, and location along strike to a known LCT (lithium-cesium-tantalum) pegmatite occurrence (Case Lake LCT pegmatite swarm).</p><p>At the St. Denis claims, Canada Silver Cobalt has discovered multiple pegmatites in the Circle Lake Road area. Many individual outcrops contain multiple pegmatites. In this phase, instead of sampling each pegmatite individually, sample spacing was prioritized due to time constraints imposed by the weather and a late start to the 2023 field season due to forest fire activity in the area. Maximizing sample spacing allows us to build a representative Lithogeochemical map which will enhance our ability to vector further exploration towards more fertile ground.</p><p>The Company has taken 36 samples from the Circle Lake Road area of the St. Denis claims, a key area of interest for our exploration activities. Of these 36 samples, 21 are channel samples, and 12 samples were extracted from identified pegmatite formations. Canada Silver Cobalt has further utilized portable XRF (X-ray fluorescence) analyses on these samples to correlate with lab values, thereby evaluating XRF as an in-field vectoring tool, demonstrating a commitment to adopting advanced technologies to enhance exploration accuracy. Two main sample areas have been targeted on Circle Lake Road, area 1 circle lake south where 15 samples were collected in an area approximately 2km by 1km and area 2 circle lake north where 18 samples were collected in a 1.5km by 200m area.</p><p>The Circle Lake Road area has proven to be highly advantageous for the Company, with excellent outcrop exposure in numerous locations. Notably, the presence of xenoliths identified in the granite is an additional encouraging sign, suggesting proximity to the granite dome, a geological feature often associated with valuable mineralization. This discovery underscores the potential for significant mineral deposits within the area. Furthermore, the identification of indicator minerals, such as garnet and muscovite, is a promising sign.</p><p>The latest developments at the St. Denis property (see map below) build on the recent successes at the Sangster West property including the identification and sampling of expanses of numerous pegmatites up to 20 metres wide and 70 metres long along with identification of pathfinder metals (see news release October 17, 2023).</p><p>Matthew Halliday, President and COO of Canada Silver Cobalt, expressed his enthusiasm for these developments, stating, \"Our progress is encouraging. We want to get a balance between the number of samples and the distance between them in the area, for both the granite and the pegmatites. This will allow our Lithogeochemical map to provide vectors for the next phase of exploration. It is encouraging to see pegmatite dykes in outcrop and some of the main indications that we are in the right area.\"</p><p>Canada Silver Cobalt remains dedicated to advancing its exploration efforts and unlocking the full potential of the St. Denis and Sangster claims. The Company's commitment to utilizing cutting-edge technologies, such as portable XRF analysis, underlines its commitment to efficient and effective resource assessment.</p><p>Figure 1: Channel Sample with Pegmatite - Circle Lake Road</p><p>Figure 2: Map showing Sangster and St. Denis Projects in relation to James Bay and Timmins</p><p>Figure 3: Map of Sangster and St. Denis Projects</p><p>The Company remains committed to responsible resource development and continues to engage with local communities, Indigenous groups, and stakeholders to ensure transparent and collaborative communication throughout our exploration activities.</p><p>Investors, media, and stakeholders are invited to stay updated on the latest developments by visiting the Company's website at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canadasilvercobaltworks.com/\">https://www.canadasilvercobaltworks.com/</url>.</p><p>Qualified person</p><p>The technical information in this news release was approved by and prepared under the supervision of Mr. Matthew Halliday, P.Geo., (PGO), President and COO of Canada Silver Cobalt Works Inc., a qualified person in accordance with National Instrument 43-101.</p><p>About Canada Silver Cobalt Works Inc.</p><p>Canada Silver Cobalt Works Inc. recently discovered a major high-grade silver vein system at Castle East located 1.5 km from its 100%-owned, past-producing Castle Mine near Gowganda in the prolific and world-class silver-cobalt mining district of Northern Ontario. The Company has completed a 60,000m drill program aimed at expanding the size of the deposit with an update to the resource estimate underway.</p><p>In May 2020, based on a small initial drill program, the Company published the regions first 43-101 resource estimate that contained a total of 7.56 million ounces of silver in Inferred resources, comprising very high-grade silver (8,582 grams per tonne un-cut or 250.2 oz/ton) in 27,400 tonnes of material from two sections (1A and 1B) of the Castle East Robinson Zone, beginning at a vertical depth of approximately 400 meters. Note that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Please refer to Canada Silver Cobalt Works Press Release May 28, 2020, for the resource estimate. Report reference: Rachidi, M. 2020, NI 43-101 Technical Report Mineral Resource Estimate for Castle East, Robinson Zone, Ontario, Canada, with an effective date of May 28, 2020, and a signature date of July 13, 2020.</p><p>The Company also has: (1) 14 battery metals properties in Northern Quebec where it has recently completed a nearly 16,000-metre drill program on the Graal property; and (2) the prospective 1,000-hectare Eby-Otto gold property close to Agnico Eagles high-grade Macassa Mine near Kirkland Lake, Ontario where it is exploring. (3) lithium property 230 square kilometers of greenfield exploration ground focussed along a significant volcanic sedimentary rock Archean granite contact near Cochrane, Ontario contiguous to Power Metals Case Lake Lithium properties.</p><p>Canada Silver Cobalts flagship silver-cobalt Castle mine and 78 sq. km Castle Property feature strong exploration upside for silver, cobalt, nickel, gold, and copper.

Wildfire Service budget soared to $500 million and an estimated $80 million in tourism and other economic costs in the Central Okanagan alone. The urgency was reinforced by another severe fire season in 2009, where the bill reached $400 million.</p><p>\u201cMany of the 2003 and 2009 fires occurred in areas where fuels had accumulated over decades, and during dry, hot weath-er conditions, these fires became very large and intense,\u201d says the province\u2019s Wildland Fire Management Strategy, released in 2010 and still in effect today.</p><p>\u201cFires like this remove so much forest cover that soil productivity can be reduced and soil erosion can lead to flooding, landslides, decreased water quality and a variety of other negative consequences.\u201d</p><p>Local politics is one impediment to changing an aggressive timber protection that started in the late 1940s as post-war heavy equipment and aircraft became available. Prescribed burns in spring produce heavy smoke, and for decades logging restrictions focused on preserving \u201cview corridors\u201d along highways and around communities, accumulating fuel in the highest-risk locations.</p><p>In the latest revamp of forest policy, Premier John Horgan and Forests Minister Katrine Conroy have committed to more use of prescribed burning to reduce fuel load, citing Indigenous forest burn practices that cleaned out underbrush to make forests passable for migration and hunting.</p><p>Fuel cleanup around communities has proceeded slowly since the recommendations made after the 2003 fires. This past June, racing for another hot summer of wildfires, the B.C. government added $20 million more to its community resiliency fund. The program has assisted 116 B.C. communities with wildfire risk reduction work since 2018, when it was set up in response to back-to-back record wildfire years in B.C. The Union of B.C. Municipalities administers the community grant fund, along with the First Nations\u2019 Emergency Services Society of B.C. The next application intake begins June 30, for projects including residential fuel reduction, critical infrastructure protection, FireSmart training, emergency management, community planning and inter-agency cooperation.</p><p>Communities that can demonstrate high wildfire risk can apply for up to $150,000 to cover up to 100 per cent of project costs, while lower-risk communities can apply for up to $50,000.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLEHFP-news20210729UAEA0002036904</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6380-6DF1-F0HF-82H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Although none of the girls collected a medal in the final leg of the competition, they found value in the experience.</p><p>Emma Harrington, 17, constructed a prototype of a portable fire extinguisher that could be used for hiking and camping.</p><p>Her experiment involved testing an On-the-Go extinguisher \u2014 a product currently available on the market \u2014 and making improvements to its design.</p><p>Harrington often carries an On-the-Go with her when she camps and hikes in case a campfire gets out of hand, but she has never actually had to use it in an emergency. She did test the device during an experiment however, and she found the trigger was difficult to pull and that not all of the CO2 released.</p><p>\"It would hurt to pull, just because it was a piece of metal,\" she said.</p><p>She lit a few controlled fires in pits in her backyard in order to compare the two devices.</p><p>\"Although the fires were being extinguished, the embers weren't cooling down, so there was still that chance of the fire relighting,\" she added.</p><p>She constructed a new trigger using a 3D printer and she added a sleeve to her model to reduce the risk of frostbite when Co2 is ejected.</p><p>\"With the 3D printed design it's more comfortable to use. It's lightweight. It's smaller \u2026 I wanted to add in a sleeve just to give people protection from frostbite rather than having to carry gloves and the portable fire extinguisher.\"</p><p>Harrington has family members who were impacted by the wildfires in Fort McMurray and this was the inspiration behind her project.</p><p>\"I was thinking about what I could do to help with the forest fire situation. Family members of mine and close people in my life have been affected by forest fires and have needed to evacuate from their homes, so I wanted to make something to prevent more people from having to do that.\"</p><p>READ MORE: Mount Baker student showing scientific invention at Canada-Wide Science Fair</p><p>Isla Barron, 16, developed a theoretical concept rather than a device. She created a scheme for recycling clothing based on Return-It's system for plastics, paper and bottles.</p><p>\"A lot of my generation, we wear whatever's new and trendy at that time. When we're done with it and it's not considered cool anymore, we'll just throw it away and that's really harmful for the environment so I thought I'd try and make a system that would prevent this,\" she explained.</p><p>Like Return-It, her system would be deposit-based. A small deposit would be charged on clothing, that would be refunded to the buyer when it is recycled.</p><p>Higher-end or lightly-used clothing could be sent to thrift stores, while damaged or worn clothing could be repurposed to make household objects or entirely new outfits.</p><p>A similar project was launched in Vancouver in 2019, but it shut down because its limited network of organizations \u2014 which it supplied clothes to \u2014 couldn't keep up with the demand. Barron investigated how this network could expand to ensure the project is more sustainable in the long-term.</p><p>Peighten Catsirelis and Annaliese Froehler, 13, teamed up to test how effective different types of sea walls are at protecting populations from tsunamis.</p><p>They used a foam mat to create a slope in a large plastic container and filled it with water. Then they created sea walls out of different kinds of materials \u2014 fish pebbles, a wooden board and piece of pipe.

Although none of the girls collected a medal in the final leg of the competition, they found value in the experience.</p><p>Emma Harrington, 17, constructed a prototype of a portable fire extinguisher that could be used for hiking and camping.</p><p>Her experiment involved testing an On-the-Go extinguisher \u2014 a product currently available on the market \u2014 and making improvements to its design. Harrington often carries an On-the-Go with her when she camps and hikes in case a campfire gets out of hand, but she has never actually had to use it in an emergency. She did test the device during an experiment however, and she found the trigger was difficult to pull and that not all of the CO2 released.</p><p>\u201cIt would hurt to pull, just because it was a piece of metal,\u201d she said.</p><p>She lit a few controlled fires in pits in her backyard in order to compare the two devices.</p><p>\u201cAlthough the fires were being extinguished, the embers weren\u2019t cooling down, so there was still that chance of the fire relighting,\u201d she added.</p><p>She constructed a new trigger using a 3D printer and she added a sleeve to her model to reduce the risk of frost-bite when Co2 is ejected.</p><p>\u201cWith the 3D printed design it\u2019s more comfortable to use. It\u2019s lightweight. It\u2019s smaller \u2026 I wanted to add in a sleeve just to give people protection from frostbite rather than having to carry gloves and the portable fire extinguisher.\u201d</p><p>Harrington has family members who were impacted by the wildfires in Fort McMurray and this was the inspiration behind her project.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about what I could do to help with the forest fire situation. Family members of mine and close people in my life have been affected by forest fires and have needed to evacuate from their homes, so I wanted to make something to prevent more people from having to do that.\u201d</p><p>Isla Barron, 16, developed a theoretical concept rather than a device. She created a scheme for recycling clothing based on Return-It\u2019s system for plastics, paper and bottles.</p><p>\u201cA lot of my generation, we wear whatever\u2019s new and trendy at that time. When we\u2019re done with it and it\u2019s not considered cool anymore, we\u2019ll just throw it away and that\u2019s really harmful for the environment so I thought I\u2019d try and make a system that would prevent this,\u201d she explained.</p><p>Like Return-It, her system would be deposit-based. A small deposit would be charged on clothing, that would be refunded to the buyer when it is recycled.</p><p>Higher-end or lightly-used clothing could be sent to thrift stores, while damaged or worn clothing could be repurposed to make household objects or entirely knew outfits.</p><p>A similar project was launched in Vancouver in 2019, but it shut down because its limited network of organizations \u2014 which it supplied clothes to \u2014 couldn\u2019t keep up with the demand. Barron investigated how this network could be expanded to ensure the project is more sustainable in the long-term.</p><p>Peighten Catsirelis and Annaliese Froehler, 13, teamed up to test how effective different types of sea walls are at protecting populations from tsunamis.</p><p>They used a foam mat to create a slope in a large plastic container and filled it with water. Then they created sea walls out of different kinds of materials \u2014 fish pebbles, a wooden board and piece of pipe. The pipe worked best, which they attributed to the fact that it was curved rather than straight.</p><p>\u201cWith the rocks, we found that the water just went right over them. With the straight wood wall, the water temporarily slowed down. The curved wall, it deflected the water back,\u201d said Catsirelis.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been really fun,\u201d she added.</p><p>Staff Writer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FREPRS-news20230525PQEA0003600924</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FREPRS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:689S-TFH1-F0HF-8291-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438278</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"688\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

It also promised $8.9 million to add 100 front-line positions and establish new medical homes, which bring together different medical practitioners in a single spot. </p><p>\"The health-care system we have today was built decades ago, it needs to evolve with the needs of Islanders,\" Burridge said. \"How we provide care, where we provide care and who provides the care all must be modernized and that is what our government is doing.\"</p><p>To ease the housing crisis, the government said it will spend $25 million to develop construction-ready lots, and $1 million to create tiny home communities.</p><p>It will spend $4 million to expedite the reduction of childcare fees by the end of the year, it said.</p><p>\"Working with the federal government, our government under the leadership of the minister of education in early years signed a historic agreement to get childcare fees to an average of $10 a day by 2025,\" Burridge said. </p><p>\"But as a government, we felt we could do more faster.\"</p><p>It has budgeted $950,000 in island-wide transit to keep fares low, it said.</p><p>The government will spend $350,000 to support the diversification of crops to prepare for climate change and to explore controlled-environment and indoor farming, it said. It is also expected to spend about $640,000 in reforestation efforts and about $550,000 in forest fire training and equipment.</p><p>\"With so many woodlots still being cleared after the destruction of (post-tropical storm) Fiona, we are at a higher risk of forest fires during the warmer months,\" the finance minister said.</p><p>\"Protecting our environment is important. Government has a role to play, and through the budget we have demonstrated our commitment to safeguard our environment, our landscape and our way of life.\"  </p><p>Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker said the budget lacked the \"large, bold, courageous, transformational ideas\" the province needs to address the health care, affordability and housing crises facing P.E.I.</p><p>\"So for me, it was disappointing,\" he said.</p><p>He called it a \"status quo budget,\" adding it suggests the re-elected Progressive Conservative government feels their work over the past four years was adequate.</p><p>\"For me, it was spectacularly inadequate, and it's left so many aspects of our province in a really bad shape,\" he said. \"So if they think that they can continue to pursue the same sorts of policies and attitudes, and somehow solve these problems \u2014 it doesn't fill me with confidence.\"</p><p>He said last year's estimated 4.3 per cent year-over-year population growth rate -- the highest in Canada -- will contribute to strong economic growth. </p><p>\"But we have to question growth of what, growth for whom, growth at what cost, growth to what end. And that's not something we're doing,\" Bevan-Baker said.</p><p>\"We just have a government that seems to be blindly pursuing what I would describe as irresponsible and reckless growth, without any sense of the impact that that economic growth is having on our health system, on our housing situation, on the environment \u2026 pressures on farmland, on the cost of living as our inflationary pressures remain the highest in the country.\" </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 25, 2023.</p><p>-- By Hina Alam in Fredericton</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-7ed89927bfdc4ca2986c76011e61921a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:689X-WBN1-JBVR-31FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><timeReceived>06:27 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 25, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Wildfire Service budget soared to $500 million and an estimated $80 million in tourism and other economic costs in the Central Okanagan alone. The urgency was reinforced by another severe fire season in 2009, where the bill reached $400 million.</p><p>\u201cMany of the 2003 and 2009 fires occurred in areas where fuels had accumulated over decades, and during dry, hot weather conditions, these fires became very large and intense,\u201d says the province\u2019s Wildland Fire Management Strategy, released in 2010 and still in effect today. \u201cFires like this remove so much forest cover that soil productivity can be reduced and soil erosion can lead to flooding, landslides, decreased water quality and a variety of other negative consequences.\u201d</p><p>Local politics is one impediment to changing an aggressive timber protection that started in the late 1940s as post-war heavy equipment and aircraft became available. Prescribed burns in spring produce heavy smoke, and for decades logging restrictions focused on preserving \u201cview corridors\u201d along highways and around communities, accumulating fuel in the highest-risk locations.</p><p>In the latest revamp of forest policy, Premier John Horgan and Forests Minister Katrine Conroy have committed to more use of prescribed burning to reduce fuel load, citing Indigenous forest burn practices that cleaned out underbrush to make forests passable for migration and hunting.</p><p>Fuel cleanup around communities has proceeded slowly since the recommendations made after the 2003 fires. This past June, bracing for another hot summer of wildfires, the B.C. government added $20 million more to its community resiliency fund. The program has assisted 116 B.C. communities with wildfire risk reduction work since 2018, when it was set up in response to back-to-back record wildfire years in B.C. The Union of B.C. Municipalities administers the community grant fund, along with the First Nations\u2019 Emergency Services Society of B.C. The next application intake begins June 30, for projects including residential fuel reduction, critical infrastructure protection, FireSmart training, emergency management, community planning and inter-agency cooperation.</p><p>Communities that can demonstrate high wildfire risk can apply for up to $150,000 to cover up to 100 per cent of project costs, while lower-risk communities can apply for up to $50,000.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALARM-news20210728PSHA0002033287</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALARM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637S-6RD1-F0HF-82CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438273</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

The brain activity of participants was additionally measured before and after each exposure using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</p><p>Researchers analyzed changes in the brain's default mode network (DMN), a set of inter-connected brain regions that play a significant role in memory and internal thought. The fMRIs revealed that participants had decreased functional connectivity in widespread regions of the DMN after exposure to diesel exhaust, compared to filtered air.</p><p>\"We know that altered functional connectivity in the DMN has been associated with reduced cognitive performance and symptoms of depression, so it's concerning to see traffic pollution interrupting these same networks,\" Jodie Gawryluk, assistant professor of psychology at UVic, told Black Press Media. \"But more studies are needed to look at the long-term effects, like what happens after we have repeated exposures for a long time \u2013 we might not be able to recover so easily from that.\"</p><p>\"Air pollution is now recognized as the largest environmental threat to human health and we are increasingly seeing the impacts across all major organ systems,\" said Carlsten. \"I expect we would see similar impacts on the brain from exposure to other air pollutants, like forest fire smoke. With the increasing incidence of neurocognitive disorders, it's an important consideration for public health officials and policymakers.\"</p><p>The study was conducted at UBC's Air Pollution Exposure Laboratory at Vancouver General Hospital, which is equipped with a state-of-the-art exposure booth that is able to mimic what it's like to breathe a range of different air pollutants.</p><p>ALSO READ: Make 'ultra-wealthy' speeders pay greater fines, says Saanich councillor</p><p>Do you have a story tip?

said.</p><p>The wildfire service is expecting up to 20 millimetres of rain in parts of B.C. over the coming days, and that could help in the short term, he said.</p><p>\"But it won't be enough to knock down the hazard as we enter into July and August, which typically set up as our warmer, drier, hotter months.\"</p><p>The BC Wildfire Service reports more than 80 active wildfires across the province on Wednesday, including four \"wildfires of note\" that are highly visible or pose a potential threat to public safety.</p><p>Forests Minister Bruce Ralston said fires have scorched 7,620 square kilometres of land since April, mostly in the northeast, dwarfing the 20-year average of 180 square kilometres at the same stage of the season.</p><p>Chapman said the province currently has enough capacity to manage the situation, although the wildfire service has notified the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre that it might need more support over the coming weeks.</p><p>An incident management team could arrive from the United States as soon as this weekend to provide some rest for one of six B.C.-based teams, he said.</p><p>The Peace River Regional District has posted an evacuation alert for a stretch of the Alaska Highway that connects Yukon and northern B.C. to the rest of the province as the 4,875-square-kilometre Donnie Creek fire burns south of Fort Nelson.</p><p>If the out-of-control blaze \u2014 the second biggest in B.C. history \u2014 cuts the highway, some northern residents could face a detour of more than 1,700 kilometres if they need to travel south on main roads.</p><p>Little rain from recent storms reached the Donnie Creek blaze on Tuesday, but downpours around the community of Dawson Creek calmed the nearly 200-square-kilometre Kiskatinaw wildfire that's burning within a few kilometres of the community of Tumbler Ridge, which was evacuated six days ago.</p><p>More than 2,750 people are currently under evacuation orders in Tumbler Ridge, the Peace River Regional District and the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality, Minister of Emergency management Bowinn Ma said Wednesday.</p><p>Ma encouraged all B.C. residents to register with the province's Emergency Support Services program, saying evacuees who are registered will be processed more quickly at reception centres and be able to get help right away.</p><p>The Chief of the Doig River First Nation near Fort Nelson said the Donnie Creek fire has claimed a handful of trapline cabins, and people are working to protect others.</p><p>Chief Trevor Makadahay said Tuesday that his community is as ready as it can be to evacuate if winds push flames from the north.</p><p>Residents, especially elders, are staying indoors and using air purifiers to cope with the heavy wildfire smoke blanketing the area, he said. </p><p>On Vancouver Island, the wildfire that forced closure of the main highway connecting communities including Port Alberni, Tofino and Uclulet with the rest of the region is now classified as \"being held,\" meaning it's not likely to spread beyond the predetermined boundaries under current conditions.</p><p>Wildfire crews have been establishing control lines around the roughly two-square-kilometre blaze that sent debris tumbling onto the highway east of Port Alberni.</p><p>Safety concerns are expected to keep the stretch of Highway 4 closed until at least June 24, officials announced Tuesday.</p><p>A lengthy and challenging detour is being used to allow people and supplies to reach the cut-off communities, but it's meant to be used only for essential travel.</p><p>Janelle Staite with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure said the detour is working \"very effectively,\" with convoys of trucks delivering supplies daily.</p><p>\"We've been given the OK from (the) BC Wildfire Service to start some clean-up work below the fire slope, which is setting us on the trajectory to be able to re-open Highway 4 to single-lane alternating traffic by next weekend,\" she said Wednesday.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 14,

Wildfire Service budget soared to $500 million and an estimated $80 million in tourism and other economic costs in the Central Okanagan alone. The urgency was reinforced by another severe fire season in 2009, where the bill reached $400 million. \u201cMany of the 2003 and 2009 fires occurred in areas where fuels had accumulated over decades, and during dry, hot weather conditions, these fires became very large and intense,\u201d says the province\u2019s Wildland Fire Management Strategy, released in 2010 and still in effect today.</p><p>\u201cFires like this remove so much forest cover that soil productivity can be reduced and soil erosion can lead to flooding, landslides, decreased water quality and a variety of other negative consequences.\u201d</p><p>Local politics is one impediment to changing an aggressive timber protection that started in the late 1940s as post-war heavy equipment and aircraft became available. Prescribed burns in spring produce heavy smoke, and for decades logging restrictions focused on preserving \u201cview corridors\u201d along highways and around communities, accumulating fuel in the highest-risk locations.</p><p>In the latest revamp of forest policy, Premier John Horgan and Forests Minister Katrine Conroy have committed to more use of prescribed burning to reduce fuel load, citing Indigenous forest burn practices that cleaned out underbrush to make forests passable for migration and hunting.</p><p>Fuel cleanup around communities has proceeded slowly since the recommendations made after the 2003 fires. This past June, racing for another hot summer of wildfires, the B.C. government added $20 million more to its community resiliency fund. The program has assisted 116 B.C. communities with wildfire risk reduction work since 2018, when it was set up in response to back-to-back record wildfire years in B.C. The Union of B.C. Municipalities administers the com-munity grant fund, along with the First Nations\u2019 Emergency Services Society of B.C. The next application intake begins June 30, for projects including residential fuel reduction, critical infrastructure protection, FireSmart training, emergency management, community planning and inter-agency cooperation.</p><p>Communities that can demonstrate high wildfire risk can apply for up to $150,000 to cover up to 100 per cent of project costs, while lower-risk com-munities can apply for up to $50,000.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRANDT-news20210727PPZA0002031779</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRANDT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637N-WR61-F0HF-812R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"455\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

The brain activity of participants was additionally measured before and after each exposure using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</p><p>Researchers analyzed changes in the brain's default mode network (DMN), a set of inter-connected brain regions that play a significant role in memory and internal thought. The fMRIs revealed that participants had decreased functional connectivity in widespread regions of the DMN after exposure to diesel exhaust, compared to filtered air.</p><p>\"We know that altered functional connectivity in the DMN has been associated with reduced cognitive performance and symptoms of depression, so it's concerning to see traffic pollution interrupting these same networks,\" Jodie Gawryluk, assistant professor of psychology at UVic, told Black Press Media. \"But more studies are needed to look at the long-term effects, like what happens after we have repeated exposures for a long time \u2013 we might not be able to recover so easily from that.\"</p><p>\"Air pollution is now recognized as the largest environmental threat to human health and we are increasingly seeing the impacts across all major organ systems,\" said Carlsten. \"I expect we would see similar impacts on the brain from exposure to other air pollutants, like forest fire smoke. With the increasing incidence of neurocognitive disorders, it's an important consideration for public health officials and policymakers.\"</p><p>The study was conducted at UBC's Air Pollution Exposure Laboratory at Vancouver General Hospital, which is equipped with a state-of-the-art exposure booth that is able to mimic what it's like to breathe a range of different air pollutants.</p><p>ALSO READ: Make 'ultra-wealthy' speeders pay greater fines, says Saanich councillor</p><p>Do you have a story tip?

Although none of the girls collected a medal in the final leg of the competition, they found value in the experience.</p><p>Emma Harrington, 17, constructed a prototype of a portable fire extinguisher that could be used for hiking and camping.</p><p>Her experiment involved testing an On-the-Go extinguisher \u2014 a product currently available on the market \u2014 and making improvements to its design.</p><p>Harrington often carries an On-the-Go with her when she camps and hikes in case a campfire gets out of hand, but she has never actually had to use it in an emergency. She did test the device during an experiment however, and she found the trigger was difficult to pull and that not all of the CO2 released.</p><p>\"It would hurt to pull, just because it was a piece of metal,\" she said.</p><p>She lit a few controlled fires in pits in her backyard in order to compare the two devices.</p><p>\"Although the fires were being extinguished, the embers weren't cooling down, so there was still that chance of the fire relighting,\" she added.</p><p>She constructed a new trigger using a 3D printer and she added a sleeve to her model to reduce the risk of frostbite when Co2 is ejected.</p><p>\"With the 3D printed design it's more comfortable to use. It's lightweight. It's smaller \u2026 I wanted to add in a sleeve just to give people protection from frostbite rather than having to carry gloves and the portable fire extinguisher.\"</p><p>Harrington has family members who were impacted by the wildfires in Fort McMurray and this was the inspiration behind her project.</p><p>\"I was thinking about what I could do to help with the forest fire situation. Family members of mine and close people in my life have been affected by forest fires and have needed to evacuate from their homes, so I wanted to make something to prevent more people from having to do that.\"</p><p>READ MORE: Mount Baker student showing scientific invention at Canada-Wide Science Fair</p><p>Isla Barron, 16, developed a theoretical concept rather than a device. She created a scheme for recycling clothing based on Return-It's system for plastics, paper and bottles.</p><p>\"A lot of my generation, we wear whatever's new and trendy at that time. When we're done with it and it's not considered cool anymore, we'll just throw it away and that's really harmful for the environment so I thought I'd try and make a system that would prevent this,\" she explained.</p><p>Like Return-It, her system would be deposit-based. A small deposit would be charged on clothing, that would be refunded to the buyer when it is recycled.</p><p>Higher-end or lightly-used clothing could be sent to thrift stores, while damaged or worn clothing could be repurposed to make household objects or entirely knew outfits.</p><p>A similar project was launched in Vancouver in 2019, but it shut down because its limited network of organizations \u2014 which it supplied clothes to \u2014 couldn't keep up with the demand. Barron investigated how this network could expand to ensure the project is more sustainable in the long-term.</p><p>Peighten Catsirelis and Annaliese Froehler, 13, teamed up to test how effective different types of sea walls are at protecting populations from tsunamis.</p><p>They used a foam mat to create a slope in a large plastic container and filled it with water. Then they created sea walls out of different kinds of materials \u2014 fish pebbles, a wooden board and piece of pipe. The pipe worked best, which they attributed to the fact that it was curved rather than straight.</p><p>\"With the rocks, we found that the water just went right over them. With the straight wood wall, the water temporarily slowed down. The curved wall, it deflected the water back,\" said Catsirelis.</p><p>\"It's been really fun,\" she added.</p><p>@<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gfrans15newsroom@thefreepress.caLike\">gfrans15newsroom@thefreepress.caLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Fernie Free Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FREPRS-news20230523PFP4473747</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FREPRS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:689B-V831-JD2C-J0JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438278</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"718\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Festival executive director Simon Gamache says the event scheduled for Sunday was called off over \"security reasons.\" Pride Montreal issued a statement on Twitter, saying it made the decision with the support of city police because there were not enough volunteers to ensure safety along the parade route. </p><p><br/><br/> Newfoundland<br/><br/> Fire sparks state of emergency<br/><br/> The rapid growth of a long-burning forest fire in central Newfoundland has triggered a state of emergency in the area and the expansion of an outdoor fire ban to the entire province. Premier Andrew Furey told reporters on Sunday the state of emergency was declared the night before in the areas of Grand Falls-Windsor, Bishop's Falls and the Connaigre Peninsula, \"not to create panic\" but to ensure residents and officials alike are ready to respond if the situation deteriorates further.<br/><br/> Canada<br/><br/> Heat warning extended <br/><br/> Five provinces across central and eastern Canada continued to swelter in unseasonably hot conditions on Sunday, Environment Canada said as it extended a widespread heat warning into a second day. The warning from the national weather agency covered broad swaths of southern Ontario, southern Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Environment Canada says maximum temperatures were expected to reach or surpass 30 C and hit the low 40s when combined with humidity. <br/><br/> News Services <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2022080865218385</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:663W-F271-F197-51CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"260\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.
