(\"Red Lake Gold\" or the \"Corporation\") is pleased to report that the Corporation has commenced field exploration at its Whirlwind Jack Gold Project near Red Lake, Ontario. The Whirlwind Jack Gold Project is on-trend and shares a common claim boundary with Great Bear Resources Ltd.'s Dixie Gold Project.</p><p>\"We are pleased to report that field exploration is underway at Red Lake Gold's flagship gold exploration project, Whirlwind Jack. The community of Red Lake, for which our Company is named, recently experienced an evacuation due to a now-contained forest fire located north of Whirlwind Jack and we are relieved that the residents of Red Lake have been able to safely return with no major structural loss in town. As to today's news, our large-scale phase one soil sampling program is an important exploration milestone for Red Lake Gold as we advance an exploration framework and methodology that has proven effective for the area. Our airborne program last year at Whirlwind Jack allowed us to demonstrate that Whirlwind Jack hosts at least 12km of the LP Fault structure, trending westward from the adjacent Great Bear Resources mineral claims. Although our field work this year was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been able to leverage that extra time to further refine numerous target areas within the Whirlwind Jack Gold Project which we are excited to begin exploring. This intensive 750 sample phase one program will focus on a target grid defined by our geophysical work that commences at the claim boundary with Great Bear Resources. The field program will generate data along the LP Fault at the Whirlwind Jack Gold Project measured within the first 1.4km of its strike-length - out of at least 12km of strike-length confirmed by our field work in 2019 - with the project having the potential to both extend the LP Fault structure further west as well as explore numerous other target areas that have already been defined,\" stated Ryan Kalt, Chief Executive Officer of Red Lake Gold.</p><p>Whirlwind Jack Gold Project - MMI Geochemistry Program</p><p>The Metal Mobile Ion (MMI) geochemistry program now underway at the Whirlwind Jack Gold Program is being conducted within a priority target area situated adjacent to the claim boundary with Great Bear Resources Ltd. This first target area measures approximately 1.4km on an east-to-west basis and approximately 1.25km on a north-to-south basis.</p><p>.</p><p>Figure 1 - Phase One Grid Area w/ Magnetic Survey Underlain</p><p>The phase one soil geochemical program is expected to sample approximately 750 different locations, with the subsequent data set designed to contribute towards vectoring potential drill targets. The Company retained Haveman Brothers Forestry Services Ltd. of Kakabeka Falls, Ontario to assist with performing the sample collection in a safe and logistically-responsible manner.</p><p>Red Lake Gold also wishes to disclose that multiple additional soil sampling target areas for future phases have also been identified within the Whirlwind Jack Gold Project. The Company remains attentive to building exploration targets across its project reflecting how, (a) the locale of potential mineralization may concentrate along the LP Fault with variation; and (b) recognizing that knowledge associated with various claim blocks in the region now believed to host the LP Fault were structured by person-defined claim boundaries that were set out without first having the 2019 discovery knowledge of the importance of the LP Fault structure and its notable gold endowment. Red Lake Gold believes its Whirlwind Jack Gold Project holds significant potential for exploration moving-forward.</p><p>Of importance, much of the Whirlwind Jack Gold Project, including the portion where the field program is now underway, was staked in August of 2018, which is relevant as the assemblage of the present-day Whirlwind Jack property preceded and predated the material discovery of gold within a new exploration target horizon - the \"LP Fault\" - as later discovered and announced by Great Bear Resources Ltd. in May of 2019 (see Great Bear Resources news release, Great Bear Drills New High Grade Gold Discovery at Dixie, dated May 28, 2019).</p><p>Further to the May 2019 discovery of gold along the LP Fault by Great Bear Resources Ltd., an inaugural airborne geophysical program was subsequently performed by Red Lake Gold in 2019, i.e. within the LP Fault \"discovery year\". The November 2019 airborne survey flown by Red Lake Gold confirmed that the LP Fault structure extended westward from the Great Bear Resources' Dixie project onto the Whirlwind Jack tenure, continuing onwards for at least 12km across Red Lake Gold's project (see Red Lake Gold news release, Red Lake Gold Inc. Outlines Airborne Survey Results, dated December 31, 2019).</p><p>The Whirlwind Jack Gold Project, as now held by Red Lake Gold, has not before received a modern-day, large-scale and coordinated exploration focus informed by the exploration methodology and results since disclosed on claims at the adjacent project held by Great Bear Resources Ltd. The phase one MMI soil sampling program is a component of a significant future exploration work path that will test and explore the Whirlwind Jack Gold Project in a systematic, detailed and progressive manner while respecting the Company's desire to maintain a prudent share capital structure.</p><p>Lab results from the phase one exploration program discussed in this news release are expected in late-September.</p><p>Further information on the Whirlwind Jack Gold Program may be found at:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.redlakegold.ca/whirlwind\">https://www.redlakegold.ca/whirlwind</url></p><p>The Corporation cautions that results or discoveries on adjacent properties (i.e. Dixie) may not necessarily be indicative as to the presence of mineralization on the Corporation's property (i.e. Whirlwind Jack).</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Mr. Garry Clark, P.

(\"Clean Air Metals\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV: AIR) (FRA: CKU) (OTCQB: CLRMF) is pleased to announce new assay results from the drilling campaign currently underway at the Company's Thunder BayNorth Project (the \"Project\"). Assay highlights (from Table 1) include:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the Escape Lake deposit:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Hole ELR21-077 intersected 76.6m grading 5.67g/t Palladium Equivalents (PdEq)1 composed of 1.63g/t Platinum (Pt), 2.14g/t Palladium (Pd), 0.81% Copper (Cu), 0.41% Nickel (Ni) from 345.0m-421.6m downhole including 21.0m grading 9.98g/t PdEq composed of 2.97 g/t Platinum (Pt), 3.93g/t Palladium (Pd), 1.41% Copper (Cu), 0.68% Nickel (Ni) from 392.0m-413.0m downhole (Figure 1).</p><p>The Escape Lake Deposit has been the focus of the majority of the drilling over the past 14 months. Since the maiden resource published in January 2021 of 505,369 ounces at 3.67 g/t PdEq in 4.28 million tonnes, the Clean Air Metals team has successfully expanded the size of the Escape South High Grade Zone and demonstrated approximately 700m of mineralization along trend. Hole ELR21-077 with its significant thickness and grade appears to further expand the edge of the Escape Lake High Grade Zone and demonstrates potential contribution of scale of the Escape Lake Deposit to the overall Thunder BayNorth Project. An updated mineral resource for the Escape Lake Deposit is currently planned for Q1 2022.</p><p>The Current Lake Deposit has a well-defined Indicated mineral resource of 1,328,789 PdEq ounces at a grade of 3.44 g/t PdEq in 11.99 million tonnes and is currently well advanced with a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) study to be published in Q4 this year. The PEA-level mine stope optimization in the Beaver Lake Zone area of the Current Lake Deposit may be enhanced by the results of a recent infill drill program, including the following highlight results:</p><p> Hole ELR21-077 intersected 76.6m grading 5.67g/t Palladium Equivalents (PdEq)1 composed of 1.63g/t Platinum (Pt), 2.14g/t Palladium (Pd), 0.81% Copper (Cu), 0.41% Nickel (Ni) from 345.0m-421.6m downhole including 21.0m grading 9.98g/t PdEq composed of 2.97 g/t Platinum (Pt), 3.93g/t Palladium (Pd), 1.41% Copper (Cu), 0.68% Nickel (Ni) from 392.0m-413.0m downhole (Figure 1).</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"208\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"416\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">__________________________</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Palladium equivalency formula can be viewed in the following Link (Click Here)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Mineral resource endowment and palladium-equivalents are quoted pursuant to the Technical Report and Mineral Resource Estimate for the Thunder BayNorth Project, Thunder Bay, Ontario, effective date January 20, 2021, posted to SEDAR March 4, 2021. Prepared by Nordmin Engineering Ltd.- QP Glen Kuntz, P.Geo. Ontario.</p><p>Update on Metallurgy and PEA</p><p>Metallurgical optimization studies continue with Blue Coast Research of British Columbia. The results of the metallurgical studies on drill-derived bulk sample material and independent analysis of smelter recoveries and smelter payables are expected to input directly into a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) mine cash flow model planned for publication in early Q4/2021.</p><p>Abraham Drost, CEO of Clean Air Metals\u00a0stated that \"infill assay results from the Beaver Lake Zone of the Current Lake deposit infill drilling (\"CL\" holes) is an affirmation of our understanding of the deposit and ability to target and execute on drilling which has the potential to materially impact the results of the upcoming PEA. This bodes well for future upgrade drilling on the large inferred resource down plunge which will occur at future study phases. The Company is looking forward to publication of a PEA in Q4/21 based solely on the Current Lake Deposit. As with the mineral resource estimate published in March, 2021, the PEA will be based on a ramp-access underground mine model constraining the existing mineral resource. In addition to the Current Lake Deposit, the potential to add scale to the Thunder BayNorth Project with feed from the Escape Lake Deposit is potentially accretive to the project.</p><p>Recent drought conditions and regional forest fire activity imposed certain restrictions and precluded the construction of new drill pads on the Thunder BayNorth Project. The Clean Air Metals geology team found innovative ways of keeping the drills running, including utilizing previous pads using angled holes to test edges and in the case of Hole ELR21-077, to expand the margins of the Escape South High Grade Zone. Fortunately, the drought has ended and the fire ban has now lifted. The present round of assay results is also being added to the Escape Lake deposit database (\"ELR\" holes) which will result in a revised mineral resource estimate in Q1/22.\"</p><p>Table 1: New Assay

Brighton youth, Sustainable Cobourg can help for free</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jenna Martinello is a Brighton resident and Cobourg Collegiate Institute (CCI) student heading into Grade 12. She's also a board member and youth ambassador with Sustainable Cobourg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This summer, as her school year was coming to an end amid the pandemic, she knew her community needed help, so she enlisted her mom to teach her how to sew.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As school ended and she got a handle on her new sewing skills, at the start of summer she began donating free, homemade, reusable face masks, where and when she could. She's donated a few hundred to date, with her parents John Martinello and Yan Cao covering the costs.</p><p>And with Sustainable Cobourg at her side, the pair hopes they can help more people in need.</p><p>\"She's quite extraordinary,\" said Gigi Ludorf-Weaver, president of Sustainable Cobourg, about Jenna, when talking about her mask project and contribution to a \"sustainable recovery.\" \"To me, this is the perfect project that demonstrates having a culture of sustainability.\"</p><p>During COVID-19, Jenna's been making and donating masks in bulk to places like clinics and other organizations such as the Green Wood Coalition. (The street-level charitable organization supports people living with poverty, disabilities, mental health issues and substance dependency.)</p><p>But Jenna and Sustainable Cobourg also want to reach individuals in need.</p><p>And this was all Jenna's idea.</p><p>Her inspiration came after local hospitals in need of masks and personal protective gear put out the call for help. Her first area of focus was the clinics and whatnot, but she says she also doesn't want to see individuals go without.</p><p>Masks are no longer necessary just for front-line workers, but a part of daily life for all, as well as a requirement in public indoor spaces to aid in the fight against the spread of COVID-19, which means that demand remains high.</p><p>Since the onset of the pandemic, Brighton resident Joanne Mallette has also been doing her part to give community members access to fabric face masks. She has been sewing for months and, in return, residents have been leaving her change and bills when they retrieve their masks from a bin outside of her home beside her front door. Mallette decided to donate the money collected to the Brighton Fare Share Food Bank.</p><p>Those community donations have generated about $2,000 to date.</p><p>\"All I can say is this community is awesome, caring, kind and generous,\" Mallette says.</p><p>\"(It) makes my heart sing.\"</p><p>She's continuing to make masks as requested, and now charges $5 to cover her fabric and elastic costs.</p><p>Masks are not really widely available or easily accessible, and can be pretty expensive, says Jenna, who mostly just wants to help where she can.</p><p>\"The two main reasons (I started this) was the medical need for it, and it was sort of after I started making the masks that I realized the very direct correlation with the issue of sustainability, which is why I reached out to Sustainable Cobourg, because I think that is so important ... to remain aware of our environment and also, of course, stay safe,\" said Jenna, who first connected with Sustainable Cobourg after getting involved with a CCI environmental club.</p><p>It wasn't long into the pandemic, and well before masks became mandatory, that complaints started trickling in as disposable masks and gloves littered store parking lots and other outdoor spaces. In other words, amid the public health and economic crisis, the environment, at least for some, was taking a back seat.</p><p>But that silo approach - placing the environment, health and economy in separate containers - it doesn't work, and thinking sustainably and for the future, it remains just as important as before, says Ludorf-Weaver.</p><p>Jenna and Sustainable Cobourg are calling on businesses to help with distribution of the free masks, to make sure people who need one get one. Right now, the pair is focusing on Cobourg.</p><p>With Jenna based in Brighton, and in terms of accessibility, she says it would be helpful if some businesses could help get the masks into the hands of people who need them.</p><p>But while the pair is currently zeroed in on Cobourg, if there is a need elsewhere in Northumberland, Jenna says she'll do her best to help. She also plans to undertake a similar effort in her hometown soon, to ensure Brightonians are taken care of.</p><p>This project has it all - all the pillars of sustainability - with the environmental stewardship, the social responsibility and the economic resilience, says Ludorf-Weaver. This helps stop disposable masks from going to landfills, it's helping people who don't have masks, who maybe can't afford this and are high-risk, and it's also helping commerce to continue safely, the president continued.</p><p>Businesses interested in helping to distribute masks, or volunteers interested in sewing and donating masks, are asked to email Jenna via <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:studentambassador@sustainablecobourg.ca\">studentambassador@sustainablecobourg.ca</email> To get free masks, visit the @masksmadesustainably Instagram page. More info about Sustainable Cobourg's initiatives and a step-by-step sewing pattern guide are available via the site.</p><p>With the demand so high, Jenna's donated masks have been making a difference for groups like the Green Wood Coalition.</p><p>\"We have supported the wearing of masks all along because it's a way to show that we care about our neighbours,\" said David Sheffield, the coalition's community director. \"This (Jenna's donation) is an example of the way the community has been stepping up to meet real needs of real people throughout the pandemic. It's been great to have various people working at making masks that we can distribute as we are doing outreach (work) in the community - it's encouraging for us, and for the people who receive one of the masks.\"</p><p>Reflecting on Jenna's efforts, Ludorf-Weaver said she was reminded of the story of the little hummingbird with the bit of water trying to put out the forest fire. This is a heartening example of a youth taking the lead to help protect our future, she said.</p><p>When it comes to sustainability, Ludorf-Weaver offers the following advice: \"Nothing you do is too small; nothing you do is irrelevant.\"</p><p>STORY BEHIND THE STORY: After Sustainable Cobourg reached out to share the news about its mask project, Northumberland News caught up with representatives and youth Jenna Martinello to delve into the project and its benefits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2020081058582533</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K2-2C51-F103-32Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1047\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Brighton youth, Sustainable Cobourg can help for free</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jenna Martinello is a Brighton resident and Cobourg Collegiate Institute (CCI) student heading into Grade 12. She's also a board member and youth ambassador with Sustainable Cobourg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This summer, as her school year was coming to an end amid the pandemic, she knew her community needed help, so she enlisted her mom to teach her how to sew.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As school ended and she got a handle on her new sewing skills, at the start of summer she began donating free, homemade, reusable face masks, where and when she could. She's donated a few hundred to date, with her parents John Martinello and Yan Cao covering the costs.</p><p>And with Sustainable Cobourg at her side, the pair hopes they can help more people in need.</p><p>\"She's quite extraordinary,\" said Gigi Ludorf-Weaver, president of Sustainable Cobourg, about Jenna, when talking about her mask project and contribution to a \"sustainable recovery.\" \"To me, this is the perfect project that demonstrates having a culture of sustainability.\"</p><p>During COVID-19, Jenna's been making and donating masks in bulk to places like clinics and other organizations such as the Green Wood Coalition. (The street-level charitable organization supports people living with poverty, disabilities, mental health issues and substance dependency.)</p><p>But Jenna and Sustainable Cobourg also want to reach individuals in need.</p><p>And this was all Jenna's idea.</p><p>Her inspiration came after local hospitals in need of masks and personal protective gear put out the call for help. Her first area of focus was the clinics and whatnot, but she says she also doesn't want to see individuals go without.</p><p>Masks are no longer necessary just for front-line workers, but as a part of daily life for all, as well as a requirement in public indoor spaces to aid in the fight against the spread of COVID-19, which means that demand remains high.</p><p>Since the onset of the pandemic, Brighton resident Joanne Mallette has also been doing her part to give community members access to fabric face masks. She has been sewing for months and, in return, residents have been leaving her change and bills when they retrieve their masks from a bin outside of her home beside her front door. Mallette decided to donate the money collected to the Brighton Fare Share Food Bank.</p><p>Those community donations have generated about $2,000 to date.</p><p>\"All I can say is this community is awesome, caring, kind and generous,\" Mallette says.</p><p>\"(It) makes my heart sing.\"</p><p>She's continuing to make masks as requested, and now charges $5 to cover her fabric and elastic costs.</p><p>Masks are not really widely available or easily accessible, and can be pretty expensive, says Jenna, who mostly just wants to help where she can.</p><p>\"The two main reasons (I started this) was the medical need for it, and it was sort of after I started making the masks that I realized the very direct correlation with the issue of sustainability, which is why I reached out to Sustainable Cobourg, because I think that is so important ... to remain aware of our environment and also, of course, stay safe,\" said Jenna, who first connected with Sustainable Cobourg after getting involved with a CCI environmental club.</p><p>It wasn't long into the pandemic, and well before masks became mandatory, that complaints started trickling in as disposable masks and gloves littered store parking lots and other outdoor spaces. In other words, amid the public health and economic crisis, the environment, at least for some, was taking a back seat.</p><p>But that silo approach - placing the environment, health and economy in separate containers - it doesn't work, and thinking sustainably and for the future, it remains just as important as before, says Ludorf-Weaver.</p><p>Jenna and Sustainable Cobourg are calling on businesses to help with distribution of the free masks, to make sure people who need one get one. Right now, the pair is focusing on Cobourg.</p><p>With Jenna based in Brighton, and in terms of accessibility, she says it would be helpful if some businesses could help get the masks into the hands of people who need them.</p><p>But while the pair is currently zeroed in on Cobourg, if there is a need elsewhere in Northumberland, Jenna says she'll do her best to help. She also plans to undertake a similar effort in her hometown soon, to ensure Brightonians are taken care of.</p><p>This project has it all - all the pillars of sustainability - with the environmental stewardship, the social responsibility and the economic resilience, says Ludorf-Weaver. This helps stop disposable masks from going to landfills, it's helping people who don't have masks, who maybe can't afford this and are high-risk, and it's also helping commerce to continue safely, the president continued.</p><p>Businesses interested in helping to distribute masks, or volunteers interested in sewing and donating masks, are asked to email Jenna via <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:studentambassador@sustainablecobourg.ca\">studentambassador@sustainablecobourg.ca</email> To get free masks, visit the @masksmadesustainably Instagram page. More info about Sustainable Cobourg's initiatives and a step-by-step sewing pattern guide are available via the site.</p><p>With the demand so high, Jenna's donated masks have been making a difference for groups like the Green Wood Coalition.</p><p>\"We have supported the wearing of masks all along because it's a way to show that we care about our neighbours,\" said David Sheffield, the coalition's community director. \"This (Jenna's donation) is an example of the way the community has been stepping up to meet real needs of real people throughout the pandemic. It's been great to have various people working at making masks that we can distribute as we are doing outreach (work) in the community - it's encouraging for us, and for the people who receive one of the masks.\"</p><p>Reflecting on Jenna's efforts, Ludorf-Weaver said she was reminded of the story of the little hummingbird with the bit of water trying to put out the forest fire. This is a heartening example of a youth taking the lead to help protect our future, she said.</p><p>When it comes to sustainability, Ludorf-Weaver offers the following advice: \"Nothing you do is too small; nothing you do is irrelevant.\"</p><p>STORY BEHIND THE STORY: After Sustainable Cobourg reached out to share the news about its mask project, Northumberland News caught up with representatives and youth Jenna Martinello to delve into the project and its benefits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2020080558575975</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JV-2VX1-JDH1-C09V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1048\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> As of Sunday, Jan. 8, there were 17 active speed cameras according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

The rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by about 2,200 in the past two weeks.</p><p>___</p><p>PRISTINA, Kosovo \u2014 Kosovo\u2019s government has postponed the start of school for two weeks and installed new restrictive measures to cope with a rise of coronavirus cases.</p><p>In August, the numbers increased significantly to about 2,000 new cases a day. On Saturday, there were 18 deaths and 1,891 confirmed cases.</p><p>The government says the pre-university school year now will start Sept. 13. Public institutions will limit the number of people in the office, and there will be no gatherings of more than 50 people.</p><p>It also reimposes the overnight curfew of 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. and only the main public service employees are exempt.</p><p>Sport and culture events can use only 10% to 30% of the seats and restaurants 70% of the outside seats. Masks are obligatory in all closed spaces and outdoors.</p><p>___</p><p>MOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s state statistics agency shows a record 50,000 deaths in July were related to the coronavirus. </p><p>The report from the Rosstat agency says 50,421 people suffering from the coronavirus died during the month, sharply higher than the previous record of 44,435 in December. </p><p>However, the agency says only 38,992 deaths were directly attributed to the disease COVID-19. In another 5,206 deaths, the coronavirus was assessed as likely the main cause but that more investigation would be need; in 1,449 other cases the virus contributed to deaths but was not the main cause. </p><p>The report says Russia has registered a total of 215,265 virus-related deaths by the end of July \u2014 more than the 180,840 cited by the national coronavirus task force. </p><p>___</p><p>SIOUX FALLS, S.D. \u2014 Health officials across five states have linked 178 virus cases to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. </p><p>In the three weeks since the rally kicked off, South Dakota health officials have reported 63 cases among rallygoers so far. The epicenter of the rally, Meade County, is reaching a per capita rate similar to the hardest-hit states of the South. Health officials in North Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota and Wisconsin all reported cases among people who attended the 10-day rally that attracted more than 500,000 people.</p><p>Health experts are worried that large gatherings across the Upper Midwest will feed a new wave of the virus.</p><p>\u201cThis coronavirus forest fire will keep burning any human wood it can find,\u201d said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. \u201cIt will find you, and it\u2019s so infectious.\u201d</p><p>The Black Hills region\u2019s largest hospital system, Monument Health, says hospitalizations from the virus rose from five to 78 this month. The hospital was bracing for more COVID-19 patients by converting rooms to intensive care units and reassigning staff.</p><p>___</p><p>LANSING, Mich. \u2014 At least half of Michigan\u2019s public K-12 students are required to wear masks in school.</p><p>Several counties, including six of the 10 most populated ones, mandate face coverings for students, teachers and staff indoors regardless of vaccination status. Health officials point to a rapid increase in coronavirus cases from the more contagious delta variant, saying masks helping to reduce the virus spread. They note kids under 12 cannot be vaccinated.</p><p>Policies vary at schools in 76 counties where health departments have recommended, but not required, masking.</p><p>The office of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says about 54% of students in traditional public schools are subject to face covering requirements.</p><p>The state Department of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the University of Michigan School of Public Health, has used outside research to estimate how long it would take for there to be a greater than 50% chance of transmission if one infectious child attends a class of 25 elementary students. </p><p>With complete masking, it is 120 hours. It drops to 24 hours with imperfect masking and 3 hours with no masking. </p><p>Dr. Sarah Lyon-Callo, the state\u2019s top epidemiologist, says masking reduces the chance of being infected in school by 40% to 75%.</p><p>___</p><p>BERLIN \u2014 Thousands turned out in Berlin to protest the government\u2019s coronavirus measures, despite bans against several planned gatherings.</p><p>Police banned nine planned demonstrations for Saturday, including one from the Stuttgart-based Querdenker movement, the most visible anti-lockdown movement in Germany. A court ruled in favor of allowing one protest, planned for 500 people, on Saturday and Sunday.</p><p>More than 2,000 police officers were stationed around the city to respond to those who showed up despite the bans.</p><p>Meanwhile, a counter-protest called the \u201cLove Train,\u201d complete with techno music, drew a large crowd of its own. Those demonstrators support government restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus. </p><p>The Saturday protests come amid debates in Germany about how and whether to impose restrictions for unvaccinated people, a question taking on more urgency as coronavirus case numbers rise. </p><p>Similar protests took place in Berlin in early August, which ended in clashes with police and hundreds of people detained.</p><p>___</p><p>LONDON \u2014 The British government says it is preparing to vaccinate children ages 12-15 against the coronavirus, even though the inoculation campaign has not yet been approved by the country\u2019s vaccine advisers.</p><p>The Department of Health says it wants \u201cto be ready to hit the ground running\u201d once approval comes and be in position to deliver shots in schools when the new academic year starts in most of the country. The return of children to class in September is expected to drive up Britain\u2019s already high coronavirus infection rate.</p><p>Britain is currently giving coronavirus vaccinations to people 16 and up, as well as those between 12 and 15 with underlying health conditions or who live with vulnerable adults.</p><p>Britain\u2019s medicines regulator has approved the use of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for the 12 to 15 age group. But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization, which sets policy, has not signed off on shots for most adolescents that young.</p><p>The United States, Canada and several European countries are already vaccinating people who are at least 12 years old. </p><p>___</p><p>TOKYO \u2014 Tokyo City Hall has apologized for \u201cconfusion\u201d amid its vaccination rollout targeting young people, after crowds looking to get the shot were turned away from a facility in the Shibuya district.</p><p>Health authorities on Saturday switched to a reservation system instead of first come, first served. But more than 2,200 people showed up to get vaccine appointment vouchers, some waiting in line since dawn, and 354 were selected by lottery to receive shots, Japanese media reported.</p><p>Inoculations for those ages 16 through 39 began Friday.</p><p>Japan, which has one of the slowest COVID-19 vaccine rollouts in the developed world, has prioritized giving shots to elderly people and then gradually working its way down by age group.</p><p>The latest development appears to counter critics who had suggested young people wouldn\u2019t be interested in getting vaccinated.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-c6162a0404469b50f5f7f4c7d144687f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63G9-H361-DY9S-T2GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2225\"/><timeReceived>06:52 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 28, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Visible gold was observed in the core from the original discovery drill hole, and at least half the pulps and rejects from this drilling are available for resampling and analysis. Based on these results, further field work is being organized, leading to the diamond drill program being planned for October of this year.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past month a team from Axiom Exploration Group (\"Axiom\") completed an initial site visit to the English Bay project, including preliminary examination of the historic drill core, which was followed by a detailed magnetic survey using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ('UAV'), equipped with a specially designed UAV magnetometer sensor.</p><p>As announced on June 25th, 2020 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://searchlightresources.com/news/2020/searchlight-resources\">https://searchlightresources.com/news/2020/searchlight-resources</url> -commences-2020-exploration-at-its-high-grade-english-bay-gold-pr oject/) the first phase of exploration, included a preliminary site visit and core review. The drill core was inspected and 100% of the core was found intact, plus the returned lab materials for about 50% of the drill holes were located and transported securely to Saskatoon by an Axiom geologist.</p><p>During the drill core inspection, the discovery drill hole CSP-03 was examined and to quote the Axiom report \"Visible gold was identified in CSP-3 at 375.2 ft within a sampled interval and verified with the XRF. The gold was proximal to pyrite and pyrrhotite within a green to dark green fine grained, moderately chlorite and sericite altered metasedimentary rock with quartz flooding\".</p><p>The Company is now reviewing the returned lab materials (pulps and rejects) and plans on resubmitting a selection of this material for confirmation analysis. To validate and further review these historical results, Searchlight has obtained the full set of assay certificates related to all the previous drilling directly from TSL Laboratories in Saskatoon. In addition to the core review, the site of the historic drilling was visited in an attempt to locate the past drill collar locations. A small number of these sites were located, but without identification as the entire area was subject to a major forest fire in 2015. Further field work is planned.</p><p>Following the site visit a detailed UAV Magnetic survey was conducted at English Bay covering 3.8 sq. kilometers at 25-meter line spacing for a total of 167 line kilometers. Final data from this survey is being processed and will be available to Searchlight by the end of July and will form part of the information used to target diamond drilling at English Bay.</p><p>2020 Drill Program</p><p>Searchlight continues to work toward a diamond drill program at English Bay being planned for October with the submittal of a Surface Exploration Permit Application to the Saskatchewan Ministry of the Environment. In addition, logistics and drill hole planning/modelling is underway to allow a prompt start to drilling as soon as all permits are in place.</p><p>English Bay Gold Project</p><p>The English Bay high grade gold project is located approximately 10 km north of La Ronge, Saskatchewan, alongside highway 102, and which was previously explored from 1997 - 2002 and in 2013, with 37 drill holes totaling 5,161 meters. Multiple high-grade gold drill intersections over a 400m of strike length were discovered including:</p><p>* 2.10 oz/t gold over 4 feet (72.00 g/t Au over 1.2 metres) in DDH CSP-16</p><p>* 1.85 oz/t gold over 4.5 feet (63.43 Au g/t over 1.4 metres) in DDH CSP-03</p><p>* 1.39 oz/t gold over 4 feet (47.66 g/t Au over 1.2 metres) in DDH CSP-13</p><p>* 0.569 oz/t gold over 9 feet (19.51 g/t Au over 2.8 metres) in DDH CSP-04</p><p>Data Note</p><p>Data quoted on drill hole CPS-03 is from \"Logistics and Project Summary Report 2020, English Bay Reconnaissance Program, La Ronge, Saskatchewan by Tyler Fiolleau, P.Geo. and Matthew Schwab, P.Geo., June 30, 2020\"</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Stephen Wallace, P.Geo., is Searchlight's Qualified Person within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical information contained in this news release.</p><p>About Searchlight Resources Inc.</p><p>Searchlight Resources Inc.

(TSXV:SCLT, OTC PINK:CNYCF) is pleased to announce the completion of Phase One of the 2020 exploration program at the English Bay Gold Project, located ten kilometers north of the community of La Ronge, Saskatchewan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The initial results of our program are very encouraging,\" commented Mr. Wallace. \"The 1997 to 2013 drill core was located and is 100% intact. Visible gold was observed in the core from the original discovery drill hole, and at least half the pulps and rejects from this drilling are available for resampling and analysis. Based on these results, further field work is being organized, leading to the diamond drill program being planned for October of this year.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past month a team from Axiom Exploration Group (\"Axiom\") completed an initial site visit to the English Bay project, including preliminary examination of the historic drill core, which was followed by a detailed magnetic survey using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ('UAV'), equipped with a specially designed UAV magnetometer sensor.</p><p>As announced on June 25th, 2020 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://searchlightresources.com/news/2020/searchlight-resources-commences-2020-exploration-at-its-high-grade-english-bay-gold-project/\">https://searchlightresources.com/news/2020/searchlight-resources-commences-2020-exploration-at-its-high-grade-english-bay-gold-project/</url>) the first phase of exploration, included a preliminary site visit and core review. The drill core was inspected and 100% of the core was found intact, plus the returned lab materials for about 50% of the drill holes were located and transported securely to Saskatoon by an Axiom geologist.</p><p>During the drill core inspection, the discovery drill hole CSP-03 was examined and to quote the Axiom report \"Visible gold was identified in CSP-3 at 375.2 ft within a sampled interval and verified with the XRF. The gold was proximal to pyrite and pyrrhotite within a green to dark green fine grained, moderately chlorite and sericite altered metasedimentary rock with quartz flooding\".</p><p>The Company is now reviewing the returned lab materials (pulps and rejects) and plans on resubmitting a selection of this material for confirmation analysis. To validate and further review these historical results, Searchlight has obtained the full set of assay certificates related to all the previous drilling directly from TSL Laboratories in Saskatoon. In addition to the core review, the site of the historic drilling was visited in an attempt to locate the past drill collar locations. A small number of these sites were located, but without identification as the entire area was subject to a major forest fire in 2015. Further field work is planned.</p><p>Following the site visit a detailed UAV Magnetic survey was conducted at English Bay covering 3.8 sq. kilometers at 25-meter line spacing for a total of 167 line kilometers. Final data from this survey is being processed and will be available to Searchlight by the end of July and will form part of the information used to target diamond drilling at English Bay.</p><p>2020 Drill Program</p><p>Searchlight continues to work toward a diamond drill program at English Bay being planned for October with the submittal of a Surface Exploration Permit Application to the Saskatchewan Ministry of the Environment. In addition, logistics and drill hole planning/modelling is underway to allow a prompt start to drilling as soon as all permits are in place.</p><p>English Bay Gold Project</p><p>The English Bay high grade gold project is located approximately 10 km north of La Ronge, Saskatchewan, alongside highway 102, and which was previously explored from 1997 - 2002 and in 2013, with 37 drill holes totaling 5,161 meters. Multiple high-grade gold drill intersections over a 400m of strike length were discovered including:</p><p>2.10 oz/t gold over 4 feet (72.00 g/t Au over 1.2 metres) in DDH CSP-161.85 oz/t gold over 4.5 feet (63.43 Au g/t over 1.4 metres) in DDH CSP-031.39 oz/t gold over 4 feet (47.66 g/t Au over 1.2 metres) in DDH CSP-130.569 oz/t gold over 9 feet (19.51 g/t Au over 2.8 metres) in DDH CSP-04</p><p>Data Note</p><p>Data quoted on drill hole CPS-03 is from \"Logistics and Project Summary Report 2020, English Bay Reconnaissance Program, La Ronge, Saskatchewan by Tyler Fiolleau, P.Geo. and Matthew Schwab, P.Geo., June 30, 2020\"</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Stephen Wallace, P.Geo., is Searchlight's Qualified Person within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical information contained in this news release.</p><p>About Searchlight Resources Inc.</p><p>Searchlight Resources Inc.

The 30,000 metre drill program at Goldlund is targeting infill and expansion of known mineralization, as well as exploration step-out targets. </p><p>Jeremy Wyeth, President and CEO of Treasury Metals, commented: \"The drill results we released today continue to illustrate solid intersections of mineralization, further adding to our confidence in our ability to meet our goals of both resource growth and conversion at Goldlund.\u00a0 Several holes released show significant intercepts of near surface mineralization that present opportunities for pit growth and confirm the resource potential within the existing pits.\u00a0 With three drill rigs now mobilized across our properties, we are confident that we can meet our commitment for a 60,000 metre drill program and show the continuity, conversion and growth that we predicted at the start of 2021. These results are some of the most significant results so far at Goldlund in 2021.\"</p><p>The drill program is actively targeting specific areas of conversion within the PEA (filed on SEDAR March 11, 2021) open pit along with additional growth of the resource directly along strike or adjacent of the current resource. Results released today are from holes targeting infill of Zone 1 and expansion on Zone 4.\u00a0 Over the balance of 2021, the Company plans to drill additional zones, as outlined in Figure 1, to test the extension of mineralization across the various zones.</p><p>Results released today, along with the previous results released from drilling at Zone 4 (see June 16, 2021 press release) illustrate the positive continuity of mineralization in Zone 4, including hole GL-21-050, which intersected 0.7 m grading 27.70 g/t Au and 26.0 m grading 2.94 g/t Au (including 1.0 m grading 63.5 g/t Au and 1.0

The holes targeting Zone 1 are located directly within the main Zone 1 pit as proposed in the PEA and give further evidence to confirm the mineralization at Goldlund over significant intervals related to the typical vein-hosted mineralization within Granodiorite.</p><p>QA / QC</p><p>The Company has implemented a quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) program to ensure sampling and analysis of all exploration work is conducted in accordance with the CIM Exploration Best Practices Guidelines. The drill core is sawn in half with one-half of the core sample dispatched to Activation Laboratories Ltd. facility located in Dryden, Ontario. The other half of the core is retained for future assay verification and/or metallurgical testing. Other QA/QC procedures include the insertion of blanks and Canadian Reference Standards for every tenth sample in the sample stream. A quarter core duplicate is assayed every 20th sample. The laboratory has its own QA/QC protocols running standards and blanks with duplicate samples in each batch stream.\u00a0 Additional checks are routinely run on anomalous values including gravimetric analysis and pulp metallic screen fire assays. Gold analysis is conducted by lead collection, fire assay with atomic absorption and/or gravimetric finish on a 50-gram sample. Check assays are conducted at a secondary ISO certified laboratory (in this case AGAT Laboratories located in Mississauga, Ontario) following the completion of a program.\u00a0 </p><p>Qualified\u00a0Persons</p><p>Mark Wheeler, P.Eng., Director, Projects, and Adam Larsen, Exploration Manager, are both considered as a \"Qualified Person\" for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"), and have reviewed and approved the scientific and technical disclosure contained in this news release on behalf of Treasury. </p><p>About Treasury Metals Inc.</p><p>Treasury Metals Inc. is a gold focused company with assets in Canada.

Autumn is an Indigenous youth who is living in government care in Vancouver, although her family is Kwakwaka wakw from Alert Bay.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Throughout her time in the child-welfare system, Autumn says she thinks she has moved around eight times.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Some of [the placements] were long-term, some of them were only three to four years, some were emergency homes and some of them were family members,\" the 18 year-old says.</p><p>As she fast approaches her nineteenth birthday, Autumn is working to complete high school and to gain culturally-relevant work experience skills through the Concord Pacific Canoe Cultures program.</p><p>For Autumn, aging out is a daunting endeavour, particularly during a global pandemic.</p><p>The day after IndigiNews spoke with Autumn, the Ministry of Children and Family Development (MCFD) announced it will extend support to youth in care who are turning 19 until March 31.</p><p>In a press release, MCFD says \"youth in government care will be able to stay where they are and those who have recently aged out of care will receive extra support\".</p><p>This may ease the transition for Autumn, and for many other youth in her position for the next six months, though it doesn't change the impact that a lack of permanency has had on her life to date.</p><p>Autumn says there were pros and cons to being moved around.</p><p>\"There are a lot of people that I consider as mother figures,\" she says. \"If you're not doing too well with one mother figure, you can go to another.\"</p><p>On the other hand, Autumn says being shuffled around led to \"developed detachment disorders and different kinds of traumas.\"</p><p>\"I think that overall, I've always wanted to stay with one home,\" she says.</p><p>When a young person in foster care is adopted or reunified with their family, they are said to have \"achieved permanency\" in the parlance of our child-welfare system. Permanency is sought by the MCFD because \"permanent, stable relationships are a major determinant of whether children feel safe and secure.\"</p><p>Autumn says that when children like her are bounced from home to home they are made to feel like \"just a burden... just a paycheque passed on [from] person to person.\"</p><p>\"What [permanency] would have meant is that I would not have so much insecurity and it would have meant that I feel like I belong,\" says Autumn. \"It would have changed my whole life.\"</p><p>There is a connection between the overrepresentation of Indigenous children and youth in care and past colonial policies and practices.</p><p>In an email, Jennifer Charlesworth, the Representative for Children and Youth (RCY), says \"the severing of ties that a legal Western adoption model creates is particularly problematic, as is the ongoing disconnection to those families and communities\".</p><p>The RCY is an independent advocacy organization that directly reports to the BC Legislative Assembly on child welfare issues in B.C.</p><p>Once taken into government care, it takes longer for Indigenous children and youth to achieve permanency.</p><p>\"Indigenous children in care are often then without permanency, on average, three years longer than their non-Indigenous counterparts,\" according to a 2016 report on Indigenous child welfare in B.C. by Grand Chief Ed John.</p><p>There is also an underrepresentation of Indigenous adoptive families in B.C.</p><p>\"Of the children and youth placed for adoption, the proportion placed in Indigenous adoptive homes has consistently decreased from 51 per cent in 2015-2016 to only 23 per cent in 2018-2019,\" says the RCY.</p><p>\"This is a concern as culture is a known protective factor for children and youth,\" says Williams.</p><p>In recent years, perspectives on permanency have shifted to welcome other approaches of what it means to be 'home'.</p><p>There are four dimensions of permanency that are being advocated for by the RCY. This includes relational, cultural, physical and legal.</p><p>Relational permanency means creating strong and lasting relationships with caregivers and adult figures, including biological family, foster parents, social workers, and teachers. Legal permanency, as it sounds, refers to who is legally responsible for the child or youth. Physical permanency is the creation of a safe living environment that is both healthy and lasting, and cultural permanency ensures the child is connected to their cultural identity.</p><p>The RCY says they are continuing to monitor the ways in which the MCFD are ensuring these dimensions of permanency are fulfilled.</p><p>According to the 2016 report report by Grand Chief Ed John, there is a sense of mistrust amongst Indigenous communities when it comes to adoption that stems from the 60's Scoop and the lack of collaboration with Indigenous communities in planning for Indigenous children and youth in care.</p><p>In recent years, the RCY has made recommendations for a more robust and culturally attuned approach to permanency and has called on MCFD to understand that adoption is not necessarily in the best interest of every child.</p><p>Given the complexity related to permanency planning for Indigenous children and youth in care, the RCY and Indigenous leaders have recommended using a culturally supportive permanency planning approach, which includes placements with extended family members and kin through Indigenous custom adoptions.</p><p>Indigenous custom adoptions allows for Indigenous communities to collaboratively plan for the care of their children so they remain connected to their cultural identity.</p><p>Autumn says she wasn't included in the process of creating her own care plan until she was older. Had she been more involved earlier on, she says she may have been able to advocate to be more connected to her cultural heritage.</p><p>She says the only connections to her culture were facilitated through Vancouver Aboriginal Child and Family Services Society (VACFSS), one of 24 Delegated Aboriginal Agencies in B.C., authorized by the provincial government to deliver child welfare services to Indigenous people.</p><p>\"I think that this [access to culture] is a very flawed part of the system,\" says Autumn. \"I think that children who are under the care of VACFSS have a lot more opportunities because it is an Aboriginal based organization\".</p><p>Autumn says she would have thrived even more if she had been exposed to programs and activities that were more culturally appropriate to her identity as a Kwakwaka wakw person.</p><p>\"I've been really lucky to have a strong influence in my life, which is my Uncle, and he is a very big name in the community,\" says Autumn.</p><p>Through the Canoe Cultures Program, she's learning how to use her hands through the process of crafting a traditional canoe and paddles.</p><p>\"It is something that can take you far, spiritually, and can take you far physically,\" she says. \"I was taught that the first thing you make has to be gifted, your first paddle, your first drum.\"</p><p>Looking back on the time she's spent in the child-welfare system, Autumn focuses on the positive in her experiences.</p><p>\"I try to live life without regrets,\" she says. \"I just think what I've been through makes me who I am today and so if I hadn't been in so many placements, I wouldn't be so adaptable.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020093059007767</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YN-DWY1-JDH1-C031-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1202\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

Starting off at 50 hectares, this fire has ballooned quite rapidly, covering 1,600 hectares so far, and poses a great deal of risk to both the public and the environment. The rescue teams have been active in this regard, having carried out helicopter evacuations to clear people from the park.  Meanwhile, in this regard, the Department of Conservation has taken the decision to close the park to visitors until such time as firefighting operations are concluded. On November 8, around 40 tourists were helicoptered out, and on the morning of November 9, another 9 tourists were evacuated. DoC is working together with regional fire services, police, civil defense, and the local administration to manage the situation and ensure that everybody in the park is kept safe.  Evacuations and Disruptions: A Setback for New Zealand\u2019s Tourism Economy  The evacuation of 40 tourists on November 8 and an additional 9 visitors the following day highlight the immediate tourism impact caused by the fire. With power outages, road closures, and travel restrictions in place, many tourists\u2019 vacation plans have been disrupted. Tourism operators, hotels, and local services are feeling the effects, as the fluctuating visitor numbers cause significant financial setbacks.  The tourism industry in New Zealand, particularly in regions surrounding Tongariro National Park, depends heavily on international visitors, who contribute significantly to the local economy. With the park closed, tourism professionals are concerned about the long-term impacts this disaster could have on visitor arrivals, especially during peak travel months. The post-pandemic tourism recovery in New Zealand is already fragile, and incidents like this threaten the sustainability of tourism growth in natural destinations like Tongariro National Park.  The Role of Tourism in Regional Economic Resilience  The tourism sector in Tongariro and the broader Central North Island is an essential pillar of the local economy. In addition to generating revenue from tourist visits, tourism creates employment in sectors like hospitality, transportation, and tourist services. The forest fire disrupts hotel bookings, tour services, and transportation, leading to financial losses for businesses directly linked to the industry. As the fire continues, local communities are feeling the economic strain, especially in areas that rely on seasonal tourism to sustain businesses and maintain local employment.  In the long term, tourism recovery will depend on the ability of New Zealand to address infrastructure vulnerabilities. Fires, natural disasters, and unforeseen disruptions demonstrate the importance of resilience in tourism infrastructure, especially in remote regions that are heavily dependent on tourism. Local businesses must be supported by both government relief and industry-specific recovery plans to minimize the damage to the sector.  Crisis Management and Tourism Resilience: Key Lessons for the Future  The current forest fire in Tongariro National Park underscores the importance of crisis management and preparedness within the tourism industry. As tourism destinations like Tongariro recover from disasters, it is crucial for authorities to implement comprehensive disaster management strategies that ensure tourists\u2019 safety and business continuity.  The Department of Conservation and New Zealand\u2019s tourism bodies must work together to create more robust plans to manage disruptions that can affect tourist safety, visitor services, and business operations. This includes better communication channels with tourists, offering alternative tourism activities, and providing clear information on closures or changes in service availability. Crisis management also requires investments in sustainable tourism infrastructure, which can help mitigate the impact of natural disasters on the tourism sector.  Rebuilding Trust and Promoting Alternative Tourism Experiences  While Tongariro National Park remains closed, there is an opportunity to promote alternative tourism experiences within New Zealand. Highlighting other natural wonders such as Fiordland National Park, Rotorua, and the Marlborough Sounds can help redirect visitors and minimize the economic impact of the park closure. Developing and promoting eco-tourism and cultural tourism can also provide new avenues for local businesses to recover and attract tourists to other regions.  For tourism professionals in the area, fostering visitor trust and reassuring potential tourists about future visits is key. Marketing campaigns can focus on safety measures implemented during crises and highlight alternative destinations within the country that provide similar experiences to Tongariro National Park.  Enhancing Sustainable Tourism in New Zealand  The forest fire in Tongariro National Park also serves as a reminder of the need to further integrate sustainable tourism practices into the country\u2019s tourism framework. As global travelers increasingly seek destinations with a focus on environmental sustainability, New Zealand must focus on sustainable tourism that minimizes environmental damage while still promoting tourism growth.  By developing eco-friendly infrastructure, carbon-neutral travel options, and promoting responsible tourism practices, New Zealand can ensure that its natural landmarks remain protected and that tourism growth aligns with the country\u2019s sustainability goals. Sustainable tourism practices should be prioritized in tourism planning, with a clear focus on preserving the natural beauty that makes destinations like Tongariro National Park so appealing to visitors.  Strengthening Tourism Infrastructure for Future Growth  In conclusion, the case of the forest fire in New Zealand\u2019s Tongariro National Park mirrored the vulnerabilities the country\u2019s tourism industry has had to confront, with a strong reliance on natural attractions. The ability of the tourism industry to adapt and recover can also be aligned with resilient infrastructure, strategic crisis management, and a focus on sustainable tourism practices. When correctly supported by government agencies and local businesses, the tourism sector will continue to thrive and grow, thus contributing to New Zealand\u2019s economic recovery despite unwarranted disruptions.

The numbers could help determine control of the House in the 2022 elections and provide an electoral edge for years to come. The data will also shape how $1.5 trillion in annual federal spending is distributed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The figures show continued migration to the South and West at the expense of counties in the Midwest and Northeast. The share of the non-Hispanic white population fell from 63.7% in 2010 to 57.8% in 2020, the lowest on record, driven by falling birthrates among white women compared with Hispanic and Asian women. The number of non-Hispanic white people shrank from 196 million in 2010 to 191 million.</p><p>White people continue to be the most prevalent racial or ethnic group, though that changed in California, where Hispanics became the largest racial or ethnic group, growing to 39.4% from 37.6% over the decade, while the share of white people dropped from 40.1% to 34.7%.</p><p>\u201cThe U.S. population is much more multiracial and much more racially and ethnically diverse than what we have measured in the past,\" said Nicholas Jones, a Census Bureau official.</p><p>___</p><p>EXPLAINER: 5 takeaways from the release of 2020 census data</p><p>The Census Bureau on Thursday issued its long-awaited portrait of how the U.S. has changed over the past decade, releasing a trove of demographic data that will be used to redraw political maps across an increasingly diverse country. The data will also shape how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is distributed each year.</p><p>Here are five takeaways from the latest census figures:</p><p>___</p><p>WHITE POPULATION DECLINED FOR FIRST TIME ON RECORD</p><p>A U.S. headcount has been carried out every decade since 1790, and this was the first one in which the non-Hispanic white population nationwide got smaller, shrinking from 196 million in 2010 to 191 million in 2020.</p><p>___</p><p>Taliban take Kandahar, Herat in major Afghanistan offensive</p><p>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) \u2014 The Taliban captured two major Afghan cities, the country's second- and third-largest after Kabul, and a strategic provincial capital on Thursday, further squeezing the embattled government just weeks before the end of the American military mission in Afghanistan.</p><p>The seizure of Kandahar and Herat marks the biggest prizes yet for the Taliban, who have taken 12 of Afghanistan's 34 provincial capitals as part of a weeklong blitz. </p><p>The capture of the city of Ghazni, meanwhile, cuts off a crucial highway linking the Afghan capital, Kabul, with the country's southern provinces, all part of an insurgent push some 20 years after U.S. and NATO troops invaded and ousted the Taliban government. </p><p>While Kabul itself isn't directly under threat yet, the losses and the battles elsewhere further tighten the grip of a resurgent Taliban, who are estimated to now hold over two-thirds of the country and continue to press their offensive.</p><p>With security rapidly deteriorating, the United States planned to send in 3,000 troops to help evacuate some personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Separately,  Britain said about 600 troops would be deployed on a short-term basis to support British nationals leaving the country. </p><p>___</p><p>Biden eyes tougher vaccine rules without provoking backlash</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 When the pace of vaccinations in the U.S. first began to slow, President Joe Biden backed incentives like million-dollar cash lotteries if that's what it took to get shots in arms. But as new coronavirus infections soar, he's testing a tougher approach.</p><p>In just the past two weeks, Biden has forced millions of federal workers to attest to their vaccination status or face onerous new requirements. He's met with business leaders at the White House to press them to do the same.</p><p>Meanwhile, the administration has taken steps toward mandating shots for people traveling into the U.S. from overseas. And the White House is weighing options to be more assertive at the state and local level, including potential support for school districts imposing rules to prevent spread of the virus over the objection of Republican leaders.</p><p>\u201cTo the mayors, school superintendents, educators, local leaders, who are standing up to the governors politicizing mask protection for our kids: thank you,\u201d Biden said Thursday. \"Thank God that we have heroes like you, and I stand with you all, and America should as well.\u201d</p><p>But even as Biden becomes more aggressive, he has refrained from using all of his powers to pressure Americans to get vaccinated. He's held off, for instance, on proposals to require vaccinations for all air travelers or, for that matter, the federal work force. The result is a precarious balancing act as Biden works to make life more uncomfortable for the unvaccinated without spurring a backlash in a deeply polarized country that would only undermine his public health goals.</p><p>___</p><p>States that had a grip on COVID now seeing a crush of cases</p><p>The COVID-19 surge that is sending hospitalizations to all-time highs in parts of the South is also clobbering states like Hawaii and Oregon that were once seen as pandemic success stories.</p><p>After months in which they kept cases and hospitalizations at manageable levels, they are watching progress slip away as record numbers of patients overwhelm bone-tired health care workers. </p><p>Oregon \u2014 like Florida, Arkansas and Louisiana in recent days \u2014 has more people in the hospital with COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. Hawaii is about to reach that mark, too. </p><p>This, despite both states having vaccination levels higher than the national average as of last week. Arkansas and Louisiana were significantly below average, while Florida was about even.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. People are exhausted. You can see it in their eyes,\" said Dr. Jason Kuhl, chief medical officer at Oregon's Providence Medford Medical Center, where patients are left on gurneys in hallways, their monitoring machines beeping away.</p><p>___</p><p>Cuomo exit isn't stopping push for answers on nursing homes</p><p>Sexual harassment allegations cost New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo his job. Now, many want to see him answer for a scandal that cut to the heart of his reputation as a pandemic hero and may have had life-and-death consequences \u2014 his administration's handling of outbreaks in nursing homes.</p><p>Months before a blistering investigation found Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women, the same attorney general concluded that the administration understated the true death toll in nursing homes by thousands and that fatalities may have been fueled by a state order that effectively forced such homes to accept recovering COVID-19 patients.</p><p>Whatever action may lie ahead on the harassment claims, families of the more than 15,000 New Yorkers who died in nursing homes say they want accountability, too, and are urging state lawmakers and the U.S. Justice Department to keep investigating Cuomo after he leaves office. </p><p>\u201cThe nursing home people and their families have not had a day of reckoning,\" said Vivian Zayas, who blames Cuomo for her mother\u2019s death in a West Islip, New York, nursing home.</p><p>\u201cThis not a victory yet,\u201d she said. \u201cA victory is when the whole nursing home scandal is blown open.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>#MeToo Take 2? Movement\u2019s strength hailed amid Cuomo fallout</p><p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Anita Hill educated a nation about workplace sexual harassment back in 1991 with calm, deliberate testimony against Clarence Thomas. And today, 30 years later, she speaks in the same measured tones, eschewing dramatic declarations \u2014 especially of victory \u2014 and sounding more like the soft-spoken academic she is than an activist.</p><p>But Hill was certain enough, after Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced his resignation this week, to make this pronouncement: \u201cWe\u2019ve made progress. The conversation has changed. And #MeToo did that.\u201d</p><p>Hill was joined by a number of leading figures connected with #MeToo in her feeling that the movement,  launched in 2017 with revelations about Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, had reached a significant milestone this week, regardless of fits and starts along the way.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got millions of people talking about their experiences \u2026 and understanding they are not alone, I think that sent a message to the American public that we needed to stop being in denial about these problems,\u201d Hill said in an interview after the governor said Tuesday he was resigning in two weeks, amid a slew of harassment allegations.</p><p>\u201cBecause there were just too many voices and too many experiences for us to say collectively that this doesn\u2019t happen. So I think that was the role that #MeToo had to play, in order for us to get where we are today.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Fires charring US West range set up ranchers for hardship</p><p>LAME DEER, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Wildfires tearing through eastern Montana and elsewhere in the U.S. West are devouring vast areas of rangeland that cattle ranchers depend upon, setting the stage for a potential shortage of livestock forage as the hot, dry summer grinds on.</p><p>On the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, firefighters and local authorities scrambled to save hundreds of homes in the path of a fire that started Sunday and exploded across more than 260 square miles (673 square kilometers) in just a few days, triggering evacuation orders covering thousands of people. </p><p>Some ranchers stayed behind to help. Yet as flames charred mile after mile of rangeland and forest, fire crews could do little to protect cattle pastures that are crucial to economic survival for some families on the remote reservation.</p><p>As the fire raced across the hilly reservation, tribal member Darlene Small helped her grandson move about 100 head of cattle to a new pasture, only to have to relocate them twice more as the flames from the Richard Spring fire bore down, she said Thursday. An extreme drought that's blanketing the West has made matters worse for ranchers by stunting vegetation untouched by fire.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got to have pasture where there\u2019s water. If there\u2019s no water, there\u2019s no good pasture,\u201d Small said. Particularly hard hit were some ranchers already depending on surplus grass after a fire burned them off their normal pasture last year, she said.</p><p>___</p><p>Migrants find themselves stranded abroad by new US policy</p><p>EL CEIBO, Guatemala (AP) \u2014 Karla Leiva sat on the patio of a migrant shelter near the Guatemala-Mexico border Thursday with her 5-year-old daughter Zoe. They had been in three countries in the past 24 hours, none of them their own.</p><p>Leiva, 32, from Yoro in north-central Honduras, had arrived at the shelter in El Ceibo on Wednesday. She and her daughter had started that day 1,000 miles to the north in Brownsville, Texas, where they were put on a plane by the U.S. government with dozens of others mothers and children without knowing where it was going.</p><p>The rumor running among the migrants was that they were being sent to California. Eventually, while in the air, they were told the plane would land in Villahermosa, in southern Mexico\u2019s Tabasco state. There, Mexican authorities hustled them onto buses that drove them the three-plus hours to the Guatemalan border.</p><p>Leiva and her daughter were swept up in the latest U.S. government effort to deter migrants and asylum-seekers from arriving at its southern border. While still delivering some migrants on flights directly to their Central American nations, the U.S. government has started supplementing with flights to southern Mexican cities like Villahermosa and Tapachula, where Mexican authorities carry them the rest of the way to Guatemala\u2019s border, even if they\u2019re not Guatemalan.</p><p>Since last year, the U.S. has not been allowing migrants to solicit asylum at the southern border under a pandemic-related ban.</p><p>___</p><p>Larry Heinzerling, AP executive and bureau chief, dies at 75</p><p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Larry Heinzerling, a 41-year Associated Press news executive and bureau chief who played a key role in winning freedom for hostage Terry Anderson from his Hezbollah abductors in Lebanon, has died after a short illness. He was 75.</p><p>Heinzerling, who passed away at home in New York on Wednesday night, served as AP bureau chief in South Africa during a time of popular revolt against apartheid and in West Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He was deputized by then-AP President and Chief Executive Officer Lou Boccardi to seek contacts with governments and international intermediaries to obtain the release of Anderson, the AP bureau chief in Beirut who had been kidnapped by the extremist group in 1985. </p><p>He worked behind the scenes for nearly seven years to win Anderson\u2019s release in 1991.</p><p>At AP headquarters in New York, Heinzerling was director of AP World Services and later deputy international editor. He was the son of the late Lynn Heinzerling, a Pulitzer Prize-winning foreign correspondent for the AP in Europe and Africa. </p><p>\u201cLarry followed in the footsteps of his illustrious AP correspondent father but he walked his own widely admired path \u2014 reporter, editor, bureau chief, headquarters executive and, in one painful period in AP history, my personal envoy as we searched across the world for the key to freedom for Terry Anderson,\" Boccardi said in an email Thursday. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-1f152be221dc88bea46f5943b7f272e1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BX-03P1-JBVR-32CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2255\"/><timeReceived>06:03 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 12, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

However, the article doesn't acknowledge that Yukon needs energy to heat our homes and buildings, and implies that using cord wood and wood chips increases Yukon's carbon foot print.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It also fails to acknowledge that to meet Yukon's energy demand for heat, the alternative to wood is to burn more LNG, diesel, propane and heating oil, which are not carbon neutral.</p><p>Wood energy is burning biomass carbon that has been part of the natural carbon exchange cycle for millennia. In Yukon, areas harvested for the production of cord wood and wood chip energy must be reforested according to the Forest Resources Act.</p><p>By planting or natural regeneration, a reestablished tree takes carbon out of the atmosphere and converts it into stem wood, bark and leaves. Trees in a forest are carbon capture and sequestration factories, with century long life cycles. When a tree or forest dies by natural or artificial means its carbon is released back into the atmosphere.</p><p>Wood energy offsets fossil fuel energy and represents an opportunity to leave fossil fuel in the ground. The wood chip boilers that have been installed in Whitehorse and Teslin are high efficiency boilers and burn the wood clean, with flue gas emissions similar to oil fired boilers. These systems are virtually smokeless.</p><p>Whitehorse and the Southern Lakes region is surrounded by forests that are approaching the day when a significant stand replacing event will occur. This is due to the age, species and structure of the second growth forest present in the triangle from Jakes Corner to Carcross to Lake Laberge.</p><p>The forests in this area were heavily logged for cordwood between 1900 and 1950's to fuel steamboats, White Pass Railroad, heating buildings and building construction. The carbon released into the atmosphere for energy consumption in the first half of the last century has been recaptured and has grown to become a threat to our communities.</p><p>Landscape fuel management plans are under development to identifying the most critical lands requiring treatment to mitigate the risk of a large fire burning out of control in the wildland-urban interface zone where we live.</p><p>This work, if it is to be effective, will produce waste wood in quantities that will result in a massive waste disposal challenge. This waste wood represents a significant opportunity to reduce, and offset our fossil fuel carbon emissions. By not consuming fossil fuels, it can be argued that our consumption is lowered therefore, less fossil carbon is emitted.</p><p>In conclusion, biomass heating fuel is biosphere carbon and is not adding to the current parts per million of carbon in the air but does reduce fossil fuel inputs.</p><p>Biomass is carbon neutral and must be measured in terms of the life cycle of the forest as part of the earth's natural and ongoing carbon exchange cycle.</p><p>Myles H Thorp</p><p>Executive director</p><p>Yukon Wood Products Association</p><p>Society's position regarding biofuels is flawed</p><p>Regarding the recent commentary from Wildlife Society Canada on environmental problems with biofuels, and with sincere respect to the authors, the analysis presented is incomplete and in part flawed.</p><p>For the past 15 years, I have been studying biofuels as a byproduct of forest fire risk reduction operations. My study has been confined to space heating and does not consider electrical power generation.</p><p>We need to stay warm and we either use fossil fuels, wood, or electricity to do so. Our electricity demand now exceeds our hydro-capacity, so we are burning trucked-in propane to run the generators. Note that this is a fossil fuel.</p><p>If we are not using biofuels (i.e. biosphere carbon) to stay warm, we will be using fossil fuels, injecting into the air carbon new to the biosphere.</p><p>Solar energy is, and will remain, inconsequential for space heating, the demand for which peaks when the solar input is least. So if we are going to stay warm, shall we recycle biosphere carbon or shall we add new (fossil) carbon to the biosphere? Note also that modern biomass boilers are as carbon-efficient as fossil fuel boilers so there is no \"dirty fuel\" side to this unless we are talking older model wood stoves.</p><p>Here is the incomplete part of the WSC analysis: the real case for biofuels is driven by a dominating public need to remove forest fuels from the Whitehorse urban periphery to manage fire risk. Think Ft. McMurray, California or Australia. This must be done in quantities that will themselves be a massive waste disposal challenge or a fossil fuel replacement opportunity.</p><p>If we manage forest slash as a waste, it will be burned in open air piles - a dirty carbon event indeed. If burned as chips in modern biofuel boilers such as in Teslin, the carbon injected in the atmosphere can be equivalent to the fossil fuels that are being replaced. Chipping and scattering the volume of slash to be expected is impractical and wasteful.</p><p>A similar case can be made for the wood slash from fire risk reduction activities in the communities.</p><p>Until it is better understood, I am skeptical of the case for biofuels for electrical generation, mostly because of problems I see in forest sustainability.</p><p>David Loeks</p><p>TransNorthern Consulting</p><p>Whitehorse</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-3935958</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0Y-C7J1-F103-34JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Yukon News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>Business &amp;

The 26-year-old from Markham, Ont., made it look easy and in classic De Grasse style, he got off to a pedestrian start before laying down a scorching second half, easily reeling in the competition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He will be looking for his second medal in Tokyo after taking bronze in the 100 metres. He'll also try to get a medal in the 200 for a second straight Games. De Grasse took silver in the event at the 2106 Rio de Janeiro Olympics when he set his old Canadian-best mark of 19.80 seconds. </p><p>\"I knew I had it in me. My (personal best) was from 2016, and I knew I was better than that, especially coming off of the personal best a couple nights ago,\" De Grasse said. \"I didn't expect to go that fast.

Andrew Cuomo faced mounting pressure Tuesday to resign, including from President Joe Biden and other one-time Democratic allies, after an investigation found he sexually harassed nearly a dozen women and worked to retaliate against one of his accusers.</p><p>\"I think he should resign,'' Biden told reporters Tuesday, echoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and New York's U.S. Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, all Democrats.</p><p>The leader of the state Assembly, which has the power to bring impeachment charges, said it was clear Cuomo could no longer remain in office. Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat, said he would move to complete an impeachment inquiry \"as quickly as possible.''</p><p>Cuomo remained defiant, saying in a taped response to the findings that \"the facts are much different than what has been portrayed\" and that he \"never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances.\"</p><p>In a telephone conversation with Heastie, Cuomo insisted he wouldn't leave office and told the speaker he needed to work fellow Democrats and garner enough votes to stop an impeachment, according to a person familiar with the conversation.</p><p>The nearly five-month, non-criminal investigation, overseen by New York's attorney general and led by two outside lawyers, concluded that 11 women from within and outside state government were telling the truth when they said Cuomo had touched them inappropriately, commented on their appearance or made suggestive comments about their sex lives.</p><p>Anne Clark, who led the probe with former U.S. Attorney Joon Kim, said the allegations had varying degrees of corroboration, including other witnesses and contemporaneous text messages. Investigators interviewed 179 people, including the governor himself.</p><p>\"These interviews and pieces of evidence revealed a deeply disturbing yet clear picture: Gov. Cuomo sexually harassed current and former state employees in violation of federal and state laws,'' New York Attorney General Letitia James said at a press conference on Tuesday.</p><p>Many of the women said they feared retaliation if they reported Cuomo's behaviour, investigators said, describing his administration as a hostile workplace \"\"rife with fear and intimidation.''</p><p>The investigation's findings, detailed in a 165-page public report, turn up the pressure on the 63-year-old governor, who just a year ago was widely hailed for his steady leadership during the darkest days of the COVID-19 crisis, even writing a book about it.</p><p>While James concluded the investigation without referring the case to prosecutors for possible criminal charges, local authorities could use its evidence and findings to mount cases. Albany District Attorney David Soares said he would request materials from James' office and welcomed victims to contact him.</p><p>In his taped response, Cuomo apologized to two accusers: Charlotte Bennett, who said the governor asked if she was open to sex with an older man after she confided she had been a sexual assault victim, and a woman he kissed at a wedding. Cuomo said he was hiring an expert to reform sexual harassment training for state employees, including the governor.</p><p>But he denied other allegations as fabricated and lashed out at the investigative process, saying it was fuelled by \"politics and bias.'' He explained that he's physically embraced people his whole life, that his mother and father _ former Gov. Mario Cuomo _ had done the same and that the gesture was meant to \"convey warmth.''</p><p>---</p><p>What we are watching in the rest of the world ...</p><p>VARIBOBI, Greece _ Firefighting planes resumed operation at first light in Greece on Wednesday to tackle a major forest fire on the northern outskirts of Athens that forced thousands to flee their homes the previous day amid the country's worst heat wave in decades.</p><p>The fire in the Varibobi and Tatoi suburbs of the Greek capital was the worst of 81 wildfires that broke out around the country in 24 hours from late Monday to late Tuesday.</p><p>Five water-dropping planes and nine helicopters were helping more than 500 firefighters, soldiers and numerous volunteer groups on the ground, the fire department said.</p><p>\"It was another exceptionally difficult night,\" Civil Protection chief Nikos Hardalias said while visiting a fire department mobile coordination centre in the area on Wednesday morning. He said fire fighters had succeeded in reducing four active fire fronts to one overnight.</p><p>The fire was fuelled by tinder-dry conditions caused by a protracted heat wave that began last week and sent temperatures soaring to 45 degrees Celsius.</p><p>There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries. The fire burned homes, businesses and vehicles, and sent a large cloud of smoke over Athens on Tuesday night. The government announced it would provide hotel rooms for local residents for as long as they are unable to return to their homes.</p><p>On Tuesday, residents evacuated in cars and on foot, while riding schools in the area raced to evacuate horses from the path of the flames. Some horses, released from their stables, wandered down the streets.</p><p>Apart from the fire north of Athens, two more major forest fires were still burning Wednesday morning, one on the island of Evia and one in the southwestern Peloponnese.</p><p>The fire department said 95 firefighters, two aircraft, four ground teams and 35 vehicles were battling the flames in Evia, while 74 firefighters, three ground teams, 22 vehicles and one helicopter were tackling the fire in the Messinia area of the Peloponnese.</p><p>As the heat wave scorching the eastern Mediterranean intensified, temperatures reached 42 degrees Celsius in parts of the Greek capital. The extreme weather has fuelled deadly wildfires in Turkey and blazes in Italy, Greece, Albania and across the region.</p><p>The heatwave is forecast to continue in Greece until the end of the week.</p><p>---</p><p>On this day in 1983 ...</p><p>In the so-called \"Fowl Ball\" incident, New York Yankee outfielder Dave Winfield was charged by Toronto police after killing a seagull with a thrown baseball. A charge of unnecessary cruelty to an animal was later dropped</p><p>---</p><p>In CFL news ...</p><p>The CFL has established a policy should COVID-19 issues force game cancellations this year.</p><p>The league didn't stage a 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic and teams will resume play with an shortened 14-game regular season that begins Thursday night.</p><p>If a game can't be played and rescheduled because of COVID-19 issues, the club suffering from the COVID-19 issues will forfeit a 1-0 loss. If both squads have COVID-19 issues, each will forfeit the game and assigned losses.</p><p>In either scenario, if a team can prove at least 85 per cent of its players under contract have been vaccinated, at least once, the players will receive their salary for the cancelled game. If that figure falls below 85 per cent, players won't be paid.</p><p>It was not clear if coaches would still be paid if a team's vaccination rate fell below 85 per cent as they are not part of the league's collective bargaining agreement it has with players.</p><p>The CFL said as of Friday, when teams made their final cuts, 79 per cent of players were fully or partially vaccinated. Three clubs had over 85 per cent of their players vaccinated with the rates of the other six ranging between 67 to 81 per cent</p><p>\"Our goal is to ensure we have zero game cancellations due to issues caused by an outbreak of COVID-19 within our football operations,\u201d CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie says. \"While this policy spells out what will happen if cancellations do occur, its main purpose is to encourage all of our players to get fully vaccinated in order to minimize the risk to our season and, most importantly, their health and safety.\"</p><p>---</p><p>ICYMI ...</p><p>A Newfoundland town that became famous on a late-night American talk show for sharing a name with a sex toy is once again urging residents to steer clear of a sign spelling out the name \"Dildo.\"</p><p>The town of Dildo reminded residents and visitors in a Facebook post last week that the giant Hollywood-style sign sits on private property and hiking to the sign is prohibited.</p><p>The town said the sign also sits atop a steep, rocky cliff and the trek up for photo shoots is dangerous.</p><p>The Dildo sign went up two years ago as part of a bit on the talk show hosted by American comic Jimmy Kimmel.</p><p>Kimmel launched a tongue-in-cheek campaign to become honorary mayor of Dildo and sent his sidekick, Guillermo Rodriguez, to the town for a few live reports.</p><p>---</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 4, 2021</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-625924ce17d543629f7c890f81baae31</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6396-6XT1-JBVR-34NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2006\"/><timeReceived>04:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 4, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Here, Charlotte Sutherland gazes out over a motel parking lot while small white flakes of ash occasionally touch down softly on the ground.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sitting on a patio chair outside her room, soaking up the thin rays of sunlight that have managed to penetrate the wildfire smoke enveloping large swaths of the province, Sutherland flips the pages of her book and waits for the day she can return home.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sutherland is one of the 1,000 people forced to flee their homes due to wildfires in this region of B.C. since Tuesday, the same day the government declared a provincial state of emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fires are common enough in B.C. that there is a recognized wildfire season each summer. But this year has been different. Thousands of homes have been evacuated, but with emergency accommodations packed to the brim, officials have asked people to stay with friends, and for tourists to carefully consider any plans to visit. The result has led to a season of uncertainty and dread.</p><p>Hotel rooms are scarce, parking lots are full of trailers, highways feature heavy traffic amid a smoky background.</p><p>Some fear this is a glimpse of what Canada will see more of in the years to come, as climate change fuels more extreme weather events. Often called climate refugees - though the term is up for debate - those ordered to leave their homes need somewhere to go.</p><p>Sutherland's journey was set in motion when a car slammed into a power pole attached to a transformer near her home at Two Mile Road, sparking an instant forest fire.</p><p>With a terminally ill husband to worry about, she skipped waiting for an evacuation order and quickly checked them both into a motel just a few kilometres away, fearing accommodations would soon be full. Not long after, booking into hotels became impossible for others in the area.</p><p>\"We don't have family here, so where do you go?\" she says. \"You have to stay away from the fire so you've got to stay in a motel.\"</p><p>The motel has become home base for Sutherland as she ensures her husband can take his medication and get to appointments. She says her friends have rallied around her and, she chuckles, being \"partial to wine\" has also helped her cope.</p><p>She's not the only evacuee waiting it out at this Best Western, a two-storey motel off the side of the Trans-Canada Highway cutting through town. Manager Eileen Hartwig says there are about 30 rooms out of more than 60 with evacuees in them.</p><p>On Thursday, Hartwig says rooms were being prioritized for evacuees, reserved for them in the event tourists - who would usually be enjoying nearby Shuswap Lake - cancel or leave.</p><p>\"We're trying to do what we can to accommodate, the local people should take precedence,\" she says. \"We're just trying to keep things rolling.\"</p><p>In 2017, B.C. had one of the worst fire seasons ever recorded, with 1.2 million hectares of forest burned and 65,000 people evacuated from their homes. Two years later, Canadian climate scientists said \"human-induced\" climate change likely was a major driver.</p><p>Now, with more than 5,000 properties in the province on evacuation order and another 17,000 on alert as of Friday, according to Emergency Management BC, another devastating fire season is raising the question of how the province can cope with large blazes.</p><p>The heart of B.C.'s holiday country, the interior of the province dotted with low mountain ranges, warm lakes and vineyards, is playing host to contrasting scenes of vacationers on the beaches while, in the background, nervous locals wait and hope the flames don't wipe out everything they have.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Coquihalla Highway, a major route that cuts through the interior down to Vancouver, cars are backed up for kilometres heading north while crews hustle to make sure flames didn't turn into another wildfire.</p><p>Along the southern route, the Crowsnest Highway, some cars sit on the roadside broken down in the summer heat with frustrated drivers standing beside them. Just outside the small orchard village of Keremeos, smoke begins to fill the sky, the landscape made up of the desert, dust and tumbleweeds many Canadians wouldn't even recognize. Temperatures are passing 30 C.</p><p>Thirty minutes drive to the east in Osoyoos, a resort community long favoured by Albertans and British Columbians coming for the hot, dry weather and lake, a fire has temporarily displaced residents and local media say hundreds of homes have been ordered evacuated, many on nearby OsoyoosIndian Band property.</p><p>In town Wednesday morning, one restaurant serves weary evacuees paying for breakfast with meal vouchers next to tables of people on holiday having a few laughs and planning the day's activities.</p><p>The question of what to call people displaced by climate events - and how to support them - is a live conversation in Canada that is becoming all the more urgent, says Sarah Kamal, a UBC graduate student and researcher with the Climate Migrants and Refugee Project focused on the mobility of those affected by climate change in Canada.</p><p>The consensus among academics and legal experts is that people displaced by climate events, which will become more common due to climate change, need a different label than \"climate refugee\" - a term that has started to gain traction around the world and is often associated with masses of people forced to flee after extreme whether events.</p><p>\"There's the emotional valence of the term climate refugee, but for legal reasons it's not a term a lot of academics accept,\" she says. \"They are fleeing their homes, but the cause of what they're fleeing is not covered under legal frameworks at all.\"</p><p>Kamal, who has studied what other countries around the world have done to support people displaced by climate events, says the most appropriate term for now is: displacement.</p><p>What to do with climate-displaced people in Canada is still a new question, but it's clear the first step is to develop a federal policy, she says.</p><p>Such a policy would not hand down a one-size-fits-all approach to helping displaced people, but it could include financial commitments to assist areas affected by things such as wildfires, storms and floods, as well as a framework for municipalities and regions to form their own displacement plans.</p><p>In the meantime, the province's emergency support services is helping people find places to stay and ensure they have what they need to survive.</p><p>About 361,000 hectares have burned across B.C. so far this year - an area fives time that of Toronto. Noelle Kekula has been a government fire information officer, tasked with providing updates to the public, on and off since 1993. She called the current state of affairs \"overwhelming.\"</p><p>One fire completely destroyed the town of Lytton late last month, killing two people. The fires came after a massive \"heat dome\" had temperatures cracking 40 C in many parts of the province.</p><p>At the nearby emergency support services reception centre in Oliver, another fruit-growing and wine community 20 kilometres away from Osoyoos, a little girl is still wearing her night gown, suggesting the departure from her home was quick.</p><p>Outside the centre, two women are furious after finding a lit cigarette butt discarded in a sidewalk planter full of dried-out grass and flowers. One goes inside the centre thinking she's figured out who is responsible for it and wants to scold them.</p><p>\"We're here to provide emergency support services in the way of absolute necessities that they can't provide for themselves any other way,\" says volunteer Bill Morrison of the provincial program. \"Lodging, food, clothing, incidentals, whatever they couldn't grab or provide for themselves.\"</p><p>The evacuees coming here ebb and flow, he says while sitting outside of the centre. A few people are inside at the moment, more are expected the next day.</p><p>With the influx of tourists, finding a place to put evacuees can be a challenge, he says, but there's been a healthy response from the community offering accommodations.</p><p>A three-hour drive north, in Sicamous, Mayor Terry Rysz says the resort town's population goes to 15,000 from 3,000 during the summer. Rysz says though the community has come together along with neighbouring towns, he's not resting easy just yet.</p><p>\"I'm a little concerned,\" he says. \"If all of the sudden the fire comes into Sicamous and we have to evacuate the whole town, that is going to be a serious challenge.\"</p><p>For now, the fire seems to be going in the right direction, he says. Thursday morning, he was glad there were no reports of any homes being destroyed.</p><p>But new problems have emerged with the yearly influx of tourists, such as boaters getting in the way of aircraft trying to gather water from the lakes to drop on the fire.</p><p>\"A bunch of bozos going out in their boats with cameras and you've got a helicopter flying straight above them,\" Rysz says. \"I was just livid, but you can't fix stupid.\"</p><p>Other tourists are weighing their options, while trying to stay out of the way of fire fighting efforts.</p><p>Adult siblings Autumn Parker and Will Ritz are sitting on the lawn at the Pines motel trying to figure out what to do next as Parker's baby snoozes in a stroller next to them.</p><p>From High River, Alta., they're on vacation with a group of nine people, including two infants. The family only managed one full day in the lakeside hotel they'd booked before having to evacuate shortly after the fire began. Ritz watched the fire eat up trees as it spread fewer than two kilometres from his hotel.</p><p>\"We went inside and then I came out 45 minutes later and the fire was three times in size already,\" he says. \"I thought, 'OK, we might be in a little trouble here.'\"</p><p>Hotels filled immediately, so they moved to a friend's place about 30 kilometres to the southwest in Salmon Arm before coming back to the motel in Sicamous.</p><p>Sitting on loungers outside the motel, they're leaning toward going home rather than spending the time bouncing around and trying to find places to stay.</p><p>\"Nine of us trying to find a place was a little bit difficult,\" Parker says. \"With two infants we're hauling around a lot of crap.\"</p><p>Two Mile Road resident and evacuee Carolyn Swallow says she understands why some tourists choose to stay, but some consideration for locals at a trying time needs to take place.</p><p>\"I know that this is where they come and of course they have to have some place to go,\" Swallow says. \"You have to think about things. How it is for everyone locally?\"</p><p>A climate-displacement plan would mean towns, villages, First Nations and cities would already know where residents could go in such emergencies, Kamal said.</p><p>She pointed to American cities such as Duluth and Buffalo, which have plans to build infrastructure with an eye to becoming \"climate havens\" for areas of the country likely to be hit by the effects of climate change, whether that's sea-level rise or severe heat.</p><p>Kamal wants Canada to also learn from people already displaced by climate change, to help form policies around what they need at the time of displacement.</p><p>\"We need to be able to have a way to understand that more and more, especially as we are facing a lot of wildfires this season. And there's going to be a lot more coming down the line,\" she said. \"Rather than working from crisis to crisis we want to be working in advance, and to have agreements in place.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, for Sutherland, part of the answer is for people to stop the kind of careless behaviour she says starts forest fires in the first place.</p><p>People doing things like flicking cigarette butts out their car windows or impeding helicopters trying to gather buckets of water need to \"grow up\" she says.</p><p>\"We as a society are failing miserably,\" she says.</p><p>With files from Alex McKeen</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20210725TTA2021072561648504</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6372-CW91-F197-51BV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1953\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

It encourages me to work harder.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highway will be among the stars of this year's Luminato Festival. The Dora Award-winning cabaret show \"The Cave,\" which premiered at last year's Luminato, and for which Highway wrote the lyrics, John Millard the music and Martha Ross the book, is being broadcast this week as part of this year's all-online event.</p><p>Now in its 14th year, Luminato is a multi-arts festival that usually fills up theatres, concert halls and outdoor spaces around Toronto. More than 250,000 people experienced Luminato's 17 days of programming in 2019, which had seven world premieres including master puppeteer Ronnie Burkett's \"Forget Me Not,\" the kaleidoscopic maze \"House Of Mirrors\" and the major outdoor choral event \"Maada'ookii Songlines.\"</p><p>This year's festival was planned to run over the next two weeks, but had to be rethought and significantly scaled back due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are now three days (Thursday through Saturday) of recorded and livestreamed performances and talks online.</p><p>Other highlights of this year's virtual Luminato include a number of works by Canadian composer R. Murray Schafer and \"Field Notes for the Future,\" a followup piece by science journalist Alanna Mitchell to her acclaimed and well-travelled play \"Sea Sick.\"</p><p>Highway had been planning to speak to me from his Gatineau home, but got caught up in a music store errand in Ottawa, and ended up sitting in a parking lot and sipping fast food coffee for the duration of our 45-minute chat. This did nothing to suppress his effusiveness.</p><p>\"The Cave,\" billed as an \"interspecies song cycle,\" is performed by four actors playing animals - bear, snake, beaver, skunk and more - who take refuge from a forest fire and entertain each other and the audience through song (the show is a Luminato production, in association with the Cave Collective). While the tone is frequently playful, it addresses climate change and underlines the effects of human action on the land and all its inhabitants.</p><p>Under quarantine, Highway said that he feels that connection to nature more than ever: \"When the planes stopped flying - they fly right over Gatineau, there is noise every five minutes - now it's all gone. The silence is stunning. There is a rapids about a kilometre away from us, a mini-waterfall. You can never hear that from our place, but now you can hear it. The movement of water brings a sense of peace. The clarity, the blueness of the sky is extraordinary.\"</p><p>Besides the water, he and his partner of 36 years now mostly hear birdsong: \"We live in a garden really, a beautiful house with plants and birds. We have a resident cardinal and blue jay - they are the most beautiful birds and the most raucous.\"</p><p>With a very low COVID-19 infection rate in his area, Highway said that he feels like he's in a \"cocoon of safety,\" enjoying visits from his grandchildren and the privilege of being a writer whose capacity to work has not been disrupted.</p><p>\"I am very busy and I love it,\" he said. \"When I am not busy I get depressed. When you work very hard, you are excited and animated and happy.</p><p>\"We are here to laugh, that is why we are on the planet,\" he added. \"I laugh about a hundred times a day. If you haven't laughed a hundred times a day, you have not lived that day.\"</p><p>Highway is not blinkered from the extreme hardship that many around the world are facing. He's particularly inflamed about the current situation in Brazil, which has become a world hot spot for COVID infection. He has many Brazilian friends and his work is frequently translated into Portuguese; he would have been in Brazil right now for an annual trip were it not for the global health crisis.</p><p>\"What is happening in Brazil right now is so evil,\" said Highway, referring to the regime of President Jair Bolsonaro, which made news last week for limiting the release of COVID data and threatening to leave the World Health Organization. \"The way (Bolsonaro) encourages his population of 200 million to kill gays, to treat women like toilet paper, to kill Blacks, to reject everything that is not white and male and heterosexual ... beautiful artists will die and have died. That's wrong. It's our responsibility, all of us, whether we are artists, to fight that evil. That's why I do what I do.\"</p><p>Referencing both U.S. President Donald Trump and Bolsonaro, Highway said, \"I don't know what their objective is. They are creating a tremendous amount of misery, tragedy and pain. Nobody has a right to do that. Everything should be done to take power away from people like that.\"</p><p>Despite this, Highway believes that bad people are outnumbered by good ones. When he thinks about responding to the times we live in and about healing the planet, he thinks of his parents: \"You've never seen a more religious couple. They were on their knees every night with their elbows on the bed, praying intensely, with tears in their eyes ... the world now has forgotten how to pray. We need to relearn how to pray. Nothing brings you down to your knees faster than death.\"</p><p>While he calls himself a \"lapsed Catholic,\" Highway has a personal version of prayer: \"I lie in my solarium and I look at the maple tree and I pray to it, and I think of all the people who help me get to where I am.\"</p><p>See luminatofestival.com for the full Luminato schedule. \"The Cave\" will be broadcast Saturday at 8 p.m., beginning with a special introduction by Tomson Highway.</p><p>Karen Fricker is a Toronto-based theatre critic and a freelance contributor for the Star.</p><p>Follow her on Twitter: @KarenFricker2</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020061058142132</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603K-WP41-JBTY-W0NC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"978\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 10, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp;

Two excited 22-year-olds left home in rural Hampshire and set sail from England on board the liner Empress Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We arrived in Toronto and decided to head as far west as possible. In Vancouver, Canadian National Railways told us there was \u201call kinds of work available in Kitimat, some 500 miles North\u201d.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We took the plunge. David signed up for general work while I declared myself a stenographer with shorthand and typing skills. This boast would come back to haunt me.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The steamship Princess Norah took us up the coast and on arrival in Kitimat we faced the first separation of our married lives. David was taken off to his new living quarters, a bunkhouse on the Delta King, while I was allocated a place in \u201cThe White House\u201d, high on the hill overlooking the bay where the Delta King was berthed.</p><p>I didn\u2019t see David for three days and remember watching as more and more people arrived eager to work with the huge Aluminium Company of Canada. There were engineers, electricians, mechanics and dozens of other trades-most of them from Europe-looking for work on the potlines and in the offices.</p><p>I can remember so well going to the hut to which I had been directed to sign-on. It was full of men speaking in a multitude of languages, and the overpowering smell of garlic. This, I came to realize later, was because most of those around me were Europeans, displaced people who were still trying to get their lives together after the Second World War.</p><p>I was assigned to the office to work for Norman Handford. That first meeting made a deep impression on me and remains etched in my mind. I had come from the UK where employees were never addressed by their given names. It was always \u2018Mr., Mrs.or Miss So-and-so\u2019. You knew your station and were not encouraged to rise above it.</p><p>When I walked into that office in Kitimat, the boss walked towards me smiling, hand outstretched. \u2018Hi.\u2019 he said, \u2018Welcome. I\u2019m Norm-Norman Handford, and this is my number two, Frank. Frank Gleadow. And here is Marion. She\u2019ll help you.</p><p>I could not believe my ears! Here was the boss talking to me as an equal.</p><p>Marion Lindsay showed me how to type up the manifests of the supplies shipped to Alcan. Fortunately Marion was the stenographer and took dictation from Norm. Despite my claims when I had signed up, I couldn\u2019t do shorthand.</p><p>Marion\u2019s husband Bernie had been one of the first workers to arrive in Kitimat, where he had met and married Marion. His family followed and his father, Sam Lindsay, was later to become Mayor of Kitimat. David and I later rented Marion and Bernie\u2019s basement apartment in Brant Street.</p><p>The only way to get to Kitimat in those days was by plane into Terrace, about 40 miles away, or by boat. There were plenty of cars on the roads in Kitimat, but nowhere to go. I remember the once-a-week dance at \u201cHelen\u2019s Cafe\u201d on the smeltersite. But television, telephone, radio? Forget it.</p><p>The Company news sheet \u2018The Kitimat Ingot\u2019 invited me to write a column from the warehouse. It was called \u201cOver the Counter\u201d and covered the activities and gossip of workers as they shipped and unloaded goods coming into ALCAN.</p><p>One day I was approached by Fred Ryan. He had just started up a teleprinting service to expedite urgent supply as logging companies in particular were screaming out for essential repair goods. The only way possible at that time was via the slow Canadian National teleprinter.</p><p>Fred rented a line from the CN and asked me if I could run it. I said \u2018yes\u2019 despite never having seen a teleprinter, never mind operating one. I spent the entire weekend learning how to master it. The business was such a success CN stopped renting the line to Fred as they were losing so many customers.</p><p>I was ready for a move and took a secretarial job with the Hunstone Construction and Logging Company but my early boasts about my shorthand skills were nearly my undoing.</p><p>I worked for Dick Grey, the company coordinator as his secretary. There was a glass window between his office and mine and he would call me when he wanted letters written. The first time I was summoned, I sat down with my notepad, pen at the ready, waiting for the inevitable moment when he realized I could not do shorthand.</p><p>I suddenly noticed that he was dictating the letter from his scribbled handwritten notes. When he was finished speaking he would crumple the paper and throw it in the wastebasket.</p><p>For several weeks, as soon as he was out of the office, I would retrieve his notes and use them to compose and present the letter he had just dictated. Then one evening disaster struck. As I was leaving the office Dick asked me to \u201ctake a letter for him to sign it in the morning\u201d. I went through the usual charade of taking notes and planned to type it up properly the following morning. But I hadn\u2019t taken account of the janitor. Overnight he had cleaned the office and cleared the wastebaskets.</p><p>I did type a letter that morning, but watched Dick\u2019s face as he read through to sign it. \u201cI have no idea what this is,\u201d he said. \u201cNor have I,\u201d was the only thing I could think to say. The whole story came out but he forgave me and I remained an employee of Hunstone Logging.</p><p>Meanwhile the logging foreman Ray Stanyer had given David work clearing the logging areas on the big Euclid machines. It was a job that nearly ended in tragedy. One day a forest fire ripped through the area he was clearing. It spread so quickly that all he could do was abandon the machine to the flames and run away as fast as he could.</p><p>As a seasoned cat-skinner with the big Euclid machines, David soon got work with Saguenay-Kitimat working on the Kildala pipeline while I took a post with Canadian National Railways as a teleprinter operator. Most of my time was spent receiving and passing on telegrams.</p><p>Socially things had improved. David and the English contingent of workers had formed a football team, grandly named The AllStars. They were managed by Canadian logging supervisor Alex Munro and regularly challenged the various European teams that had also sprung up in the town. The Hungarians, Italians, Portuguese and Germans were keen to show off their soccer skill on the dirt pitch Alcan had provided to play.</p><p>In those times the men worked hard and played hard-mostly going into the bush for moose hunting, salmon fishing and meeting their mates in the one and only bar in Kitimat. It was men-only in the beer parlour with gambling and drinking on the Delta King.</p><p>It was snow, snow and yet more snow in winter. When the thaw came, it was mud, mud, mud. When you visited your neighbours and friends the first thing you did was take off your shoes before sharing a beer.</p><p>We were invited to the first motor show held by the Bob Parker Garage and I was given a special tour of the show cars.</p><p>I was also invited to ride as the Parade Queen for the Royal Order of the Elks in the Carnival Parade (I think it might have been Dominion Day), and with David driving a festooned car, a dias was set up on a trailer, and with uniformed members of the Elk Society seated ahead, we toured the township with crowds lining the route.</p><p>I think the ratio was about 400 men for every female. There were dozens of clubs formed to bring the residents and workers together:line dancing; craft; bridge; whist; cribbage; fishing; shooting; sailing. At last a cinema came to town. The movies were rather ancient but it was always house full.</p><p>I encouraged my closest friend in the UK to come to Kitimat. Eve arrived at Terrace and as a first class stenographer, and I knew she could earn so much with her (genuine) qualifications.</p><p>She was installed as the court stenographer under the auspices of Judge Jessop. She worked in the municipal buildings alongside Art Currie, and her work brought her into contact with the fire service and the RCMP. Her lasting memory is that of being invited to slide the fireman pole. There was a rush of firemen to the ground floor to watch her land. I wonder why? She met and married Jock Christie in Kitimat. He had moved from Scotland and theirs was the first wedding to take place in the newly built Legion Club.</p><p>David and I left Kitimat at the end of 1958 as we started our family in England the following year. There is so much more to tell of our time in the town, but my overwhelming memory is of the wonderful Canadian people. They are the most delightful people and they live in the most beautiful country in the world.</p><p>(Now 88, Pauline Silvester lives in Winchester, England.

(AP) \u2014 The governors of Oregon and New Mexico ordered near-lockdowns Friday in the most aggressive response yet to the latest wave of coronavirus infections shattering records across the U.S., even as many of their counterparts in other states show little appetite for reimposing the hard-line restrictions of last spring. 'We are in a life-or-death situation, and if we don't act right now, we cannot preserve the lives, we can't keep saving lives, and we will absolutely crush our current health care system and infrastructure,' Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico said in imposing a two-week stay-at-home order.Oregon Gov. Kate Brown ordered a two-week 'freeze' starting Wednesday, under which all businesses will be required to close their offices to the public and mandate work-from-home 'to the greatest extent possible.' </p><p>While most Oregon stores will remain open, gyms, museums, pools, movie theaters and zoos will be forced to close, and restaurants and bars will be limited to takeout. Social gatherings will be restricted to six people. The Democratic governor warned that violators could face fines or arrest. 'For the last eight months, I have been asking Oregonians to follow to the letter and the spirit of the law, and we have not chosen to engage law enforcement,' Brown said. 'At this point in time, unfortunately, we have no other option.' Both states had lockdowns earlier in the year, but the coronavirus is coming back with a vengeance across the country, and the U.S. is facing a long, dark winter. The scourge is blamed for 10.7 million confirmed infections and almost a quarter-million deaths in the U.S., with the closely watched University of Washington model projecting nearly 439,000 dead by March 1. Deaths have climbed to about 1,000 a day on average. New cases per day are soaring, reaching another all-time high on Thursday of more than 153,000. Hospitals are getting swamped. Still, there is little will among many governors and other elected officials for going back to the kind of lockdowns and large-scale business closings seen last spring. Some governors also continue to resist issuing statewide mask rules. Among the reasons given: public fatigue, fear of doing more damage to already-crippled businesses, lack of support from Washington, and the way efforts to tame the virus have become fiercely politicized. 'I think that governors and mayors are, again, in a really tough spot. The American population is emotionally and economically exhausted,' Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. President Donald Trump asked all Americans to remain 'vigilant' but ruled out a nationwide 'lockdown.' 'Hopefully, whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be, I guess time will tell, but I can tell you this administration will not go to a lockdown,' Trump said in his first public remarks since his defeat by President-elect Joe Biden. Governors in many states, such as New York, Maryland, Virginia and Minnesota, have taken largely incremental measures over the past few days, such as limiting the size of gatherings, making businesses close early, restricting capacity or cutting off alcohol sales earlier in the evening. Starting Saturday, most people in North Dakota will be ordered to wear masks at indoor public spaces and outdoors where social distancing isn't possible, Republican Gov. Doug Burgum ordered late Friday. Businesses will also have restrictions on capacity and hours of operation, according to the executive order. Nevada Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak has repeatedly argued that containing the virus is largely up to individuals. 'Some people are going to ask, 'Why not limit retail, or casino resorts, or restaurants right now?' That's a fair question,' he said. 'That is the tightrope of trying to balance controlling the COVID-19 spread, protecting our hospitals from surges, and at the same time, not destroying and shutting down our economy.' In Texas, which this week became the first state to surpass 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has emphasized new treatments and vaccines that are expected to become available soon. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has taken an even harder line against new restrictions, suing after El Paso closed nonessential businesses because of a surge so severe that mobile morgues are being brought in. An appeals court Thursday temporarily lifted the shutdown. On Friday, the appeals court sent the case back to a state district judge with instructions to halt the shutdown. In a statement that Paxton's office tweeted, he called the appeals court's Friday decision 'outstanding,' adding that 'I will not let rogue political subdivisions try to kill small businesses and holiday gatherings through unlawful executive orders.' Officials have gotten pushback from some constituents, especially business owners who fear for their livelihoods. In Ohio, Bahram Akradi, founder, chairman and CEO of Life Time health clubs, objected when the governor added gyms to a list of businesses that could be shuttered if cases continue to rise. 'Another shutdown would just be completely devastating and simply unjust,' Akradi said. He added: 'The damage of not allowing people to have healthy activity is much more than the gain.' In Montana, where cases are up more than 16% in the past week, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock said he is wary of imposing tougher statewide restrictions without additional federal aid to unemployed individuals and small businesses. 'I never wanted to punish the businesses that are doing right in this pandemic to keep their employees and customers safe. Shutting down those businesses would do just that,' he said. The political perils of statewide mandates have been on display in Wisconsin. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers issued a 'safer at home' order in March that was challenged by Republican lawmakers and struck down by the conservative-controlled state Supreme Court in May. The result has been a hodgepodge of local limits across the state, with some of the strictest in places like Milwaukee, which is moving forward with imposing steep fines of between $500 and $5,000 for violations of local health orders. Other governors have likewise relied on local and county officials to tackle the crisis, creating a patchwork of restrictions around the country. But that strategy has its limits against a virus. In Tennessee, Nashville Mayor John Cooper said he doesn't plan on reinstating restrictions on the city's honky-tonks and other businesses. He said shutting down just one county would probably be ineffective against the virus because the surrounding areas wouldn't be following the same guidelines. 'We are also subject to what goes on in our state, and we can't keep just our county safe,' Cooper said. Some economists say the crisis has been falsely portrayed as a choice between the economy and public health. Instead, they argue that the economy cannot recover until the virus is brought under control and people are confident enough to go shopping, eat at restaurants and do other things again. Experts have argued, too, that strict but relatively short lockdowns could ultimately result in less economic pain than the half-measures employed now, which have only succeeded in dragging out the crisis. Dr. Michael Fine, former director of Rhode Island's Health Department, said the outbreak requires more aggressive strategies. Closing bars earlier in the evening, he said, 'might have worked in July, but there's not a chance they'll work now. It's like taking an eyedropper to a forest fire.' 'Short of very profound lockdowns, I don't think we have a chance of slowing the spread,' Fine said. ___ Johnson reported from Washington state; Pane reported from Boise, Idaho.

Now we are delivering brush cutters. Later we will have tractors, bulldozers, tracked vehicles, and the respective transport of these machines, which the Intermunicipal Communities (CIM) will be responsible for maintaining and finding operators for. These last tenders are underway,\u201d stated Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fernandes.  The minister was speaking at the hangar of the air resources center in Arcos de Valdevez, in the Viana do Castelo district, where the Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests (ICNF) delivered 135 brushcutters to 27 teams of Forest Firefighters from the 10 municipalities of the district, in what is the first batch to be delivered as part of the re-equipping of the Forest Firefighters.  In the area of \u200b\u200bprevention, the Minister of Agriculture and Sea also highlighted \u201cthe plan for extensive grazing, endowed with 30 million euros from the Environmental Fund to reduce combustible material and, simultaneously, place people in the territory, creating wealth\u201d.  \u201cAll of this is encompassed in the Pact for the Forest, which has been approved. It is absolutely essential, for us to succeed, that all legislation relating to property is ready by 2026. The Assembly of the Republic will be fundamental to this objective and I hope for a broad consensus so that we can act,\u201d he stated.  Another preventive aspect emphasized by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fernandes concerns controlled burning.  The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that the government's objective is to \"more than double\" the area of \u200b\u200bapplication of this technique, which in 2025 was approximately 2,500 hectares.  \"We want to reach more than five thousand hectares,\" he reinforced, adding that in many places where controlled burning should have been done, but wasn't, there was enormous destruction. Controlled burning means using a technical means to protect and care for the area, to prevent fires from having so much combustible material that no one can control them. This will be a joint effort with the Intermunicipal Communities (CIMs),\" he emphasized.  According to the minister, \"there are many places where people know that the fire will spread if nothing is done, and many places where they know the fire can take hold.\"  \"It is absolutely essential that this controlled burning planning work be done.\" \"It is not only technically defensible, but, in environmental terms, it is a necessity and a requirement,\" he stressed.  In statements to journalists at the end of the ceremony, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fernandes said that the Government \"will do everything to value the work of forest firefighters, so that they have a fair and dignified income for an arduous job, which is not easy.\"  \"When we came to power, there were debts to the firefighting teams that we settled. We increased the amount for each forest firefighting team, composed of five members, from 55 to 61 thousand euros. Everything we can do within the law, but also with the objective of valuing forest firefighters, we will do. The purchase of equipment is also a way to help make the work easier and less arduous. Training counts 100% as a public service. Before, it didn't.\" \u201cThese are steps we are taking that the forest firefighters deserve,\u201d he said.  In addition to the 135 brushcutters delivered today to the forest firefighters of Alto Minho, a total of 2,060 brushcutters will be delivered, in an action financed by the PRR, representing an investment aimed at more than 400 teams of forest firefighters, contributing to the improvement and optimization of work machinery and to strengthening the operational capacity of these teams in forest fire prevention.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58150526395</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H5V-YN03-RS4R-925H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Portugal News</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>November 11, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Portugal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico said in imposing a two-week stay-at-home order.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oregon Gov. Kate Brown ordered a two-week \u201cfreeze\u201d starting Wednesday, under which all businesses will be required to close their offices to the public and mandate work-from-home \u201cto the greatest extent possible.\u201d</p><p>While most Oregon stores will remain open, gyms, museums, pools, movie theatres and zoos will be forced to close, and restaurants and bars will be limited to takeout. Social gatherings will be restricted to six people.</p><p>The Democratic governor warned that violators could face fines or arrest.</p><p>\u201cFor the last eight months, I have been asking Oregonians to follow to the letter and the spirit of the law, and we have not chosen to engage law enforcement,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAt this point in time, unfortunately, we have no other option.\u201d</p><p>Both states had lockdowns earlier in the year, but the coronavirus is coming back with a vengeance across the country, and the U.S. is facing a long, dark winter. The scourge is blamed for 10.7 million confirmed infections and almost a quarter-million deaths in the U.S., with the closely watched University of Washington model projecting nearly 439,000 dead by March 1.</p><p>Deaths have climbed to about 1,000 a day on average. New cases per day are soaring, reaching another all-time high on Thursday of more than 153,000. Hospitals are getting swamped.</p><p>Still, there is little will among many governors and other elected officials for going back to the kind of lockdowns and large-scale business closings seen last spring. Some governors also continue to resist issuing statewide mask rules.</p><p>Among the reasons given: public fatigue, fear of doing more damage to already-crippled businesses, lack of support from Washington, and the way efforts to tame the virus have become fiercely politicized.</p><p>\u201cI think that governors and mayors are, again, in a really tough spot. The American population is emotionally and economically exhausted,\" Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.</p><p>President Donald Trump asked all Americans to remain \u201cvigilant\u201d but ruled out a nationwide \u201clockdown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully, whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be, I guess time will tell, but I can tell you this administration will not go to a lockdown,\u201d Trump said in his first public remarks since his defeat by President-elect Joe Biden.</p><p>Governors in many states, such as New York, Maryland, Virginia and Minnesota, have taken largely incremental measures over the past few days, such as limiting the size of gatherings, making businesses close early, restricting capacity or cutting off alcohol sales earlier in the evening.</p><p>Starting Saturday, most people in North Dakota will be ordered to wear masks at indoor public spaces and outdoors where social distancing isn't possible, Republican Gov. Doug Burgum ordered late Friday. Businesses will also have restrictions on capacity and hours of operation, according to the executive order.</p><p>Nevada Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak has repeatedly argued that containing the virus is largely up to individuals.</p><p>\u201cSome people are going to ask, \u2018Why not limit retail, or casino resorts, or restaurants right now?\u2019 That\u2019s a fair question,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the tightrope of trying to balance controlling the COVID-19 spread, protecting our hospitals from surges, and at the same time, not destroying and shutting down our economy.\u201d</p><p>In Texas, which this week became the first state to surpass 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has emphasized new treatments and vaccines that are expected to become available soon.</p><p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has taken an even harder line against new restrictions, suing after El Paso closed nonessential businesses because of a surge so severe that mobile morgues are being brought in. An appeals court Thursday temporarily lifted the shutdown. On Friday, the appeals court sent the case back to a state district judge with instructions to halt the shutdown.</p><p>In a statement that Paxton\u2019s office tweeted, he called the appeals court\u2019s Friday decision \u201coutstanding,\u201d adding that \u201cI will not let rogue political subdivisions try to kill small businesses and holiday gatherings through unlawful executive orders.\u201d</p><p>Officials have gotten pushback from some constituents, especially business owners who fear for their livelihoods.</p><p>In Ohio, Bahram Akradi, founder, chairman and CEO of Life Time health clubs, objected when the governor added gyms to a list of businesses that could be shuttered if cases continue to rise.</p><p>\u201cAnother shutdown would just be completely devastating and simply unjust,\u201d Akradi said. He added: \u201cThe damage of not allowing people to have healthy activity is much more than the gain.\"</p><p>In Montana, where cases are up more than 16% in the past week, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock said he is wary of imposing tougher statewide restrictions without additional federal aid to unemployed individuals and small businesses.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted to punish the businesses that are doing right in this pandemic to keep their employees and customers safe. Shutting down those businesses would do just that,\u201d he said.</p><p>The political perils of statewide mandates have been on display in Wisconsin. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers issued a \u201csafer at home\u201d order in March that was challenged by Republican lawmakers and struck down by the conservative-controlled state Supreme Court in May.</p><p>The result has been a hodgepodge of local limits across the state, with some of the strictest in places like Milwaukee, which is moving forward with imposing steep fines of between $500 and $5,000 for violations of local health orders.</p><p>Other governors have likewise relied on local and county officials to tackle the crisis, creating a patchwork of restrictions around the country. But that strategy has its limits against a virus.</p><p>In Tennessee, Nashville Mayor John Cooper said he doesn\u2019t plan on reinstating restrictions on the city's honky-tonks and other businesses. He said shutting down just one county would probably be ineffective against the virus because the surrounding areas wouldn\u2019t be following the same guidelines.</p><p>\u201cWe are also subject to what goes on in our state, and we can\u2019t keep just our county safe,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>Some economists say the crisis has been falsely portrayed as a choice between the economy and public health. Instead, they argue that the economy cannot recover until the virus is brought under control and people are confident enough to go shopping, eat at restaurants and do other things again.</p><p>Experts have argued, too, that strict but relatively short lockdowns could ultimately result in less economic pain than the half-measures employed now, which have only succeeded in dragging out the crisis.</p><p>Dr. Michael Fine, former director of Rhode Island\u2019s Health Department, said the outbreak requires more aggressive strategies. Closing bars earlier in the evening, he said, \u201cmight have worked in July, but there\u2019s not a chance they\u2019ll work now. It\u2019s like taking an eyedropper to a forest fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort of very profound lockdowns, I don\u2019t think we have a chance of slowing the spread,\u201d Fine said.</p><p>___</p><p>Johnson reported from Washington state; Pane reported from Boise, Idaho. AP journalists around the U.S. contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-f7995f3df600b3115fe7058db4b84435</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6194-1K31-DY9S-T4VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1312\"/><timeReceived>11:52 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 13, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It encourages me to work harder.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highway will be among the stars of this year's Luminato Festival. The Dora Award-winning cabaret show \"The Cave,\" which premiered at last year's Luminato, and for which Highway wrote the lyrics, John Millard the music and Martha Ross the book, is being broadcast this week as part of this year's all-online event.</p><p>Now in its 14th year, Luminato is a multi-arts festival that usually fills up theatres, concert halls and outdoor spaces around Toronto. More than 250,000 people experienced Luminato's 17 days of programming in 2019, which had seven world premieres including master puppeteer Ronnie Burkett's \" Forget Me Not,\" the kaleidoscopic maze \"House Of Mirrors\" and the major outdoor choral event \"Maada'ookii Songlines.\"</p><p>This year's festival was planned for June 11 to 28 but had to be rethought and significantly scaled back due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are now three days (June 11 to 13) of recorded and livestreamed performances and talks online.</p><p>Other highlights of this year's virtual Luminato include a number of works by Canadian composer R. Murray Schafer and \"Field Notes for the Future,\" a followup piece by science journalist Alanna Mitchell to her acclaimed and well-travelled play \" Sea Sick.\"</p><p>Highway had been planning to speak to me from his Gatineau home but got caught up in a music store errand in Ottawa, and ended up sitting in a parking lot and sipping fast food coffee for the duration of our 45-minute chat. This did nothing to suppress his effusiveness.</p><p>\"The Cave,\" billed as an \"interspecies song cycle,\" is performed by four actors playing animals - bear, snake, beaver, skunk and more - who take refuge from a forest fire and entertain each other and the audience through song (the show is a Luminato production, in association with the Cave Collective). While the tone is frequently playful, it addresses climate change, and underlines the effects of human action on the land and all its inhabitants.</p><p>Under quarantine, Highway said that he feels that connection to nature more than ever: \"When the planes stopped flying - they fly right over Gatineau, there is noise every five minutes - now it's all gone. The silence is stunning. There is a rapids about a kilometre away from us, a mini-waterfall. You can never hear that from our place, but now you can hear it. The movement of water brings a sense of peace. The clarity, the blueness of the sky is extraordinary.\"</p><p>Besides the water, he and his partner of 36 years now mostly hear birdsong: \"We live in a garden really, a beautiful house with plants and birds. We have a resident cardinal and blue jay - they are the most beautiful birds and the most raucous.\"</p><p>With a very low COVID-19 infection rate in his area, Highway said that he feels like he's in a \"cocoon of safety,\" enjoying visits from his grandchildren and the privilege of being a writer whose capacity to work has not been disrupted.</p><p>\"I am very busy and I love it,\" he said. \"When I am not busy I get depressed. When you work very hard, you are excited and animated and happy.</p><p>\"We are here to laugh, that is why we are on the planet,\" he added. \"I laugh about a hundred times a day. If you haven't laughed a hundred times a day, you have not lived that day.\"</p><p>Highway is not blinkered from the extreme hardship that many around the world are facing. He's particularly inflamed about the current situation in Brazil, which has become a world hot spot for COVID infection. He has many Brazilian friends and his work is frequently translated into Portuguese; he would have been in Brazil right now for an annual trip were it not for the global health crisis.</p><p>\"What is happening in Brazil right now is so evil,\" said Highway, referring to the regime of President Jair Bolsonaro, which made news last week for limiting the release of COVID data and threatening to leave the World Health Organization. \"The way (Bolsonaro) encourages his population of 200 million to kill gays, to treat women like toilet paper, to kill Blacks, to reject everything that is not white and male and heterosexual ... beautiful artists will die and have died. That's wrong. It's our responsibility, all of us, whether we are artists, to fight that evil. That's why I do what I do.\"</p><p>Referencing both U.S. President Donald Trump and Bolsonaro, Highway said, \"I don't know what their objective is. They are creating a tremendous amount of misery, tragedy and pain. Nobody has a right to do that. Everything should be done to take power away from people like that.\"</p><p>Despite this, Highway believes that bad people are outnumbered by good ones. When he thinks about responding to the times we live in and about healing the planet, he thinks of his parents: \"You've never seen a more religious couple. They were on their knees every night with their elbows on the bed, praying intensely, with tears in their eyes ... the world now has forgotten how to pray. We need to relearn how to pray.

Here, Charlotte Sutherland gazes out over a motel parking lot while small white flakes of ash occasionally touch down softly on the ground.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sitting on a patio chair outside her room, soaking up the thin rays of sunlight that have managed to penetrate the wildfire smoke enveloping large swaths of the province, Sutherland flips the pages of her book and waits for the day she can return home.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sutherland is one of the 1,000 people forced to flee their homes due to wildfires in this region of B.C. since Tuesday, the same day the government declared a provincial state of emergency.</p><p>Fires are common enough in B.C. that there is a recognized wildfire season each summer. But this year has been different. Thousands of homes have been evacuated, but with emergency accommodations packed to the brim officials have asked people to stay with friends, and for tourists to carefully consider any plans to visit. The result has led to a season of uncertainty and dread.</p><p>Hotel rooms are scarce, parking lots are full of trailers, highways feature heavy traffic amid a smoky background.</p><p>Some fear this is a glimpse of what Canada will see more of in the years to come, as climate change fuels more extreme weather events. Often called climate refugees - though the term is up for debate - those ordered to leave their homes need somewhere to go.</p><p>Sutherland's journey was set in motion when a car slammed into a power pole attached to a transformer near her home at Two Mile Road, sparking an instant forest fire.</p><p>With a terminally ill husband to worry about, she skipped waiting for an evacuation order and quickly checked them both into a motel just a few kilometres away, fearing accommodations would soon be full. Not long after, booking into hotels became impossible for others in the area.</p><p>\"We don't have family here, so where do you go?\" she says. \"You have to stay away from the fire so you've got to stay in a motel.\"</p><p>The motel has become home base for Sutherland as she ensures her husband can take his medication and get to appointments. She says her friends have rallied around her and, she chuckles, being \"partial to wine\" has also helped her cope.</p><p>She's not the only evacuee waiting it out at this Best Western, a two-storey motel off the side of the Trans-Canada Highway cutting through town. Manager Eileen Hartwig says there are about 30 rooms out of more than 60 with evacuees in them.</p><p>On Thursday, Hartwig says rooms were being prioritized for evacuees, reserved for them in the event tourists, who would usually be enjoying nearby Shuswap Lake, cancel or leave.</p><p>\"We're trying to do what we can to accommodate, the local people should take precedence,\" she says. \"We're just trying to keep things rolling.\"</p><p>In 2017, B.C. had one of the worst fire seasons ever recorded, with 1.2 million hectares of forest burned and 65,000 people evacuated from their homes. Two years later, Canadian climate scientists said \"human-induced\" climate change likely was a major driver.</p><p>Now, with more than 5,000 properties in the province on evacuation order and another 17,000 on alert as of Friday, according to Emergency Management BC, another devastating fire season is raising the question of how the province can cope with large blazes.</p><p>The heart of B.C.'s holiday country, the interior of the province dotted with low mountain ranges, warm lakes and vineyards, is playing host to contrasting scenes of vacationers on the beaches while, in the background, nervous locals wait and hope the flames don't wipe out everything they have.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Coquihalla Highway, a major route that cuts through the interior down to Vancouver, cars are backed up for kilometres heading north while crews hustle to make sure flames didn't turn into another wildfire.</p><p>Along the southern route, the Crowsnest Highway, some cars sit on the roadside broken down in the summer heat with frustrated drivers standing beside them. Just outside the small orchard village of Keremeos smoke begins to fill the sky, the landscape made up of the desert, dust and tumbleweeds many Canadians wouldn't even recognize. Temperatures are passing 30 C.</p><p>Thirty minutes drive to the east in Osoyoos, a resort community long favoured by Albertans and British Columbians coming for the hot, dry weather and lake, a fire has temporarily displaced residents and local media say hundreds of homes have been ordered evacuated, many on nearby OsoyoosIndian Band property. In the early evening, obscured by the smoke, the sun is a red bulb in the sky.</p><p>In town Wednesday morning, one restaurant serves weary evacuees paying for breakfast with meal vouchers next to tables of people on holiday having a few laughs and planning the day's activities.</p><p>The eyes of a young boy are heavy and welled up as he reluctantly ambles into the restaurant with a group of adults. He clutches a towel big enough to be used as a blanket.</p><p>The question of what to call people displaced by climate events - and how to support them - is a live conversation in Canada that is becoming all the more urgent, says Sarah Kamal, a UBC graduate student and researcher with the Climate Migrants and Refugee Project focused on the mobility of those affected by climate change in Canada.</p><p>The consensus among academics and legal experts is that people displaced by climate events, which will become more common due to climate change, need a different label than \"climate refugee\" - a term that has started to gain traction around the world and is often associated with masses of people forced to flee after extreme whether events.</p><p>\"There's the emotional valence of the term climate refugee but for legal reasons it's not a term a lot of academics accept,\" she says. \"They are fleeing their homes, but the cause of what they're fleeing is not covered under legal frameworks at all.\"</p><p>Kamal, who has studied what other countries around the world have done to support people displaced by climate events, says the most appropriate term for now is: displacement.</p><p>What to do with climate-displaced people in Canada is still a new question, but it's clear the first step is to develop a federal policy, she says.</p><p>Such a policy would not hand down a one-size-fits-all approach to helping displaced people, but it could include financial commitments to assist areas affected by things such as wildfires, storms and floods, as well as a framework for municipalities and regions to form their own displacement plans.</p><p>In the meantime, the province's emergency support services is helping people find places to stay and ensure they have what they need to survive.</p><p>About 360,835 hectares have burned across B.C. so far this year - an area fives time that of Toronto. Noelle Kekula has been a government fire information officer, tasked with providing updates to the public, on and off since 1993. She called the current state of affairs \"overwhelming.\"</p><p>One fire completely destroyed the town of Lytton late last month, killing two people. The fires came after a massive \"heat dome\" had temperatures cracking 40 C in many parts of the province.</p><p>At the nearby emergency support services reception centre in Oliver, another fruit-growing and wine community 20 kilometres away from Osoyoos, a little girl is still wearing her night gown, suggesting the departure from her home was quick.</p><p>Outside the centre two women are furious after finding a lit cigarette butt discarded in a sidewalk planter full of dried-out grass and flowers. One goes inside the centre thinking she's figured out who is responsible for it and wants to scold them.</p><p>\"We're here to provide emergency support services in the way of absolute necessities that they can't provide for themselves any other way,\" says volunteer Bill Morrison of the provincial program. \"Lodging, food, clothing, incidentals, whatever they couldn't grab or provide for themselves.\"</p><p>The evacuees coming here ebb and flow, he says while sitting outside of the centre. A few people are inside at the moment, more are expected the next day.</p><p>With the influx of tourists, finding a place to put evacuees can be a challenge, he says, but there's been a healthy response from the community offering accommodations.</p><p>People on holiday who were also evacuated from a local campground have moved their vacation headquarters to the parking lot of a local grocery store - some hoping to wait out the fires and pick up where their vacation left off. Others said they were cutting their losses and heading home early.</p><p>A three-hour drive north, in Sicamous, Mayor Terry Rysz says the resort town's population goes to 15,000 from 3,000 during the summer. Rysz says though the community has come together along with neighbouring towns, he's not resting easy just yet.</p><p>\"I'm a little concerned,\" he says on the lawn at the local emergency support services reception centre. \"If all of the sudden the fire comes into Sicamous and we have to evacuate the whole town, that is going to be a serious challenge.\"</p><p>For now, the fire seems to be going in the right direction, he says. Thursday morning he was glad there were no reports of any homes being destroyed.</p><p>But new problems have emerged with the yearly influx of tourists, such as boaters getting in the way of aircraft trying to gather water from the lakes to drop on the fire.</p><p>\"A bunch of bozos going out in their boats with cameras and you've got a helicopter flying straight above them,\" Rysz says. \"I was just livid, but you can't fix stupid.\"</p><p>Other tourists are weighing their options, while trying to stay out of the way of fire fighting efforts.</p><p>Adult siblings Autumn Parker and Will Ritz are sitting on the lawn at the Pines motel trying to figure out what to do next as Parker's baby snoozes in a stroller next to them.</p><p>From High River, Alta., they're on vacation with a group of nine people, including two infants. The family only managed one full day in the lakeside hotel they'd booked before having to evacuate shortly after the fire began. Ritz watched the fire eat up trees as it spread fewer than two kilometres from his hotel.</p><p>\"We went inside and then I came out 45 minutes later and the fire was three times in size already,\" he says. \"I thought, 'OK, we might be in a little trouble here.'\"</p><p>Hotels filled immediately, so they moved to a friend's place about 30 kilometres to the southwest in Salmon Arm before coming back to the motel in Sicamous.</p><p>Sitting on loungers outside the motel, they're leaning toward going home rather than spending the time bouncing around and trying to find places to stay.</p><p>\"Nine of us trying to find a place was a little bit difficult,\" Parker says. \"With two infants we're hauling around a lot of crap.\"</p><p>Two Mile Road resident and evacuee Carolyn Swallow says she understands why some tourists choose to stay, but some consideration for locals at a trying time needs to take place.</p><p>\"I know that this is where they come and of course they have to have some place to go,\" Swallow says. \"You have to think about things. How it is for everyone locally?\"</p><p>A climate-displacement plan would mean towns, villages, First Nations and cities would already know where residents could go in such emergencies, Kamal said.</p><p>She pointed to American cities such as Duluth and Buffalo, which have plans to build infrastructure with an eye to becoming \"climate havens\" for areas of the country likely to be hit by the effects of climate change, whether that's sea-level rise or severe heat.</p><p>Kamal wants Canada to also learn from people already displaced by climate change, to help form policies around what they need at the time of displacement.</p><p>\"We need to be able to have a way to understand that more and more, especially as we are facing a lot of wildfires this season. And there's going to be a lot more coming down the line,\" she said. \"Rather than working from crisis to crisis we want to be working in advance, and to have agreements in place.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, for Sutherland, part of the answer is for people to stop the kind of careless behaviour she says starts forest fires in the first place.</p><p>People doing things like flicking cigarette butts out their car windows or impeding helicopters trying to gather buckets of water need to \"grow up\" she says.</p><p>\"We as a society are failing miserably,\" she says.</p><p>With files from Alex McKeen</p><p>Jeremy Nuttall is a Vancouver-based investigative reporter for the Star.

Charged by King Francois I to look for gold in the New World and a passage to China, Cartier left St-Malo, France, on April 20, 1534, with two ships and 61 men, arriving off Newfoundland 20 days later. Before heading home on Aug. 15, he claimed Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the lands adjacent for France.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 1714, Queen Anne died at age 49. She was succeeded by George I.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 1774, British scientist Joseph Priestley succeeded in isolating oxygen from air.</p><p>In 1778, the world's first savings bank opened in Hamburg, Germany.</p><p>In 1790, the first U.S. census showed a population of almost four million.</p><p>In 1793, France became the first country to use the metric system of weights and measures.</p><p>In 1798, the \"Battle of the Nile\" between the British and the French isolated Napoleon's army in Egypt. One of the greatest victories of British admiral Horatio Nelson, it ensured the ultimate disintegration of the French army and secured Britain's possession of the Mediterranean and India.</p><p>In 1824, John Galt proposed the formation of the Canada Land Co. for settlement in Ontario.</p><p>In 1834, slavery was abolished in all British possessions. But it was not until the victory of the Union in the U.S. Civil War in 1865 that slaves were freed in the United States. Opening up of the West Indies and the southern states of America had made slavery a lucrative trade. But in the latter part of the 18th century and early 19th century, public conscience was aroused over the issue.</p><p>In 1834, Robert Morrison, the first English Protestant missionary to reach China, died at age 52. Sent by the London Missionary Society in 1807, in 1823 he completed a Chinese translation of the Bible. It filled 23 volumes.</p><p>In 1876, Colorado was admitted as the 38th state.</p><p>In 1885, a six-man jury in Regina found Metis leader Louis Riel guilty of treason. He was hanged the following November.</p><p>In 1890, Walther Eichrodt, German Reformed Old Testament scholar, was born. He taught at Basel and Erlangen universities, and is highly regarded among Christian evangelicals for his book Theology of the Old Testament.</p><p>In 1909, the British ship \"Waratah\" vanished after leaving London with 300 aboard.</p><p>In 1914, Germany declared war on Russia in the First World War.</p><p>In 1928, Vancouver sprinter Percy Williams earned his second gold medal of the Amsterdam Olympics. He won the 200 metres, two days after winning the 100.</p><p>In 1930, the British airship \"R100\" crossed the Atlantic and arrived in Montreal. The trip was financed by Britain and Canada, part of a plan to provide airship service throughout the Commonwealth. The flight took 78 hours and 52 minutes. But airships were too vulnerable to the elements, and after the explosion of the Hindenburg in 1937, airship travel ceased.</p><p>In 1932, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, a democratic socialist political party and the forerunner of the New Democratic Party, was formed in Calgary. Under the leadership of J. S. Woodsworth, the CCF brought into one federation a number of farm and labour groups and socialist parties in Western Canada.

(\"Clean Air Metals\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce new assay results from the drilling campaign currently underway at the Company's Thunder BayNorth Project (the \"Project\"). Assay highlights (from Table 1) include:</p><p>For the Escape Lake deposit: //st * Hole ELR21-077 intersected 76.6m grading 5.67g/t Palladium Equivalents (PdEq)1 composed of 1.63g/t Platinum (Pt), 2.14g/t Palladium (Pd), 0.81% Copper (Cu), 0.41% Nickel (Ni) from 345.0m-421.6m downhole including 21.0m grading 9.98g/t PdEq composed of 2.97 g/t Platinum (Pt), 3.93g/t Palladium (Pd), 1.41% Copper (Cu), 0.68% Nickel (Ni) from 392.0m-413.0m downhole (Figure 1).</p><p>The Escape Lake Deposit has been the focus of the majority of the drilling over the past 14 months. Since the maiden resource published in January 2021 of 505,369 ounces at 3.67 g/t PdEq in 4.28 million tonnes, the Clean Air Metals team has successfully expanded the size of the Escape South High Grade Zone and demonstrated approximately 700m of mineralization along trend. Hole ELR21-077 with its significant thickness and grade appears to further expand the edge of the Escape Lake High Grade Zone and demonstrates potential contribution of scale of the Escape Lake Deposit to the overall Thunder BayNorth Project. An updated mineral resource for the Escape Lake Deposit is currently planned for Q1 2022.</p><p>The Current Lake Deposit has a well-defined Indicated mineral resource of 1,328,789 PdEq ounces at a grade of 3.44 g/t PdEq in 11.99 million tonnes and is currently well advanced with a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) study to be published in Q4 this year. The PEA-level mine stope optimization in the Beaver Lake Zone area of the Current Lake Deposit may be enhanced by the results of a recent infill drill program, including the following highlight results: //st * Hole CL21-007 which intersected 13.49m grading 6.09 g/t PdEq composed of 2.79 g/t Platinum (Pt), 2.61g/t Palladium (Pd), 0.52% Copper (Cu) and 0.31% Nickel (Ni) from 140.2 - 153.7m downhole (Figure 2). * Hole CL21-006 which intersected 14.83m grading 4.65 g/t PdEq composed of 1.92 g/t Platinum (Pt), 1.90g/t Palladium (Pd), 0.46% Copper (Cu) and 0.28% Nickel (Ni) from 152.2 - 167.0m downhole (Figure 2). * Hole CL21-008 which intersected 20.0m grading 3.43 g/t PdEq composed of 1.55 g/t Platinum (Pt), 1.41g/t Palladium (Pd), 0.26% Copper (Cu) and 0.20% Nickel (Ni) from 142.0 - 162.0m downhole (Figure 2). //st 1 Palladium equivalency formula can be viewed</p><p>in the following Link (Click Here)</p><p>Mineral resource endowment and palladium-equivalents are quoted pursuant to the Technical Report and Mineral Resource Estimate for the Thunder BayNorth Project, Thunder Bay, Ontario, effective date January 20, 2021, posted to SEDAR March 4, 2021. Prepared by Nordmin Engineering Ltd.- QP Glen Kuntz, P.Geo. Ontario.</p><p>Update on Metallurgy and PEA</p><p>Metallurgical optimization studies continue with Blue Coast Research of British Columbia. The results of the metallurgical studies on drill-derived bulk sample material and independent analysis of smelter recoveries and smelter payables are expected to input directly into a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) mine cash flow model planned for publication in early Q4/2021.</p><p>Abraham Drost, CEO of Clean Air Metals stated that \"infill assay results from the Beaver Lake Zone of the Current Lake deposit infill drilling (\"CL\" holes) is an affirmation of our understanding of the deposit and ability to target and execute on drilling which has the potential to materially impact the results of the upcoming PEA. This bodes well for future upgrade drilling on the large inferred resource down plunge which will occur at future study phases. The Company is looking forward to publication of a PEA in Q4/21 based solely on the Current Lake Deposit. As with the mineral resource estimate published in March, 2021, the PEA will be based on a ramp-access underground mine model constraining the existing mineral resource. In addition to the Current Lake Deposit, the potential to add scale to the Thunder BayNorth Project with feed from the Escape Lake Deposit is potentially accretive to the project.</p><p>Recent drought conditions and regional forest fire activity imposed certain restrictions and precluded the construction of new drill pads on the Thunder BayNorth Project. The Clean Air Metals geology team found innovative ways of keeping the drills running, including utilizing previous pads using angled holes to test edges and in the case of Hole ELR21-077, to expand the margins of the Escape South High Grade Zone. Fortunately, the drought has ended and the fire ban has now lifted. The present round of assay results is also being added to the Escape Lake deposit database (\"ELR\" holes) which will result in a revised mineral resource estimate in Q1/22.\"</p><p>Table 1: New Assay Results Update - Thunder BayNorth Project //st Hole ID From, To, m Length, Pt+Pd Cu+Ni Pt Pd Cu Ni(%) PdEq</p><p>m m (g/t) (%) (g/t) (g/t) (%) ELR21-075 325.86 334.00 8.14 1.43 0.48 0.65 0.78 0.27 0.21 2.28 ELR21-075 336.73 347.00 10.27 2.12 0.64 0.96 1.16 0.39 0.25 3.17 ELR21-077 325.00 341.00 16.00 2.08 0.67 0.90 1.18 0.45 0.22 3.17 ELR21-077 345.00 421.60 76.60 3.77 1.23 1.63 2.14 0.81 0.41 5.67 **incl. 392.00 413.00 21.00 6.90 2.09 2.97 3.93 1.41 0.68 9.98 ELR21-078 395.00 398.75 3.75 3.34 0.77 1.60 1.75 0.64 0.14 4.23 CL21-005 148.00 153.00 5.00 1.88 0.40 0.95 0.93 0.22 0.19 2.47 CL21-005 159.00 162.14 3.14 1.88 0.37 0.98 0.90 0.22 0.15 2.31 CL21-006 152.17 167.00 14.83 3.82 0.73 1.92 1.90 0.46 0.28 4.65 CL21-007 134.20 136.20 2.00 1.49 0.24 0.79 0.70 0.11 0.12 1.79 CL21-007 140.20 153.69 13.49 5.39 0.83 2.79 2.61 0.52 0.31 6.09 CL21-007 198.10 201.00 2.90 2.38 0.72 1.17 1.21 0.41 0.31 3.51 CL21-008 142.00 162.00 20.00 2.96 0.46 1.55 1.41 0.26 0.20 3.43 CL21-009 144.05 146.05 2.00 2.08 0.37 1.08 1.00 0.20 0.17 2.53 CL21-009 208.00 212.40 4.40 4.73 1.55 2.42 2.31 0.93 0.62 7.11 CL21-010 147.59 149.59 2.00 1.54 0.29 0.82 0.72 0.12 0.17 1.97 CL21-010 151.61 153.61 2.00 1.90 0.34 0.93 0.97 0.18 0.17 2.36 //st Note: 1) All intercepts are estimated to be )95% of true width based on</p><p>drill hole inclination 2) Mineralized intervals calculated at 1 ppm Pt+Pd cutoff</p><p>Please see the link below for Figures 1 and 2.</p><p>Figure 1: 2021 Drill Hole Intercepts in the Escape Lake Deposit Area - Link (Click Here)</p><p>Figure 2: 2021 Drill Hole Intercepts in the Current Lake Deposit Area - Link (Click Here)</p><p>COVID Policy</p><p>Clean Air Metals has adopted COVID-19 avoidance and personal protection measures for its geological staff, drilling contractor and service suppliers.

In recent weeks, a question has been asked in the Ontario medical community: not just who is in charge, but who should be in charge?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In some provinces, the head of epidemic response is not just obvious, but their faces are painted on murals. Dr. Bonnie Henry rules B.C.; Dr. Deena Hinshaw has taken the lead in Alberta. Here in Ontario we have Dr. David Williams, the chief medical officer of health, and a man whose communication style can be described as hospital tranquilizer beige. It's been confusing.</p><p>On Monday, it was announced Williams would no longer give a daily update, and will instead befuddle the cameras just twice a week. There is some speculation the premier may also cut back his appearances.</p><p>And, while public communication isn't everything, it's an admission that public communication from the top public health official in Ontario stopped being useful, if it ever was. It's hard to even criticize the move because Williams is such an impenetrable communicator. It has been an exercise in confusion, in that regard.</p><p>But the pandemic isn't over in this province, and we're stuck between two worlds. The Greater Toronto Area is still in the grips of COVID-19, and much of the province is relatively COVID-free, and neither epidemic success nor economic success are being achieved.</p><p>So, with Williams half-sidelined, do the next thing. Appoint a coronavirus czar, even this late in the game. A public health leader.</p><p>\"If there was a single person whose sole responsibility was to efficiently address the issues facing the province, I think we would be in a much better position,\" says Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist with the University of Toronto and Toronto General Hospital.</p><p>\"It should be a small group, not a major committee, that can just act and cut through all levels of bureaucracy to get the job done. It would be people who have experience in epidemic management. That's what this is. A huge part is communication, because you need buy-in from the people and communities you're working with. This is a new virus, yes, but the same principles apply to all communicable diseases.\"</p><p>Ontario isn't out of control. We have averted a catastrophe.

In recent weeks, a question has been asked in the Ontario medical community: not just who is in charge, but who should be in charge?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In some provinces, the head of epidemic response is not just obvious, but their faces are painted on murals. Dr. Bonnie Henry rules B.C; Dr. Deena Hinshaw has taken the lead in Alberta. Here in Ontario we have Dr. David Williams, the chief medical officer of health, and a man whose communication style can be described as hospital tranquilizer beige. It's been confusing.</p><p>On Monday, it was announced Williams would no longer give a daily update, and will instead befuddle the cameras just twice a week. There is some speculation the premier may also cut back his appearances.</p><p>And while public communication isn't everything, it's an admission that public communication from the top public health official in Ontario stopped being useful, if it ever was. It's hard to even criticize the move because Williams is such an impenetrable communicator. It has been an exercise in confusion, in that regard.</p><p>But the pandemic isn't over in this province, and we're stuck between two worlds. The Greater Toronto Area is still in the grips of COVID-19, and much of the province is relatively COVID-free, and neither epidemic success nor economic success are being achieved.</p><p>So with Williams half-sidelined, do the next thing. Appoint a coronavirus czar, even this late in the game. A public health leader.</p><p>\"If there was a single person whose sole responsibility was to efficiently address the issues facing the province, I think we would be in a much better position,\" says Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist with the University of Toronto and Toronto General Hospital.</p><p>\"It should be a small group, not a major committee, that can just act and cut through all levels of bureaucracy to get the job done. It would be people who have experience in epidemic management. That's what this is. A huge part is communication, because you need buy-in from the people and communities you're working with. This is a new virus, yes, but the same principles apply to all communicable diseases.\"</p><p>Ontario isn't out of control. We have averted a catastrophe. But it's been said over and over: the case numbers won't consistently fall, and the underlying infrastructure to control the epidemic haven't been adequately built.

In recent weeks, a question has been asked in the Ontario medical community: not just who is in charge, but who should be in charge?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In some provinces, the head of epidemic response is not just obvious, but their faces are painted on murals. Dr. Bonnie Henry rules B.C; Dr. Deena Hinshaw has taken the lead in Alberta. Here in Ontario we have Dr. David Williams, the chief medical officer of health, and a man whose communication style can be described as hospital tranquilizer beige. It's been confusing.</p><p>On Monday, it was announced Williams would no longer give a daily update, and will instead befuddle the cameras just twice a week. There is some speculation the premier may also cut back his appearances.</p><p>And while public communication isn't everything, it's an admission that public communication from the top public health official in Ontario stopped being useful, if it ever was. It's hard to even criticize the move because Williams is such an impenetrable communicator. It has been an exercise in confusion, in that regard.</p><p>But the pandemic isn't over in this province, and we're stuck between two worlds. The Greater Toronto Area is still in the grips of COVID-19, and much of the province is relatively COVID-free, and neither epidemic success nor economic success are being achieved.</p><p>So with Williams half-sidelined, do the next thing. Appoint a coronavirus czar, even this late in the game. A public health leader.</p><p>\"If there was a single person whose sole responsibility was to efficiently address the issues facing the province, I think we would be in a much better position,\" says Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist with the University of Toronto and Toronto General Hospital.</p><p>\"It should be a small group, not a major committee, that can just act and cut through all levels of bureaucracy to get the job done. It would be people who have experience in epidemic management. That's what this is. A huge part is communication, because you need buy-in from the people and communities you're working with. This is a new virus, yes, but the same principles apply to all communicable diseases.\"</p><p>Ontario isn't out of control. We have averted a catastrophe. But it's been said over and over: the case numbers won't consistently fall, and the underlying infrastructure to control the epidemic haven't been adequately built. Ontario has dropped under 300 new daily cases twice, on May 26 and 27, and then popped back up; the surge Monday was partly driven by migrant workers in Windsor and Haldimand-Norfolk districts.</p><p>But we're not there. When the province's 34 medical officers of health offered a data-based set of thresholds that will allow individual areas to hold restrictions at their own pace, it was among the most comprehensive and helpful displays of public health leadership at an Ontario-wide level that we have seen in the pandemic. The fact Doug Ford is now considering a regional reopening strategy is a credit to local public health officials.</p><p>But which expert is in charge of Ontario's actual pandemic response? Williams? Ontario Health head Matt Anderson, who has been given the testing portfolio? The provincial health table, which may not include a single doctor who still sees patients, and is light on infectious disease expertise? Who is aligning Ontario's overlapping pieces? Who could give Ford advice that would lead to something other than a partial lockdown, a reopening that happened too soon, and a one-size-fits-all strategy?</p><p>And who is setting up the architecture to fight this longer-term? Can you test in the right places? (Ontario finally has a testing program that doesn't send away people with symptoms, but it requires implementation.) Can you keep the virus out of vulnerable settings? (The migrant workers, often crammed into bunk bed shacks, are an indication we can't, as are the skyrocketing numbers in homeless shelters.)</p><p>Can you trace contacts? (Ontario's contact tracing starts, on average, five to seven days after the onset of symptoms, rendering it ineffective as often as not.) Can you isolate people who have the virus, and don't have the ability to self-isolate from their families? (Largely, no.)</p><p>\"You need methods to detect COVID-19 early on, before it spreads out of control,\" says Bogoch. \"Can you detect an ember before it becomes a forest fire?\"</p><p>We are still not in a position to stamp out this virus, while the jurisdictions who have done so are the ones hugging their parents and drinking on patios. Maybe a czar.</p><p>\"The key in these jobs is somebody who can tell truth to power: who is respected enough by the (health) sector and by the system that at the end of the day, they can absorb the information, communicate that information back, and have the ear of the premier,\" says Dr. Sacha Bhatia, the chief innovation officer at Women's College Hospital, and its chief of cardiology. \"So you know that when you communicate with them, it will get to the premier.</p><p>\"The positives would be someone who isn't beholden to structures, or bureaucracy, but can integrate those two worlds together. But the danger is if you're to do a czar, the czar has to be A, super-respected, and B, the role has to be clearly defined by the province.</p><p>\"It's a high-risk play, but it could be effective if it's the right person brought into the right circumstance.\"</p><p>So who would it be? Anderson? Ontario Health is already taking more control, in testing and medical procedure restarts. Dr. Jane Philpott? She is a Liberal, but an excommunicated one. Dr. Allison McGeer? She is one of our most decorated epidemiologists, but isn't seen as a politician.</p><p>Ford probably wouldn't appoint anyone he couldn't control, so it may be a pipe dream. But it would be nice to have someone truly credible to whom Ontario could look to for guidance on public health, all together. Because we don't have that right now.</p><p>Bruce Arthur is a Toronto-based columnist for the Star.

They were accompanied by Roly Russell, British Columbia's Parliamentary Secretary for Rural Development and Member of Legislative Assembly for Boundary-Similkameen,\u00a0Mike Allison, Councillor of the Upper Similkameen Indian Band, Her Worship Suzan Hewat, Mayor of Kaslo, and Sadie Hunter, Kamloops City Councillor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Among the projects approved today, the Upper Similkameen Indian Band will restore the Chuchuwayha Community Hall and increase indoor space to facilitate gatherings for cultural events and traditions. This hall will also include an area for food preparation and for youth to socially gather in a safe and welcoming space.</p><p>The City of Kamloops will offer residents and visitors an additional active transportation route by completing its north-south cycling and multi-use pathways, connecting to parks and the hospital. Also included in this project are new crosswalks, bus shelters, and stormwater catch basins as well as modifications to traffic signals to accommodate the pathways.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>At the Kaslo and District Arena, the aging fire prevention system will be upgraded as will the electrical wiring to accommodate a new Fortis transformer, and the ice plant condensers will also be replaced. The Arena is the only ice arena serving the Village of Kaslo and immediate surroundings and is also a designated Emergency Reception Centre during forest fire and mudslide seasons, and extended power outages.</p><p>The Government of Canada and the Province of British Columbia are investing over $24.5 million in the 27 projects announced today through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program's new COVID-19 Resilience Infrastructure Stream. Canada is contributing over $20.8 million, and B.C. is contributing almost $3.7 million. Federal and provincial funding is conditional on fulfilling all requirements related to consultation with Indigenous groups. </p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"Today's announcement of over $20.8 million from the federal government to upgrade key local infrastructure in municipalities and Indigenous communities across the Okanagan-Kootenay Region will help support local economies at a time when it is needed most. Among other benefits, these projects will upgrade community buildings as well as create cycling and multi-purpose pathways, which will enhance community connections and offer residents and visitors more options to commute and stay active.\"</p><p>The Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities</p><p>\"Together with B.C., we are investing in local infrastructure such as the Elkford Active Transportation project that will provide additional, safe recreational spaces for everyone's enjoyment in the Okanagan-Kootenay region. Canada's infrastructure plan invests in thousands of projects, creates good jobs across Canada, and builds cleaner, more inclusive communities.\" </p><p>Andy Fillmore, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities</p><p>\"By investing in welcoming, healthy and connected communities, we are working to make people's lives better as we emerge from the pandemic. These infrastructure projects we're launching with our local and federal partners will bring a multitude of benefits to communities and people in the Okanagan and Kootenay regions, creating jobs, improving community services and helping everyone move through restart toward a strong recovery from the pandemic.\"</p><p>The Honourable Josie Osborne, British Columbia's Minister of Municipal Affairs\u00a0</p><p>\"People across British Columbia have done a lot to keep one another safe through the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are now in a position to get to work on our recovery and build back even better. Communities can start that recovery with important infrastructure projects like the USIB's Chuchwayha Community Hall. These projects will provide local jobs and begin the renewal that we're all excited to see.\"</p><p>Roly Russell, British Columbia's Parliamentary Secretary for Rural Development and Member of Legislative Assembly for Boundary-Similkameen</p><p>\"This is not just another infrastructure project. For us, the Chuchuwayha Hall restoration is about bringing our community together under one roof, creating a space for our Elders to prepare food, and providing a safe place for our youth to gather socially. Chuchuwayha is a place where we will welcome our neighbours and share our culture. We are very grateful for the CVRIS grant opportunity.\"</p><p>Chief &amp; Council, Upper Similkameen Indian Band</p><p>\"The Kaslo and District Arena was built in 1975 by volunteers and has been run by a volunteer board ever since. We would not have such a wonderful facility in our little village without the efforts of these dedicated people and the support of our community. The Village of Kaslo is proud of them and so happy that we can contribute to this major capital upgrade thanks to this CVRIS grant opportunity. Our arena is the hub for winter activities, events, and tournaments. Over the years the facility has seen hockey players young and old participate as well as having had a very active figure skating group. We look forward to this renewal and to welcoming everyone back to the arena this winter knowing it will safely continue to serve the Kaslo area for years to come.\"</p><p>Suzan Hewat, Mayor of Kaslo</p><p>\"The COVID-19 pandemic has really emphasized how important access to outdoor spaces really is. Building an accessible bike network connecting multi-use pathways to neighbourhoods will enable a safer means for our residents and visitors to get outdoors, be active, and get around our city. We're grateful for the CVRIS grant for helping bring this project to fruition much sooner than would have been otherwise been possible.\"</p><p>Sadie Hunter, Councillor, City of Kamloops</p><p>Quick facts </p><p> Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the federal government is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada's rural and northern communities. Across B.C., the Government of Canada has invested more than $4.4 billion in over 580 infrastructure projects under the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Province is investing $3.6 billion over a 10-year period under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program for British Columbia's infrastructure initiatives. To support Canadians and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, a COVID-19 Resilience Infrastructure Stream has been added to the over $33-billion Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to help fund pandemic-resilient infrastructure. Existing program streams have also been adapted to include more eligible project categories.\u00a0 Under the COVID-19 Resilience Infrastructure Stream, the federal cost share for public infrastructure projects is up to 80%, with the Province adding 20% to achieve 100% funding.

But of all the community forests that we have under the BC Community Forest Association membership, and even the ones that we don't, their biggest drive is to try and have something sustained for their communities in one way or another. Some are corporations, some are owned by cities, some are owned by non-profits, some are owned by co-ops. But all of them have this rural mantra of trying to protect their forests for long term sustainability for the benefit of their community.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read Part I: B.C.'s community forests are at the heart of sustaining rural regions</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Does the LNTCFS work with area First Nations?</p><p>\"Historically, the First Nations in particular, were the ones that helped us get a community forest in 2003 after the McLure Wildfire happened here,\" explained Wright, \"With the help of First Nations we were able to acquire a community forest, and so we work together with Simpcw First Nation in particular because we are in their unceded land territory. We also work with other bands; Neskonlith, KamloopsIndian Band, Little Shuswap, and Adams Lake Indian Band. We refer to all of them, and we try to work with all the First Nations. From our perspective we don't have any trouble in doing that because a lot of what we are doing is what they want to do as well\"</p><p>He notes the First Nations operating a community forest have a community forest license, they also have a First Nations woodland licence, and may also have a wood lot as well. However, the provincial government's regulations for First Nations' community forests is not the same as other community forest licences, and as a result First Nations want to make that change so they can do more on their land base similar to what the LNTCFS can do under their licence.\"</p><p>Wright pointed out that a First Nations woodland licence does not allow the same level of community involvement that a community forest does,</p><p>\"They are currently trying to make that change with the provincial government so that the government will recognized their First Nations Woodlots as community forests.\"</p><p>Currently there are 58 community forest licence holders and 860 wood lots operating in B.C., and Wright advises they are all concerned about what the provincial government is considering doing with tab rates.</p><p>\"On most of the provincial Crown land, the government receives stumpage [a fee that businesses or individuals pay when they harvest timber from Crown land in B.C.] from the land sales. That stumpage is based on the sale of lumber and the average trend of bidding on BC Timber Sales (BCTS),\" explained Wright.</p><p>\"What the community forest has is a system that is separate from that. The community forest system was initiated a number of years ago where the community forest got what they call tab rates. Tab rates is a percentage of the stumpage - 15 per cent of the stumpage in the Interior, and 30 per cent at the coast. That gives a difference in what community forests pay in stumpage, and what a person who makes a sale on BCTS would pay. By having that difference in stumpage it allows us to create profit. If we were under the same stumpage system that BCTS has, which they call Market Pricing System or MPS, we wouldn't be able to operate because what we find is that stumpage is keyed so high to log sales that we would actually end up not being able to log.\"</p><p>Many community forests that are joined with First Nations woodland licences find that the woodland licences stumpages are so high right now that they can't log and make money. Whereas a community forest such as the LNTCFS has a low enough stumpage rate that we can still log and contribute to our community.</p><p>Wright says the province is currently reviewing this system, and those operating community forests are very concerned that if the direction of the province was to initiate the Market Pricing System on community forests that most of them would be dissolved.</p><p>Would this mean the LNTCFS would also be dissolved if the community would receive no financial benefits from its continuation?</p><p>\"Yes. Our community forest would essentially be non-existent and the province would take this tenure and change it into something else.\"</p><p>Wright tells that his year alone, the LNTCFS will be putting approximately $150,000 back into their community area of Little Fort to McLure. Over a 10 year period this adds up to a million and a half dollars that will be invested back into the area.</p><p>\"Some years we've made more \u2013 some years less, such as during the pine beetle epidemic when profit was down,\" said Wright, \"In recent years the community forest has been able to do more for their community because profits were up, we've made better money, and we've done better.\"</p><p>He notes the LNTCFS board try to take some of the funding they receive and look toward the future.</p><p>By responsibly using the profits of the community forest they are also able to attract more benefits for their community through the process of leveraging their profits as seed money to grow larger projects from outside sources. The LNTCFS over time has leveraged a total of $451,979 towards Job Creation Projects, which provided employment for summer students; creating and maintaining 64 km of recreational trails, and purchasing an OS log splitter for community use.</p><p>\"We are currently reviewing how we can help to create economic development within the community so we can bring more value to our community, more people to the community, and grow our community. As opposed to taking money out of the community like the majors [large corporations] are doing, and taking it down to the United States to buy mills in the U.S., said Wright, \"The provincial government is making the investing climate not promising for the majors, so most are going south to invest in the United States. That's just what large corporations do, but at the same time we will always be here if we are allowed to operate the way we are.\"</p><p>If the Lower North Thompson Community Forest Society is allowed to carry on the way it has been doing, it will be able operate into perpetuity as an ongoing benefit for the community. That ongoing benefit is not just about the giving back of dollars raised from the land to the community, but also giving back by being a good steward of our natural environment.</p><p>A community forest is not just about giving work to those in the logging industry who live locally.</p><p>\"We find that the directors of our community forest are very supportive of the community, and also of the community for what it does,\" said Wright, \"I think most people are supportive of us as well, but we do find that many people don't know enough about the forest to really understand what we do.\"</p><p>Wright related a good example regarding public perceptions about what a community forest does.</p><p>\"I recently chatted with some community members who were speaking about the Trans Mountain Pipeline, and how the company has to have concern for frogs, for snakes, and for birds such as hummingbirds and nesting birds. People are finding about that now because Trans Mountain is a major project going through our valley. But that's something we've been doing in our community forest for the past 10 years.</p><p>\"Most people don't know about that. There have been frog migrations in Nakusp that have been resolved because of community information and the logging aspect of it was resolved so that the frogs can co-exist with logging. Merritt has also dealt with migrating frogs, and they have erected frog barriers and mitigated it so frogs weren't harmed where there was logging. We have animals, such as the wolverine that is red listed, as well as the marten. We have tried to increase the habitat of the wolverine and also have put up wolverine nesting boxes and marten nesting boxes to try and enhance the wildlife.</p><p>\"There are areas where policies are put in place, and the majors [large logging corporations] have them as well, where a bird migration aspect of mitigation has been put in place. If you are in a bird migration route and there are birds passing through that area the logging is stopped until the migration is over. There are also red listed species like the goshawk that we watch out for. If we are out cruising cut-blocks and you notice a goshawk nest in the area, then that cut-block cannot be logged until the goshawk babies have feathered out and moved on.\"</p><p>After an area has been logged are the roads into that area automatically deactivated?</p><p>\"Not until we have finished planting,\" said Wright, \"But what we do is try to not put a road in that we cannot redevelop into timber. When we put a road into a cut-block, a lot of times what we do is set it up so we can take that road back out and plant it. A lot of roads we put in are just quad track roads, not vehicular roads. In this way we are trying to cut down the footprint of the road in the forest so that we can do a couple of things; wildlife protection and try to mitigate the growth of more timber by cutting down your footprint.\"</p><p>He adds the LNTCFS board and staff have a strong stewardship for the land \"which is a large part of what a community forest is all about.\"</p><p>The BC Community Forest Association (BCCFA) website offers an annual Indicators Report that the public can read online at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://bccfa.ca/2021-community-forest-indicators-report\">https://bccfa.ca/2021-community-forest-indicators-report</url>/</p><p>\"There area about 30 community forests that report to the BCCFA with the different aspects of what their investment back into the community is, and what their sustainability looks like,\" explained Wright, \"There are also about 18 questions asked that they reply to with stories, etcetera, about what they are doing. A lot of that information is very intuitive about what community forests are doing, but it is not actually out there in front of the general public unless they go to the website.</p><p>\"However, as an association we have been able to canvas our provincial government to try and show that we are doing a better job than what is expected of us, and I think that cuts across the whole province. We try to look at that report on an annual basis and see where the improvements are made.</p><p>\"What we see is that per capita we have employed more people per cubic meter than what the majors do, we create better enhancement and sustainability projects than the majors do, we create more revenue back to our communities than what the majors do. There are also many aspects on how we actually work on the land at a level far above what is being done in other areas.\"</p><p>The difference between the major corporations and the community forests is that their land base is larger.</p><p>\"Their cutting on a larger area that might go from Kamloops to Valemount,\" said Wright, \"Whereas we are on 8,000 hectares, and that's all we are on. We can't go anywhere else. If a fire took our community forest tomorrow, we'd have to log it and replant it, and then wait for 80 years to log it again.\"</p><p>The major corporations are also based on volume.</p><p>\"When Interfor bought Canfor they bought another 300,000 cubic meters,\" said Wright, \"So the Interfor mill at Adams Lake sits at about 985,000 cubic meters of timber that they are allowed to cut in a year, which spans an area that goes approximately from Kamloops to Valemount. Based on that volume they have to get it from wherever they can within that area, and then that volume is judged every five years to make sure it is in line with the provincial guidelines. As they take that timber out, they then replant so they can have that much timber in the future.\"</p><p>One thing that the majors don't necessarily do is wildfire mitigation to protect their assets. If timber burns in an area where there is a sawmill, which reduces the volume for the mill. The volume of timber taken off after the fire will be put through the sawmill, but then the land has to be replanted by the province. If that mill then does not have enough timber coming through they would have to shut down, which has already happened to some of the mills in B.C., not only from loss of timber to wildfires, but also due to the over-cut that was necessary because of the pine beetle.</p><p>\"We will see a consolidation of timber between some of the mills, because their profitability level is at about a million cubic meters of wood a year in order to sustain their sawmills and make a profit,\" said Wright, \"Where as we're sitting with 20,000 meters.\"</p><p>British Columbia's old growth forests are very much in the public eye right now.

But of all the community forests that we have under the BC Community Forest Association membership, and even the ones that we don\u2019t, their biggest drive is to try and have something sustained for their communities in one way or another. Some are corporations, some are owned by cities, some are owned by non-profits, some are owned by co-ops. But all of them have this rural mantra of trying to protect their forests for long term sustainability for the benefit of their community.\u201d</p><p>Does the LNTCFS work with area First Nations? \u201cHistorically, the First Nations in particular, were the ones that helped us get a community forest in 2003 after the McLure Wildfire happened here,\u201d explained Wright, \u201cWith the help of First Nations we were able to acquire a community forest, and so we work together with Simpcw First Nation in particular because we are in their unceded land territory. We also work with other bands; Neskonlith, KamloopsIndian Band, Little Shuswap, and Adams Lake Indian Band. We refer to all of them, and we try to work with all the First Nations. From our perspective we don\u2019t have any trouble in doing that because a lot of what we are doing is what they want to do as well\u201d He notes the First Nations operating a community forest have a community forest license, they also have a First Nations woodland licence, and may also have a wood lot as well. However, the provincial government\u2019s regulations for First Nations\u2019 community forests is not the same as other community forest licences, and as a result First Nations want to make that change so they can do more on their land base similar to what the LNTCFS can do under their licence.\u201d</p><p>Wright pointed out that a First Nations woodland licence does not allow the same level of community involvement that a community forest does, \u201cThey are currently trying to make that change with the provincial government so that the government will recognized their First Nations Woodlots as community forests.\u201d</p><p>Currently there are 58 community forest licence holders and 860 wood lots currently operating in B.C. , and Wright advises they are all concerned about what the provincial government is considering doing with tab rates.</p><p>\u201cOn most of the provincial Crown land, the government receives stumpage [a fee that businesses or individuals pay when they harvest timber from Crown land in B.C. ] from the land sales. That stumpage is based on the sale of lumber and the average trend of bidding on BC Timber Sales (BCTS),\u201d explained Wright, \u201cWhat the community forest has is a system that is separate from that. The community forest system was initiated a number of years ago where the community forest got what they call tab rates. Tab rates is a percentage of the stumpage -15 per cent of the stumpage in the Interior, and 30 per cent at the coast. That gives a difference in what community forests pay in stumpage, and what a person who makes a sale on BCTS would pay. By having that difference in stumpage it allows us to create profit. If we were under the same stumpage system that BCTS has, which they call Market Pricing System or MPS, we wouldn\u2019t be able to operate because what we find is that stumpage is keyed so high to log sales that we would actually end up not being able to log.</p><p>\u201cMany community forests that are joined with First Nations woodland licences find that the woodland licences stumpages are so high right now that they can\u2019t log and make money. Whereas a community forest such as the LNTCFS has a low enough stumpage rate that we can still log and contribute to our community.\u201d</p><p>Wright says the province is currently reviewing this system and those operating community forests are very concerned that if the direction of the province was to initiate the Market Pricing System on community forests that most of them would be dissolved.</p><p>Would this mean the LNTCFS would also be dissolved if the community would receive no financial benefits from its continuation? \u201cYes. Our community forest would essentially be non-existent and the province would take this tenure and change it into something else.\u201d</p><p>This year alone the LNTCFS will be putting approximately $150,000 back into their community of Little Fort to McLure. Over a 10 year period this adds up to a million and a half dollars that will be invested back into the area.</p><p>\u201cSome years we\u2019ve made more, some years less, such as during the pine beetle epidemic when profit was down,\u201d said Wright, \u201cIn recent years the community forest has been able to do more for their community because profits were up, we\u2019ve made better money, and we\u2019ve done better.\u201d</p><p>He notes the LNTCFS board try to take some of the funding they receive and look toward the future.</p><p>By responsibly using the profits of the community forest they are also able to attract more benefits for their community through the process of leveraging their profits as seed money to grow larger projects from outside sources. The LNTCFS LNTCFS over time has leveraged a total of $451,979 towards Job Creation Projects, which have provided employment for summer students; creating and maintaining 64 km of recreational trails, and purchasing an OS log splitter for community use.</p><p>\u201cWe are currently reviewing how we can help to create economic development within the community so we can bring more value to our community, more people to the community, and grow our community. As opposed to taking money out of the community like the majors [large corporations] are doing, and taking it down to the United States to buy mills in the U.S. The provincial government is making the investing climate not promising for the majors, so most are going south to invest in the United States. That\u2019s just what large corporations do, but at the same time we will always be here if we are allowed to operate the way we are.\u201d</p><p>If the Lower North Thompson Community Forest Society is allowed to carry on the way it has been doing, it can operate into perpetuity as an ongoing benefit for the community, and that ongoing benefit in not just in the giving back of dollars raised from the land to the community, but also giving back by being good a steward of our natural environment.</p><p>\u201cWe find that the directors of our community forest are very supportive of the community, and also of the community for what it does,\u201d said Harley Wright, \u201cI think most people are supportive of us as well, but we do find that most people don\u2019t know enough about the forest to really understand what we do.\u201d</p><p>A community forest is not just about giving work to those in the logging industry who live locally.</p><p>Wright related a good example regarding public perceptions about what a community forest does.</p><p>\u201cI recently chatted with some community members who were speaking about the Trans Mountain Pipeline, and how the company has to have concern for frogs, for snakes, and for birds such as hummingbirds and nesting birds. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve been doing in our community forest for the past 10 years. People are finding about it now because Trans Mountain is a major project going through our valley. But forests have been doing that for many years already. There have been frog migrations in Nakusp that have been resolved because of community information and the logging aspect of it was resolved so that the frogs can co-exist with logging. Merritt has also dealt with migrating frogs and they have erected frog barriers and mitigated it so frogs weren\u2019t harmed where there was logging.</p><p>\u201cWe have animals, such as the wolverine that is red listed, as well as the marten. We have tried to increase the habitat of the wolverine and also have put up wolverine nesting boxes and marten nesting boxes to try and enhance the wildlife.</p><p>\u201cThere are areas where policies are put in place (and the majors [large logging corporations] have them as well) where a bird migration aspect of mitigation has been put in place. If you are in a bird migration route and there are birds passing through that area the logging is stopped until the migration is over. There are also red listed species like the goshawk that we watch out for. If we are out cruising cutblocks and you notice a goshawk nest in the area, then that cut-block cannot be logged until the goshawk babies have feathered out and moved on.</p><p>\u201cThe forest industry has been doing a lot of wildlife enhancement for many years. Most people don\u2019t know about it, but people are hearing about it now because many are working on the Trans Mountain pipeline and they come back and talk about it with others.\u201d</p><p>After an area has been logged are the roads automatically deactivated? \u201cNot until we have finished planting,\u201d said Wright, \u201cBut what we do is try to not put a road in that we cannot redevelop into timber. When we put a road into a cut-block, a lot of times what we do is set it up so we can take that road back out and plant it. A lot of roads we put in are just quad track roads but not vehicular roads. In this way we are trying to cut down the footprint of the road in the forest so that we can do a couple of things; wildlife protection and try to mitigate the growth of more timber by cutting down your footprint.\u201d</p><p>He adds the LNTCFS board and staff have a strong stewardship for the land \u201cwhich is a large part of what a community forest is all about\u201d.</p><p>Write also notes the BC Community Forest Association (BCCFA) website offers an annual Indicators Report that the public can read online at:<url normalizedValue=\"https://bccfa.ca/2021-community-forest-indicators-report/\u201cWe\">https://bccfa.ca/2021-community-forest-indicators-report/\u201cWe</url> have about 30 community forests that report to the BCCFA with the different aspects of what their investment back into the community is, what their sustainability looks like, and there are about 18 questions asked that they reply to with stories, etcetera, about what they are doing. A lot of that information is very intuitive about what community forests are doing but it is not actually out there in front of the general public unless they go to the website. However, as an association we have been able to canvas our provincial government to try and show that we are doing a better job than what is expected of us and I think that cuts across the whole province. We try to look at that report on an annual basis and see where the improvements are made. What we see is that per capita we have employed more people per cubic meter than what the majors do, we create better enhancement and sustainability projects than the majors do, we create more revenue back to our communities than what the majors do. There are also many aspects on how we actually work on the land at a level far above what is being done in other areas.\u201d</p><p>Wright explains that the difference between the major corporations and the community forests is that their land base is larger.</p><p>\u201cThere cutting on a larger area, that might go from Kamloops to Vale- mount,\u201d said Wright, \u201cWhereas we are on that 8,000 hectares, and that\u2019s all we are on. We can\u2019t go anywhere else. If a fire took our community forest tomorrow, we have to log it and replant it, and then wait for 80 years to log it again.\u201d</p><p>He notes that the majors are based on volume.</p><p>\u201cWhen Interfor bought Canfor they bought another 300,000 cubic meters, so the Interfor mill at Adams Lake sits at about 985,000 cubic meters of timber that they are allowed to cut in a year, which spans an area that goes approximately from Kamloops to Valemount. Based on that volume they have to get it from wherever they can within that area, and then that volume is judged every five years to make sure it is in line with the provincial guidelines. As they take that timber out, they then replant so they can have that much timber in the future.\u201d</p><p>One thing that the majors don\u2019t necessarily do is wildfire mitigation to protect their assets. If timber burns in an area where there is a sawmill, which reduces the volume for the mill. The volume of timber taken off after the fire will be put through the sawmill, but then the land has to be replanted by the province. If that mill then does not have enough timber coming through they would have to shut down, which has already happened to some mills not only from loss of timber to wildfires but also due to the over-cut that was necessary because of the pine beetle.</p><p>\u201cWe will see a consolidation of timber between some of the mills, because their profitability level is at about a million cubic meters of wood a year in order to sustain their sawmills and make a profit,\u201d said Wright, \u201cWhere as we\u2019re sitting with 20,000 meters.\u201d</p><p>British Columbia\u2019s old growth forests are very much in the public eye right now. Does the LNTCFS have old growth to deal with in their area? \u201cThe old growth was set aside by the provincial government under the guidance of a plan that was consulted through the whole province by some First Nations and others involved. The plan was developed with about 14 recommendations. One of the recommendations was to look at what old growth we have left in the province, and then of that old growth we need to look at how we are managing it,\u201d said Wright, \u201cI think everybody agrees with that. Nobody disagrees with managing old growth.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened was that the provincial government while trying to ascertain where the old growth is, started by surmising there was three per cent of the old growth still left in our province. Subsequently there was another study done by Forsythe that showed we had probably closer to 30 per cent old growth in our province. When they sat down with a technical committee to look at what volume to set aside, they made certain conclusions based on the knowledge that they used, that there was a need to set aside another 260,000 hectares of land. The problem was that it was never ground proved to look at make sure the old growth was actually there. So now what we are finding across the province is that many of the areas that were set aside, under the guise of setting aside old growth, really isn\u2019t old growth at all.</p><p>\u201cWe looked at some areas within our own community forest that had been set aside, just a small portion at this point. But of that area it\u2019s not old growth. It\u2019s actually set up in an area where there is no old growth, but there are large trees. The one area where it was set up is in a wildfire management area, and we have predicated that this area has a strong potential for a wildfire to take off and go through our community forest and burn our mature timber, which is of value for the next 250 years. What we wanted to do was to go into this area and log it out and replant, so that if there was a wildfire in that area it wouldn\u2019t have a chance to get into our mature timber which is an asset.</p><p>\u201cThere was an argument at our board meeting about that, and fair enough, because people believe in not logging old growth. But the truth is when we got out there what was suggested as old growth is instead an area that really has tremendous wildfire potential instead. There was some old large trees, but they didn\u2019t meet the criteria that the provincial government has set down for old growth. With the ladder fuel [live or dead vegetation on the forest floor that lets a fire climb up into the trees] that\u2019s in there, if it caught fire because of it\u2019s proximity to a road or something it would become a crown fire in no time at all through that area and take it out.</p><p>The criteria for old growth is there need to be trees in the area that are 250 years old for that area. The trees found in the LNTCFS area are spruce about 60 years old, Douglas fir about 80 to 100 years old, and cedar that was 150 years old which had grown since the last wildfire through that area, plus a large amount of understory cedar stagnating that is perhaps four to six inches around that is 80 years old.</p><p>\u201cFrom our perspective of trying to make that forest productive land, as you would if you were a farmer, we see that forest is stagnating and it doesn\u2019t meet the criteria that the government has set down for old growth,\u201d said Wright, \u201cBut they have drawn the line on a map that says it is designated old growth, so for the next two years we are not allowed to touch it for wildfire protection.</p><p>So now, what does the LNTCFS do? \u201cAs a sustainability objective, and as a community forest that wants to try and do the best thing for the timber, do you log it? Do you not log it? If you leave it will you have a fire go through it?,\u201d said Wright, \u201cWe know that we are going to answer these questions and we will have some more discussion at our upcoming board meeting where it will have to be answered and decided on at a board level. At least now we have a good understanding of what is there which was a necessary first step.\u201d</p><p>Whatever the LNTCFS decides they will have to ask the province for approval before they cam move ahead with that area of their community forest.</p><p>Wright says that the LNTCFS agrees with preserving old growth forests that meet the criteria of the province, but what they would like to see is that the old growth is managed. He notes that as the forest floor closes from the ladder fuel the bio-diversity of the forest diminishes. When there is a forest canopy that is partially closed off and in some areas partially open, that promotes the bio-diversity and the animals need the bio-diversity. Old growth forests on the coast have a closed canopy, lots of moss on the forest floor, and something that people what to have and enjoy. That is their biodiversity.</p><p>\u201cWhat we believe is respect the old growth and treat it like you want it for 250 years, but at the same time because of climate change we need to have wildfire protection, greater bio-diversity by opening some designated and smaller areas up so that other plants can grow. You can still have old growth, bio-diversity and a greater degree of wildlife living in it,\u201d said Wright.</p><p>\u201cFor our forest we want to go in there and clean that ladder fuel out. You won\u2019t have a forest fire, and you would have timber there for the next 150 to 200 years. That\u2019s a responsibility. But let\u2019s not have old growth for the sake of not being able to do anything. Set down parameters that you have to keep the timber, set down parameters to respect old growth.

(\"Trillium\" or the \"Company\"), is pleased to announce that the Company has commissioned Windfall Geotek (\"Windfall\" or \"WIN\") to deploy their proprietary CARDS Artificial Intelligence (\"AI\") system to identify high-grade gold targets on its Leo Property. The Leo Property is a greenfield exploration project located about 15km south of Great Bear Resources' famed Dixie project with excellent access and infrastructure.</p><p>Figure 1: Regional gold signature based on the Ontario Supergrid Magnetic data (Red Lake-Stormy) and SRTM at 40m resolution</p><p>Russell Starr, CEO of Trillium Gold Mines comments \"Leo is a very exciting prospect for Trillium and its shareholders. Utilizing Windfall's proprietary AI technology we look to rapidly focus on high quality targets and speed up the time to discovery of gold mineralization. AI has been instrumental in identifying priority drill targets among our peers by amalgamating and evaluating multiple layers of large geological datasets and increasing the efficiency and quality of high priority zones identified on a project.\" AI support in mineral exploration will be instrumental in the future successes in our industry and we look forward to working with Windfall.\"</p><p>Windfall Geotek (TSX-V:WIN) is a leader in the use of technology for exploration targeting. WIN has developed the CARDS analysis as well as proprietary data mining techniques. It combines all available public and in-house data sets including geologic, geophysical, geochemical, drill hole and surface data. The algorithms developed and employed by Windfall Geotek in this case are designed to highlight areas of interest that have the potential to be geologically similar to gold deposits and mineralization in the Red Lake region.</p><p>Figure 2: By combining various data types, data utilization is optimized and prediction is maximized.</p><p>The CARDS analysis identifies areas of high exploration potential using several techniques. Algorithms analyze each layer of information for every drill hole/rock/soil sample and data site to create a unique signature for the mineralization that is being sought (gold, copper, kimberlites etc.). By using the MCubiX data mining engine (with numerous supporting algorithms) the analysis recognizes patterns of information among drill holes and other sample media. The system uses these algorithms to find the new patterns, patterns that are often not recognized by the naked eye. CARDS analysis identifies locations of the new mineralization signature in the exploration area. Predictions are given a cell rating by percentage: Targets rated over 80% are considered promising and targets 90% and higher are exceptional. Millions of spatial data points and their relationships are analyzed -- in a rather short period of time -- an activity that a human brain cannot do as efficiently and quickly as a computer. The CARDS System becomes trained and \"cross validates\" each model that CARDS generates. The cell rating percentage \"weeds out\" unwanted (low percentage cells) targets, leaving only the highest probability areas for the discovery of mineralization. In some regions this may be as low as 5% of total original project area.</p><p>Figure 3: Millions of spatial data points and their relationships are analyzed.</p><p>Russell Star, CEO of Trillium Gold, states that \"working with Windfall Geotek allows us to accelerate our generative gold targeting efforts while at the same time allowing our team to efficiently manage current priority field programs in progress on the Newman Todd Property, and shortly thereafter on the newly acquired Rivard Property as well. While we efficiently expedite our current programs, we are preparing the Leo project for rapid follow up exploration with the high-value targets expected to be generated by the CARDS system.\"</p><p>Update on active forest fire in Red Lake</p><p>Trillium's Newman Todd project is located approximately 15km north west of the active forest fires on the north side of Red Lake. Work is continuing at the Newman Todd Project and has not been unimpeded by the Red Lake Fire, but management and staff are vigilant in monitoring the situation to ensure the safety of company staff and contractors.</p><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Robert W. Schafer QP, PGeo, a director of Trillium Gold Mines, as defined by NI 43-101.</p><p>About the Leo Project</p><p>The 100% owned Leo Property is located 35 kilometers southeast of Red Lake and covers an area of 210 sq km. The area has become the focus for renewed exploration and lies about 15 kilometers south of several properties held by Great Bear Resources, including the Dixie Lake project. Leo features many similar geological characteristics to these regional projects, making this one of our most exciting generative exploration areas.</p><p>About Trillium Gold Mines Inc.</p><p>Trillium Gold Mines Inc. is a British Columbia based company engaged in the business of acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties located in the highly prospective Red Lake Mining District of Northern Ontario.</p><p>For further information about this news release and the Company's current activities contact <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@trilliumgold.com\">info@trilliumgold.com</email>, visit our website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.trilliumgold.com\">www.trilliumgold.com</url> or call us at 604-688-9588.</p><p>On behalf of the Board of Directors,</p><p>Trillium Gold Mines Inc.</p><p>\"Russell Starr\"</p><p>Russell Starr</p><p>President, CEO and Director</p><p>Trillium Gold Mines Inc.</p><p>Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</p><p>This news release contains forward-looking information, which involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual events to differ materially from current expectation.

Matt Kavanagh, a 43-year-old Victoria state firefighter, was killed in a vehicle crash on Friday, officials said. Kavanagh was on the road working to extinguish unattended campfires when the crash happened, said Chris Hardman, Forest Fire Management Victoria's Chief Fire Officer. It took police a few days to investigate his death before they confirmed it was linked to his work on the wildfires, and therefore part of the disaster's official death toll.</p><p>\"He's such a well-loved guy,\" Hardman told reporters. \"For those people who knew Matt, it's going to take a long time. I can't imagine what that family is going through and what Matt's colleagues are going through. It's just such a very sad day.\"</p><p>The unprecedented fire crisis in southeast Australia that has destroyed 2,000 homes and shrouded major cities in smoke has focused many Australians on how the nation adapts to climate change. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has faced fierce criticism both domestically and internationally for downplaying the need for his government to address climate change, which experts say helps supercharge the blazes.</p><p>The centre-left opposition Labor Party has made political capital from the crisis by promising more ambitious policies than the ruling conservative coalition to tackle climate change. Opposition climate spokesman Mark Butler wants the government to allow a debate on climate change in Parliament when it returns in February.</p><p>\"Hopefully we could fashion a bipartisan position,\" Butler told ABC. The two sides last held a bipartisan position on climate change in 2007, and have remained bitterly divided ever since on issues such as making carbon polluters pay for their emissions.</p><p>Labour had pledged to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 45% below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve zero emissions by 2050 if it had won last year's elections.</p><p>The coalition government has committed to reduce emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030 and warns that Labor's more ambitious target would wreck the economy. The government argues that Australia is responsible for only 1.3% of global emissions and more ambitious targets would not ease the current fire crisis, which follows Australia's hottest and driest year on record.</p><p>Several firefighters unions urged the federal government on Wednesday to order a royal commission - the nation's highest form of investigation - into the wildfires. Environmental group Greenpeace Australia said any such investigation must analyze the role of climate change.</p><p>\"This unprecedented and catastrophic fire season still has months to go and the next one will not be far behind. We need to start planning now so the chaotic scenes witnessed this summer do not become an annual occurrence,\" Greenpeace Australia Pacific's Head of Campaigns, Jamie Hanson, said in a statement. \"But this inquiry needs to go beyond the symptoms of the bushfire crisis and look at the largest underlying cause of the conditions that have exacerbated these fires, which is burning coal. \"</p><p>Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas, but Morrison rejected calls last month to downsize Australia's lucrative coal industry.</p><p>The wildfire disaster, which is likely to continue throughout the Southern Hemisphere summer, has galvanized calls for more global action on climate change.</p><p>Elton John and actor Chris Hemsworth are among the celebrities donating big bucks to help aid the firefighting efforts. Hemsworth, an Australian who lives in the drought-affected New South Wales town of Byron Bay, wrote on Twitter that he was donating $1 million and asked his followers to show support. \"Every penny counts,\" he wrote.</p><p>John announced during his Farewell Yellow Brick Road concert in Sydney on Tuesday that he will also donate $1 million.

At least 25 humans dead, 480 million animals wiped out, 2,000 homes perished in fires equivalent to the size of Nova Scotia blazing across Australia. But these figures that have caught international attention don't adequately capture the fear and uncertainty on the ground, the children jumping into lakes, the firefighters doubling and trebling their efforts and residents living in a perpetual state of heightened alarm.</p><p>In popular Canadian imagination, Australia is an identical twin, down to the colonial violence that marks its birth. It's just warmer and more vibrant.</p><p>So many Canadians volunteered to go fight the fires themselves that the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre which is co-ordinating the Canadian response had to intervene.</p><p>\"While Australia does use volunteer firefighters, these firefighters are familiar with and trained to specific standards relative to firefighting in Australian conditions,\" a note on its website says. It requests that people not overload the Australian state fire services by contacting them directly.</p><p>I, too, have personal stakes in the catastrophe. The smoke there chokes me here. My sister and brother live in Sydney. For my young nieces, breathing the world's worst air right now, climate change isn't some intangible peril of the future but an omnipresent danger whose status is constantly updated on fire services apps, one that demands a preparedness to flee at a moment's notice.</p><p>\"We haven't seen blue skies in three months,\" my brother told me. \"The sun has been a hazy orange since September.\"</p><p>Suburban Sydneysiders are the fortunate ones that have escaped - so far - the ravages of coastal green belts and the combustible eucalyptus treed-Blue Mountains nearby.</p><p>There was that one night when my brother awoke to find the house filled with smoke. They'd already swept the dried leaves off the roof gutters. But the danger of flying embers on extremely dry wood is real. Despite Level 1 water restrictions (with Level 6 the most severe), he and a few neighbours sprayed the roof that day.</p><p>\"How does one decide between letting the house burn and saving water?\"</p><p>Bellantonio is a senior deputy captain of a fire fighters brigade. At the state level, he is also a member of an aviation rescue crew. Like most Australian firefighters he's a volunteer. He has lost count of the number of fires he has fought.</p><p>\"Many, many, many,\" he said. Some are \"small events,\" others large. A year without major fires or floods works out to three or four weeks of volunteering. This year he estimates it's already been two or three months. Bellantonio is self-employed, which means no work no money. He thinks he's out of pocket \"20 grand easily.\" But \"there are thousands of firefighters like me,\" he said.</p><p>\"As a small population living in a very large country it is essential for all of us to pull together and help each other out.\"</p><p>A month ago, he said, he was in an aircraft flying up the coast from Sydney to the mid-north. \"All the way up the visibility was so bad we could barely fly. It was just smoke. When you look at the grounds as far as the eye can see, it's just fire.\"</p><p>\"Next year, there will be nothing left to burn,\" he added.</p><p>The dryness that made Australia a tinder box much like California and the Brazilian rainforest has come following a prolonged drought that experts blame on climate change caused by emissions of heat-trapping gases. Another reason they are spreading so devastatingly is poor land management.</p><p>\"There is no doubt traditional ways and methods of burning were far superior to what we're doing these days,\" Bellantonio said.</p><p>These fires \"are the consequence of failing to heed to warnings from First Nations all around this country, failure to indigenize land management and implement it with control of the First Nations that can read country,\" writes Natalie Cromb, a Gamilaraay woman, author and activist from Sydney in IndigenousX.</p><p>Last year, Indigenous cultural burning was reintroduced in the state of Victoria for the first time in almost 200 years, something brought back in after consultations with Indigenous peoples in North America.</p><p>However, the best strategies in Australia might come to naught in the face of the country's dangerous leader. Vacationing in Hawaii while the fires raged on was possibly the most innocuous of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's decisions.</p><p>Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal and natural gas. Like the Liberals here who claim to support an environmental agenda while promoting oil extraction, political parties there speak from both sides of their mouths, but with coal mining. There is even a bipartisan group named - wait for it - Parliamentary Friends of Australian Coal Exports.</p><p>Morrison, who just last month was seeking to outlaw protests by environmentalists, embodies politicians who are not accountable to land, even to their much-vaunted \"private property.\"</p><p>The prime minister's support of coal and war on climate activists despite the fires decimating his countrypeople, left wing or right, shows that when it comes to power, these politicians are not even accountable to the people that vote for them.</p><p>Twitter: @ShreeParadkar</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020010756795368</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXJ-JMV1-DY91-K1S9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 7, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;
