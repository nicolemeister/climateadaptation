How a beloved character may have helped fuel catastrophic fires</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First off, let's ditch \"the.\" It's officially \"Smokey Bear.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The definite article only got shoehorned in there in 1952, when his fame was snowballing and a pair of songwriters penned Smokey his own anthem. They jammed \"the\" into his name for the song's rhythm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Second: know he only got his job because Bambi was contractually unavailable. Had Walt Disney been a little more open about loaning out his prancing cartoon deer for government work, Americans may have never heard of Smokey Bear or his famous catchphrase: \"Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Bambi had merchandise to hawk at the Magic Kingdom, so Smokey became the face of American forestry - and the longest-running public service campaign in the country's history.</p><p>This month Smokey is popping champagne bottles in celebration of his 74th birthday. But the milestone comes as the bear's legacy is sunk in doubt. Right now 110 wildfires are currently blazing through western states, charring more than 5.7 million acres, The Washington Post reported this week. The current damage total has already overlapped past years, syncing with a larger pattern of larger fires and longer fire seasons, according to The Post.</p><p>So as America burns, where's Smokey Bear?</p><p>The recent fires actually highlight an ongoing debate among ecologists about whether Smokey should shoulder some responsibility for the flames now regularly sweeping across natural lands. For much of the last century, Smokey was the pitchman for the federal government's aggressive wildfire suppression policy. That tactic, some scientists believe, may have contributed along with climate change to making American forests vulnerable long-term to combustion. They call it \"the Smokey Bear effect.\"</p><p>To understand the history of modern American fire prevention, you actually have to jump back to the terror and anxiety spilling over the country at the start of the Second World War. Before the war, fire policy was a regular topic of debate - stop fires or allow controlled burns? - among foresters in the west and southwest. But after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, forestry suddenly became a national security concern.</p><p>According to the federal government, in the spring of 1942 Japanese submarines popped up along the west coast and began shelling Santa Barbara, California. The enemy fire landed dangerously close Los Padres National Forest, igniting concerns among officials that a few well-placed enemy bombs could spark catastrophic fires along the Pacific Coast. The fear was compounded because most of the men who usually fought forest fires were overseas.</p><p>The government decided to launch a public campaign promoting hypervigilance among citizens to prevent wildfires. The early campaign, run by the co-operative Forest Fire Prevention, couched preventions in terms of the war effort. Posters warned \"Our Carelessness, Their Secret Weapon\" and \"Forest Fires Aid the Enemy.\" One image featured a forest blaze below the glaring (and frankly racist) caricatures of Japanese Supreme Military Leader Hideki Tojo and Germany's Adolf Hitler.</p><p>A popular poster from this early effort leveraged anthropomorphic cuteness, tapping Disney's Bambi (\"Please Mister, Don't Be Careless\") for a 1944 campaign. But Walt Disney only licensed its creation for a year. After Bambi's time was up, government organizers realized they needed a new cuddly face for prevention.</p><p>Smokey Bear, created by artist Albert Staehle, made his debut for the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service in August 1944. The first poster showed Smokey - decked out in his trademark wide-brimmed park ranger hat, pants, and standing on two legs - pouring a bucket of water over a campfire. \"Smokey says - Care will prevent 9 out of 10 woods fires!\" the caption boasted. By 1947, Smokey's tag line was updated: \"Remember ... Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires.\"</p><p>Smokey was soon splashed on posters in parks, buses, roadsides, and on television and radio spots. In 1950, Smokey got a real-world counterpart when New Mexico firefighters battling a blaze discovered a black bear clinging to a charred tree. The animal was nursed back to health, named Smokey, and shipped off to the National Zoo in Washington. He lived there until his death in 1976 as a \"living symbol of forest fire prevention\" and \"an honest to goodness reminder of the danger of forest fires,\" actor William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy) said in a 1953 short film on the cub.</p><p>Smokey's public campaign has been incredibly effective. As Charles E. Little noted in a 1993 article in American Forests, when the federal government's fire prevention campaign began in the 1940s, fires regularly burned an average of 30 million acres nationally. By 1988, the U.S. was only seeing 7.4 million acres of damage.</p><p>But that success is the problem, according to some scientists.</p><p>The Smokey campaigns have fostered the idea that all fires are bad and preventable, critics argue. In reality, fires are a natural part of the ecosystem, regularly clearing out old growth. As University of California at Riverside professor Richard Minnich told Grist in 2016, the government campaign at the height of the Smokey era ignored fire as a natural occurrence.</p><p>\"Smokey Bear says, 'Only you can prevent forest fires,'\" Minnich told the website. \"Let's change that last part. Smokey Bear says, 'Only you can prevent earthquakes.' Or how about, 'Only you can prevent tornadoes' - except no one thinks that.\"</p><p>The result is more forest land packed with potential fuel when fires do strike. Most experts today feel controlled burns of forests are the most effective way to clear land and help the health of wildlife.</p><p>It's a reality the government itself has come to grapple with.</p><p>In a 2007 paper titled \"Be careful what you wish for: the legacy of Smokey Bear,\" two USDA Forest Service researchers noted the \"long-standing policy of aggressive wildfire suppression has contributed to a decline in forest health, an increase in fuel loads in some forests, and wildfires that are more difficult and expensive to control.\"</p><p>Smokey himself has been updated to reflect the more advanced position. In 2001, his catchphrase was updated to \"Only You Can Prevent Wildfires\" instead of forest fires. According to the bear's official bio, the change was \"in response to a massive outbreak of wildfires in natural areas other than forests and to clarify that Smokey is promoting the prevention of unwanted and unplanned outdoor fires versus prescribed fires.\"</p><p>Smokey continues to be the face of wildfire prevention, starring in a number of commercials in recent years featuring the bear schooling millennials in proper campfire prevention.</p><p>Still looking fit and healthy at 74, Smokey likely has his work cut out for him. As The Post reported this week, in the 1980s and 1990s, the average wildfire burned between 40 and 80 acres. This year's average fire now tops 130 acres.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-08/15/201847127338</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T20-87W1-JDH3-G12M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1146\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Wildfire Service and Sproat Lake Volunteer Fire Department had a good handle on a two-hectare fire burning on Turtle Lake Road east of Great Central Lake after battling the small blaze Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>Although smoke appeared to pick up Wednesday evening, the Coastal Fire Centre says that the size of the fire has not increased.</p><p>\"We have not called that fire out,\" explained fire information officer Natasha Broznitsky. \"What people are seeing&amp;#8230;there can be areas of fuel within the area of the fire that can burn off and become more visible.\"</p><p>Within B.C. Wildfire Service, \"under control\" means that a fire has received sufficient suppression action to ensure it will not spread.</p><p>A 10-person crew from Sproat Lake VFD and three B.C. wildfire crew members were on scene shortly after 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 7 after receiving multiple reports of the fire approximately 20 kilometres west of Port Alberni. Sproat Lake also responded with an engine, a tanker and support truck on the Coastal Fire Centre's request, fire Chief Mike Cann said.</p><p>The fire is burning in slash in an area that was logged late last fall or earlier this spring, Cann said. \"There had been no industry activity in here for a while,\" he added.</p><p>Although a definitive cause for the fire has not been determined, the Coastal Fire Centre is reporting that it is human-caused. \"That's what forestry is saying and the timber holder company is saying, is it's person-caused, but it's under investigation,\" Cann said. He did not name the timber company.</p><p>Fighting a forest fire in the bush in the middle of the night is a challenge, Cann said. \"The ground wasn't too bad. It was dark and we worked slowly and carefully.\"</p><p>The wind was calm at night, and that worked in the crews' favour, he added. \"That was a really good thing for us. The weather cooperated for us.\"</p><p>Calls started coming in from Port Alberni late Monday, Aug. 6 that people could see flames out toward the Alberni Valley Regional Airport. It turned out the wildfire was burning east of Great Central Lake, between the lake and the airport. People in Port Alberni were posting on social media that they could see the flames from nearly 20 kilometres away.</p><p>\"It's a very small fire,\" said Coastal Fire Centre Fire Information Officer Donna MacPherson on Tuesday morning.</p><p>Crews from Sproat Lake Volunteer Fire Dept. and B.C. Wildfire crews were still working in the area as of late Tuesday morning.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editor@albernivalleynews.com\">editor@albernivalleynews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AVLNWS-3638595</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AVLNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T08-F871-JDH3-G0T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"413\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Alberni Valley News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 8, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC00026Q8</classCode><className>THE TIMBER CO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Wildfire Service and Sproat Lake Volunteer Fire Department had a good handle on a two-hectare fire burning on Turtle Lake Road east of Great Central Lake after battling the small blaze Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>Although smoke appeared to pick up Wednesday evening, the Coastal Fire Centre says that the size of the fire has not increased.</p><p>\"We have not called that fire out,\" explained fire information officer Natasha Broznitsky. \"What people are seeing&amp;#8230;there can be areas of fuel within the area of the fire that can burn off and become more visible.\"</p><p>Within B.C. Wildfire Service, \"under control\" means that a fire has received sufficient suppression action to ensure it will not spread.</p><p>A 10-person crew from Sproat Lake VFD and three B.C. wildfire crew members were on scene shortly after 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 7 after receiving multiple reports of the fire approximately 20 kilometres west of Port Alberni. Sproat Lake also responded with an engine, a tanker and support truck on the Coastal Fire Centre's request, fire Chief Mike Cann said.</p><p>The fire is burning in slash in an area that was logged late last fall or earlier this spring, Cann said. \"There had been no industry activity in here for a while,\" he added.</p><p>Although a definitive cause for the fire has not been determined, the Coastal Fire Centre is reporting that it is human-caused. \"That's what forestry is saying and the timber holder company is saying, is it's person-caused, but it's under investigation,\" Cann said. He did not name the timber company.</p><p>Fighting a forest fire in the bush in the middle of the night is a challenge, Cann said. \"The ground wasn't too bad. It was dark and we worked slowly and carefully.\"</p><p>The wind was calm at night, and that worked in the crews' favour, he added. \"That was a really good thing for us. The weather cooperated for us.\"</p><p>Calls started coming in from Port Alberni late Monday, Aug. 6 that people could see flames out toward the Alberni Valley Regional Airport. It turned out the wildfire was burning east of Great Central Lake, between the lake and the airport. People in Port Alberni were posting on social media that they could see the flames from nearly 20 kilometres away.</p><p>\"It's a very small fire,\" said Coastal Fire Centre Fire Information Officer Donna MacPherson on Tuesday morning.</p><p>Crews from Sproat Lake Volunteer Fire Dept. and B.C. Wildfire crews were still working in the area as of late Tuesday morning.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editor@albernivalleynews.com\">editor@albernivalleynews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAIFDI-3640174</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAIFDI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T0X-BW31-F105-651G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"413\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Vancouver Island Free Daily</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 8, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC00026Q8</classCode><className>THE TIMBER CO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N113110CC</classCode><className>TIMBER TRACT OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N113110CC</classCode><className>TIMBER TRACT OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The impact is undeniable.</p><p>\"It's important to recognize that despite the destruction, wildfire is also an essential process in forest ecosystems,\" said Lori Daniels, professor of Forest Ecology and director of the Tree-Ring Lab at UBC in Vancouver. \"In the wildland-urban interface though they can be incredibly destructive. What is imperative is the adaptation of individuals and communities learning how to live with wildfire.\"</p><p>Kicking-off this year's Science in Society Speaker Serie s Wednesday, Oct. 4, the public is invited to hear Daniels present her long-term forest fire patterns research and hear her speak about forest resilience to climate change.</p><p>The presentation will take place at Okanagan College's Vernon campus in the lecture theatre at 7:30 p.m.</p><p>\"Wildfire is driven by climate, weather and fuels that vary among ecosystems and through time,\" said Daniels.</p><p>\"Combined, land-use change, fire exclusion and global warming have made many forests highly susceptible to intense fires that are difficult to control and spread to large sizes. Revolutionizing forest and fire management will improve ecosystem resilience to climate change, but we will not stop future fires from burning.\"</p><p>Daniels' research, published in leading academic journals, applies tree-ring analyses to investigate disturbance patterns and the impacts of climate and humans on forest dynamics.</p><p>Given her interests in conservation and sustainable resource management, much of her research has practical application and is collaborative with non-governmental organizations, government agencies and private companies.</p><p>Admission to the lecture is $7 in advance or $10 at the door.</p><p>For advanced tickets, call the Okanagan Science Centre at 250-545-3644 or purchase them online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.eventbrite.ca\">www.eventbrite.ca</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VERNON-3441552</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VERNON2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PK3-JN61-JDH3-G1H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"350\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Vernon Morning Star</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 2, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

But Waddington predicts the firefighters will need ongoing support and possible treatment for serious illnesses over the next 10 to 20 years.</p><p>\"Realistically, a lot of our guys, their lives are going to be shortened because of this incident,\" Waddington says bluntly. \"When you compound that with everything that we're going to have in our careers, we're definitely going to be in a high risk.\"</p><p>The fire spread into the oilsands capital on May 3 and forced more than 80,000 people to leave. It destroyed roughly 2,400 homes and other buildings - about one-tenth of the city. Firefighters were credited with saving the rest of the community.</p><p>Municipal crews were assisted in the following days by firefighters from other communities and wildland firefighters from across Canada and other countries - about 2,200 in all.</p><p>But the hometown crew was there first, working around the clock, when the forest fire morphed into an urban blaze and moved from timber to buildings with toxins in vinyl siding, treated lumber and furniture.</p><p>Firefighters \"would have been out there for long periods of time sucking in the smoke,\" says Fort McMurray fire Chief Darby Allen.</p><p>He explains that municipal firefighters normally wear a self-contained breathing apparatus. The air in the tanks might last up to an hour - enough time for going into a single house fire, but not for a marathon shift fighting flames consuming hundreds of homes.</p><p>\"We didn't have time to get back to the hall to charge (the tanks).\"</p><p>Forest crews sometimes wear particulate filter masks. Waddington says those P100 masks aren't stocked in large numbers at municipal fire stations. Pallets of them arrived a few days after the fire raced into the city.</p><p>But wearing such masks is a \"double-edge sword,\" Waddington says. The filters make it harder to breathe and can get plugged.</p><p>And the half-masks can cause safety glasses and visors to fog, says Jamie Coutts, fire chief of Slave Lake, Alta.</p><p>\"How do you wear that for six days?\" he says.</p><p>Coutts and 13 Slave Lake firefighters helped during the initial days of the Fort McMurray fire and he says he didn't get a filter mask.</p><p>He also didn't have one during a forest fire that spread into his town in 2011 and destroyed about 400 buildings.</p><p>In the months after that fire, members of the Slave Lake crew developed chest infections and nose and throat problems, Coutts says. He was diagnosed with asthma and later lung sarcoidosis, although he says the disease can't be directly linked to the fire.</p><p>After Coutts got home from Fort McMurray, he was coughing and wheezing again and couldn't run-up the stairs, he says.</p><p>\"I'm a firefighter. I've got a better-than-average chance of dying of cancer. It is what it is.\"</p><p>Coutts says experts need to come up with a better way to protect crews when forest fires move into urban area.</p><p>\"They're going to have to make better particulate masks.\"</p><p>Peter Krich, president of the Alberta Fire Chiefs Association, says his group may look at whether filter masks should be stocked in communities in forested areas.</p><p>The Fort McMurray fire was unusually large, Krich points out. \"You're not just fighting one fire. You're fighting two fires, three, four, five ... It was going on and on and you could never stop.\"</p><p>The challenge, he says, is that firefighters will do whatever it takes without thinking of their health.</p><p>\"We have to learn,\" he says. \"Hopefully we can ... be more prepared or help each other better in the event of something of this nature happening ever again.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2016071138825480</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K6V-DR31-F197-52DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

(CP) - The north-central Quebec village of Parent was eerie, dark and deserted today except for a handful of firefighters trying to control forest fires that turned day into night hundreds of kilometres away. \"We're doing what we can to save the village,'' said Gerard Lacasse, spokesman for Quebec's forest fire protection agency.</p><p>Thick, black smoke hovered over the province as far east as the Gaspe and so many calls were made to emergency services, firefighters, police and government officies across the province that authorities could not respond to real emergencies Monday night and provincial police issued a call for calm.</p><p>On Monday afternoon, the smoke darkened the sky so much over Roberval - on Lac-St-Jean 250 kilometres to the east - that it triggered the town's automated street lights and residents had to drive with their headlights on.</p><p>The 500 residents of Parent - located on the CN railway line from Abitibi to the St. Maurice valley - were forced to leave Monday but \"there are 20 firemen still there trying to make sure they have homes to come back to,'' Lacasse said.</p><p>He said the nearest fire, which had destroyed 400 square kilometres, was still out of control and was closer to the village.</p><p>\"It seems to have slowed down a bit,'' he said.</p><p>\"The winds have changed and the weather is cooler.

In mountain communities east of Los Angeles, calmer conditions aided firefighters on the lines of a suspected arson wildfire that forced thousands to flee.</p><p>California Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday issued emergency proclamations in both Riverside County in the south and Shasta County in the north. The declarations authorize the state to rally resources to local government.</p><p>In the north, new evacuations were ordered for communities in the wilderness recreation region near Whiskeytown Lake as that wildfire tripled in size to more than 80 square kilometres. It had already forced residents out of French Gulch.</p><p>French Gulch resident Raquel Hines said she had two hours to evacuate and that others in the former mining town had as little as 30 minutes to leave. The community has faced two wildfires in the last two weeks, Hines said.</p><p>\"It's terrifying. You know you're frightened a little bit because you don't know if you're going to come back to your house and the town is going to be different,\" she told KRCR-TV.</p><p>Hundreds of kilometres to the south, winds were absent over the fire in Southern California's San Jacinto Mountains. But temperatures were rapidly rising, and forecasters said highs could hit 38 C. They also warned of possible afternoon wind gusts that could create dangerous fire conditions.</p><p>Elsewhere in the state, a huge forest fire continued to grow outside Yosemite National Park. A total of 100 homes were still considered under threat in the San Francisco Bay community of Clayton, although firefighters had stopped the progress of a small fire there after one house burned.</p><p>The blaze in the San Jacinto Mountains erupted Wednesday and quickly turned into a wall of flame that torched timber and tinder-dry brush. In a matter of hours, it grew to 19 square kilometres.</p><p>About 3,200 people in the town of Idyllwild and nearby communities were ordered to evacuate. An estimated 600 homes were threatened.</p><p>The fire was the largest of at least five that police believe were purposely set Wednesday by a man whose car was reportedly spotted at the starting point of the blaze in Riverside County, officials said.</p><p>Brandon N. McGlover, 32, of Temecula was booked on suspicion of five counts of arson, state fire officials said. It wasn't clear whether he had an attorney.</p><p>Authorities ordered residents to leave Idyllwild and several neighbouring communities, home to about 12,000 people.</p><p>!@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

tragic airplane crash this summer has delayed completion of an aerial geography mapping project for the Okanagan Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Okanagan Basin Water Board had enlisted a radar technology tool called LiDAR to create digital three-dimensional aerial imaging data to accurately map the valley landscape.</p><p>The $600,000 project, contracted out to the Port Coquitlam firm Eagle Mapping, was expected to provide valuable data that can help community planners, government environment management officials and First Nations communities how to better respond to landscape changes caused by global warming and to both better enhance flood protection and prevention measures along with better development planning by valley communities near sensitive ecosystems and floodplains.</p><p>The environment ministry had embarked on similar mapping exercises on Vancouver Island and the Interior this year as part of a larger $1.45 million program.</p><p>RELATED: Floodplain mapping program launched</p><p>But the Okanagan project suffered a setback when the Eagle Mapping LiDAR technician and his pilot were killed in an airplane crash while conducting another aerial survey assignment in the Kannanaskis region of Alberta in August.</p><p>Anna Warwick Sears, executive director of the OBWB, said she wasn't made aware of the aviation mishapuntil almost 10 days after it happened as the aerial mapping project was being coordinated by the ministry of environment office in Victoria.</p><p>Along with the two fatalities, the camera gear used on the plane was also damaged in the crash, as recovery efforts to save the camera-recorded data is still underway.</p><p>\"There was a significant amount of data on the plane cameras related to our project when the plane went down,\" she said.</p><p>RELATED: Better preparing for weather events in Okanagan communities</p><p>Adding to the complications was the heavy forest fire smoke filling the skies across the region for much of August, making any flights unable to continue due to limited aerial photography visibility.</p><p>\"What we had enough imaging of the floodplain mapping aspect on the valley bottom, but there were a bunch more things we hoped to do with LiDAR for the whole watershed such as mapping slope stability, understanding the quality of the watershed, evaluate forest canopy&amp;#8230;there are so many things you can do with this three-dimensional imaging,\" Warwick Sears said.</p><p>\"The ironic thing is we are doing the floodplain mapping because of the impacts of climate change, but one aspect of climate change is forests fires, with the smoke getting in the way of completing the project.\"</p><p>Warwick Sears said her hope is that work will reconvene next spring when the snow is melted.</p><p>\"It's been a challenging project with the different weather conditions and the tragic accident but we are slowly making our way through it and it will eventually all come together,\" she said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:barry.gerding@blackpress.caLike\">barry.gerding@blackpress.caLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on

Last weekend, when French River Provincial Park and Henvey Inlet First Nation were being evacuated and massive fires raged, others were enjoying a campfire.</p><p>\"We had to visit a number people ... having their little fires outside their houses and cottages,\" said McDougall fire chief Brian Leduc.</p><p>Some, he said, claimed ignorance of the ban or believed that the bit of moisture that did come was enough to lift the ban. A couple are being charged under the municipal bylaw with a Type III summons to Provincial Offences Act court.</p><p>Until now, the township hasn't had firefighters patrolling to ensure compliance with fire bans for about 13 years.</p><p>\"We did it last weekend too, but we haven't had to do it for a while because we haven't had a fire season where the fire index has been (at high or extreme) for an extended period,\" he said.</p><p>It's a similar story in Whitestone Township, where charges are also being laid for campfires.</p><p>\"We're still catching the odd person having a campfire,\" said Whitestone chief Bob Whitman. \"They are saying they didn't know there was a fire ban in place.\"</p><p>That, despite signs at the municipality's entry points announcing the ban, including on the road to a common camping area on Crown land.</p><p>Even in the Town of Parry Sound firefighters have been called about campfires over the last week, but charges are yet to be laid.</p><p>The region's firefighters now have their eyes on the sky hoping for the right kind of rain, but not lightning.</p><p>\"Lightning without rain will be a real problem for the area,\" said Parry Sound Fire Chief Dave Thompson. \"Best situation would be for a few days of steady light rain.

He has already cut civil service jobs by eight per cent through attrition and has ordered Crown agencies to reduce management positions.</p><p>Some 13,000 civil servants have been protected from outright layoffs by a special clause the NDP agreed to in the last five-year collective agreement. That deal expires in March, and the Manitoba Government and General Employees' Union expects the axe could fall on many workers.</p><p>\"Our members themselves are very nervous and very scared of what is going to happen,\" union president Michelle Gawronsky said.</p><p>\"These people have mortgages to pay and they've got children to feed.\"</p><p>The government already has served notice about a small number of potential layoffs for when the collective agreement expires - up to 11 workers in real estate services, up to eight employees in government translation services and some others.</p><p>Pallister said the layoffs are a small fraction of the provincial workforce and spending restraint is needed to end years of red ink that led to two credit downgrades by bond-rating agencies.</p><p>The province's annual deficits have dropped, but this year's is forecast to come in at $518 million. Rising interest rates and uncertainty over global trade agreements are also threats, Pallister said.</p><p>\"Apart from management trim at the top of the organization, there's been virtually no layoffs,\" the premier said.</p><p>\"Any Manitoban who has to manage money and has to get value out of their paycheque will appreciate the fact that this is a government that is keeping its word and stabilizing our finances in the province.\"</p><p>Gawronsky said Pallister also made promises to protect front-line jobs and services. Since the 2016 election, some hospital emergency rooms have closed, services such as forest-fire water bombers have been privatized and subsidies for things such as  chiropractic care have been reduced.</p><p>\"It was a promise this premier and his government made, that they were going to ... protect the services Manitobans rely on,\" she said.</p><p>\"We're not seeing that in any way, shape or form.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-344383c492a540d9bcb9f9b3da6b23f2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V31-Y8W1-JBVR-341F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 29, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In mountain communities east of Los Angeles, calmer conditions aided firefighters on the lines of a suspected arson wildfire that forced thousands to flee.</p><p>California Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday issued emergency proclamations in both Riverside County in the south and Shasta County in the north. The declarations authorize the state to rally resources to local government.</p><p>In the north, new evacuations were ordered for communities in the wilderness recreation region near Whiskeytown Lake as that wildfire tripled in size to more than 80 square kilometres. It had already forced residents out of French Gulch.</p><p>French Gulch resident Raquel Hines said she had two hours to evacuate and that others in the former mining town had as little as 30 minutes to leave. The community has faced two wildfires in the last two weeks, Hines said.</p><p>\"It's terrifying. You know you're frightened a little bit because you don't know if you're going to come back to your house and the town is going to be different,\" she told KRCR-TV.</p><p>Hundreds of kilometres to the south, winds were absent over the fire in Southern California's San Jacinto Mountains. But temperatures were rapidly rising, and forecasters said highs could hit 38 C. They also warned of possible afternoon wind gusts that could create dangerous fire conditions.</p><p>Elsewhere in the state, a huge forest fire continued to grow outside Yosemite National Park. A total of 100 homes were still considered under threat in the San Francisco Bay community of Clayton, although firefighters had stopped the progress of a small fire there after one house burned.</p><p>The blaze in the San Jacinto Mountains erupted Wednesday and quickly turned into a wall of flame that torched timber and tinder-dry brush. In a matter of hours, it grew to 19 square kilometres.</p><p>About 3,200 people in the town of Idyllwild and nearby communities were ordered to evacuate. An estimated 600 homes were threatened.</p><p>The fire was the largest of at least five that police believe were purposely set Wednesday by a man whose car was reportedly spotted at the starting point of the blaze in Riverside County, officials said.</p><p>Brandon N. McGlover, 32, of Temecula was booked on suspicion of five counts of arson, state fire officials said. It wasn't clear whether he had an attorney.</p><p>Authorities ordered residents to leave Idyllwild and several neighbouring communities, home to about 12,000 people.</p><p>!@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

tragic airplane crash this summer has delayed completion of an aerial geography mapping project for the Okanagan Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Okanagan Basin Water Board had enlisted a radar technology tool called LiDAR to create digital three-dimensional aerial imaging data to accurately map the valley landscape.</p><p>The $600,000 project, contracted out to the Port Coquitlam firm Eagle Mapping, was expected to provide valuable data that can help community planners, government environment management officials and First Nations communities how to better respond to landscape changes caused by global warming and to both better enhance flood protection and prevention measures along with better development planning by valley communities near sensitive ecosystems and floodplains.</p><p>The environment ministry had embarked on similar mapping exercises on Vancouver Island and the Interior this year as part of a larger $1.45 million program.</p><p>RELATED: Floodplain mapping program launched</p><p>But the Okanagan project suffered a setback when the Eagle Mapping LiDAR technician and his pilot were killed in an airplane crash while conducting another aerial survey assignment in the Kannanaskis region of Alberta in August.</p><p>Anna Warwick Sears, executive director of the OBWB, said she wasn't made aware of the aviation mishapuntil almost 10 days after it happened as the aerial mapping project was being coordinated by the ministry of environment office in Victoria.</p><p>Along with the two fatalities, the camera gear used on the plane was also damaged in the crash, as recovery efforts to save the camera-recorded data is still underway.</p><p>\"There was a significant amount of data on the plane cameras related to our project when the plane went down,\" she said.</p><p>RELATED: Better preparing for weather events in Okanagan communities</p><p>Adding to the complications was the heavy forest fire smoke filling the skies across the region for much of August, making any flights unable to continue due to limited aerial photography visibility.</p><p>\"What we had enough imaging of the floodplain mapping aspect on the valley bottom, but there were a bunch more things we hoped to do with LiDAR for the whole watershed such as mapping slope stability, understanding the quality of the watershed, evaluate forest canopy&amp;#8230;there are so many things you can do with this three-dimensional imaging,\" Warwick Sears said.</p><p>\"The ironic thing is we are doing the floodplain mapping because of the impacts of climate change, but one aspect of climate change is forests fires, with the smoke getting in the way of completing the project.\"</p><p>Warwick Sears said her hope is that work will reconvene next spring when the snow is melted.</p><p>\"It's been a challenging project with the different weather conditions and the tragic accident but we are slowly making our way through it and it will eventually all come together,\" she said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:barry.gerding@blackpress.caLike\">barry.gerding@blackpress.caLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on

Both the Crown and the defence had asked for leniency.</p><p>Halford, who is 35, entered guilty pleas last year on seven counts of fraud. She had claimed that she had aggressive breast cancer and that she and her family had lost everything in the 2016 Fort McMurray forest fire.

The smoke-filled sky shrouded the town in darkness before turning an unnerving shade of bright red.</p><p>Australia's annual wildfire season, which peaks during the Southern Hemisphere summer, started early after an unusually warm and dry winter. Record-breaking heat and windy conditions triggered devastating wildfires in New South Wales and Queensland states in September.</p><p>About 5 million hectares (12.35 million acres) of land have burned nationwide over the past few months, with 12 people confirmed dead and more than 1,000 homes destroyed. Nearly 100 fires were burning across the state of New South Wales, which is home to Sydney.</p><p>New South Wales state Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said this wildfire season is the worst on record and painted a bleak long-term picture.</p><p>\"We've seen extraordinary fire behaviour,\" he said Tuesday. \"What we really need is meaningful rain, and we haven't got anything in the forecast at the moment that says we're going to get drought-breaking or fire-quenching rainfall.\"</p><p>The wildfire crisis has reignited debate about whether Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative government has taken enough action on climate change. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas.</p><p>Morrison, whom critics have deemed a climate change skeptic, conceded earlier this month that \"climate change along with many other factors\" has contributed to the wildfires.</p><p>The prime minister took criticism for going on a family vacation to Hawaii in December during the crisis. He eventually cut his trip short and publicly apologized.</p><p>Late Tuesday, Mallacoota was saved by changes of wind direction, but authorities said \"numerous\" homes were lost. Residents returning home were urged to boil tap water before drinking it. Forest Fire Management Victoria said the wildfires had put heavy demands on tap water that is affecting the supply of water.</p><p>Stranded residents and vacationers were reported to be sleeping in cars on New Year's Eve, while gas stations and surf clubs transformed into evacuation areas.</p><p>Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews had earlier announced plans to evacuate the trapped people by sea. There were grave fears for four missing people. \"We can't confirm their whereabouts,\" Andrews told reporters Tuesday.</p><p>Andrews has requested assistance from 70 firefighters from the United States and Canada, while Australia's military sent air and sea reinforcements.</p><p>Victoria Emergency Services Commissioner Andrew Crisp confirmed \"significant\" property losses across the region. More than 115 communities across Victoria remained under emergency warnings Tuesday night.</p><p>Some communities cancelled New Year's fireworks celebrations, but Sydney's popular display over its iconic harbour controversially went ahead in front of more than a million revelers. The city was granted an exemption to a total fireworks ban in place there and elsewhere to prevent new wildfires.</p><p>Fire conditions in Victoria and New South Wales worsened after oppressive heat Monday mixed with strong winds and lightning.</p><p>Police in New South Wales said Tuesday that two men - a 63-year-old father and 29-year-old son - died in a house in the wildfire-ravaged southeast town of Cobargo, and a 72-year-old man remained missing.</p><p>\"They were obviously trying to do their best with the fire as it came through in the early hours of the morning,\" New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said. \"The other person that we are trying to get to, we think that person was trying to defend their property in the early hours of the morning.\"</p><p>On Monday, a firefighter was killed when extreme winds flipped his truck. Samuel McPaul, 28, was the third volunteer firefighter in New South Wales to have died in the past two weeks. He was an expectant father.</p><p>More than 130 fires remain burning across New South Wales, with five at an emergency level. Authorities warned that power would be out for 24 hours along the fire-ravaged south coast of the state.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-1461c95d002ff54474b54cb9376b8b0b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XW3-9761-DY9S-T0C7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"739\"/><timeReceived>01:16 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 31, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Last weekend, when French River Provincial Park and Henvey Inlet First Nation were being evacuated and massive fires raged, others were enjoying a campfire.</p><p>\"We had to visit a number people...having their little fires outside their houses and cottages,\" said McDougall fire chief Brian Leduc.</p><p>Some, he said, claimed ignorance of the ban or believed that the bit of moisture that did come was enough to lift the ban. A couple are being charged under the municipal bylaw with a Type III summons to Provincial Offences Act court.</p><p>Until now, the township hasn't had firefighters patrolling to ensure compliance with fire bans for about 13 years.</p><p>\"We did it last weekend too, but we haven't had to do it for a while because we haven't had a fire season where the fire index has been (at high or extreme) for an extended period,\" he said.</p><p>It's a similar story in Whitestone Township, where charges are also being laid for campfires.</p><p>\"We're still catching the odd person having a campfire,\" said Whitestone chief Bob Whitman. \"They are saying they didn't know there was a fire ban in place.\"</p><p>That, despite signs at the municipality's entry points announcing the ban, including on the road to a common camping area on Crown land.</p><p>Even in the Town of Parry Sound firefighters have been called about campfires over the last week, but charges are yet to be laid.</p><p>The region's firefighters now have their eyes on the sky hoping for the right kind of rain, but not lightning.</p><p>\"Lightning without rain will be a real problem for the area,\" said Parry Sound Fire Chief Dave Thompson. \"Best situation would be for a few days of steady light rain. Any rain we get will not penetrate enough to assist with the fire hazard unless it is a slow, steady rain. A quick heavy thunderstorm will just have the water run off the surface and will not penetrate into the ground.\"</p><p>In the town of Parry Sound there was rain Tuesday afternoon with more forecasted for Thursday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018072446946617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SWP-S491-JDH3-G54B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"416\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

In 1967, the first ATM -automatic teller machine -was installed at a branch of Barclays PLC in a north London suburb. In 1972, one of the most sensational player signings in hockey history took place. Superstar left winger Bobby Hull left the NHL's Chicago Blackhawks to join the Winnipeg Jets of the fledgling World Hockey Association. In 1978, responding to reports of a forest fire, volunteer firefighters from Lac-des-Loups, Quebec raced towards a plume of smoke on the horizon. When the smoke kept moving away from them, they realized they were chasing a tornado. In 1984, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was named the 1984 winner of the Albert Einstein peace prize for his global campaign to ease East-West tensions.</p><p>In 1986, Jean Drapeau announced he would not seek a ninth term as Montreal's mayor. He had held office for nearly 30 years, bringing the city its subway system, Expo '67, major league baseball and the 1976 Olympics.</p><p>In 1986, Irish voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to lift a ban on divorce.

The family-owned aviation company, based in Port Alberni, has been working on converting six Boeing 737 passenger airplanes into dual-purpose aerial firefighting tankers and passenger aircraft. The FireLiners include a 4,000-gallon capacity for water or retardant and 66 seats for moving fire personnel.</p><p>READ: Coulson Aviation's first 737 jets arrive in Port Alberni</p><p>This project, said Qualtrough, is putting Canada at the forefront of the aerial firefighting industry.</p><p>\"Port Albern is at the centre of Canada's forest industry,\" she said on Thursday. \"With forests come the risk of forest fire. That means that Coulson is geographically well-situated to design, develop and manufacture the aerial firefighting technology of the future.\"</p><p>Wayne Coulson, president and CEO, introduced the first FireLiner of the fleet on Thursday. The new aircraft finished all of its flight-testing in the U.S. and will be in Australia within a week, where it has picked up a five-year contract. It will be the first 737 ever used in fire suppression.</p><p>\"This has never been done before,\" said Qualtrough. \"This innovative project will solve a real problem and increase efficiency by providing the ability to deliver both fire retardant and firefighting personnel at the same time.\"</p><p>Coulson said the eventual goal is to have the crafts fighting fires in British Columbia.</p><p>\"Hopefully at some point in time, we'd like to get them back here at home in B.C.,\" he said.</p><p>This new investment by the federal government, said Qualtrough, will create up to 15 new jobs, while maintaining 73 more in Port Alberni. Coulson Aviation will also continue to partner with post-secondary institutions for the \"local development of skilled aerospace workers.\"</p><p>Coulson thanked the City of Port Alberni and the Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District for their support on Thursday. It is because of the region's airport, which reopened last year after an $8 million expansion, that the 737s were able to land on the new runway.</p><p>Mayor Mike Ruttan said on Thursday that this is exactly what the region was hoping for in its new airport when the expansion was announced.</p><p>\"This couldn't have happened without all of us working together,\" he added.</p><p>PROGRESS 2017: Expanded airport means economic growth in Port Alberni</p><p>Although Coulson Group of Companies also operates the famed Martin Mars air tankers&amp;#8212;the largest water bombers in the world&amp;#8212;Coulson chose not to speak to the Mars bombers on Thursday.</p><p>READ: Martin Mars waterbombers' firefighting days are past: Coulson</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:elena.rardon@albernivalleynews.com\">elena.rardon@albernivalleynews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLDNWS-3677296</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLDNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TGD-NHN1-F103-34M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438289</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Goldstream News Gazette</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 12, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

COWEN</nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New evidence suggests wildfires are a wild card in climate change. The chemical junk that forest fires spew into the air might affect atmospheric chemistry in a manner similar to -- and on a scale similar to -- the impact of sulfurous chemicals from volcanic eruptions. This further complicates the complex challenge scientists face in trying to understand what's happening to Earth's climate.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>Christian Science Monitor News Service</p></bodyText></section><p>Volcanic debris moving through the lower atmosphere washes out fairly quickly. But chemicals that reach the stratosphere spread around the world. They undergo reactions that produce a pall of sulfuric acid droplets. This haze reflects some incoming sunlight and cools the underlying atmosphere. The effect of a single eruption can last for several years.</p><p>Scientists have known that forest-fire smoke also spreads widely. But they haven't realized how high it can reach. Now Michael Fromm with Computational Physics in Springfield, Va., and Rene Servranckx with the Meteorological Service of Canada in Montreal have found that it, too, penetrates the stratosphere. They published their evidence last week in Geophysical Research Letters.</p><p>They show that dense smoke from a 2001 Canadian forest fire reached into the lower stratosphere. There the fire chemicals caused \"atmospheric effects similar to those seen during a volcanic eruption,\" according to the paper's announcement. It notes that powerful updrafts in so-called \"supercell\" thunderstorms can carry wildfire debris to stratospheric heights where it can \"affect environmental conditions, including cloud formation and climate change.\"</p><p>There can be more than a copycat relationship between wildfires and volcanoes. Writing in the same issue of Geophysical Research Letters, Baerbel Langmann and Hans Graf at Germany's Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg explain how Indonesian forest fires extend the volcanic-climate impact. Even when quiescent, Indonesian volcanoes emit sulfurous gases constantly. Rains settle these chemicals into the soil of the local peat forests. When the dry season comes, the dried-out peat often catches fire, releasing the sulfur-containing chemicals back into the atmosphere. Once there, thunderstorms can lift them to the stratosphere.</p><p>Scientists are only beginning to understand the role of wildfires in climate change. Yet two points are clear. Their influence on climate is more subtle than scientists have realized. Moreover, Drs. Fromm and Servrance suggest it is likely to grow as warming temperatures encourage more fire outbreaks in high northern latitudes.</p><p>Second, there is a significant difference between the volcanic and forest-fire wild cards. We can't control volcanic eruptions. We can minimize wildfires. Many fires result from human carelessness or outmoded slash-and-burn farming. Lack of proper forest maintenance also encourages conflagrations. It may be difficult to do such maintenance in remote parts of high latitude northern forests. Yet in many other areas, such as the Western United States where fires now rage, there is no excuse to delay fire management planning.</p><p>Protection of forest resources and the lives and property of forest dwellers is reason enough to raise the status of forest fire management on the list of national and international priorities. Concern about climate change should enhance the sense of urgency.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: CANADIAN PRESS; Debris in a lumber mill continues to smolder after a forest fire burned the mill in Barriere, B.C., Sunday.

Even higher temperatures are expected on Friday, where areas in the south could see peaks of 42 to 44 degrees Celsius.Meteo France said France's all-time record could be broken -- an August 12, 2003 reading of 44.1 degrees Celsius in Saint-Christol-les-Ales and Conqueyrac in the southern Gard region.Saturday is expected to be the hottest day for the Paris region with temperatures between 38-40 degrees Celsius expected.Temperatures are expected to fall next week but will still remain well above the norms for this time of the year.French hotel group Accor said it would open up its air-conditioned lobbies to the elderly until Saturday to ensure their wellbeing. There has been no coordinated shutdown of schools but some have closed in parts of France, while others advised parents to keep children at home.Schools in Paris will stay open until the end of the week when the summer holidays will begin, city authorities said.In the wider Paris region, authorities have shut some primary schools including in Essonne where around 59 educational institutions have closed.- Increasing probability -The increase in temperature has also led to a build-up of pollution in already clogged cities, in particular the gas ozone.In Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Strasbourg, authorities have banned the most-polluting cars from the roads.Scientists warn that global warming linked to human fossil fuel use could make such scorchers more frequent.\"Global temperatures are increasing due to climate change,\" said Len Shaffrey, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.\"The global rise in temperatures means the probability that an extreme heatwave will occur is also increasing.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO100903156164096115325176900104</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF7-WHV1-F03R-N484-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"642\"/><timeReceived>1:09 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 27, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0006HX8</classCode><className>ACCOR SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0008YO2</classCode><className>FRANCE 2 SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS722511 FULL-SERVICE RESTAURANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS721110 HOTELS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS) &amp;

The family-owned aviation company, based in Port Alberni, has been working on converting six Boeing 737 passenger airplanes into dual-purpose aerial firefighting tankers and passenger aircraft. The FireLiners include a 4,000-gallon capacity for water or retardant and 66 seats for moving fire personnel.</p><p>READ: Coulson Aviation's first 737 jets arrive in Port Alberni</p><p>This project, said Qualtrough, is putting Canada at the forefront of the aerial firefighting industry.</p><p>\"Port Albern is at the centre of Canada's forest industry,\" she said on Thursday. \"With forests come the risk of forest fire. That means that Coulson is geographically well-situated to design, develop and manufacture the aerial firefighting technology of the future.\"</p><p>Wayne Coulson, president and CEO, introduced the first FireLiner of the fleet on Thursday. The new aircraft finished all of its flight-testing in the U.S. and will be in Australia within a week, where it has picked up a five-year contract. It will be the first 737 ever used in fire suppression.</p><p>\"This has never been done before,\" said Qualtrough. \"This innovative project will solve a real problem and increase efficiency by providing the ability to deliver both fire retardant and firefighting personnel at the same time.\"</p><p>Coulson said the eventual goal is to have the crafts fighting fires in British Columbia.</p><p>\"Hopefully at some point in time, we'd like to get them back here at home in B.C.,\" he said.</p><p>This new investment by the federal government, said Qualtrough, will create up to 15 new jobs, while maintaining 73 more in Port Alberni. Coulson Aviation will also continue to partner with post-secondary institutions for the \"local development of skilled aerospace workers.\"</p><p>Coulson thanked the City of Port Alberni and the Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District for their support on Thursday. It is because of the region's airport, which reopened last year after an $8 million expansion, that the 737s were able to land on the new runway.</p><p>Mayor Mike Ruttan said on Thursday that this is exactly what the region was hoping for in its new airport when the expansion was announced.</p><p>\"This couldn't have happened without all of us working together,\" he added.</p><p>PROGRESS 2017: Expanded airport means economic growth in Port Alberni</p><p>Although Coulson Group of Companies also operates the famed Martin Mars air tankers&amp;#8212;the largest water bombers in the world&amp;#8212;Coulson chose not to speak to the Mars bombers on Thursday.</p><p>READ: Martin Mars waterbombers' firefighting days are past: Coulson</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:elena.rardon@albernivalleynews.com\">elena.rardon@albernivalleynews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PARKQB-3677036</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PARKQB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TG6-PYV1-JDH1-C32R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438316</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Parksville Qualicum Beach</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 11, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

As well, there is heavy wildlife activity, and it is considered of significant importance to the surrounding community.</p><p>Working with the FPInnovations Forest Operations group, the City is utilizing funding from Forest Enhancement Society of BC to enable this project, which will ultimately contribute to the understanding of fuel loading effects and potential fire behaviour, as well as the maintenance of fuel management units over time using prescribed fire.</p><p>Steven Havengaard and Marian Marinescu from FPInnovations were on-site Sept. 24-27 to establish nine permanent plots over the 20-hectare area (Unit 14 AB). The test plots will capture baseline data on fibre type, stand structure, fuel loading, duff layer and soil type characteristics.</p><p>Two members of the Kluskus Band were assisting with the sampling, so that there is the option of them carrying on the work in the future.</p><p>Havengaard says they are looking at a variety of fuels that contribute to fire spreading, including the organic materials lying on the forest floor; ground fuels like roots; ladder fuels that contribute to fire spreading up from the ground to the tree's crown, like tall shrubs and bark flakes; and crown heights.</p><p>\"These are all the different things that can contribute to fuel behaviour, so trying to quantify, qualify those different fuel layers and trying to evaluate how those are going to contribute to potential fire behaviour, that is essentially what we're doing,\" he said. \"There are some fire behaviour models ... Those are really good tools, but we really need to rely on an intuitive evaluation of this fuel environment as well. They both go hand-in-hand. We need to take a close look at all those elements of that fuel environment and how they all interact and contribute to the overall fire behaviour.\"</p><p>Fuel management (selective logging) operations began Sept. 27, with Freya Logging Inc. and Seneca Enterprises Ltd. from Prince George partnering to do the harvesting.</p><p>The contractors are using a single grip harvester to directional fall, de-limb and cut to length on the spot. The single grip harvester is also equipped to pickup, load, and transfer most of the debris left from harvesting and remove it from the treatment area.</p><p>The FPInnovations Forest Operations group will carry out a time-study on the productivity of the equipment, falling and extracting in hopes of documenting the removal of fibre and the associated costs.</p><p>This research project will be able to contribute to methods for predicting fire effects from on-site fuels - using pre-harvest and post-harvest debris load inventory. As well, it will help contribute to the understanding of fuel loading on the amount of smoke and the amount of soil heating from prescribed fires, enable the development of additional tools to describe fuels for fire management and contribute to understanding the productivity of harvesting, processing and fuel management methods.</p><p>Erin Robinson, the City's Forestry Initiatives Manager, says this work will help the City identify how to maintain fuel management.</p><p>During the selective harvesting, most of the big fir trees will be retained - as long as there are no forest health issues - and the area will end up looking park-like, she explained, noting the City will create a multi-use recreational trail after the project is completed.</p><p>READ MORE: Quesnel's new Forestry Initiatives Program up and running</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editor@quesnelobserver.comLike\">editor@quesnelobserver.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-3880746</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X70-78D1-JDH1-C3FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Quesnel Cariboo Observer</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 6, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001475</classCode><className>RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But it turned again Monday and only a canyon separated the fire from homes in the heavily wooded area.</p><p>The fire ballooned to 900 hectares Monday from 500 Sunday in high winds, searing heat and low humidity.</p><p>\"We are so much at the mercy of the weather,'' said spokeswoman Wendy Stewart of the Forest Service.</p><p>The hot, dry conditions heightened the forest fire flashpoint in British Columbia where authorities say if present weather persists it could be a costly summer.</p><p>Hardest hit is the southern Interior, where temperatures are in the high 30s and humidity in the 25 per cent range.</p><p>Thunderstorms, which because of lightning strikes produce more new fires rather than dampening existing ones, swept through the area overnight along with gusting winds.</p><p>Forecasts for the rest of the week call for more of the same in the hardest-hit fire zones but with temperatures easing slightly.</p><p>\"It was an average summer for forest fires until we got this blitz of high temperatures and low humidity,'' Sylvia Pang, spokeswoman for the B.C. Forest Service, said from Victoria.</p><p>\"Hopefully it won't continue, otherwise it will be a bad year.''</p><p>Pang said there were 168 fires burning throughout the province on Monday, up from 129 Sunday and including 147 new fires in the last four days.</p><p>So far, 1,051 fires have charred more than 4,200 hectares and cost $12 million to fight. About 750 fires burned 2,650 hectares by this time last year.</p><p>A fire near Lac Le Jeune, a resort area 40 minutes' drive south of Kamloops, became the province's latest hot spot Monday, joining a blaze in the Coast Range, 200 kilometres east of Vancouver, and the Penticton fire.</p><p>\"Basically a wall of fire was the way it was moving,'' Kathy Danchuk of the Forest Service said, describing how the Lac Le Jeune fire quickly expanded to more than 300 hectares through high-elevation spruce and balsam.</p><p>Property owners at the lake were put on evacuation alert but the blaze died down overnight, enabling crews to attack it.</p><p>\"The heat of the day will recharge the fire,'' Danchuk said. \"It's doubtful we'll contain it (Monday).''</p><p>A cattleman and his ranchhand were told to leave but stayed and built fireguards around their buildings. Livestock were seen along a hydro right-of-way later swept by the inferno.</p><p>Another fire got away in mountainous terrain near Coalmont, east of Princeton on the southern edge of the province.</p><p>\"The fire built up enough heat that it became uncontrollable,'' said spokesman Larry Johnston, who saw the blaze expand to 250 hectares from 60 on Sunday and become so hot fire crews were pulled out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199407250299</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1994</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:470N-T7H0-01G6-82F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"610\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1994 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"1994\"><dateText>July 25, 1994 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><className>FOREST SERVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>\u00a0B C FOREST SERVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLYR</classCode><className>PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N721110MM</classCode><className>RESORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GX055</classCode><className>VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(CP) - The winds blew, the sleeping giant stirred, but the fire guards containing the stubborn Salmon Arm blaze held into today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 63-square-kilometre forest fire burning in the mountains surrounding this idyllic city on the shores of Shuswap Lake did jump to life as 40 kilometre an hour winds fanned it beginning in the late afternoon Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">-BODY- \"So far the fire guard has held,'' said Mitzi Bushell, a B.C. Forest Service spokeswoman said Friday night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There were a few spots where the fire got outside the guard, but we have tons of manpower up there watching for them and they jump on them as soon as they happen.</p><p>\"It looks good.''</p><p>Bushell said the today's weather forecast called for a return to light winds. Temperatures were expected to remain in the high 20s or low 30s with no rain.</p><p>Sunday could be the day residents and firefighters have been waiting for for more than two weeks because there is a strong chance of rain.</p><p>A cold front blew through the area, 500 kilometres east of Vancouver, in the late afternoon. Winds picked up, reaching gusts of up to 40 kilometres an hour. So while the smoke swirled above the city and orange dots danced on the slops, its fire-weary residents hunkered down for what they hoped would be a quiet late summer weekend.</p><p>The wind, which lasted well into the night, combined with searing 35C heat made for tough conditions Friday for firefighters, who continued to extinguish hot spots.</p><p>Several new fires were also reported in the East Kootenay region and south of Revelstoke, but none were threatening communities. In addition to the 300 firefighters, including 100 soldiers on the ground, two massive Martin Mars waterbombers, 14 helicopters and more than 100 pieces of heavy equipment are battling the Salmon Arm fire.</p><p>While residents have praised those efforts, many are starting to question why the fire ever got to this stage.</p><p>Donna Mason, who manages a houseboat rental company, said residents - especially those who lost homes - deserve an explanation from the government.</p><p>Mason's business has been largely unaffected by the fire, except for a cancellation Friday because the client's children are asthmatic.</p><p>She is hoping the fire doesn't have a long-term effect on the all-important tourist trade in the area.</p><p>\"It's definitely not going to be as pretty as it was, seeing as Salmon Arm is surrounded by the three mountains that were on fire,'' she said.</p><p>\"They were beautiful, luscious and green and that's not going to be there next spring.''</p><p>Mason, who had to flee her home earlier this week, said Salmon Arm showed superior community spirit during the evacuation and she expects that will carry the city as it recovers.</p><p>\"But there's certainly a lot of question of why this fire got out of control.''</p><p>Bushell said there is an independent review of how every fire is handled.</p><p>Meanwhile, Peter Kilby, the evacuation co-ordinator for the fire operation, said he's pleased with the level of readiness of emergency personnel if another move order has to be issued.</p><p>But he's concerned that some people in the city of 15,000 are dropping their guard.</p><p>He said the community remains on evacuation alert and officials spent Friday reminding people in the areas most at risk to remain ready to move at a moment's notice.</p><p>\"We have a concern there are a lot of people who've had a couple of nights on the couch with their feet up and a Coors in their hand watching television,'' said Kilby. About 20 rural homes were destroyed by the flames last week.</p><p>The fire situation east of Salmon Arm also deteriorated late Friday.</p><p>Forest Service spokeswoman Karyn Zuidinga said the areas south of Invermere in the East Kootenay and Nakusp - south of Revelstoke - had received a large number of lightning strikes.</p><p>\"We have a developing situation,'' she said from Castlegar, B.C. \"We've got a lot of fires being reported.''</p><p>Fires also continued to burn in northwestern Alberta, parts of Saskatchewan and Northern Ontario.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199808150013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4701-3B70-01G6-8127-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"657\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>August 15, 1998 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>AB C COMMUNICATIONS CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLYR</classCode><className>PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001734</classCode><className>TOURISM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX055</classCode><className>VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

A forest fire was raging north of Cottbus, the second-largest city in Brandenburg state. Police said it could take days to put out the blaze in an area that was just recovering from a fire in 2018. The fire was deemed especially dangerous due to the risk of unexploded ammunition left in the area, which is home to a military training facility.- 'Hell is coming' -In Spain, TV weather presenter Silvia Laplana riffed on the doom-filled catchphrase \"Winter is coming\" from the blockbuster Game of Thrones franchise to describe what lay in store for the country. </p><p>\"El infierno (hell) is coming,\" she tweeted alongside a weather map which showed most of the country coloured scarlet later in the week. \"Of course it's hot in summer but when you have a heatwave that is so extensive and intense, during which records are forecast to be beaten, it's NOT normal,\" she tweeted.Temperatures are expected to be particularly sweltering in the northeast, with a stifling 45 degrees expected Friday in the northeastern city of Girona, and 44 degrees in Zaragoza at the weekend. Five northern provinces were placed on an orange high alert for a heatwave on Wednesday, with another five to be added by the weekend.- 'Overdoing' the warnings? -Authorities were also taking no chances in France, which is still scarred by the August 2003 heatwave blamed for the deaths of 15,000 people, many of them elderly who were left to fend for themselves.In a highly unusual move, Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer on Monday postponed national school exams to next week. Health Minister Agnes Buzyn denied the government was being excessively vigilant.\"For all those who know (the risks), obviously it's too much, but if I can avoid unnecessary deaths, I will continue to communicate about prevention,\" Buzyn told LCI television, referring to the warnings on radio, TV and public transport.Players and spectators at the women's football World Cup taking place in cities around France were also being inundated with messages about keeping hydrated.In a rare gesture by FIFA on Monday evening, fans were allowed to bring their own bottles of water into the Paris stadium where Sweden took on Canada.Phil Neville, the England coach, was sanguine about the impact of the weather on the tournament, however. \"There's no excuse, the players are ready for it.\"Meanwhile, French beekeepers and farming groups said they were bracing for a \"catastrophic\" honey harvest this year after frost damage in winter, an unusually rainy spring, and, now, unusually high temperatures.\"In the hives, there is nothing to eat, beekeepers are having to feed them with syrup because they risk dying from hunger,\" added the union, which represents many small farms in honey-producing regions.burs-cb/hmw/nla </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031561475208399251766500087</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDT-Y8M1-F03R-N1VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"613\"/><timeReceived>3:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 25, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001982</classCode><className>WEAPONS &amp;

That wasn't always the case.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Logging operations started in the bay around 1907, and in the 1920s a cannery opened, bringing many people with it. At that time Syd Vicary and his daughter opened a store and post office, and the Union Steamships made the bay one of their regular stops. This sudden boom wasn't an unusual story at a time when canneries were scattered across the coast and remote outposts were home to countless logging camps. Seemingly everyone in the region laboured at turning the coast's natural resources into paycheques.</p><p>The Redonda Bay cannery was the site of a peculiar feat of creative engineering. The SS Transfer, an old Fraser River sternwheeler, was brought up on the beach at Redonda Bay and was used to generate steam power to run the cannery machinery. It also served as a bunkhouse when additional accommodations were needed. It certainly made for an interesting retirement for this ship, which in its earlier years ran a ferry service between New Westminster and Chilliwack.</p><p>When the Depression hit, the cannery shut down, and along with the buildings and other infrastructure, the SS Transfer lay abandoned. In the 1940s when things began to improve economically after the Depression, the cannery was re-opened by Frances Millerd and Company. Although the cannery could be revived, the SS Transfer was rotting on the beach. It was dismantled and the boilers were repurposed and moved into the cannery.</p><p>The re-opening of the cannery marked the beginning of a more prosperous time for Redonda Bay. Logging had started up again and there were now enough residents to support a small school. By the late 1940s the population was nearing one hundred. In 1949 a Government wharf was built, there was scheduled air service, logging operations were expanding, and the community was booming. However, by the mid-1950s the boom town went bust when the cannery closed and the economic prosperity that came with it dwindled. The store managed to remain open until 1964.</p><p>A couple years later a forest fire burned down much of the timber in the area. After this time the Bay was left uninhabited other than the occasional squatter making use of the buildings that remained from more prosperous times. In the 1970s the BC Forest Service set up a minimum-security prison camp for a time so that the inmates could thin out some of the trees to improve the market value of the timber that remained.</p><p>At some point the old buildings were taken down as a safety precaution, so there isn't too much to see anymore. Old log chutes and skid roads provide hints of the Bay's past. Although not much remains of the settlement, photographs, stories and archival records help us to piece together the history of abandoned places like Redonda Bay. It's not the same as seeing it for yourself, but with a little imagination you can hear the steaming of the boiler and the clanking of the cannery machinery starting up on a chilly morning.</p><p>West Redonda Island is one of the islands featured in the Museum's summer Historic Boat Tours.

Everyone would benefit from a good and creative, thoughtful discussion on the long-term future of these lands.\"</p><p>Last month, the Where Do We Stand group, which is also advocating for a pause in logging in the forest reserve until more research and consultations are carried out, was successful in having the construction of a logging road in the Stoney Hill area put on hold after discussions with senior officials in North Cowichan.</p><p>RELATED STORY: CONCERNED CITIZENS AIM TO PROTECT N.

You can't extend your hand in an attempt for solidarity whilst rolling your eyes and expect for things to get better. I understand the value of opinion pieces and generally Mr. Eden has something positive to share with and about the community and is not so passive-aggressively partisan.</p><p>STEVE HICKS</p><p>Great read. Animal rights folks are so far off from reality it's frightening.

In fact they also want to shut down any meat animal farm operations. Say hello to zero animal product diet. Agree that outdoor people know how to look after their animals. AR showed up at Kearney race. Their dialogue is so incredibly limited to the very few stories that hit mainstream media. I disagree that we should find middle ground with them. Their end goal is destructive to all working animals. Animal welfare is a whole other matter. Hopefully the redo of OSPCA will focus on animal welfare not animal rights.</p><p>LAUREL TURANSKY</p><p>These people preaching about animal abuse often know very little about the animals in question or the sport they are railing against. There is big money behind PETA which kills far more animals than it helps. People who are attracted to that kind of brainwashing are infiltrating jobs in government, legal, and the veterinary profession.

The weather can at times act to limit the movement of air pollutants and so they can accumulate into a concentration level, in which case we issue an advisory.\"</p><p>As for emissions, there is residential wood heating from stove or boiler, industrial sources in and around the community, and the transportation sector are some of the reasons for the frequent advisories, Weinstein explained.</p><p>READ MORE: Wildfire smoke blankets B.C. and Alberta, prompting air quality advisories</p><p>The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health issued the air quality advisory for Vanderhoof on Feb. 11 and it was lifted on Feb. 14. Most of the Highway 16 corridor was under the same notice, Weinstein said.</p><p>There is poor air quality in Vanderhoof for parts of the year. Weinstein said the district has exceeded the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standard for particulate matter.</p><p>\"Vanderhoof has from a provincial perspective high levels of particulate matter...There are numerous advisories [issued to the community] through the year between five to 15 depending on the weather. And this does not include forest fire days,\" Weinstein explained.</p><p>There is a significant amount of wood combustion from various sources in the District, such as lumber mills, pellet farms, residential wood heating, he said, noting that is just the emissions part, which when combined with still wind is what causes the poor air quality</p><p>To reduce pollution Vanderhoof has a wood stove exchange program. Essentially in this program the applicant would purchase a new stove, obtain an installation permit from the District for which the fees is waived. Then the stove needs to be inspected and Bonfire Pellet &amp;amp; Wood Heating a local company, has partnered with the District to provide a free inspection.</p><p>There is a list of stoves available on the district's website from which the applicant can choose. After the new stove has been bought, the old one needs to be destroyed entirely and then delivered to the District of Vanderhoof Public Works Yard. Staff has to sign off the drop. The last step to claim rebate is to provide the District with proof that a new stove has been purchased, installed and inspected.</p><p>At the health level, poor air quality can have an impact on our respiratory and cardiovascular organs, Weinstein said.</p><p>\"We recommend people monitor their health. People with pre-existing conditions can take actions to reduce their exposure. Staying indoors can help. Running a filter in your house would lower your exposure. Exposure is particularly a concern for infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease,\" he explained.</p><p>And for people with further questions, Weinstein said the ministry recommends seeking further advice from their health care provider.</p><p>Real-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bcairquality.ca\">http://www.bcairquality.ca</url>.</p><p>Aman Parhar Editor, Vanderhoof Omineca Express <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:aman.parhar@ominecaexpress.comLike\">aman.parhar@ominecaexpress.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VANDER-3747606</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VANDER2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VF9-5741-JDH1-C3DS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438216</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"547\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Vanderhoof Omineca Express</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 15, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Business &amp;

Our hearts go out to them.\"</p><p>The Boot Drive raised $3,000 and has been donated to the Red Cross Fort McMurray Relief Fund.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2016052738256650</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JWN-N3G1-JDV5-F38J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"217\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Trent Hills Independent</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 27, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000769</classCode><className>FUNDRAISING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001463</classCode><className>RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I had visited the Comfor office and have a copy of the logging plan. The dead tree areas are marked on the map and I encourage anyone who uses the park to visit the Community Forest office and view this map.</p><p>The bike park people have a very real problem with dead trees and blow-down. Not only are these trees a danger to the users of the trails but also to the volunteers who maintain the amazing trail system. There is a real danger of a rider, walker or maintenance volunteer being injured or killed by a falling tree.</p><p>The more urgent dangers are the unanswered questions about the logging plan. How will these isolated groups of trees be accessed and how will the trees be removed? Where are the landings? What will happen to the slash? And, what will logging truck traffic do to the newly upgraded road? And, most importantly, will the users of the park, local, national and international, be thrilled to ride in a logged area? In my opinion the least amount of tree removal, to the satisfaction of the bike group, creates the most value in the park and to the community.</p><p>As for forest fire, after understanding the science of fire as it relates to a fire on Boer Mountain, the possibility of a fire on the mountain reaching Burns Lake is almost nil. If, as a community, you are really concerned with fire please put a fire lookout back on the mountain. During the times our communities were protected by fire lookout persons there we no big fires.</p><p>The Boer Mountain trails are the \"Jewel in the Crown\" of our community. There is an amazing variety of birds, animals and plants that populate this forest. This park can be reached easily from town, even on foot. If we are to capitalize on these assets we need to work together. There are work bees on Wednesdays, contact BLMBA for more information.

The province used to provide $4.7 million annually, but the federal funding only works out to $3.75 million per year.</p><p>\"It essentially keeps the program going and it gives assurances to the nurseries that will be able to use the stock they planted based on speculation for the program, so it really provided us a nice opportunity to keep the wheels on the wagon,\" he said.</p><p>About 27 million trees have been planted since the program started in 2007, which is just over half of the initial target of 50 million by 2020.</p><p>Keen said Southern Ontario needs 40 per cent forest coverage, but it currently only has about 26 per cent. He said it will take at least another one billion trees to reach the 40 per cent mark.</p><p>\"Climate change is going to have an impact on our forests,\" he said. \"So, as much as forests can help mitigate climate change, having large continuous healthy forests will ensure they are able to adapt to climate change, as well.\"</p><p>The program generates a lot of green from both an environmental and economic standpoint.</p><p>An economic analysis determined there is a 3-to-1 return on every dollar spent on the program. There are also 300 full-time seasonal workers in Ontario directly employed through the program.</p><p>Sidebar: Simcoe.com reporter Brad Pritchard has been following this story since the funding cutbacks were first announced toward the end of April. He spoke to people involved in the industry to get a better understanding of the importance of the program and to demonstrate the impact it has had on the province over the past 12 years.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2019061154777103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCG-CTP1-F103-31D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"593\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Crew that can drop by rope from helicopters into inaccessible places were also deployed.</p><p>The intense heat is another factor, said Stewart.</p><p>\"It's 40 degree weather out there. That's really hard slogging.''</p><p>Casey Saliken, whose home is nestled in the woods about 400 metres across the Ellis Creek canyon from the blaze, was among dozens of onlookers watching aerial tankers dump retardant on the fire.</p><p>Although the cause of the fire wasn't known, she believes it started near a dam on the creek.</p><p>\"I hiked up there when it was still small and it was just past the dam where it started,'' she said.</p><p>\"The water bombers scouted it out and it seemed so innocuous and then half an hour later it just exploded.''</p><p>The recent heat wave has dried up forests and sagebrush throughout the southern B.C. Interior, from Kamloops to the Canada-U.S. border.</p><p>Campfire bans were ordered for much of the region as lightning was predicted for the Okanagan today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199407220312</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1994</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:470N-T7C0-01G6-819V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"408\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1994 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"1994\"><dateText>July 22, 1994 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>PENTICTON FOREST DISTRICT\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR120</classCode><className>NORTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
