Its mayorasked residents Wednesday to pray for rain.</p><p>\"Sadly for us yesterday, we didn't receive a lot precipitation,\" Mayor Guy Lafreni\u00e8re said. \"Today, it's a nice sunny day with no clouds. We've been praying for rain, but it's taking a bit of time.\"</p><p>Quebec officials said rainfall over the previous 24 hours in the northern part of the province was insufficient to douse wildfires near Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon and Chibougamau, where residents were allowed to return Monday.</p><p>\"The rain is our best ally to get the upper hand,\" Sylvain Tremblay told a technical briefing on Wednesday. \"It would take a good 20 to 25 millimetres of rain over a few days, which would allow us to put out some parts of the fire for good and leaving just hot spots.\"</p><p>Around Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, between 300,000 and 350,000 hectares are currently on fire, including one large fire that covers 200,000 hectares. The Nordic Kraft pulp mill near the community is also under threat.</p><p>\"We can't take any risks,\" Public Security Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bonnardel told reporters in Quebec City. \"For the moment, the situation is too worrisome in the short and medium term to tell Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon residents they can return in the next 48 hours.\"</p><p>By the end of the week, Quebec authorities expect 1,500 firefighters on the ground including a sizable contingent of international reinforcements. The teams will include 72 crew from New Brunswick, 106 from France, 119 from the United States, 100 from Portugal and 140 from Spain, in addition to 283 Canadian Forces members. The international firefighters are expected to stay two to three weeks, Tremblay said.</p><p>About 2,800 Quebecers \u2014 including roughly 2,000 from Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon \u2014 remained evacuated on Wednesday, but about 800 people living in Norm\u00e9tal, a municipality in the Abitibi region in northwestern Quebec, began returning home on Wednesday. A fire in the area had crept to within 500 metres of the community at one point last week.</p><p>Officials reminded the public that fires remain active in many areas where people have been able to return home this week.</p><p>Lance Cooper, deputy chief of Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou, a Cree community near Chibougamau, says its residents were allowed to return this week. No damage was reported in the community of about 800.</p><p>\"Everybody is back home now for now. It's safe, but the only problem is smoke,\" Cooper said. \"So we're going to keep watch of that, but there's no fires that are at a close distance at the moment.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 14, 2023.</p><p>\u2014 With files from Patrice Bergeron in Saguenay, Que.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-78af7e119cab44288ee3a9d15f1a87af</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68G6-8SY1-JBVR-30CC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><timeReceived>02:43 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 14, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This had been Canada's worst year for forest fires, and it is well-established that the tinderbox conditions of the great northern forests are one of the more immediate symptoms of the climate crisis.</p><p><br/><br/> As I waited for my ride, I noticed a sign for the Pathways Alliance, a consortium of tarsands producers aiming to continue oil production with the help of carbon capture technology.<br/><br/> Carbon capture is Big Oil's preferred \"climate solution.\" But its record is far from promising. It's heavily subsidized by government - public money that could, frankly, be better used to build solar plants and wind farms. Most carbon-capture projects have missed their targets, blown their budgets, and led to a net increase in emissions. That's not surprising, given carbon capture is a repurposing of an old technology called \"enhanced oil recovery.\" Its patina of environmental responsibility masks the fact carbon capture is almost exclusively used to produce more oil.<br/><br/> Which may explain why it was so popular amongst the Canadian delegates - both from industry and government - at the 24th World Petroleum Congress this past September: if the end of oil is nigh, they want the last barrel to come from Alberta.<br/><br/> I was hoping to catch a glimpse of the Rockies on the ride into town, but the smog was too thick. I did see the \"Calgary: Be Part of the Energy\" sign on the way in, however.<br/><br/> It's a memory that lingers this week, when the Alberta premier moved to use a Sovereignty Act to ward off Ottawa's efforts to green the country's energy.<br/><br/> Here's the thing: The disaster of climate change isn't a hypothetical problem that future generations of clever scientists will be forced to deal with. It is a clear and present danger, as much for the citizens of Calgary and Canada as the entire world.<br/><br/> However much trouble getting off oil might cause Ottawa from a constitutional vantage point, in terms of court battles with Alberta or other provinces, it pales in comparison to the trouble that delaying the energy transition will assuredly cause future generations of Canadians.<br/><br/> Given the International Energy Agency, among a host of other leading experts, all predict global oil demand will peak within this decade, and that the climate crisis is no longer a future hypothetical but a current reality, the energy transition is really less of an environmental question as it is one of national security. Maintaining our quality of life, keeping the country together, and growing our economy will be impossible if Canada is caught unprepared for the seismic shocks coming our way.<br/><br/> The September congress's big-league speakers - be they the CEOs of Kuwait Oil, Saudi Aramco or ExxonMobil - spent their time preaching to the choir of petroleum evangelists. They mocked a spate of recent reports that suggest peak global oil demand may be met before the end of this decade. Rather than discussing best practices and strategies for the sunsetting of the industry, they instead spent most of their time pontificating about the dangers of transitioning too fast, or adhering to arbitrary deadlines set by small groups of activists.<br/><br/> The problem isn't transitioning too fast: it's that the transition wasn't started long ago. <br/><br/> The deadlines aren't arbitrary: they represent a clear red line from which recovery, already doubtful, will likely be impossible. <br/><br/> And these deadlines haven't been set by activists, but by the international community. <br/><br/> And yet delegates were almost obnoxiously bullish on their future prospects. It was not uncommon for them to declare many decades of future growth, even while the engineers and analysts out on the exhibition room floor privately confided their concerns that theirs is a moribund industry dependent on rapidly evaporating public support.<br/><br/> Of all the evangelizers still preaching the gospel of fossil fuels, none were more enthusiastic than Alberta Premier Danielle Smith and her petroleum industry Kool-Aid sipping disciples, Brian Jean and Rebecca Shultz. The trio was on hand to show the government of Alberta remains resolutely in favour of continued oil and gas production, irrespective of whatever inconvenient truths may get in the way.<br/><br/>Alberta's major announcement at the Congress demonstrated this fully: a public subsidy to oil giant Cenovus - a company that made $6.5 billion in profit last year - so that it could study the use of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) to provide energy for the steam-assisted gravity drainage technique of recovering heavy oil from tarsands. The requirement of a constant supply of steam is energy-intensive. Rather than use the large quantities of natural gas that's available in situ, Cenovus's idea is that nuclear reactors could provide the energy, which they argued could help decarbonize production.<br/><br/> Cenovus reps were quick to point out that SMRs - if they actually work - would only be able to partly decarbonize the production process. By continuing production, they will have an obviously detrimental climatological impact given the continued emissions related to transporting and consuming oil.<br/><br/> If that weren't bad enough, recent research from Stanford and the University of British Columbia indicates SMRs may actually produce more radioactive waste than conventional nuclear reactors.<br/><br/> By subsidizing this effort, the government of Alberta is not so much taking one step forward and two steps back, as it is sprinting backwards and declaring itself leading the race.<br/><br/> It was a little more than ironic that the one person who actually advocated getting on the road to net zero was federal Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson. Ironic not least because he was almost immediately condemned by Smith for advocating precisely what the conference was supposed to be about (The theme was \"Energy Transition: The Path to Net Zero\"), but also because federal government subsidies to the oil and gas industry are precisely what's retarding Canada's ability to successfully transition off of fossil fuels.<br/><br/> Last year alone, federal subsidies were conservatively estimated to be over $20 billion, and that's not including the subsidies provided to oil majors for projects they've proposed as part of their carbon emission mitigation strategies.<br/><br/> Unless Canada also wishes to join the other petrostates and become an international pariah, we too have a responsibility to cease oil and gas production. Given that Alberta is both the sunniest and windiest province, it could be ground zero of the energy transition. But Smith has set the development of solar and wind power in Alberta back by a generation if her oil and gas industry-friendly moratorium on new sustainable energy development persists.<br/><br/> Creating unnecessary hurdles for the growing sustainable energy industry - all while subsidizing the unsustainable energy industry - is incompetent. That Smith is actively digging her province a deeper grave by picking pointless and ultimately fruitless fights with the federal government borders on the incomprehensible. <br/><br/> No good will come of this. Unfortunately for Canadians, the Supreme Court has determined the federal government does not have the right to set environmental policies for the benefit of all if it interferes with a given province's right to develop its resources.<br/><br/> Smith said, \"This is not an industry that's winding down. It's an industry that's transitioning away from emissions.\"<br/><br/> That's a complete and total fabrication. Emissions are increasing, and governments are using our money to subsidize it.<br/><br/> Taylor C.

These shifts, combined with forestry policies and climate change effects, greatly increase the risk of catastrophic wildfire.\u201d-Keith Atkinson, Chair, BC Forest Practices Board (BCFPB) Forestry experts have long warned that forest practices and government policies are intensifying wildfire risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But industry and government have disregarded numerous studies and persistent calls for action. Practices and policies are little changed.</p><p>The results have been disastrous as expanses of forest, extensive infrastructure and numerous homes have been razed, and as the air has been fouled and fire suppression costs have multiplied. Increasingly, wildfire ravages more land in less time.</p><p>On June 26, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Service, reported that nmre than 7,600,000 hectares had burned in Canada to date in 2023. That surpassed the previous annual record of 7,560,000 hectares in 1989.</p><p>Six months of 2023 saw more area destroyed than 12 months of the record year. The average fire in 2023 was four times larger than in 1989. Extreme fire seasons have been common this century.</p><p>In British Columbia to July 4, 2023, 621 fires burned 1,042,000 hectares.</p><p>In the record year of 2018, 1,354,000 hectares were lost to 2,117 fires. The area burned this year is almost certainly on track to exceed the record year, with most of the two peak fire months yet to be added to the tally.</p><p>The BCFPB on June 29 released their report, \u201cForest and Fire Management in BC\u201d. The report relates that the 2021 wildfire season resulted in $800 million in fire suppression costs and indirect costs as high as $24 billion.</p><p>Costs include damage to private property and infrastructure and extensive loss of soil productivity, timber supply and wildlife habitat. Since 2018, the province has spent $72 million on fuel reduction measures, says the report, \u201calmost exclusively\u201d within the wildland urban interface (WUI).</p><p>The budget for mitigation is dwarfed by fire suppression costs, and is almost non-existent relative to the extensive costs of wildfire, as areas impacted and severity of impact greatly expand.</p><p>Mike Flannigan, a professor of fire science at Thompson River University, told the CBC that without climate change this fire season would have been impossible.</p><p>\u201cThe warmer it gets, the more efficient the atmosphere is at sucking the moisture of the fuels \u2026 on the forest floor,\u201d he noted. BC forest scientists fear a loss in the diversity of tree species, and expect vast forested areas will be replaced by grasslands.</p><p>Promisingly, techniques to mitigate risks in forests and reduce wildfire events exist. Governments need only adopt them, and of course pay for them.</p><p>Forestry experts recommend that fuel reduction measures must be expanded and targeted beyond the WUI. Provincial policy and regulation should require all areas harvested to be reforested, not just with the most economically viable species, but with those species native to the area to improve resilience.</p><p>Destructive forestry activities, like widespread salvage logging after disasters, should be prohibited. These measures and others provide only part of the solution.</p><p>The BCFPB report recommends \u2013more accurately, urges \u2013 a comprehensive approach called landscape fire management (LFM). \u201cLFM is a way to proactively mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires on the broader landscape.</p><p>\u201cIt is a restoration approach to addressing forest fuel buildup and improving landscape resilience,\u201d the report reads. \u201cAchieving this paradigm shift will require bold and immediate action by the provincial government to align policies and programs across all levels of government with a vision of landscape resilience and co-existence with fire.\u201d</p><p>LFM will require major effort and a significant budget.</p><p>Should the BC government continue to avoid the responsibility and the expense, the environment and economy of this province will be irretrievably damaged.</p><p>Bruce Uzelman is a political columnist for Black Press, living in the Okanagan.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVRECO-news20230802PPXA0003768899</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVRECO2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VG-SJ91-JD2C-J4YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438259</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"690\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

While the access road was closed September 30 and October 1, the fires also caused frightening conditions for drivers on that stretch of the Billy Diamond Highway. </p><p>\u201cSmoke was thick at times on the road home to Chisasibi and at one point there were ashes falling, which at first we thought were raindrops but it wasn\u2019t wet,\u201d said Angela Gates. \u201cWe saw three fires. The far ones looked scary because it was night and we saw a lot of orange in the distance. My kids and I were shocked that they had reignited.\u201d </p><p>Although the road reopened the following Monday, drivers were cautioned that shifting winds could continue to cause flareups. Regional fire marshal Lee-Roy Blacksmith told the Nation that these blazes didn\u2019t require a firefighter response and that SOPFEU is monitoring the area. </p><p>As the fire season winds down, Blacksmith is organizing debriefing sessions with SOPFEU and his working group to begin planning for next year. In coming talks with SOPFEU, he\u2019s looking to secure training for Cree firefighters in the spring and information on how to define damages for cabin insurance.   </p><p>\u201cThey want us to provide a fire report through SOPFEU,\u201d said Blacksmith. \u201cWe\u2019ll be working with SOPFEU on these cabin fires \u2013 where the fires were, what caused them.\u201d </p><p>The Cree Nation Government launched a cabin damage registry in September to help document the impact of this summer\u2019s forest fires on Cree cabins and equipment. The simple online form asks owners to submit their cabin\u2019s location, size, type of infrastructure, funding source and estimated damage value.  </p><p>Owners are asked if their cabin was insured and whether they\u2019re on the Economic Security Program, describing the damage in words and pictures. The survey is not an offer of financial aid. Local Cree Trappers\u2019 Associations or Niskamoon officers are available to assist with filling out the form. </p><p>\u201cThis is a very, very large undertaking for the Cree Nation Government because the territory is huge,\u201d explained Grand Chief Mandy Gull-Masty. \u201cWe want to find solutions to assist our members. We want to justify those solutions. This is your opportunity to participate in finding an outcome for the Cree Nation in terms of what happened this summer.\u201d </p><p>Among the more than 10,000 cabins in Eeyou Istchee, only 262 had insurance. The CTA\u2019s Thomas Stevens estimated that included less than 10% of Cree cabins that burned down. While it isn\u2019t yet clear how Cree insurance rates will be impacted by this year\u2019s wildfires, some homeowners in British Columbia found their rates had more than doubled by late summer. </p><p>According to Craig Stewart of the Insurance Bureau of Canada, insurers are assessing premiums for vulnerable communities based on existing fire protection and forest management practices. He said the insurance industry is in \u201cintensive\u201d talks with Natural Resources Canada to find solutions that encourage consumers to adopt wildfire mitigation practices.  </p><p>BC is currently the only province offering an intensive FireSmart program, which certifies property owners who complete recommendations following a risk assessment. Program lead Rachel Woodhurst said houses with a non-combustible roof in good condition and flammable material cleared about one-and-a-half metres around the perimeter have a 90% chance of survival.    </p><p>With less forest to absorb rainfall and moderate snowfall, areas impacted by fires may be at risk of flooding, infrastructure damage and other \u201ccascading hazards,\u201d according to Environment Canada meteorologist Armel Castellan.  </p><p>The months of June, July and August were the warmest on record for the planet. Then September exceeded all these previous broken records by an unprecedented margin. While Canadian wildfires are typically slow by late August and fade away by October, many of this year\u2019s fires grew at their fastest rates throughout late September, particularly in western Canada.  </p><p>On September 27, the last day that the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported numbers for the year, 798 fires were still burning, with 382 out of control. More than 6,400 wildfires scorched almost 18 million hectares across the country, including close to 4 million hectares in northern Quebec, much of it in Cree territory.  </p><p>Scientists from the World Weather Attribution initiative found that human-caused climate change made Quebec\u2019s wildfires through the end of July at least seven times more likely to occur \u2013 and at least 50% more intense. Although these fires were unprecedented, the report\u2019s authors concluded \u201cthey are no longer extremely unusual.\u201d </p><p>The substantial losses to forests, wildlife and cultural infrastructure have disturbed Indigenous communities\u2019 balance with their surrounding nature. The Anishinabe community of Lac Simon has held several ceremonies to mourn the deaths of wildlife trapped in the blazes.  </p><p>\u201cThe forest that protects us has disappeared,\u201d lamented the community\u2019s former leader, Adrienne J\u00e9r\u00f4me. \u201cOur pantry has disappeared. There are no more small game animals, no hares, no partridges. All the medicinal plants have burned.\u201d  </p><p>While Cree land users like Allan Saganash have long criticized the region\u2019s irresponsible forestry practices, a growing chorus of scientists denounce the industry\u2019s focus on lucrative but fire-fuelling black spruce. They recommend prioritizing mixed reforestation of coniferous and deciduous trees that are more resistant to fire risk. </p><p>Saganash has already observed changes in the local wildlife.

His father came from Salmon Arm and ran a gas station on 10th Avenue for a few years. It was one of almost 40 gas stations in the Alberni Valley at the time. McGregor's mother, whose parents were Fred and Gertrude Brand, was born in the Alberni Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Think this,\" McGregor says with a grin. \"Gertrude Street and Johnston Road: Gertrude Brand, n\u00e9e Johnston!\"</p><p>When McGregor's grandparents first came to the Alberni Valley, people could drive oxen as far as Polly's Point. Gertrude's father was one of the early Alberni Valley amateur photographers.</p><p>\"Some of his pictures are in the museum collection with no credit, as part of the deal mom made to donate them,\" McGregor explained.</p><p>He adds that the cameras are still in the family, as is a piano. His grandparents had \"Brand's Hall\" on Southgate Street, where they played piano on Saturday nights and pushed it over to the church next door for Sunday's Services.</p><p>McGregor also recalls his younger days when he and other kids went ice skating on Sproat Lake and the Redford Ponds, as well as at the top of the Hump. \"Now all we got is the arena,\" he said.</p><p>His working life started around 1961 with a company that got him to join the Jaycees, or the Junior Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>\"Their policy was to get contacts and a strong desire to volunteer,\" said McGregor. \"Thus, I got involved in setting up car shows, demolition derbies in the '60s and '70s. Some of the most fun was working on the go-kart racing on the Second Avenue and Kingsway area.\"</p><p>For his involvement in the event, McGregor and his wife Pat received a commendation from Mayor Ken McRae.</p><p>\"Another great memory was sharing a hot tub with Gillian Trumper, Mayor of Port Alberni at the time,\" he said. \"We were with Community Futures in those days.\"</p><p>McGregor's involvement in his community is vast, from working at Western Motors and serving the forest industry, as well as other companies and individuals, by supplying auto parts and general equipment to rebuild motors, generators and a number of pieces of equipment to being a member of the BC Federation of Labour and representing the IWA at various conventions. He also held a membership in the automotive association. McGregor was also an active volunteer member of the Alberni Valley Community Foundation, a local organization whose goal is to provide grants to help fund local projects.</p><p>In the early '80s, McGregor left Western Motors and started his own business with Mike Lawler at what is now M&amp;D Auto Parts, located on Southgate at Margaret Street. This was a company he owned and managed until his retirement in 2002. This business, still in operation in the same place, was sold to his son and other partners by forming a type of co-op partnership.</p><p>With the recent forest fire near Cameron Lake, which has affected the west coast communities' access this summer, including, of course, Port Alberni, McGregor also has a story to share about the so-called Horne Lake connector.</p><p>\"In the early '60s, a group of five or six of us would hang out together,\" he recalls. \"One day we decided to go to Qualicum via Horne Lake. We all piled into a Volkswagen van owned by one of our parents, and proceeded to go past the golf course to meet up with the access road for the power lines coming into Port. We followed the poorly maintained 'road' for a while, then the road got really rough. The van started jumping up and there was a bang. The rear end transmission lost all gears except low. We had to turn around and head home.\"</p><p>After a discussion, the group decided to get McGregor's 48 Chev and go again. However, the new route started at Coombs Country Candy, heading straight up to the old lookout, past McBrides' sawmill, over to Lacey Lake, then along the old logging roads to Horne Lake caves.</p><p>\"Some trip!\" McGregor recalls. \"Lots of washouts and ungraded stretches. For a customized car it was a challenge. However, we did finally make it, and to prove it, the dash of the car had fingernail scratches for some time after.</p><p>\"Thanks 'Twerp!' The new connector via Horne Lake would be welcome, if just for the memories.\"</p><p>McGregor has seen numerous changes in the Alberni Valley over the years.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we have lost many jobs in the forest industry, so now we are trying to boost tourism as a way of bringing out the beauty of our surroundings as well as helping our economy,\" he said.</p><p>\"We should improve the promotion of this beautiful natural area we live in more extensively.\"</p><p>A few years ago, after seeing what was done in Chemainus with murals on the buildings, he thought it was a good idea to enhance the look of our own city and do the same here. So, as a member of PACES, he initiated the project of painting murals in various parts of Port Alberni.</p><p>These days, McGregor keeps active by taking part in activities at the Sunshine Club, playing golf and by volunteering at the Alberni Valley Bulldogs games. He says he has met many fine people in this community while volunteering, starting with his time as a leader with the Boy Scouts, and other organizations he has served throughout the years.</p><p>Orlando Delano writes Valley Seniors once a month for the Alberni Valley News.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Alberni Valley News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AVLNWS-news20231026PAE4530921</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AVLNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69GM-B3Y1-JD2C-J12B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Year to date we've had 3,164 fires that have burned 8.8 million hectares. This surpasses the previous record in 1995 of hectares burned by 1 million.

(Words fail me on this one!)<br/><br/> It's heartbreaking to smell the smoke in the air and see the hazy sky. I've been experiencing my beloved garden and tree-filled backyard from behind closed windows with the air conditioner humming away. After three long years of COVID-19, we need the great outdoors more than ever to regain some semblance of what real life is supposed to be.<br/><br/> But when I see people maskless in the smoky air, I worry how many will soon be experiencing the health effects.<br/><br/> The Canada.ca website says wildfire smoke contains sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, fine particulate matter and ozone. The big damage to our health is from the fine particulates that can get deep into your lungs and bloodstream, especially if you are vigorously exercising and breathing deeply. There is no safe level for wildfire smoke exposure.<br/><br/> The short-term effects include scratchy throat and eyes, breathing issues, racing heart, asthma attacks, fatigue and headaches. Longer-term effects include a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and death.<br/><br/> The rain over the holiday weekend may have ruined our plans, but rain does cleanse the air of fine particulates. And after a spell of smoky air, we all need the pleasure of petrichor: the smell of the earth when it rains after a dry spell. This, incidentally, is partly due to geosmin, an odorant released by a bacteria in the soil.<br/><br/> The rain itself is not toxic, but it can carry extra nutrients into our streams and waterways, leading to algae blooms and a reduction in oxygen in the water that harms fish and other water-dwelling creatures.<br/><br/> Our summers are so brief, it's heartbreaking to lose one minute of them. And there is little doubt this is our new normal. Wilful ignorance of the role of our climate breakdown and how it creates the conditions for wildfires defines our provincial government. <br/><br/> The connections are clear: an increase in average global temperature creates more extreme weather that includes droughts, wilder storms, and an increase of lightning strikes.<br/><br/> So yes, Premier Ford, you are right that lightning starts many wildfires, but the decimation of environmental protection and climate change denial by your government ensures this is not the last of our smoky summers.<br/><br/> Susan Koswan is a freelance contributing columnist <br/><br/> for The Record, based in <br/><br/> Waterloo Region.

After three long years of COVID-19, we need the great outdoors more than ever to regain some semblance of what real life is supposed to be.<br/><br/> But when I see people maskless in the smoky air, I worry how many will soon be experiencing the health effects.<br/><br/> The Canada.ca website says wildfire smoke contains sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, fine particulate matter and ozone. The big damage to our health is from the fine particulates that can get deep into your lungs and bloodstream, especially if you are vigorously exercising and breathing deeply. There is no safe level for wildfire smoke exposure.<br/><br/> The short-term effects include scratchy throat and eyes, breathing issues, racing heart, asthma attacks, fatigue and headaches. Longer-term effects include a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and death.<br/><br/> The rain over the holiday weekend may have ruined our plans, but rain does cleanse the air of fine particulates. And after a spell of smoky air, we all need the pleasure of petrichor: the smell of the earth when it rains after a dry spell. This, incidentally, is partly due to geosmin, an odorant released by a bacteria in the soil.<br/><br/> The rain itself is not toxic, but it can carry extra nutrients into our streams and waterways, leading to algae blooms and a reduction in oxygen in the water that harms fish and other water-dwelling creatures.<br/><br/> Our summers are so brief, it's heartbreaking to lose one minute of them. And there is little doubt this is our new normal. Wilful ignorance of the role of our climate breakdown and how it creates the conditions for wildfires defines our provincial government. <br/><br/> The connections are clear: an increase in average global temperature creates more extreme weather that includes droughts, wilder storms, and an increase of lightning strikes.<br/><br/> So yes, Premier Ford, you are right that lightning starts many wildfires, but the decimation of environmental protection and climate change denial by your government ensures this is not the last of our smoky summers.<br/><br/> Susan Koswan is a freelance contributing columnist <br/><br/> for The Record, based in <br/><br/> Waterloo Region.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Friday, March. 8, 18 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> TICKETS<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.<br/><br/> As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.<br/><br/> PAST LOCATIONS<br/><br/>

Entire provinces and states, all the way down to Texas and Florida, have been covered in the shifting colours of smoke intensity on the firesmoke.ca map.</p><p><br/><br/> The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre on Canada's birthday was showing 558 active fires in Canada; half of them were out of control. Year to date we've had 3,164 fires that have burned 8.8 million hectares. This surpasses the previous record in 1995 of hectares burned by 1 million. Wildfires also release a significant amount of greenhouse gases. And it's only early July. It is beyond belief.<br/><br/> So is the misinformation and the conspiracy theories, with the causes split across political lines. <br/><br/> Arson is occasionally the cause, but most wildfires are caused by lightning taking full advantage of droughts caused by our climate breakdown. Add to this off-road vehicles and human carelessness that includes, although rarely, explosives from gender-reveal parties. (Words fail me on this one!)<br/><br/> It's heartbreaking to smell the smoke in the air and see the hazy sky. I've been experiencing my beloved garden and tree-filled backyard from behind closed windows with the air conditioner humming away. After three long years of COVID-19, we need the great outdoors more than ever to regain some semblance of what real life is supposed to be.<br/><br/> But when I see people maskless in the smoky air, I worry how many will soon be experiencing the health effects.<br/><br/> The Canada.ca website says wildfire smoke contains sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, fine particulate matter and ozone. The big damage to our health is from the fine particulates that can get deep into your lungs and bloodstream, especially if you are vigorously exercising and breathing deeply. There is no safe level for wildfire smoke exposure.<br/><br/> The short-term effects include scratchy throat and eyes, breathing issues, racing heart, asthma attacks, fatigue and headaches. Longer-term effects include a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and death.<br/><br/> The rain over the holiday weekend may have ruined our plans, but rain does cleanse the air of fine particulates. And after a spell of smoky air, we all need the pleasure of petrichor: the smell of the earth when it rains after a dry spell. This, incidentally, is partly due to geosmin, an odorant released by a bacteria in the soil.<br/><br/> The rain itself is not toxic, but it can carry extra nutrients into our streams and waterways, leading to algae blooms and a reduction in oxygen in the water that harms fish and other water-dwelling creatures.<br/><br/> Our summers are so brief, it's heartbreaking to lose one minute of them. And there is little doubt this is our new normal. Wilful ignorance of the role of our climate breakdown and how it creates the conditions for wildfires defines our provincial government. <br/><br/> The connections are clear: an increase in average global temperature creates more extreme weather that includes droughts, wilder storms, and an increase of lightning strikes.<br/><br/> So yes, Premier Ford, you are right that lightning starts many wildfires, but the decimation of environmental protection and climate change denial by your government ensures this is not the last of our smoky summers.<br/><br/> Susan Koswan is a freelance contributing columnist <br/><br/> for The Record, based in <br/><br/> Waterloo Region.

After three long years of COVID-19, we need the great outdoors more than ever to regain some semblance of what real life is supposed to be.<br/><br/> But when I see people maskless in the smoky air, I worry how many will soon be experiencing the health effects.<br/><br/> The Canada.ca website says wildfire smoke contains sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, fine particulate matter and ozone. The big damage to our health is from the fine particulates that can get deep into your lungs and bloodstream, especially if you are vigorously exercising and breathing deeply. There is no safe level for wildfire smoke exposure.<br/><br/> The short-term effects include scratchy throat and eyes, breathing issues, racing heart, asthma attacks, fatigue and headaches. Longer-term effects include a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and death.<br/><br/> The rain over the holiday weekend may have ruined our plans, but rain does cleanse the air of fine particulates. And after a spell of smoky air, we all need the pleasure of petrichor: the smell of the earth when it rains after a dry spell. This, incidentally, is partly due to geosmin, an odorant released by a bacteria in the soil.<br/><br/> The rain itself is not toxic, but it can carry extra nutrients into our streams and waterways, leading to algae blooms and a reduction in oxygen in the water that harms fish and other water-dwelling creatures.<br/><br/> Our summers are so brief, it's heartbreaking to lose one minute of them. And there is little doubt this is our new normal. Wilful ignorance of the role of our climate breakdown and how it creates the conditions for wildfires defines our provincial government. <br/><br/> The connections are clear: an increase in average global temperature creates more extreme weather that includes droughts, wilder storms, and an increase of lightning strikes.<br/><br/> So yes, Premier Ford, you are right that lightning starts many wildfires, but the decimation of environmental protection and climate change denial by your government ensures this is not the last of our smoky summers.<br/><br/> Susan Koswan is a freelance contributing columnist <br/><br/> for The Record, based in <br/><br/> Waterloo Region.

Wood Buffalo and Grande Prairie also have high risk air quality forecasts.</p><p>Moderately bad air quality is forecast for Edmonton and Calgary on Friday.</p><p>In British Columbia, air quality was expected to improve almost everywhere in the province except for Fort St. John. </p><p>The number of fires burning across the country fell slightly Thursday, but forecasts suggest smoke warnings will remain in place in several provinces into the weekend.</p><p>The record setting air pollution that blanketed Ottawa and much of eastern Ontario with a yellow-tinged haze Wednesday had mostly cleared by Thursday morning. But further south, Environment Canada maintained very high-risk air quality rating in the Toronto area, southwestern Ontario and the Niagara region.</p><p>Multiple health studies have linked wildfire smoke to serious health consequences including heart attacks, strokes and breathing problems, and the poor air quality has prompted cancellations or changes to outdoor activities as a result.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre said there were 431 fires burning on Thursday in nine provinces and two territories. That was down from 441 Wednesday, with Quebec extinguishing 10 fires since Wednesday morning.</p><p>The number of out-of-control fires also fell from 256 on Wednesday to 234 on Thursday, including a change in status for more than a dozen fires in Quebec.</p><p>The week's events prompted the second debate in the House of Commons related to climate change and fires this week on Thursday.</p><p>The Bloc and NDP accused the Liberals of claiming to be acting on climate while still subsidizing and approving the expansion of fossil-fuel projects. The Liberals blamed the Conservatives for pushing back on climate policies such as carbon pricing without offering alternatives.</p><p>More than 43,000 square kilometres have burned so far this year, making 2023 the second-worst year for fires on record. That's before the hottest months of the year have even begun. </p><p>In 2014, more than 46,000 square kilometres burned, the most ever in a single year. At the current pace, that total is expected to be passed this weekend.</p><p>Mohammad Reza Alizadeh, a climate environmental researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is studying climate extremes including wildfires, heat waves and droughts. Alizadeh, who did his PhD at McGill University in Montreal, said in an interview this spring's unusually severe fire season in Canada is \"really a clear sign of climate change.\"</p><p>Fires, said Alizadeh, love three things: dry fuel, windy hot weather and frequent lightning strikes. Climate change is bringing all three, he said. </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 9, 2023. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-55a306dc089c40be830417d35dfa9c47</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DX-G031-JBVR-3434-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"570\"/><timeReceived>04:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 9, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

His father came from Salmon Arm and ran a gas station on 10th Avenue for a few years. It was one of almost 40 gas stations in the Alberni Valley at the time. McGregor\u2019s mother, whose parents were Fred and Gertrude Brand, was born in the Alberni Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThink this,\u201d McGregor says with a grin. \u201cGertrude Street and Johnston Road:Gertrude Brand, nee Johnston!\u201d When McGregor\u2019s grandparents first came to the Alberni Valley, people could drive oxen as far as Polly\u2019s Point. Gertrude\u2019s father was one of the early Alberni Valley amateur photographers.</p><p>\u201cSome of his pictures are in the museum collection with no credit, as part of the deal mom made to donate them,\u201d McGregor explained.</p><p>He adds that the cameras are still in the family, as is a piano. His grandparents had \u201cBrand\u2019s Hall\u201d on Southgate Street, where they played piano on Saturday nights and pushed it over to the church next door for Sunday\u2019s Services.</p><p>McGregor also recalls his younger days when he and other kids went ice skating on Sproat Lake and the Redford Ponds, as well as at the top of the Hump. \u201cNow all we got is the arena,\u201d he said.</p><p>His working life started around 1961 with a company that got him to join the Jaycees, or the Junior Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>\u201cTheir policy was to get contacts and a strong desire to volunteer,\u201d said McGregor. \u201cThus, I got involved in setting up car shows, demolition derbies in the \u201960s and \u201870s. Some of the most fun was working on the go-kart racing on the Second Avenue and Kingsway area.\u201d</p><p>For his involvement in the event, McGregor and his wife Pat received a commendation from Mayor Ken McRae.</p><p>\u201cAnother great memory was sharing a hot tub with Gillian Trumper, Mayor of Port Alberni at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were with Community Futures in those days.\u201d</p><p>McGregor\u2019s involvement in his community is vast, from working at Western Motors and serving the forest industry, as well as other companies and individuals, by supplying auto parts and general equipment to rebuild motors, generators and a number of pieces of equipment to being a member of the BC Federation of Labour and representing the IWA at various conventions. He also held a membership in the automotive association. McGregor was also an active volunteer member of the Alberni Valley Community Foundation, a local organization whose goal is to provide grants to help fund local projects.</p><p>In the early \u201880s, McGregor left Western Motors and started his own business with Mike Lawler at what is now M&amp;D Auto Parts, located on Southgate at Margaret Street. This was a company he owned and managed until his retirement in 2002. This business, still in operation in the same place, was sold to his son and other partners by forming a type of co-op partnership.</p><p>With the recent forest fire near Cameron Lake, which has affected the west coast communities\u2019 access this summer, including, of course, Port Alberni, McGregor also has a story to share about the so-called Horne Lake connector.</p><p>\u201cIn the early \u201860s, a group of five or six of us would hang out together,\u201d he recalls. \u201cOne day we decided to go to Qualicum via Horne Lake. We all piled into a Volkswagen van owned by one of our parents, and proceeded to go past the golf course to meet up with the access road for the power lines coming into Port. We followed the poorly maintained \u2018road\u2019 for a while, then the road got really rough. The van started jumping up and there was a bang. The rear end transmission lost all gears except low. We had to turn around and head home.\u201d</p><p>After a discussion, the group decided to get McGregor\u2019s 48 Chev and go again. However, the new route started at Coombs Country Candy, heading straight up to the old lookout.past McBrides\u2019 sawmill, over to Lacey Lake, then along the old logging roads to Horne Lake caves.</p><p>\u201cSome trip!\u201d McGregor recalls.</p><p>\u201cLots of washouts and ungraded stretches. For a customized car it was a challenge. However, we did finally make it, and to prove it, the dash of the car had fingernail scratches for some time after.</p><p>\u201cThanks \u2018Twerp!\u2019 The new connector via Horne Lake would be welcome, if just for the memories.\u201d</p><p>McGregor has seen numerous changes in the Alberni Valley over the years.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, we have lost many jobs in the forest industry, so now we are trying to boost tourism as a way of bringing out the beauty of our surroundings as well as helping our economy,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe should improve the promotion of this beautiful natural area we live in more extensively.\u201d</p><p>A few years ago, after seeing what was done in Chemainus with murals on the buildings, he thought it was a good idea to enhance the look of our own city and do the same here.

There were also 370 military members helping with logistics, evacuations and fire duties, he added. </p><p>As of Friday, the fires had forced more than 13,500 people from their homes, many of them in the northern municipalities of Chibougamau and Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon. About 50 people were also evacuated from a detention centre in Amos, Que., as a preventive measure, Bonnardel said.</p><p>Despite the stabilizing situation, Bonnardel said it was likely many of the evacuees wouldn't be able to return home before next week. </p><p>He announced the province would offer $1,500 to each household that was evacuated and would fully reimburse affected municipalities for the costs they incurred to run shelters, manage evacuations and fight fires. </p><p>Blanchette V\u00e9zina said the wildfire fight on Friday continued to focus on the province's northern and western regions, including on a blaze that came to within 500 metres of a town in the Abitibi region. She said the situation in Norm\u00e9tal, Que., remained critical but that no damage had been reported in the 800-person community located 720 kilometres northwest of Montreal.</p><p>Morale among firefighters on the ground remained high, she said, despite a gruelling week.</p><p>\"They're all fighting, they're all on adrenalin,\" she said. \"What they do, they're there to save lives, save communities, and their work and skills are put to full use. So morale is very good, and even better since reinforcements are arriving.\" </p><p>SOPFEU has described the current wildfire season as the worst on record. The province has reported a total of 444 wildfires so far this year, compared to an average of 207 at the same date during prior years.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 9, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a99d4ec73b504a6b9f7ca92e978df8a4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68F4-FDJ1-DY9S-T4B5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><timeReceived>12:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 9, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Entire provinces and states, all the way down to Texas and Florida, have been covered in the shifting colours of smoke intensity on the firesmoke.ca map.</p><p><br/><br/> The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre on Canada's birthday was showing 558 active fires in Canada; half of them were out of control. Year to date we've had 3,164 fires that have burned 8.8 million hectares. This surpasses the previous record in 1995 of hectares burned by 1 million. Wildfires also release a significant amount of greenhouse gases. And it's only early July. It is beyond belief.<br/><br/> So is the misinformation and the conspiracy theories, with the causes split across political lines. Arson is occasionally the cause, but most wildfires are caused by lightning taking full advantage of droughts caused by our climate breakdown. Add to this off-road vehicles and human carelessness that includes, although rarely, explosives from gender-reveal parties. (Words fail me on this one!)<br/><br/> It's heartbreaking to smell the smoke in the air and see the hazy sky. I've been experiencing my beloved garden and tree-filled backyard from behind closed windows with the air conditioner humming away. After three long years of COVID-19, we need the great outdoors more than ever to regain some semblance of what real life is supposed to be.<br/><br/> But when I see people maskless in the smoky air, I worry how many will soon be experiencing the health effects.<br/><br/> The Canada.ca website says wildfire smoke contains sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, fine particulate matter and ozone. The big damage to our health is from the fine particulates that can get deep into your lungs and bloodstream, especially if you are vigorously exercising and breathing deeply. There is no safe level for wildfire smoke exposure.<br/><br/> The short-term effects include scratchy throat and eyes, breathing issues, racing heart, asthma attacks, fatigue and headaches. Longer term effects include a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and death.<br/><br/> The rain over the holiday weekend may have ruined our plans, but rain does cleanse the air of fine particulates. And after a spell of smoky air, we all need the pleasure of petrichor: the smell of the earth when it rains after a dry spell. This, incidentally, is partly due to geosmin, an odorant released by a bacteria in the soil.<br/><br/> The rain itself is not toxic, but it can carry extra nutrients into our streams and waterways, leading to algae blooms and a reduction in oxygen in the water that harms fish and other water-dwelling creatures.<br/><br/> Our summers are so brief, it's heartbreaking to lose one minute of them. And there is little doubt this is our new normal. Wilful ignorance of the role of our climate breakdown and how it creates the conditions for wildfires defines our provincial government. The connections are clear: an increase in average global temperature creates more extreme weather that includes droughts, wilder storms, and an increase of lightning strikes.<br/><br/> So yes, Premier Ford, you are right that lightning starts many wildfires, but the decimation of environmental protection and climate change denial by your government ensures this is not the last of our smoky summers.<br/><br/> Susan Koswan is a freelance contributing columnist for The Record, based in Waterloo Region.

Noakes Contributing Columnist</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>  CALGARY-The unmistakable smell of forest fire smoke greeted me as I stepped out of the Calgary International Airport. This had been Canada's worst year for forest fires, and it is well-established that the tinderbox conditions of the great northern forests are one of the more immediate symptoms of the climate crisis.</p><p><br/><br/> As I waited for my ride, I noticed a sign for the Pathways Alliance, a consortium of tarsands producers aiming to continue oil production with the help of carbon capture technology.<br/><br/> Carbon capture is Big Oil's preferred \"climate solution.\" But its record is far from promising. It's heavily subsidized by government - public money that could, frankly, be better used to build solar plants and wind farms. Most carbon-capture projects have missed their targets, blown their budgets, and led to a net increase in emissions. That's not surprising, given carbon capture is a repurposing of an old technology called \"enhanced oil recovery.\" Its patina of environmental responsibility masks the fact carbon capture is almost exclusively used to produce more oil.<br/><br/> Which may explain why it was so popular amongst the Canadian delegates - both from industry and government - at the 24th World Petroleum Congress this past September: if the end of oil is nigh, they want the last barrel to come from Alberta.<br/><br/> I was hoping to catch a glimpse of the Rockies on the ride into town, but the smog was too thick. I did see the \"Calgary: Be Part of the Energy\" sign on the way in, however.<br/><br/> It's a memory that lingers this week, when the Alberta premier moved to use a Sovereignty Act to ward off Ottawa's efforts to green the country's energy.<br/><br/> Here's the thing: The disaster of climate change isn't a hypothetical problem that future generations of clever scientists will be forced to deal with. It is a clear and present danger, as much for the citizens of Calgary and Canada as the entire world.<br/><br/> However much trouble getting off oil might cause Ottawa from a constitutional vantage point, in terms of court battles with Alberta or other provinces, it pales in comparison to the trouble that delaying the energy transition will assuredly cause future generations of Canadians.<br/><br/> Given the International Energy Agency, among a host of other leading experts, all predict global oil demand will peak within this decade, and that the climate crisis is no longer a future hypothetical but a current reality, the energy transition is really less of an environmental question as it is one of national security. Maintaining our quality of life, keeping the country together, and growing our economy will be impossible if Canada is caught unprepared for the seismic shocks coming our way.<br/><br/> The September congress's big-league speakers - be they the CEOs of Kuwait Oil, Saudi Aramco or ExxonMobil - spent their time preaching to the choir of petroleum evangelists. They mocked a spate of recent reports that suggest peak global oil demand may be met before the end of this decade. Rather than discussing best practices and strategies for the sunsetting of the industry, they instead spent most of their time pontificating about the dangers of transitioning too fast, or adhering to arbitrary deadlines set by small groups of activists.<br/><br/> The problem isn't transitioning too fast: it's that the transition wasn't started long ago.<br/><br/> The deadlines aren't arbitrary: they represent a clear red line from which recovery, already doubtful, will likely be impossible.<br/><br/> And these deadlines haven't been set by activists, but by the international community.<br/><br/> And yet delegates were almost obnoxiously bullish on their future prospects. It was not uncommon for them to declare many decades of future growth, even while the engineers and analysts out on the exhibition room floor privately confided their concerns that theirs is a moribund industry dependent on rapidly evaporating public support.<br/><br/> Of all the evangelizers still preaching the gospel of fossil fuels, none were more enthusiastic than Alberta Premier Danielle Smith and her petroleum industry Kool-Aid sipping disciples, Brian Jean and Rebecca Shultz. The trio was on hand to show the government of Alberta remains resolutely in favour of continued oil and gas production, irrespective of whatever inconvenient truths may get in the way.<br/><br/>Alberta's major announcement at the Congress demonstrated this fully: a public subsidy to oil giant Cenovus - a company that made $6.5 billion in profit last year - so that it could study the use of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) to provide energy for the steam-assisted gravity drainage technique of recovering heavy oil from tarsands. The requirement of a constant supply of steam is energy-intensive. Rather than use the large quantities of natural gas that's available in situ, Cenovus's idea is that nuclear reactors could provide the energy, which they argued could help decarbonize production.<br/><br/> Cenovus reps were quick to point out that SMRs - if they actually work - would only be able to partly decarbonize the production process. By continuing production, they will have an obviously detrimental climatological impact given the continued emissions related to transporting and consuming oil.<br/><br/> If that weren't bad enough, recent research from Stanford and the University of British Columbia indicates SMRs may actually produce more radioactive waste than conventional nuclear reactors.<br/><br/> By subsidizing this effort, the government of Alberta is not so much taking one step forward and two steps back, as it is sprinting backwards and declaring itself leading the race.<br/><br/> It was a little more than ironic that the one person who actually advocated getting on the road to net zero was federal Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson. Ironic not least because he was almost immediately condemned by Smith for advocating precisely what the conference was supposed to be about (The theme was \"Energy Transition: The Path to Net Zero\"), but also because federal government subsidies to the oil and gas industry are precisely what's retarding Canada's ability to successfully transition off of fossil fuels.<br/><br/> Last year alone, federal subsidies were conservatively estimated to be over $20 billion, and that's not including the subsidies provided to oil majors for projects they've proposed as part of their carbon emission mitigation strategies.<br/><br/> Unless Canada also wishes to join the other petrostates and become an international pariah, we too have a responsibility to cease oil and gas production. Given that Alberta is both the sunniest and windiest province, it could be ground zero of the energy transition. But Smith has set the development of solar and wind power in Alberta back by a generation if her oil and gas industry-friendly moratorium on new sustainable energy development persists.<br/><br/> Creating unnecessary hurdles for the growing sustainable energy industry - all while subsidizing the unsustainable energy industry - is incompetent. That Smith is actively digging her province a deeper grave by picking pointless and ultimately fruitless fights with the federal government borders on the incomprehensible.<br/><br/> No good will come of this. Unfortunately for Canadians, the Supreme Court has determined the federal government does not have the right to set environmental policies for the benefit of all if it interferes with a given province's right to develop its resources.<br/><br/> Smith said, \"This is not an industry that's winding down. It's an industry that's transitioning away from emissions.\"<br/><br/> That's a complete and total fabrication. Emissions are increasing, and governments are using our money to subsidize it. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2023112869901513</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69RS-6291-JDV5-F00J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1269\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

This had been Canada's worst year for forest fires, and it is well-established that the tinderbox conditions of the great northern forests are one of the more immediate symptoms of the climate crisis.</p><p><br/><br/> As I waited for my ride, I noticed a sign for the Pathways Alliance, a consortium of tarsands producers aiming to continue oil production with the help of carbon capture technology.<br/><br/> Carbon capture is Big Oil's preferred \"climate solution.\" But its record is far from promising. It's heavily subsidized by government - public money that could, frankly, be better used to build solar plants and wind farms. Most carbon-capture projects have missed their targets, blown their budgets, and led to a net increase in emissions. That's not surprising, given carbon capture is a repurposing of an old technology called \"enhanced oil recovery.\" Its patina of environmental responsibility masks the fact carbon capture is almost exclusively used to produce more oil.<br/><br/> Which may explain why it was so popular amongst the Canadian delegates - both from industry and government - at the 24th World Petroleum Congress this past September: if the end of oil is nigh, they want the last barrel to come from Alberta.<br/><br/> I was hoping to catch a glimpse of the Rockies on the ride into town, but the smog was too thick. I did see the \"Calgary: Be Part of the Energy\" sign on the way in, however.<br/><br/> It's a memory that lingers this week, when the Alberta premier moved to use a Sovereignty Act to ward off Ottawa's efforts to green the country's energy.<br/><br/> Here's the thing: The disaster of climate change isn't a hypothetical problem that future generations of clever scientists will be forced to deal with. It is a clear and present danger, as much for the citizens of Calgary and Canada as the entire world.<br/><br/> However much trouble getting off oil might cause Ottawa from a constitutional vantage point, in terms of court battles with Alberta or other provinces, it pales in comparison to the trouble that delaying the energy transition will assuredly cause future generations of Canadians.<br/><br/> Given the International Energy Agency, among a host of other leading experts, all predict global oil demand will peak within this decade, and that the climate crisis is no longer a future hypothetical but a current reality, the energy transition is really less of an environmental question as it is one of national security. Maintaining our quality of life, keeping the country together, and growing our economy will be impossible if Canada is caught unprepared for the seismic shocks coming our way.<br/><br/> The September congress's big-league speakers - be they the CEOs of Kuwait Oil, Saudi Aramco or ExxonMobil - spent their time preaching to the choir of petroleum evangelists. They mocked a spate of recent reports that suggest peak global oil demand may be met before the end of this decade. Rather than discussing best practices and strategies for the sunsetting of the industry, they instead spent most of their time pontificating about the dangers of transitioning too fast, or adhering to arbitrary deadlines set by small groups of activists.<br/><br/> The problem isn't transitioning too fast: it's that the transition wasn't started long ago.<br/><br/> The deadlines aren't arbitrary: they represent a clear red line from which recovery, already doubtful, will likely be impossible.<br/><br/> And these deadlines haven't been set by activists, but by the international community.<br/><br/> And yet delegates were almost obnoxiously bullish on their future prospects. It was not uncommon for them to declare many decades of future growth, even while the engineers and analysts out on the exhibition room floor privately confided their concerns that theirs is a moribund industry dependent on rapidly evaporating public support.<br/><br/> Of all the evangelizers still preaching the gospel of fossil fuels, none were more enthusiastic than Alberta Premier Danielle Smith and her petroleum industry Kool-Aid sipping disciples, Brian Jean and Rebecca Shultz. The trio was on hand to show the government of Alberta remains resolutely in favour of continued oil and gas production, irrespective of whatever inconvenient truths may get in the way.<br/><br/>Alberta's major announcement at the Congress demonstrated this fully: a public subsidy to oil giant Cenovus - a company that made $6.5 billion in profit last year - so that it could study the use of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) to provide energy for the steam-assisted gravity drainage technique of recovering heavy oil from tarsands. The requirement of a constant supply of steam is energy-intensive. Rather than use the large quantities of natural gas that's available in situ, Cenovus's idea is that nuclear reactors could provide the energy, which they argued could help decarbonize production.<br/><br/> Cenovus reps were quick to point out that SMRs - if they actually work - would only be able to partly decarbonize the production process. By continuing production, they will have an obviously detrimental climatological impact given the continued emissions related to transporting and consuming oil.<br/><br/> If that weren't bad enough, recent research from Stanford and the University of British Columbia indicates SMRs may actually produce more radioactive waste than conventional nuclear reactors.<br/><br/> By subsidizing this effort, the government of Alberta is not so much taking one step forward and two steps back, as it is sprinting backwards and declaring itself leading the race.<br/><br/> It was a little more than ironic that the one person who actually advocated getting on the road to net zero was federal Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson. Ironic not least because he was almost immediately condemned by Smith for advocating precisely what the conference was supposed to be about (The theme was \"Energy Transition: The Path to Net Zero\"), but also because federal government subsidies to the oil and gas industry are precisely what's retarding Canada's ability to successfully transition off of fossil fuels.<br/><br/> Last year alone, federal subsidies were conservatively estimated to be over $20 billion, and that's not including the subsidies provided to oil majors for projects they've proposed as part of their carbon emission mitigation strategies.<br/><br/> Unless Canada also wishes to join the other petrostates and become an international pariah, we too have a responsibility to cease oil and gas production. Given that Alberta is both the sunniest and windiest province, it could be ground zero of the energy transition. But Smith has set the development of solar and wind power in Alberta back by a generation if her oil and gas industry-friendly moratorium on new sustainable energy development persists.<br/><br/> Creating unnecessary hurdles for the growing sustainable energy industry - all while subsidizing the unsustainable energy industry - is incompetent. That Smith is actively digging her province a deeper grave by picking pointless and ultimately fruitless fights with the federal government borders on the incomprehensible.<br/><br/> No good will come of this. Unfortunately for Canadians, the Supreme Court has determined the federal government does not have the right to set environmental policies for the benefit of all if it interferes with a given province's right to develop its resources.<br/><br/> Smith said, \"This is not an industry that's winding down. It's an industry that's transitioning away from emissions.\"<br/><br/> That's a complete and total fabrication. Emissions are increasing, and governments are using our money to subsidize it. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2023112869901173</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69RR-HPJ1-JDV5-F04C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1269\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

That order has also been lifted.</p><p>\"Pursuant to the BC Emergency Program Act, the (evacuation order) in the Tzenzaicut Lake Area issued on Saturday, May 20, 2023 at 10:30 p.m. is being rescinded by the Cariboo Regional District at the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC).\"</p><p>The CRD reminded all involved that conditions may change quickly, so be prepared for that possibility.</p><p>When returning to the area, said emergency officials, there are cautions to be aware of, such as:</p><p>Please watch for livestock and wildlife on roads.</p><p>Residents should be aware that there may be danger trees in wildfire-affected areas. Danger trees on Crown land will be dealt with by the BC Wildfire Service danger-tree fallers. Homeowners and private land owners are recommended to work with an insurance agency to have an assessment done by a qualified arborist.</p><p>Wildfires remain active and firefighting activities continue in the area. It is important for residents to stay out of active wildfire areas. Interfering in an active fire area will result in crews ceasing ground and air operations potentially endangering nearby properties.</p><p>Residents must be prepared in the event that the area receives a future evacuation order or alert on short notice. Local governments may not have time to go door to door should a new evacuation order be issued.</p><p>It is also important to note that air quality may remain poor as a result of smoke from nearby fire activity. Those with respiratory issues, small children and the elderly should consider this before they choose to return to the area.</p><p>Residents returning to the area are encouraged to register for the Cariboo Chilcotin Emergency Notification System to receive a text, call or email regarding Evacuation Alerts and Orders: cariboord.ca/CRDEmergsignup</p><p>For Cariboo Regional District information, please visit cariboord.ca/EOC or facebook.com/CRDEmergencyOperations or @CaribooRD or call the CRD's emergency information line at 1-866-759-4977 (8:30 a.m. \u2013 4:30 p.m. every weekday).</p><p>Copyright 2023 Quesnel Cariboo Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20230523PQC4473773</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:689B-V831-JD2C-J0PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"516\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

By evening, the city's air quality ranked among the world's worst, at times ahead of even Lahore, Pakistan, which was labelled the planet's most polluted city in 2022, according to IQ Air, a global air quality tracker.</p><p><br/><br/> Across the GTA, the haze resulted in cancelled recreational sports, postponed school field trips and notices sent to parents that schoolchildren would begin spending recess indoors on Wednesday, including across the York Region District School Board. The Toronto District School Board advised parents late Tuesday that \"all strenuous outdoor activities, including athletic events\" on Wednesday and Thursday would be rescheduled or moved indoors.<br/><br/> By Tuesday evening, Toronto's air quality health index (AQHI) had climbed from a level 3 recorded that morning - which is considered \"low risk\" - to a level 7 out of 10, \"high risk\" territory. It's expected to hover at levels 6 and 7 at least through to Thursday. <br/><br/> But it's unclear when the smoke will dissipate. <br/><br/> \"It's going to get worse before it gets better,\" Environment Canada senior climatologist David Phillips said. He expects conditions to worsen Wednesday  as smoke from Quebec and Ontario merge. <br/><br/> It will be hard to immediately recognize when the smoke's fully gone as its intensity may vary by the hour and location across the city, Phillips said, adding to expect more of the same this summer as the forecast is calling for drier and warmer weather than usual. <br/><br/> At times, the thick haze hanging over Ottawa nearly obscured the sun. The air quality index reading for the capital city was above a level 10 on Tuesday morning, indicating a \"very high risk\" to health.<br/><br/> Meanwhile, forest fires are burning in most provinces and territories. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre says there are 415 fires currently burning and more than 2,280 fires have burned 37,000 square kilometres so far this year. Wildfires in Quebec and southeastern Ontario over the weekend caused thousands  to be evacuated from their homes.<br/><br/> And with summer still two weeks away, Canada is already on pace for its most devastating wildfire season on record,driven in part by climate change delivering conditions conducive to more frequent and severe wildfires.<br/><br/> In a statement to the Star Tuesday, Toronto Public Health (TPH) said it had not yet advised the city to cancel events due to the smoke. However, it encouraged recreational organizers to consider the city's current air quality when deciding whether to proceed with events.<br/><br/> According to TPH, exposure to air pollutants like wildfire smoke can cause irritated eyes, increased mucus production, coughing and difficulty breathing.<br/><br/> Jeff Brook, an associate professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health and Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, recommended wearing an N95 mask to minimize the smoke's impacts. But even a standard surgical mask would help, he added.<br/><br/> With files from Joshua Chong, Steve McKinley and The Canadian Press <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023060768112265</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DG-KNP1-F197-508D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

By evening, the city's air quality ranked among the world's worst, at times ahead of even Lahore, Pakistan, which was labelled the planet's most polluted city in 2022, according to IQ Air, a global air quality tracker.</p><p>Across the GTA, the haze resulted in cancelled recreational sports, postponed school field trips and notices sent to parents that schoolchildren would begin spending recess indoors on Wednesday, including across the York Region District School Board. The Toronto District School Board advised parents late Tuesday that \"all strenuous outdoor activities, including athletic events\" on Wednesday and Thursday would be rescheduled or moved indoors.</p><p>By Tuesday evening, Toronto's air quality health index (AQHI) had climbed from a level 3 recorded that morning - which is considered \"low risk\" - to a level 7 out of 10, \"high risk\" territory. It's expected to hover at levels 6 and 7 at least through to Thursday.</p><p>But it's unclear when the smoke will dissipate.</p><p>\"It's going to get worse before it gets better,\" Environment Canada senior climatologist David Phillips said. He expects conditions to worsen Wednesday as smoke from Quebec and Ontario merge.</p><p>It will be hard to immediately recognize when the smoke's fully gone as its intensity may vary by the hour and location across the city, Phillips said, adding to expect more of the same this summer as the forecast is calling for drier and warmer weather than usual.</p><p>At times, the thick haze hanging over Ottawa nearly obscured the sun. The air quality index reading for the capital city was above a level 10 on Tuesday morning, indicating a \"very high risk\" to health.</p><p>Meanwhile, forest fires are burning in most provinces and territories. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre says there are 415 fires currently burning and more than 2,280 fires have burned 37,000 square kilometres so far this year. Wildfires in Quebec and southeastern Ontario over the weekend caused thousands to be evacuated from their homes.</p><p>And with summer still two weeks away, Canada is already on pace for its most devastating wildfire season on record,driven in part by climate change delivering conditions conducive to more frequent and severe wildfires.</p><p>In a statement to the Star Tuesday, Toronto Public Health (TPH) said it had not yet advised the city to cancel events due to the smoke. However, it encouraged recreational organizers to consider the city's current air quality when deciding whether to proceed with events.</p><p>According to TPH, exposure to air pollutants like wildfire smoke can cause irritated eyes, increased mucus production, coughing and difficulty breathing.</p><p>Jeff Brook, an associate professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health and Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, recommended wearing an N95 mask to minimize the smoke's impacts. But even a standard surgical mask would help, he added.</p><p>With files from Joshua Chong, Steve McKinley and The Canadian Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20230607TTA2023060768112265</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DG-3C41-JDV5-F41T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"525\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

A smog warning is in effect over large swaths of Quebec, including in Montreal, due to smoke from the forest fires. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2023060668098901</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68D8-MHT1-JDV5-F2J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 6, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008X9G</classCode><className>POPULATION DENSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001627</classCode><className>STATISTICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST00096SZ</classCode><className>PRESS CONFERENCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000CY7S</classCode><className>TRAILER PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DB9B</classCode><className>JUSTIN TRUDEAU</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX060</classCode><className>TORONTO, ON, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX052</classCode><className>OTTAWA, ON, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS176</classCode><className>QUEBEC, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS171</classCode><className>NEWFOUNDLAND &amp; LABRADOR, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Confinement means residents are strongly advised to stay indoors with windows closed.</p><p>No injuries have been reported so far. </p><p>The fire is located in a steep and craggy mountain area with pine trees, with several municipalities on its flanks, including El Rosario, Arafo and Candelaria to the east, and La Orotava to the west. Access for firefighters is extremely difficult.</p><p>Television images and videos posted on social media have showed the flames coming down a hill close to houses in small neighborhoods and a massive cloud of smoke rising from the area.</p><p>Candelaria mayor Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n Brito N\u00fa\u00f1ez told Spanish National Television that firefighters complained that the water being dumped on the flames was evaporating before hitting the ground because of the high temperatures.</p><p>The army\u2019s Military Emergency Unit said that dense clouds of smoke were impairing visibility for firefighters and preventing many water-carrying aircraft from getting close.</p><p>Army Capt. Rafael San Jos\u00e9 told Spanish National Television that some progress had been made overnight in stopping the fire's spread but that rising temperatures during the day would increase difficulties.</p><p>Favorable conditions Friday in the town of El Rosario prompted authorities to lift the confinement call for half of the 3,800 residents there.</p><p>The Canary Islands have been in drought for most of the past few years, just like most of mainland Spain. The islands have recorded below-average rainfall in recent years, because of changing weather patterns impacted by climate change.</p><p>The fire is said to have scorched more than 3,200 hectares, or 7,900 acres. </p><p>Regional President Fernando Clavijo said Friday\u2019s efforts would be crucial to containing the fire. The air quality in several municipalities remains hazardous and vulnerable people are advised not to leave their homes, he said.</p><p>The north of the island was forecast to have a maximum temperature of 30 degrees Celsius (84 F) Friday with light winds, (20 kph/12 mph) but temperatures were set to rise over the weekend.</p><p>Regional government meteorologist Vicky Palma told reporters that temperatures of up to 34 degrees Celsius (93 F) will be reached Saturday in the wildfire area, and temperatures will continue to rise on Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>The flames cover a perimeter of 40 kilometers (25 miles) encircling some 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) of land. Nearly 600 firefighters and Spanish army soldiers are in the area, which is in the northeast of the island, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from its main town, Santa Cruz.</p><p>Tenerife is one of Europe's main tourist destinations. Its tourism office stressed Thursday that the most important tourist areas are far from the fire. Business continues as usual in accommodation establishments, beaches and other tourist sites near the coast and in the midlands, the office said. </p><p>But access to the Teide National Park, the most important tourist attraction in Tenerife after the beaches, was closed Thursday evening and all tourist facilities around the Teide volcano area, including accommodation, were to be evacuated.</p><p>Clavijo claimed the fire was the worst in 40 years. He said the combination of extreme temperatures and the fire had turned the area into a virtual oven. </p><p>The seven-island archipelago is located off the northwest coast of Africa and southwest of mainland Spain.</p><p>More than 2,000 people were evacuated in a wildfire on the nearby La Palma island last month that affected some 4,500 hectares (11,000 acres).</p><p>According to the latest figures from the European Forest Fire Information System, Spain heads the list of EU countries affected by wildfires so far this years, with 75,000 hectares ( 185,000 acres) burned, ahead of Italy and Greece. </p><p>Spain accounted for almost 40% of the nearly 800,00 hectares (2 million acres) burned in the European Union in 2022, the EU agency said.</p><p>____</p><p>Ciar\u00e1n Giles in Madrid contributed to this story.

A smog warning is in effect over large swaths of Quebec, including in Montreal, due to smoke from the forest fires. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2023060668099122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68D8-MHT1-JDV5-F2MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

The next update on the highway's status will be at 6 p.m. on Aug. 18.</p><p>Chapman said flames were far exceeding the height of the trees in the area, which he estimated to be between 150 and 200 feet tall.</p><p>The fire began in the Fraser Valley Regional District (FVRD), which declared a state of local emergency in Area \"A\".

It includes things like encouraging active transportation planning, forest fire mitigation, improving electrical grids, supporting local farming and food security groups, composting, and protecting watersheds, among other measures.</p><p>The plan contains no new tax increases or bylaw changes, but rather is \"a guidance document, not a regulatory document, and the intention of the plan is to provide staff with direction to engage with [the community] on key areas where we don't have solutions\u2026,\" said sustainability planner Paris Marshall Smith.</p><p>The action plan is the product of several years of meetings and community consultation with various stakeholders, and was due to be adopted by the board at the April meeting.</p><p>But after two poorly advertised and attended public consultation meetings in March, concern started to grow among some residents about the plan. At least one petition began circulating calling on the regional district to hold more public consultation meetings, and residents came to the monthly board meeting to push for a delay.</p><p>Board vice-chair Diane Lockwood thanked the public for coming to hear the debate, and asked people to be constructive when offering feedback on the plan.</p><p>\"They can write down, not just that they don't like it, but what they actually want to see or what they wouldn't like to see. It would be really helpful for all of us directors who hear this kind of thing\u2026,\" she said. \"We're elected because of you, we want to hear from you, and that's how we work.\"</p><p>It will be up to local area directors to work with staff to settle the time and place for meetings in their local areas. The issue hasn't generated a lot of controversy for some directors, while others like Area H's Walter Popoff said he was going to request up to six meetings for the public to discuss the action plan.</p><p>READ MORE: RDCK director pushes back against petition opposed to Climate Action Plan</p><p>Copyright 2023 Nelson Star</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20230505PKO4467156</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:685H-C1B1-JD2C-J409-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice,\" states the advisory.<br/><br/> Monday's weather forecast calls for a high of 23C and a mix of sun and clouds, dropping to 11C overnight with a 40 per cent chance of showers and the risk of a thunderstorm. For Tuesday, a high of 23C and sunny, with a chance of north winds gusting 20 to 40 km per hour, followed by a nighttime low of 8C and clear. The forecasts also includes the possibility of smoke in the air.<br/><br/> \"People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.\"<br/><br/> Environment Canada recommends using MERV filters in your home's HVAC system (rated 13 or higher) and set furnace fans to recirculate air inside. Keep doors and windows closed if the temperature in the home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Other tips provided by Environment Canada include:<br/><br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p> For relief, go to places in the community with clean, cool air.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/><br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p> A well-fitting respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face can help reduce exposure to fine particles in smoke.

Nouris said he has spoken to the Egyptian ambassador to Cyprus and that arrangements will be made to repatriate the remains.</p><p>Odou community chief Menelaos Philippou told state-run Cyprus News agency the four men who worked at a greenhouse that grew tomatoes tried to flee the fire along a mountain road, but their small truck veered off the road and crashed down an embankment. They then try to flee on foot but didn't make it. </p><p>President Nicos Anastasiades called the fire \u201can unprecedented tragedy\" except for the destruction wreaked by a 1974 war that split the island along ethnic lines after Turkey invaded in response to a coup aimed at union with Greece. </p><p>Greek and Israeli aircraft joined 11 other planes and helicopters in firefighting efforts Sunday afternoon. </p><p>Despondent residents who saw their homes go up in flames vented anger at what they called authorities' slow response. Anastasiades, who toured the fire-hit villages, pledged immediate government help to farmers and homeowners who lost crops and property and the families of those who perished in the fire. </p><p>Police said a 67-year-old man faces arson charges. A court ordered that he remain in custody for eight days to assist the investigation into the cause of the fire. </p><p>Nouris said firefighting aircraft and ground crews focused their efforts Sunday on two massive fire fronts between the villages of Odou and Vavatsinia.</p><p>Government deputy spokeswoman Niovi Parissinou said some of the fire-afflicted villages were later declared safe and residents could return home. She said fire crews would remain on alert all night to prevent a possible resurgence of the blaze.</p><p> Fire officials said the entire department had mobilized to fight the fire, including 70 fire engines, seven bulldozers and 10 water tankers. Many volunteers also rushed to help.</p><p>Two helicopters from British military bases in Cyprus also helped firefighting efforts, along with two GreekCanadair CL-415 aircraft and two Israeli fixed-wing planes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-369686e4b84eab1b86400f6bfaf7e16e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:632K-3VG1-JBVR-3070-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"487\"/><timeReceived>01:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 4, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This follows evacuations in some parts of Quebec over the weekend.</p><p>Smoke from wildfires can drift hundreds of kilometres and air quality can fluctuate, Environment Canada reports.</p><p>\"Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice,\" states the advisory.</p><p>Monday's weather forecast calls for a high of 23C and a mix of sun and clouds, dropping to 11C overnight with a 40 per cent chance of showers and the risk of a thunderstorm. For Tuesday, a high of 23C and sunny, with a chance of north winds gusting 20 to 40 km per hour, followed by a nighttime low of 8C and clear. The forecasts also includes the possibility of smoke in the air.</p><p>\"People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.\"</p><p>Environment Canada recommends using MERV filters in your home's HVAC system (rated 13 or higher) and set furnace fans to recirculate air inside. Keep doors and windows closed if the temperature in the home is comfortable.</p><p>Other tips provided by Environment Canada include:</p><p>For relief, go to places in the community with clean, cool air.</p><p>A well-fitting respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face can help reduce exposure to fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest health risk.</p><p>Respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke.</p><p>Reduce or stop activities if you experience symptoms.</p><p>Check on vulnerable loved ones and people around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.</p><p>Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense or candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping.</p><p>If you experience stress, anxiety, or depression, contact a mental health care provider for advice or visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA\">https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-news20230605TPEW0ab40ad8e89a4075a561ee5462be188f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68D4-F711-JDV5-F211-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario) Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 5, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

She wore sensible shoes, she had adequate clothing for the weather, and she had extra food and water to get her through.</p><p>She walked out on her own steam Thursday evening, after days of exhaustive searching by dozens of volunteers.</p><p>While this outcome was everything searchers could have hoped for, with Wang returned uninjured to her family, not all cases work out so well on the local mountains and trails.</p><p>RELATED: Missing teen spent 54 hours lost in Golden Ears Provincial Park</p><p>READ MORE: Esther is alive \u2013 girl missing in Golden Ears park is safe</p><p>Heading into the Canada Day long weekend, when hundreds will hit local trails (whether in the forest or other areas of local wilderness), it's a good time for a few friendly and helpful reminders, said Ryan Smith, team manager for the Ridge Meadows Search &amp; Rescue.</p><p>Sometimes by accident, other times through no fault of their own, people do get lost.</p><p>As the happy news of Wang's safe return was officially shared Friday morning, the local search team offered a few tips for those going out in the backcountry.</p><p>If a person gets lost, they need to avoid panicking \u2013 stay calm, rescuers advise above all else.</p><p>As obvious as this may sound, most people who become lost in the wilderness stop thinking straight and quite often make the situation worse.</p><p>Stop moving and stay put, searchers insist.</p><p>As soon as a person realizes their lost, stop moving. It is far easier for search and rescue personnel to locate people if they stay in one location. Generally, people who keep moving wander farther from the trail and go deeper into the backcountry, rescuers note from experience.</p><p>People need to ensure they have the '10 Essentials' and to provide a trip plan to someone, including where they're going and when they are going to be returning, so that they can call authorities if they are overdue, said Smith.</p><p>The 10 Essentials:</p><p>Flashlight and spare batteries</p><p>Extra food and water</p><p>Extra clothing</p><p>Navigational aids</p><p>Fire starter</p><p>First-aid kit</p><p>Emergency shelter</p><p>Sun protection</p><p>Pocket knife</p><p>Signaling device</p><p>It's wise, where possible, to seek or make shelter, searchers note.</p><p>Because a prepared hiker has packed the 10 essentials, they should have everything needed to create a reasonably dry shelter. If there is no emergency tarp, it is suggested they look for a dry area near the base of a tree or under a log. It can be critically important that people stay out of the rain or snow.</p><p>Building a fire where possible is helpful on several fronts. Fires are not only a source of heat and comfort, but can help occupy a lost or injured hiker's time and mind. Being lost is not an excuse for starting a forest fire, however, so emergency responders advise using great care if building a fire.</p><p>It can also help with visibility, sometimes from air or from ground \u2013 and that can be critical to locate a missing person. It also helps to use a whistle or other signalling device to help rescuers or other backcountry users to find people.</p><p>For more information or tips, people can see BeAdventureSmart suggestions on the Ridge Meadows Search &amp; Rescue website at rmsar.bc.ca.</p><p>.</p><p>Is there more to the story?

Interior will likely look very different in a year's time and beyond as life returns to the wildfire-ravaged landscape, ecologists predict.<br/><br/> An eruption of low plants, grasses, and shrubs will turn the hills green. Birds and small mammals, as well as deer and bears, will return to feast on berries and other plant life. Carnivores including cougars could move in.</p><p><br/><br/> But the tall trees destroyed by the fires may never recover or return, said Robert Gray, a wildland fire ecologist.<br/><br/> \"When you look at West Kelowna, it's really rocky, steep ground and trees aren't going to come back very well there. There is not a lot of moisture in the soil and it's only going to get drier with climate change,\" said Gray. \"A lot of that landscape may not see a lot of trees come back.\"<br/><br/> Gray said that by next June, people should expect to see \"an explosion of shrubs, grasses, and herbs\" sprouting from the ruined forest.<br/><br/> \"What will happen on that landscape is you'll get a lot of shrubs. Grasses will come back and that's good for a while,\" said Gray.<br/><br/> \"Nature is amazing. It's resilience ... there are so many plants that are adapted to fire. They need fire on a regular basis, so they will reoccupy those areas,\" said Gray.<br/><br/> For instance, shrub species in the wildfire zone already had seeds deeply buried in the soil, and were waiting for heat or fire to germinate them, Gray said.<br/><br/> Tree recovery is a different matter. \"Unless you intentionally plant these areas, they're not likely to have a lot of trees in the future,\" said Gray. <br/><br/> Okanagan residents are no strangers to catastrophic wildfires.<br/><br/> In 2003, the Okanagan Mountain Park fire forced the evacuation of thousands of people and destroyed hundreds of properties. It also transformed the landscape.<br/><br/> Tara Bergeson, an urban forestry supervisor with the City of Kelowna, said the 2003 fire that scorched the park and the city was \"very severe and has had a lasting impact on the landbase.\"<br/><br/> \"Little regeneration has occurred in much of the area, and we may not see trees return in a timely way or at all. Currently, much of the area remains as shrubs and grassland,\" Bergeson wrote in an email.<br/><br/> Recently burned trees, weakened but clinging to life, can attract bark beetles and other insects, Gray said.<br/><br/> \"These little beetles, they'll burrow into the tree and they will lay their eggs, and when the young larvae grow they will basically kill the tree,\" said Gray.<br/><br/> In about five to eight years, dead trees will start to break apart.<br/><br/> Gray said situations like these will pose significant fire risks, especially with ongoing climate change making things drier and hotter. He said prescribed burns would be important in such areas to limit future wildfires.<br/><br/> Ken Lertzman, professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University's School of resource and environmental management, said some small animals can thrive after fires, such as bluebirds, hawks, owls and woodpeckers. \"They can really take advantage of that particular mix of resources that are available in those very young, open forests,\" said Lertzman.<br/><br/> Gray agreed, saying recently burned, open forest ground with plenty of grasses and shrubs could be a food heaven for animals.<br/><br/> \"Now it's open and there are grasses and herbs and shrubs and berries and nuts, there is so much to eat,\" said Gray. A diverse shrub community with berries would attract visitors including deer, elk and bears, and insects and birds would be drawn to flowers, added Gray. <br/><br/> Lertzman said the length of forest regeneration depends on many factors, ranging from soil conditions to temperatures.<br/><br/> Generally speaking, it took 40 to 60 years for young forests to get established and at least 100 years for mature forests to return, said Lertzman, adding that forests recovering from fire represented a natural cycle. <br/><br/> \"In the B.C. Interior and lots of forests around the world, the forest fire is part of the evolutionary history of the forest,\" said Lertzman.<br/><br/> However, Gray said it would not necessarily be a bad thing if many trees did not come back.<br/><br/> \"If we get the similar forest back, then it will just burn again,\" he said.<br/><br/> \"On that landscape, you definitely want fewer trees because the more trees, you have more drought and then it weakens the trees and insects kill the trees. And then fire occurs, so we want fewer trees there,\" said Gray.<br/><br/> The Canadian Press <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023090368941127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6938-2001-JDV5-F38K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

The RFZ is active until further notice.  </p><p>At their meeting on June 19, Limerick Township council heard from Fire Chief Greg Maxwell, who suggested that the minimum municipal fine for having an open air fire during the total fire ban that is currently on be increased to $500, or even higher, as there were some people who still had open air fires during the ban. Council discussed it and ultimately decided that an even higher fine would be appropriate, at $1,000 minimum fine. Under their updated fire service fee bylaw, 2023-20, passed on June 19, the minimum fine for an open air fire during a total fire ban is $1,000 and the maximum fine is $5,000. There are also the costs associated with fighting any fire that arises from an open-air fire started during this ban, which could go into thousands of dollars more. The full bylaw can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.limerick.ca/news-notices/update-fire-bylaw-2023-20/\">www.limerick.ca/news-notices/update-fire-bylaw-2023-20/</url>. </p><p>Even with these municipal fines for not adhering to the total fire ban, there are also consequences for ignoring the RTZ put in place by the province due to the dry conditions; a $25,000 fine, three months in jail and financial responsibility for any costs incurred fighting the resultant forest fire.   </p><p>The RFZ is an order by the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry under the Forest Fires Prevention Act that restricts the use of any open fires in a specific area of the province. The current RFZ was enacted because of the extreme fire situation and hazard that northern and central Ontario have been facing, and is a temporary measure to negate preventable fires caused by humans while conditions remain perilous for forest and landscape fires.  </p><p>Under the RFZ, portable gas or propane stoves may be used for cooking and warmth but with extreme caution, and all burning permits are suspended. Even with the rains that have occurred, lightning often comes with it, and can ignite a fire under the forest floor, and according to the province, once the weather dries up, winds pick up and temperatures rebound, those holdover lightning fires can appear up to a week later.  </p><p>According to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ontario.ca/page/forest-fires\">www.ontario.ca/page/forest-fires</url>, there have been 279 fires so far this year, compared to just 87 fires last year, and a 10-year average of 207 forest fires.   </p><p>Tudor and Cashel Township also had a message posted on their Facebook page from their Fire Chief Jason Gear on June 20, about the RFZ and municipal fire ban, advising residents that although they were getting some rain in areas, others are not, and to adhere to the fire ban.   </p><p>\u201cEven with the heavy rain, it runs away and does not penetrate the ground floor. Areas are still very dry. Please obey the restriction put in place by the province to mitigate risk. Area 29 and 36 covers all of Madoc Township and Tudor and Cashel [as well as Limerick Township and Bancroft]. Provincial fire bans supersede municipal bans,\u201d he says. \u201cFines for burning can be $25,000 and time in jail.

The premier of Alberta, whose own province has been ravaged by fierce flames this season, played down that connection in an interview with CTV News today, and instead focusing on the clash with Ottawa over new draft regulations on generating environmentally friendly electricity. Premier Smith thanks so much for joining us. You've been vocal about your opposition to these new regulations, even going so far as calling them unconstitutional. If you feel so strongly, why not immediately invoke the sovereignty act which your government passed and take the federal government to court?</p><p>DANIELLE SMITH (Alberta Premier): Well, look, I've been trying to work with the federal government to align their aspirations with what we think is realistic. We put forward our emissions reduction energy development plan which talks about being carbon neutral by 2050. When I talk to everybody in the electricity business, they think that that's achievable. But trying to achieve these targets by 2035, I'm hearing numbers in the order of $200 to $400 billion that it would cost us here, and it doesn't address our issues of reliability. So we have to operate in the real world, and in the real world we need a realistic plan. That's what I want to work with the federal government on.</p><p>SACHEDINA: Now the federal government says the 2035 timeline is realistic and you are saying that's too soon, insisting on 2050 timeline. You used the word diplomacy in your news conference today, and sometimes that involves compromise. Is there a date between 2035 and 2050 you'd be open to? And if so, what is it?</p><p>SMITH: Well the first thing I would say is that we have to have the generators. They're going to be the ones who have to implement it on the ground. And there are some like Capital Power that has been very open, that they think they can achieve that target by 2045. There are approval processes that take place. There's making sure the technology works. There's a regulatory approval process. There's the actual construction time. And that's why we think 2050 is the more realistic target. We can get there.</p><p>SACHEDINA: You just a few minutes ago mentioned 2045. If the feds came back with that date, would your province sign on?</p><p>SMITH: Well I want to make sure, that's only one company that I had mentioned. We have several big power players in our province, and I want to make sure we're in alignment with all of them.</p><p>SACHEDINA: We are having this discussion, of course, at a time when there are critical conversations around the world on climate change. Much of the country, including your province, has been ravaged by wildfires this season. Do you believe there is a connection to climate change?</p><p>SMITH: Well, look, everybody is on target on 2050. That was decided a couple of years ago at COP 26, and so all of the industrialized provinces are moving in that direction for exactly that reason. Everybody knows that we need to reduce emissions. But I'm also watching that China is a billion plus population, they don't have a target until 2060. India, as I understand it, doesn't have a target until 2070.</p><p>SACHEDINA: But in terms of a link, Premier, do you believe that climate change and the unprecedented wildfires we've been seeing this summer are at all related?</p><p>SMITH: All I know is in my province we had 650 fires and 500 of them were human caused. So we have to make sure that when people know that it's dry out there and we get into forest fire season that they're being a lot more careful, because any time you end up with an ignition that happens, it can have devastating consequences. And so that's what are I would hope we can educate the public on that front as well.</p><p>SACHEDINA: All right, Premier Smith, thank you, appreciate your time.</p><p>SMITH: My pleasure. Talk to you again.</p><p>SACHEDINA: And you can see the full interview with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith on our website at ctvnews.ca.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68Y5-BCJ1-DYX2-93NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CTV Televisions, Inc.

A further 2,500 were forced to flee their homes from another fire in Shelburne County, 150 km southwest of Halifax, which has burned 17,186 hectares. That fire has become the largest forest fire in Nova Scotia's history.<br/><br/> Forecasts for Wednesday indicated winds were coming from the south, which typically brings low-humidity conditions. That's significant, said David Steeves of the province's Department of Natural Resources, because of the crossover, which occurs when the relative humidity, expressed as a percentage, approaches or drops below the temperature in degrees Celsius. <br/><br/> In Nova Scotia, the relative humidity is predicted to drop below 20 per cent over the next few days, while the temperature is projected to be 20 to 25 C. Steeves said the crossover is \"an indicator of extreme fire behaviour\" - accelerated movement or expansion.<br/><br/> The term is a guideline for fire managers, says Chelene Hanes, a wildland fire research scientist for the Canadian Forest Service, alerting them to potential changes to how fires may start and move.<br/><br/> A wildfire's behaviour depends on three major factors, said Hanes: weather, topography and fuel. When the weather is dry and hot, \"that's where you get these small ignitions and when that stuff is really dry, it can sustain that flaming, so it helps to move that fire along.\"<br/><br/> When the wind begins to push a fire, feeding it new, dry fuel as it goes along, a blaze can rapidly grow to the point where battling it head-on becomes unsafe for firefighters and they have to get out of the way and resort to picking away at its flanks.<br/><br/> And when a fire gets really big, it can  create its own weather.<br/><br/> Even on a smaller scale, large fires can make their own wind by convection. That fire draught can increase wind's speed, helping a fire grow even faster by giving it more oxygen, said Mike Flannigan, professor of wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, B.C.<br/><br/> But when a fire gets to a certain size and intensity - like those in Fort McMurray in 2016 and elsewhere in Alberta this year - it can create what's called a fire-generated thunderstorm, also known as pyroCb for pyrocumulonimbus. From Flannigan's observations, the Shelburne County fire is of a size to develop its own pyroCb, given the right conditions.<br/><br/> \"In the fire and the combustion process, there's heat, but there's also moisture being released. It's almost like you're going through the water cycle, air rises, cools, condenses, forms clouds, and that eventually develops into a thunderstorm.\"<br/><br/> Sometimes, that storm creates rain and hail, which may help put the fire out. But it can also create lightning, starting new fires. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023060168053232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68C6-SV01-JDV5-F229-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"530\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Interior will likely look very different in a year's time and beyond as life returns to the wildfire-ravaged landscape, ecologists predict.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An eruption of low plants, grasses, and shrubs will turn the hills green. Birds and small mammals, as well as deer and bears, will return to feast on berries and other plant life. Carnivores including cougars could move in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the tall trees destroyed by the fires may never recover or return, said Robert Gray, a wildland fire ecologist.</p><p>\u201cWhen you look at West Kelowna, it\u2019s really rocky, steep ground and trees aren\u2019t going to come back very well there. There is not a lot of moisture in the soil and it\u2019s only going to get drier with climate change,\u201d said Gray. \u201cA lot of that landscape may not see a lot of trees come back.\u201d</p><p>Gray said that by next June, people should expect to see \u201can explosion of shrubs, grasses, and herbs\u201d sprouting from the ruined forest.</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen on that landscape is you'll get a lot of shrubs. Grasses will come back and that\u2019s good for a while,\u201d said Gray.</p><p>\u201cNature is amazing. It\u2019s resilience...there are so many plants that are adapted to fire. They need fire on a regular basis, so they will re-occupy those areas,\u201d said Gray.</p><p>For instance, shrub species in the wildfire zone already had seeds deeply buried in the soil, and were waiting for heat or fire to germinate them, Gray said.</p><p>Tree recovery is a different matter.</p><p>\"Unless you intentionally plant these areas, they're not likely to have a lot of trees in the future,\" said Gray. </p><p>Okanagan residents are no strangers to catastrophic wildfires.</p><p>In 2003, the Okanagan Mountain Park fire forced the evacuation of thousands of people and destroyed hundreds of properties. It also transformed the landscape.</p><p>Tara Bergeson, an urban forestry supervisor with the City of Kelowna, said the 2003 fire that scorched the park and the city was \u201cvery severe and has had a lasting impact on the landbase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle regeneration has occurred in much of the area, and we may not see trees return in a timely way or at all. Currently, much of the area remains as shrubs and grassland,\u201d Bergeson wrote in an email.</p><p>Recently burned trees, weakened but clinging to life, can attract bark beetles and other insects, Gray said.</p><p>\u201cThese little beetles, they'll burrow into the tree and they will lay their eggs, and when the young larvae grow they will basically kill the tree,\u201d said Gray.</p><p>In about five to eight years, dead trees will start to break apart.</p><p>Gray said situations like these will pose significant fire risks, especially with ongoing climate change making things drier and hotter. He said prescribed burns would be important in such areas to limit future wildfires.</p><p>Ken Lertzman, professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University's School of resource and environmental management, said some small animals can thrive after fires, such as bluebirds, hawks, owls and woodpeckers.</p><p>\u201cThey can really take advantage of that particular mix of resources that are available in those very young, open forests,\u201d said Lertzman.</p><p>Gray agreed, saying recently burned, open forest ground with plenty of grasses and shrubs could be a food heaven for animals.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s open and there are grasses and herbs and shrubs and berries and nuts, there is so much to eat,\u201d said Gray. A diverse shrub community with berries would attract visitors including deer, elk and bears, and insects and birds would be drawn to flowers, added Gray. </p><p>Lertzman said the length of forest regeneration depends on many factors, ranging from soil conditions to temperatures.</p><p>Generally speaking, it took 40 to 60 years for young forests to get established and at least 100 years for mature forests to return, said Lertzman, adding that forests recovering from fire represented a natural cycle. </p><p>\u201cIn the B.C. Interior and lots of forests around the world, the forest fire is part of the evolutionary history of the forest,\u201d said Lertzman.</p><p>However, Gray said it would not necessarily be a bad thing if many trees did not come back.</p><p>\u201cIf we get the similar forest back, then it will just burn again,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOn that landscape, you definitely want fewer trees because the more trees, you have more drought and then it weakens the trees and insects kill the trees. And then fire occurs, so we want fewer trees there,\u201d said Gray.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sep. 2, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-8ad4d44c9e7a4367af34eef960ecc952</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6932-04R1-JBVR-30D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"733\"/><timeReceived>04:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 2, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It's an area where firefighters were already battling the province's largest forest fire ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVE ROCKWOOD (Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources): This thing has been getting up and rolling like a freight train.</p><p>SACHEDINA: In another area outside Halifax, this is what the damage looks like from the air. You can see the burned sections from the sky. CTV's Atlantic bureau chief Creeson Agecoutay has the latest.</p><p>CREESON AGECOUTAY (Reporter): Nearly 20,000 people have been forced from their homes in Nova Scotia, with a new evacuation order issued tonight in Shelburne County. That fire is now the largest in the province's history, growing larger each day, destroying homes and infrastructure.</p><p>TIM HOUSTON (Nova Scotia Premier): To anyone who's a human being, who can see the suffering that's happening to Nova Scotians right now, that we're looking for help.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: With the hot dry weather pushing Nova Scotia further into crisis, the province's list to the prime minister included military firefighters, trucks, helicopters, and firefighting foam, a base camp and command post, and a 50 percent cost share for modular housing for those who lost homes. Wind gusts and low humidity only fuelled the flames to more extreme levels today, and talks of potentially bringing people back to their homes were called off.</p><p>DAVID STEEVES (Nova Scotia Natural Resources): We are not keeping folks at bay because it's what we want to do. This is to keep people alive.</p><p>TAMMY MACKAY (Moulding Warehouse Ltd. Owner): We're hoping it wasn't true.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: Tammy MacKay is coming to terms with losing her family's manufacturing business of 21 years.</p><p>MACKAY: It's gone.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: After this picture was sent to them earlier in the week.</p><p>MACKAY: I'm devastated. My children are devastated. I know my employees are devastated.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: Terri and Lutz Kottwitz got out with only clothing on their backs after fires took both their home and daycare facility.</p><p>TERRI KOTTWITZ (Hammonds Plains Evacuee): It's sad to hear the house is gone, and all of our personal belongings, but the centre was such a big part of my life, and the children's and families, that I haven't processed that part yet.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: Halifax's mayor warned of increased fines up to $25,000 for anyone violating the fire ban after more illegal fires were reported in backyards.</p><p>MIKE SAVAGE (Halifax Mayor): If you're burning on your property, that is stupid, that is selfish, and that is putting people at risk.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: Today, these roofers are being hailed as heroes for their quick actions on Sunday, going door-to-door to alert people after spotting smoke in the distance.</p><p>ADAM WOLFE (Roofer): There was eight foot flames that looked like a bonfire, and then instantaneously after that there was like a 60-foot tree that burst into flame.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: And there is still no word yet on the cause of that fire.
