Pathways creates the prospect of facilitating low-carbon oil exports from the Alberta oil sands to a variety of potential markets,\u201d Carney\u2019s government announced on September 11.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While in Alberta on the same day, Carney said the carbon capture element is a \u201cnecessary condition\u201d for future pipeline construction and that his government is going to \u201caccelerate\u201d work on the joint carbon capture and pipeline initiative, which he described as a \u201cpotentially viable project\u201d.</p><p>It was an unusual choice of words for a potentially multi-billion-dollar investment forced on taxpayers and being aggressively lobbied for by some of the country\u2019s largest oil companies.\u00a0</p><p>While Carney described the carbon capture project as \u201cpotentially viable\u201d, scientists say the technology is not proven and merely a way for the oil industry to justify pipeline and oil extraction expansion. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be no oil pipeline that\u2019s brought forward to the Major Projects Office, unless there is a decarbonization plan like Pathways,\u201d Carney said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe major project office will continue to do the work that creates the opportunity for the \u2018plus\u2019. The \u2018plus\u2019 is a potential pipeline to a variety of potential markets.\u201d</p><p>The oil industry, through a group called the Pathways Alliance, has been lobbying the federal government for years to get the project off the ground with billions in taxpayer funding.</p><p>Through the Alberta government, the Pathways Alliance \u2014 which includes Suncor Energy, Imperial Oil, ConocoPhillips, Canadian Natural Resources, Cenovus Energy and MEG Energy \u2014 has aggressively lobbied Ottawa for financial assistance to build its carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) project, a 400-kilometre pipeline that would link about two dozen northern Alberta oilsands operations to an underground carbon storage facility near Cold Lake.</p><p>The Alberta and federal governments had previously pledged billions of dollars for the project in tax breaks, carbon credits and other incentives.\u00a0</p><p>Critics say the carbon capture plans are nothing more than a taxpayer-funded government handout to justify massive oil expansion and the construction of new pipelines to get more oil to markets.</p><p>Scientists warn that carbon capture, as Carney appeared to question, is not even a viable technology, and that the notion of \u201cdecarbonizing\u201d the oilsands is just the latest greenwashing spin by the industry to deflect from the fact that any expansion would cause even more harmful pollution, at a critical time when emissions levels are going in the wrong direction.</p><p>Canada is set to miss its 2030 emissions target by a significant margin. But Carney is betting on unproven \u201cdecarbonization\u201d claims pushed by the fossil fuel industry with costly and unreliable carbon capture technology, raising concerns he might be prioritizing industry and political calculations over climate action, stakeholders warn.</p><p>Environmental Defence\u2019s oil and gas program manager Aly Hyder Ali criticized Carney for proposing decarbonized oil, which is \u201ca dangerous myth\u2026[that] goes against the sense of chemistry on this planet, and is being used to justify the expansion of false solutions like carbon capture.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Environmental organizations have voiced concern about the Pathways Alliance lobbying efforts, pointing out that there has been no government assessment to evaluate the various claims being made by the oil industry giants.\u00a0</p><p>Carney is now being questioned about his apparent support for a plan that has been aggressively pushed by the largest polluters in the country, but has not been scientifically vetted by any government agency. The six oil giants\u2019 claims about capturing between 10 to 12 megatonnes of CO2 annually by 2030 have never been evaluated by the federal government. However, research and past attempts at carbon capture have shown the technology does not come close to delivering what the industry claims. \u00a0</p><p>The petrochemical industry has been widely condemned for spending tens of millions on public relations and lobbying campaigns to make citizens believe in \u201cclean\u201d natural gas, \u201cdecarbonized\u201d oilsands, \u201cresilient hydrocarbons\u201d and \u201ctransitional projects\u201d; slogans meant to distract from the scientific fact that there is no such thing as green petrochemicals and the reality that the only way to avoid climate catastrophe is to stop burning carbon-based resources for energy.\u00a0</p><p>Hyder Ali says the use of such terms, and Carney\u2019s apparent capitulation to the oil industry\u2019s carbon capture myths is part of a dangerous game: \u201cIt also gives oil companies a license to keep increasing fossil fuel production under the facade that they\u2019re cleaning up their mess.\u201d</p><p>On September 18, the Canadian Climate Institute\u2019s Early Estimate of National Emissions (EENE) report revealed national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remained unchanged in 2024, holding at 694 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, the same level as 2023, a troubling reversal after years of modest declines.</p><p>Emissions from the oil and gas sector rose by 1.9 percent, driven by a 3.4 percent increase in oil sands production as Ottawa provided nearly $30 billion in direct subsidies and public financing to the fossil fuel industry.</p><p>\u201cThe latest emissions data confirm that two decades of climate progress is in jeopardy without a policy reboot from governments right across the country. With emissions flatlining and important policies being scaled back, Canada\u2019s 2030 target is now out of reach\u2014and the longer we take to get back on track, the more Canadians will pay the price,\u201d the Canadian Climate Institute president, Rick Smith, said.</p><p>On September 11, Carney unveiled five \u201cnation-building projects\u201d aimed at making Canada \u201cthe strongest economy in the G7\u201d, mixing promising initiatives with controversial ones, including Phase two of LNG Canada in Kitimat, British Columbia (B.C.), doubling liquefied natural gas production by chilling gas piped from Alberta and Northeast B.C. into a liquid form for export to Asia with initial shipments already underway this summer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTogether, these projects represent investments of more than $60 billion in our economy and will create thousands of well-paying jobs for Canadians,\u201d a statement noted.</p><p>\u201cThe whole initiative felt more like a communications exercise than something truly functional\u2014at least for now. Most of these projects were already happening and are often well into development,\u201d University of Toronto Economic Analysis and Policy assistant professor and former federal New Democratic Party Chief Economist, Rob Gillezeau, told The Pointer.</p><p>\u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t be picking which business ventures succeed. If carbon capture or any other project truly made economic sense, the private sector should be able to deliver it on its own.\u201d</p><p>Hyder Ali questions the economic justification for the project.</p><p>\u201cContinuing to expand oil and gas projects in the middle of a climate crisis when we're so far off from our climate commitments is absolutely reckless. It's not only environmentally reckless, it's financially reckless,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt's a very short-sighted move.\u201d</p><p>David Suzuki Foundation\u2019s Indigenous Strategy senior advisor Janelle Lapointe told The Pointer she is \u201cdisappointed, but not surprised\u201d since the Prime Minister\u2019s Office has signalled that Carney\u2019s version of nation-building involves reinvesting in the \u201csame extractive industries that have been wreaking havoc on the environment and the climate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe LNG Phase two would completely blow Canada's commitments out of the water and set off a regional carbon bomb, and jeopardize our future competitiveness and the global economy, as you see the rest of the world transition away from fossil fuels into renewable energy,\u201d Lapointe emphasized.</p><p>\u201cNot only is it a step back on our climate commitments, but it does not seem to be keeping pace with the rest of the world.\u201d</p><p>Environmental Defence executive director Tim Gray explained that Canada entered the LNG market late, which is already dominated by major players like the U.S. and Russia. Liquefied natural gas, primarily methane, is both \u201ctoxic and a potent greenhouse gas\u201d, with climate impacts comparable to coal and oil.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWith massive project oversupply now coming online, Canada will have invested in more planet-heating carbon while wasting resources that could have developed renewable energy for export to the United States,\u201d Gray noted.</p><p>In 2022, methane was responsible for 117 megatonnes of carbon emissions, over 16 percent of Canada\u2019s total greenhouse gas output, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada\u2019s National Inventory report. Nearly half of that, 56 megatonnes, came from the oil and gas sector alone.</p><p>Canada has yet to finalize its updated regulations targeting a 75 percent reduction in methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 2030, with draft rules released in December 2023 still awaiting completion.</p><p>Similarly, the proposed oil and gas emissions cap, unveiled in November 2024, remains unfinished. The first reporting obligations begin in 2026, under a cap-and-trade system.</p><p>Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, a vocal critic of the federal oil and gas emissions cap, calling it unconstitutional and an infringement on provincial authority, welcomed Carney's announcement. Her United Conservative Party previously voted to scrap provincial emissions reduction targets and officially declared carbon dioxide \u201ca foundational nutrient for all life on Earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I looked at the first five projects, I thought: \u2018Finally, they get it,\u2019 because it\u2019s all the projects that have been difficult to build,\u201d Smith told reporters in Edmonton.</p><p>The projects will be overseen by the newly established Major Projects Office (MPO), headquartered in Calgary, launched on August 29 and led by CEO Dawn Farrell, who previously served as President and CEO of Trans Mountain Corporation.</p><p>           First Nations and civil society organizations slammed the MPO as a continuation of a failed strategy that risks sidelining Indigenous rights, weakening environmental protections and putting corporate timelines ahead of communities.</p><p>\u201cWe oppose the absolute destruction of this planet. When a supposedly democratic country like Canada sets up an office of cherry-picked individuals whose purpose is to generate profits, not protections, it is not only immoral, it fails to uphold Canada\u2019s constitutional duty to consult, and other constitutional protections owed to Indigenous peoples. All Canadians, and all Indigenous Nations, must stand together to oppose this office and refuse to support it,\u201d Chief Na\u2019Moks, Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en Hereditary Chief, said.</p><p>\u201cProjects of national interest must take into account human health impacts, not just short-term economic benefits. First Nations and rural communities bear a disproportionate burden from fracking and LNG infrastructure, with research linking these operations to increased rates of respiratory disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and other serious health conditions. LNG development threatens not only health but also sovereignty and Indigenous ways of life, as many First Nations across BC are being forced to defend their territories from this harmful industry,\u201d Dr. Melissa Lem, family physician and President of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, added.</p><p>\u201cBefore fast-tracking any more LNG projects, the federal government needs to invest in research and enact stronger regulations to safeguard communities from the health impacts of fracking and LNG, and show the industry is safe, because current evidence suggests it is not. Instead of racing to support major polluters, the government should be protecting Canadians from the mounting healthcare costs and climate impacts that are part of fossil fuel expansion.\u201d</p><p>On July 16, chiefs from four First Nations and senior counsel Kate Kempton announced a fast-tracked constitutional challenge against Ontario\u2019s Bill 5 and key parts of federal Bill C-5, arguing these laws grant governments unchecked power to override environmental protections, human rights, and Indigenous consultation.</p><p>In response, Carney announced an 11-member Indigenous Advisory Council from First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit communities to guide the MPO on September 10.</p><p>After the council appointments were announced, some Indigenous leaders voiced concerns over inadequate representation.</p><p>\u201cWhile we acknowledge the First Nations leaders who have been appointed, the Government of Canada is once again moving forward without respecting the voices, jurisdiction, and decision-making authority of First Nations in Manitoba,\u201d Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC) Grand Chief Kyra Wilson said in a statement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot one First Nations leader was even considered. This is not inclusion \u2013 it is exclusion. First Nations in Manitoba must determine for themselves how they will be engaged, not through a federally appointed body designed in Ottawa\u2026These are nation-building projects that will affect our lands, our waters, and our future generations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs the government of the M\u00e9tis Nation within Alberta, representing the largest Indigenous population in Canada, the Otipemisiwak M\u00e9tis Government must be included on the Indigenous Advisory Council to reflect the vital and historic role our Citizens have played, and continue to play, in building Canada,\u201d Andrea Sandmaier, President of the Otipemisiwak M\u00e9tis Government, added in a statement.</p><p>\u201cIf the M\u00e9tis Nation within Alberta does not have a seat at the table, it would undermine reconciliation and weaken the very nation-building these projects are meant to achieve.\u201d</p><p>Beyond the five flagship projects, the government is exploring \u201ctransformative\u201d strategies still in early stages.</p><p>Among the longer-term initiatives under MPO consideration is the Pathways Plus carbon capture plan.</p><p>\u201cWe're also referring the\u2026Pathways Plus project to the Major Projects Office,\u201d Carney said during the press conference. Pathways \u201ccould achieve enormous emissions reductions, taking the equivalent of the emissions of 90 percent of all the cars and trucks in Alberta off the road.\u201d</p><p>There has been no independent or government-led scientific study to justify Carney\u2019s claims.</p><p>Pathways Plus offers the potential to enable low-carbon oil exports from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to diverse markets, and \u201crepresents the opportunity to create a major new industry in carbon capture and storage and an essential technology for global decarbonization,\u201d the Prime Minister said.</p><p>He positioned it as a required condition for future pipeline development, supporting the long-term viability of the province\u2019s energy sector.</p><p>\u201cTo fast-track this project without a proper assessment, despite its failed track record and the serious environmental risks it poses, pipelines exploding and impacts on surrounding ecosystems, is extremely risky,\u201d Ali said.</p><p>In May 2024, Ecojustice, on behalf of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation (ACFN) and several environmental and community organizations, filed a request for an environmental impact assessment (EIA) to evaluate the potential environmental, health, social and Indigenous rights impacts of the $16 billion Pathways Alliance carbon capture project in Alberta\u2019s oilsands, to ensure the implications were fully understood and addressed.</p><p>The Alberta government and the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) denied this request in October, refusing to order the assessment.</p><p>\u201cThe government's failure to follow through with a thorough Free, Prior and Informed consent process means that Indigenous nations who have concerns or wish to say no to projects have little avenue other than engaging in costly legal battles, which has the opportunity to just balloon the price tags of these projects even more,\u201d Lapointe said.</p><p>\u201cThe oil and gas corporations and executives are going to make a whole lot of money off of Canadian labour and Indigenous lands, and we are going to be left to clean up the mess.\u201d</p><p>What Carney failed to mention during the announcement is that CCS is a solution put forward by the fossil fuel industry, not science.</p><p>It is \u201cmoreabout prolonging the life of the declining oil and gas industry than actually protecting the planet and reducing emissions,\u201d Lapointe said.</p><p>Originally commercialized in the 1970s, carbon capture began as a method known as enhanced oil recovery (EOR), in which captured carbon dioxide was injected into depleted oil and gas reservoirs to extract more fossil fuels. This practice continues to dominate the field: over 70 percent of CCS projects today are still used to produce more oil and gas, with 80 to 90 percent of captured carbon dioxide historically serving this purpose rather than being permanently stored.</p><p>As public concern over climate change grew, the oil and gas industry rebranded EOR as a climate solution, and called it carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS).</p><p>But the rebranding has done little to solve the technology\u2019s persistent flaws. A 2024 study by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) found that 10 out of 13 major CCS projects reviewed either failed or severely underperformed, often capturing far less carbon than promised.</p><p>CCS in the power sector has fared even worse. Since 2000, nearly 90 percent of proposed carbon capture capacity for power plants has either been cancelled or suspended, citing technical and economic issues.\u00a0</p><p>CCS projects often ignore Scope 3 emissions, the largest share of total emissions, which occur when fossil fuels are ultimately burned by consumers. \u201cCarbon-neutral\u201d claims made by oil and gas producers typically account only for a small fraction of total lifecycle emissions, misleading the public.</p><p>Hyder Ali called the government\u2019s support for carbon capture technology \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201cdisheartening,\u201d pointing out that the method has been around for 50 years and consistently failed to deliver on its promises.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYear after year, decade after decade, it has underperformed, failing to capture the emissions it was supposed to, while costing taxpayers billions,\u201d he said.</p><p>Since 2000, carbon capture has accounted for just 0.5 percent of Canada\u2019s total emissions reductions, a David Suzuki Foundation report noted.</p><p>\u201cCO2 (carbon dioxide) storage is not necessarily permanent. Physical leakage from storage reservoirs is possible via gradual and long-term release or sudden release of CO2 caused by disruption of the reservoir,\u201d a 2005 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned.</p><p>In March 2024, the world's first commercial-scale CCS project, Archer Daniels Midland\u2019s (ADM) carbon capture facility near Decatur, Illinois, experienced a significant leak in less than a month, intensifying concerns over the safety of carbon sequestration near the Mahomet Aquifer, a critical source of drinking water for nearly one million people across 14 counties in the U.S..</p><p>The public and state officials were not informed of this initial leak until September 2024, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a proposed enforcement order for violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act.</p><p>ADM also reported a second suspected leak in September 2024, which led them to pause all carbon injections.</p><p>The same year, Australia's second-largest state, Queensland, banned carbon capture and storage in the Great Artesian Basin (GAB), one of the country\u2019s most vital groundwater resources.</p><p>In May 2024, the Queensland government announced that the new legislation would prohibit injecting greenhouse gases into the basin, emphasizing its enormous environmental, agricultural, economic, and cultural significance.\u00a0</p><p>The move came after the state\u2019s independent environmental regulator rejected a CCS pilot project proposed by mining giant Glencore, which aimed to inject liquefied carbon dioxide into the GAB aquifer due to the high risk of irreversible groundwater contamination.</p><p>Widespread public opposition, led by farmers, conservationists, and local councils, played a key role in the decision. Groups like AgForce and the Queensland Farmers\u2019 Federation raised concerns about CCS risks to the basin\u2019s water, combining scientific evidence with community experiences. Their pressure pushed the government to reject proposals and enforce a permanent ban.\u00a0</p><p>The government also committed $32 million to expand bore capping programs, reinforcing its focus on protecting the environment over unproven technologies.</p><p>Beyond the environmental impacts, the bill is also steep due to the high costs of CCS technologies.</p><p>International Institute for Sustainable Development\u2019s policy advisor, Canada energy transitions, Steven Haig, warns CCS in the oil and gas sector is particularly expensive, sometimes costing up to $200 per ton of carbon.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt is also very energy-intensive, slow to implement, and difficult to scale. And the thing is\u2026most projects in Canada focus on increasing oil production through enhanced oil recovery, which may actually increase emissions over time,\u201d Haig told The Pointer.</p><p>In January, a report by IEEFA warned that the Pathways AllianceCCS project faces daunting financial and technical obstacles that could undermine its viability. The $16 billion project is already expected to rely on taxpayers for half its funding. According to IEEFA, escalating costs, capped and unstable carbon credit revenues, and the risk of chronic underperformance suggest the project may never achieve financial self-sufficiency.</p><p>The report draws on the experiences of Alberta\u2019s two operating CCS projects: Shell\u2019s Quest facility and the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line (ACTL).\u00a0</p><p>Both were heavily subsidized, and both have seen costs rise dramatically. At Quest, operating expenses per tonne of carbon dioxide captured have surged 118 percent since 2016, and ACTL\u2019s costs climbed more than 60 percent in just three years. Neither facility has consistently met its projected capture rates, meaning their actual costs per tonne, closer to $145 at ACTL and $180 at Quest, are far higher than official estimates.</p><p>\u201cThe Pathways project will likely have to deal with similar challenges of escalating energy, material, and labour costs. If operating costs rise at currently observed industry rates for the life of the project, then total cost per tonne of CO2 at the proposed facility would balloon to levels that make breakeven or profitability highly improbable,\u201d the report cautioned.</p><p>CCS has long been promoted as a foundational solution that would allow oil sands producers, responsible for about 95 percent of Canada\u2019s bitumen output and more than 86 million tonnes of carbon annually, to maintain operations in a carbon-constrained world. Yet the Pathways project would capture only 10 to 12 million tonnes per year, a small fraction of total emissions, as it does nothing to address the even larger downstream emissions released when the oil is burned.\u00a0</p><p>IEEFA warns that the project risks repeating the global pattern of CCS facilities that overpromise, underdeliver, and become dependent on indefinite subsidies. Despite record profits in recent years, oil sands producers have not committed significant private capital to the project and continue lobbying Ottawa and Alberta for more public support.</p><p>IEEFA noted \u201cpermanently subsidizing a risky, unproven, and high-cost venture\u201d is unlikely to appeal to shareholders, who see little chance of positive returns. The result, the report had concluded, is mounting pressure on governments to act as funders of last resort, exposing taxpayers to the same kind of runaway costs that plagued the Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline.</p><p>Since the government purchased the project for $4.5 billion, the cost of the Trans Mountain expansion ballooned to $34 billion in 2024, when it was initially estimated to be $7.4 billion in 2017.</p><p>Hyder Ali warned that Canadians could be locked into spending $16 billion on the PathwaysCCS project, estimated to capture only about five percent of oil sector emissions by 2030. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cCarbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a small part of decarbonization, but building more fossil fuel infrastructure expecting CCS to offset emissions is a fairy tale,\u201d Citizens' Climate Lobby Canada director Cathy Orlando told The Pointer.</p><p>The move was, however, welcomed by Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who has argued that such projects make the oil and gas industry a more reliable energy source than low-emission renewables and has floated linking the Pathways project to the approval of a future oil pipeline to B.C.'s northern coast as part of a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d.</p><p>Pathways Alliance president Kendall Dilling also praised the federal backing, calling it a sign that Ottawa is prepared to collaborate with industry.</p><p>\u201cTo build Canada\u2019s economic and energy future, we encourage the federal government to continue to work together with industry and other levels of government to advance supportive policies which remove barriers to investment,\u201d Dilling said in a statement.</p><p>He also welcomed Smith\u2019s September 16 announcement that large emitters in Alberta will be able to avoid paying provincial carbon levies if they invest in emissions-reduction projects, starting this fall. Smaller emitters can opt out entirely by 2025.</p><p>Alberta has also confirmed it will keep its industrial carbon price frozen at $95 per tonne since May through 2026, defying the federal schedule, which mandates an increase to $110 next year.</p><p>Smith, who did not indicate whether the freeze would be lifted soon, has defended the freeze as providing \"certainty\" to industry.</p><p>In April, Dilling had also written to Carney requesting Ottawa end the federal industrial pricing.</p><p>But Pathways\u2019 call to freeze Alberta\u2019s carbon pricing is hard to square with the economics of CCS, which rely on a strong carbon price to be viable.</p><p>The Carney government has given no sign it plans to end industrial carbon pricing anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cEconomists are basically united on this: if you want to reduce emissions, you need a robust carbon price. Giving up on that sends a clear signal that tackling climate change is no longer a priority,\u201d Gillezeau said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just pick individual projects and say they make sense or don\u2019t. You need a consistent, fair policy\u2014like carbon pricing\u2014that lets the market decide.\u201d</p><p>What the Carney government has suggested is that the new climate plan may include ending the oil and gas emissions cap.</p><p>Since winning the Liberal leadership in March, Carney has held 25 meetings with fossil fuel lobbyists, and the pace has only quickened since the federal election, a recent Environmental Defence report revealed. In May, he met with representatives from Cenovus, Enbridge, Imperial Oil, MEG, Pathways Alliance, Shell, Suncor, and Tourmaline, and followed up with meetings with the same companies in June, adding FortisBC to the list.</p><p>As these backroom talks continue, the reality is: our planet is changing rapidly.\u00a0</p><p>July 2025 was the third-warmest July in history, coming after the record-breaking months of 2023 and 2024, the World Meteorological Organization reported.</p><p>By August 28, leading climate scientists warned that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), commonly known as the Gulf Stream, is on the brink of collapse due to rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The powerful ocean currents\u2019 collapse would trigger colder, longer winters, disrupting food production and infrastructure, with scientists estimating up to a 70 percent chance of failure if emissions continue unchecked.</p><p>By the end of August, Canada was battling one of its worst wildfire seasons on record, with over 8 million hectares burned, more than double the ten-year average for this time of year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre and Natural ResourcesCanada.</p><p>By September 10, Arctic sea ice reached its annual minimum extent of 4.60 million square kilometres, tying 2025 for the tenth lowest minimum since satellite records began nearly 47 years ago. In June 2024, Arctic sea ice near Canada was thinner than average.</p><p>Scientists have long warned Canada is warming twice as fast as the global average, and its Arctic is warming nearly four times as fast.</p><p>They have also pushed for a \u201cglobal effort to reduce emissions as quickly as possible, in order to stay close to the 1.5 [degrees C] target set by the Paris Agreement.\u201d</p><p>As the world\u2019s 11th largest greenhouse gas emitter, Canada faces a critical climate reckoning, and Carney, once a UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance, is expected to lead the way. Critics are now asking why, elected on a promise to fight climate change, he appears to be pursuing Conservative policies that seem at odds with that commitment.</p><p>\u201cHe won the election on this message of standing up to Trump and nation building, and we know that after another devastating year of climate impacts, climate action is meaningful to many Canadians who are experiencing impacts firsthand,\u201d Lapointe said.</p><p>\u201cI think this (CCS and LNG projects) is some tricky greenwashing and positive PR for the industries that are actually responsible for the climate crisis. And it's sad to see that kind of weaponized against the public who are trusting in him to do the things that he was elected on.\u201d</p><p>Notably absent from the federal government's projects of \u201cnational interest\u201d list, Hyder Ali argued, are initiatives that would help Canada align with the global shift toward a clean energy economy.\u00a0</p><p>He pointed to examples of what should be prioritized: large-scale and community-based renewable energy projects, a national low-carbon transportation strategy that includes rural transit and regional rail, a major program to build and retrofit affordable, energy-efficient homes, and the creation of an East-West electricity grid to allow clean power to flow across provinces.</p><p>\u201cThere are so many nation-building projects that deserve to be fast-tracked. But fossil fuel projects? Absolutely not,\u201d Hyder Ali said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in this climate crisis because of fossil fuels. There needs to be a real pivot toward clean energy. That\u2019s what will address the climate emergency and build a better future for all Canadians, not just the oil and gas industry.\u201d</p><p>Interestingly, in July, the Conflict of Interest Commissioner released a list of Carney\u2019s former financial interests. He had disclosed investments in 567 entities, all held in a third-party-managed account over which he claimed no control. A quick scan of the lengthy list reveals that Carney held shares in at least a dozen renewable energy companies\u2014suggesting he does, at least financially, see renewables as part of the future.</p><p>Hyder Ali says it is \u201cunnerving\u201d that despite the urgency, Carney still hasn't made it clear about his direction when it comes to climate action.</p><p>\u201cIt is disappointing to see that, when given the choice, Canadians voted for climate action, and this is not what we're getting.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:anushka.yadav@thepointer.com\">anushka.yadav@thepointer.com</email></p><p>At a time when vital public information is needed by everyone, The Pointer has taken down our paywall on all stories to ensure every resident of Brampton, Mississauga and Niagara has access to the facts.

The City of Greenwood recognizes that it cannot tackle this challenge alone - it demands the active participation and commitment of multiple stakeholders working in concert.</p><p>City Council and the Greenwood Volunteer Fire Department play crucial roles in wildfire preparedness through proactive planning, resource allocation, and personnel training. The Regional District of Kootenay Boundary (RDKB) contributes essential support, expertise and emergency coordination on a wider geographic scale and specifically on the implementation of the FireSmart program. However, the most critical link in mounting an effective defense against wildfires is the engaged involvement of local property owners.</p><p>By maintaining defensible space around structures, utilizing fire-resistant landscaping and construction materials, and having a well-rehearsed evacuation plan, individual residents become indispensable partners in fortifying the entire community\u2019s resilience when facing an encroaching wildfire. Only by everyone - from elected officials to firefighters to homeowners - fully embracing their respective responsibilities can Greenwood be optimally equipped to confront the ever-present wildfire threat. Apathy is not an option; the city\u2019s wildfire readiness hinges on each person stepping up and doing their part in this essential collective endeavour.</p><p>As the Mayor, I also recognize that education around wildfire is essential. Hence why the City is increasing efforts to provide educational opportunities for the residents of Greenwood. This started on May 3rd with a Town Hall that provided a presentation by the British Columbia Wildfire Service on forest fire fighting 101. Staff are presently working with the RDKB to host another Town Hall that will focus on the FireSmart program and the City of Greenwood\u2019s Community Wildfire Resiliency Plan. Further communication tools are being developed including a full section in the new City website (estimated to be live at the end of the summer 2025) dedicated to all aspects of a wildfire event, including key links to the RDKB FireSmart program and grants available to homeowners.</p><p>FireSmart home evaluations are a critical first step for property owners looking to protect their homes and families from the threat of wildfire. These comprehensive assessments, offered free of charge by the RDKB, provide invaluable insights into the specific vulnerabilities and risk factors present on your property. By implementing these expert suggestions, homeowners can significantly enhance their property\u2019s resilience to wildfire, reducing the likelihood of ignition and improving the chances of the home surviving a fire event.</p><p>To take advantage of this potentially life-saving service, property owners simply need to visit the RDKB website and click on the FireSmart link under the Public Safety section. From there, booking a free FireSmart evaluation is a straightforward process.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FORKSG-news20250618PQHA0004801345</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FORKSG2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2S-SRX3-RRST-S0SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"508\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

The new structure will be a lifeguard station and picnic shelter, with a stronger foundation to handle future flooding.</p><p>But Jane Groenewegen, who owns Harbour House, a guesthouse just across from the beach, says she was shocked to see construction begin last week without any public notice or signs explaining what was going on.</p><p>\"We didn't see anything posted. And we're down here quite often,\" she said. \"Whenever there's a development, there's usually a 90-day appeal period where people can comment on what's proposed.\"</p><p>Groenewegen said she's frustrated that there was no opportunity for public input, especially since many other tourism-related sites in the community still need to be repaired after flooding and fire damage.</p><p>She said that while the new building may replace something that was lost, it's the wrong time and the wrong place for it. She also doesn't understand why the territory\u00a0chose a location that has already seen serious flood damage.</p><p>\"Who asked for this? Yes, it's replacing something, but the timing is off. The beach is a disaster,\" she said. \"The beach is just kind of a swamp now that goes from one end to the other.\"</p><p/><p>Groenewegen said the flooding dramatically changed the landscape. The shoreline has receded, and the sand is now overgrown with poisonous vegetation, such as water hemlock. Dead trees still line the campground.</p><p>She said the beach isn't the only area that still needs attention. At Twin Falls Territorial Park, a major tourist attraction located just outside Hay River, the trails and stairs to the falls remain uncleared since the 2023 wildfires, leaving the site in a rough state and unsafe for visitors.</p><p>\"Our government always says they're so hard up ... they got no money for capital projects,\" she said. \"But they got [money] for something that nobody asked for.\"</p><p>'We've had our difficulties'</p><p>Darrell Dean, who owns Castaways Cottages and Campground on the other side of town, says the new building going up at the beach\u00a0isn't a top concern for him, but\u00a0he agrees that there are more urgent priorities in the community that the territory\u00a0should address\u00a0first.</p><p>\"I'd rather see them spend their money cleaning the beach up, because nobody's going to go there to stay in a swamp,\" he said. \"It just doesn't make any sense.\"</p><p>Dean says he's still trying to recover from the wildfires that burned through his site in 2023, destroying trees, campers, and four cabins.</p><p>\"We've been hit with a couple years of COVID, and then ... a couple years of flood and then a forest fire. So we've had our difficulties,\" he said.</p><p/><p>Dean said his campground wasn't insured when the fire hit, because there are no fire hydrants in the area, and coverage has become increasingly complex and expensive to get. Without insurance, he had to cover the cost of replacing everything himself.</p><p>On\u00a0top of that, he says one of the\u00a0biggest challenges he faces is competing with the territorial-run campground, which offers amenities like wi-fi in certain areas, power hookups, and lower rates. He says private operators like himself can't match those prices.\u00a0</p><p>\"We can't afford to put that kind of money on infrastructure and then charge that little amount of money,\" Dean said. \"The going rate down south ... is anywhere from $60 to $125 a night to stay in a campground. We're well below par on the rates.\"</p><p>For Dean, offering basic services like power is not financially feasible. He estimates it would cost around $150,000 to install electricity at his campground.</p><p>Dean said that the territory's infrastructure department\u00a0has supported him with funding in the past, but\u00a0large-scale upgrades, such as power installations, remain out of reach for private operators, and he's not aware of any funding program that could cover such high costs.</p><p>\"[The territory] should be investing money in local tour operators, I think, because it's a plus for everybody,\" he said.</p><p>Ongoing municipal issues don't help either, he said. His road often isn't plowed or graded, and a flood-damaged culvert still hasn't been properly fixed, making it hard for large campers to reach the site. He says it took over a decade of complaints to get consistent road maintenance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanorthtourismbusinessesinhayrivernwtquestiongovtprioritieswithnewbuildingproject17586019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G9C-GNV3-RRRW-72HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"754\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

The heat wave is forecast to last until Thursday and the smoke will likely linger just as long, though Toronto will avoid the worst of the smoke, which is headed to Ottawa and Montreal, according to the BlueSky fire smoke forecast map.</p><p>Emerging research shows that wildfire smoke is worse for your health than other kinds of air pollution.</p><p>\"I often equate it to smoking because we know when people smoke, they're breathing in combusted plant life,\" said Dr. Anne Hicks, a professor of pediatric respiratory medicine at the University of Alberta. \"With wildfires, we're burning down vegetation and you're inhaling it.\"</p><p>Smoke from forest fires contains toxic volatile organic hydrocarbons and heavy metals, Hicks said. And when they react to sunlight in the atmosphere, they generate ozone and other pollutants that can cause swelling in the lungs. While the visible particles in smoke won't penetrate as deeply into your lungs as some of the smaller, invisible particles, the smallest particles of all can pass directly into your bloodstream.</p><p>\"If you're smelling something, probably at least some of that is getting absorbed directly into your olfactory nerve - the part of your nervous system that's involved in scent - and that can go directly to your brain,\" she said.</p><p>With increased wildfire activity, and the huge \"monster\" fires that burn for months on end becoming more commonplace, smoke is travelling long distances and reaching places it didn't used to.</p><p>A recent study found that hospitalizations increased by 20 per cent in the U.S. northeast in 2023, after smoke from B.C. and Alberta travelled 3,200 kilometres to blanket the area. Quebec fires that same year sent smoke into southern Ontario, where a similar spike in hospital visits for asthma was found.</p><p>As bad as that sounds, smoke is the lesser evil when compared to extreme heat. </p><p>\"Heat is an immediate risk. Heat kills. Heat kills especially the most vulnerable populations: infants and young children, the elderly, people with less access to services or who live alone, and people who have housing insecurity,\" Hicks said.</p><p>So as much as avoiding the smoke is important, compromises - like opening a window in a stuffy apartment - might be necessary to avoid the heat.</p><p>\"Being too hot with no smoke exposure is riskier than being exposed to smoke at cooler temperatures,\" said Dr. Sarah Henderson, director of environmental health services at the University of British Columbia in an interview posted online.</p><p>In order to protect yourself from smoke, Hicks recommends staying inside if possible, or minimizing physical activity if you have to be outside. Masks can filter out some toxic particles, but few will protect you completely.</p><p>She also says keeping indoor spaces clean is important for improving air quality, and investing in a HEPA filter for children's bedrooms has been shown to have health benefits. </p><p>It's both a short-term and a long-term concern, she said.</p><p>\"Wildfires I think didn't used to fall into both categories and now they do just because we're exposed to the smoke so many more days per year,\" said Hicks.</p><p>\"In the short term we absolutely need to worry about it. And there's lots of good evidence that infants and young children, the elderly, people with heart and lung problems and so on are going to be at increased risk of immediate harms like asthma attacks, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) attacks, strokes, that kind of stuff ... Not to mention that it's miserable to be coughing all day.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025071476092222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G8B-1833-RSDJ-J10P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"713\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

That is more than double the 10-year average of the area burned by mid-July.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There were 561 fires burning as of Friday morning, including 69 that were considered out of control. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre says almost 3,300 fires have been recorded this year so far.</p><p>The record was set in 2023, when more than 6,000 fires burned more than 150,000 square km of land \u2014 an area larger than all three Maritime provinces put together.</p><p>That devastating season, where wildfires raged from Newfoundland to B.C. for months on end, sparked significant public pressure for the federal government to create a new kind of disaster response agency.\u00a0</p><p>Former emergency management ministers Bill Blair and Harjit Sajjan both mulled the idea of such an agency during their time in office, with both ministers acknowledging the strain natural disasters have put on the Canadian Armed Forces and the provinces and territories.\u00a0</p><p>The government said it was looking to the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency and Australia's National Emergency Management Agency as potential examples.</p><p>Final decisions on that front still have not been made.</p><p>During a Friday afternoon briefing with several of her cabinet colleagues, Emergency Management Minister Eleanor Olszewski said her department will be making changes to how it responds to wildfire seasons, which are becoming longer and more severe.</p><p>\"We think that the formation of such an agency could have a very positive impact on our ability to co-ordinate how we respond to national disasters across the country,\" Olszewski said.\u00a0</p><p>That could mean having regional water bombers to respond more quickly to fires in areas that have fewer resources, she said, or leaning on a \"humanitarian task force\" to ensure people can be deployed where they're needed.</p><p>Matthew Godsoe, a senior director of the government operations centre at Public Safety Canada, said natural disasters are outpacing the capacity of the country's emergency management system.\u00a0</p><p>\"In that current context, maintaining the status quo is equivalent to doing less,\" he told reporters at a technical briefing Friday, adding that all levels of government and individual Canadians must work together \"to slow or stop this nearly exponential growth in disaster losses that we're experiencing as a country.\"</p><p>The federal government has been called in to provide help five times this wildfire season, including last week, when the Armed Forces and the Red Cross helped to evacuate more than 2,800 people from Garden Hill First Nation in Manitoba.\u00a0</p><p>Olszewski said she expects to have an update on a federal emergency agency in the fall.</p><p>In the meantime, communities in high-risk areas are bracing for things to get worse in the next two months, which are typically the most active months of the fire season.\u00a0</p><p>Saskatchewan has already seen one of the worst fire seasons ever in terms of the total area burned, and a record number of people have been forced out of their homes in that province.</p><p>Indigenous Services Minister Mandy Gull-Masty said 39,000 people have been forced to evacuate from 66 First Nations, mostly on the Prairies, calling the fire season unprecedented.\u00a0</p><p>\"It is, I hope, not the new reality that we have to live with, but I'm asking myself what this looks like,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p>Gull-Masty said the government's goal at the end of the wildfire season is to \"come together, debrief, reflect, and put tools in place for the next possible time that this occurs.\"</p><p>Officials said the fire risk typically rises throughout August as temperatures get hotter, and they are predicting higher than normal temperatures for most of the country next month.\u00a0</p><p>\"This is consistent with climate change projections, which show that the next five years will be warmer than (we) are used to,\" said S\u00e9bastien Chouinard, the director of operations at the Canadian Meteorological Centre.</p><p>August is also slated to bring below-normal rainfall levels for the Prairies, B.C. and the Maritimes.</p><p>More than 530 firefighters from Australia, New Zealand, Costa Rica, Mexico and the U.S. are in Canada to help.\u00a0</p><p>Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson said his department is setting aside $11.7 million over four years to create the Wildfire Resilience Consortium of Canada, an agency he said will \"connect domestic, international governments, the private sector, wildfire scientists and experts and affected communities to share knowledge, science and technology so we can fight fires better.\"\u00a0</p><p>The consortium is part of Canada's commitment to a wildfire co-operation charter that was signed at the G7 leaders' summit in Kananaskis, Alta., this summer.\u00a0</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 18, 2025.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

In the Yukon, that idea is not new -\u00a0but finding a way to reap the benefits of fire while preventing devastation is a delicate balancing act.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As 92 active wildfires burn across the territory, many communities are experiencing some level of risk.\u00a0</p><p>It is not uncommon for wildfire evacuees and those affected by wildfire smoke to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/wildfires-mental-health-1.7289606\">experience anxiety and stress</url>.\u00a0And wildfires can cause severe damage to homes, businesses\u00a0and local economies. Last year's devastating wildfire in Jasper, Alta., cost an estimated $1.23 billion in insured damages, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada.\u00a0</p><p>However, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://poliswildfireproject.org/publications/beneficial-fire/\">report</url> on beneficial fire in B.C. from the University of Victoria's <url normalizedValue=\"https://poliswildfireproject.org/\">POLIS Wildfire Resilience Project</url>\u00a0says\u00a0if communities can find a way to live with fire and, in some cases, use it to their advantage, they can help protect themselves and ecosystems from future devastation.\u00a0</p><p>The intensity and frequency of wildfires is increasing with climate change, but in the Yukon's boreal forest, fire has always been a part of a healthy ecosystem. Some Yukon First Nations say they have been living with and adapting to wildfire on the landscape for generations.\u00a0</p><p>What is beneficial fire?</p><p>According to the report, beneficial fire is \"planned or unplanned wildland fire that has positive effects on ecosystem processes and functions and has acceptable risk to human communities.\"</p><p>The report adds that beneficial fire can include \"cultural fire, prescribed fire and managed fire.\"\u00a0</p><p>Andrea Barnett, a project manager and analyst for the project, says the report provides a framework that communities can apply to their unique needs to understand how they can use beneficial fire to build wildfire resilience.\u00a0</p><p>\"They need to understand fire history. They also need to understand what their risks are and what kind of risks they're willing to subject their community to and what kind of risk they're not willing to [take].\"</p><p/><p>Ecological benefits of fire</p><p>Jill Johnstone, a forest ecologist and research affiliate at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Yukon University, says that forest species in the Yukon are adapted to wildfire.</p><p>\"This is a really good indication that fire is an essential part of this landscape,\" Johnstone said. \"By and large, fire is a productive part of the forest cycle here in the northern boreal region.\"</p><p>However, Johnstone says that in recent years climate change is causing more frequent and severe wildfires that are harmful to ecosystems.</p><p>As wildfires occur more frequently, the natural wildfire cycle, which is typically 50 to 200 years, is being disrupted and that affects the ability of species like conifers to re-establish in the forest after a fire, she said.</p><p>And the more severe the fire, the more carbon is released into the atmosphere from the combustion of organic material. That's where beneficial fires come in.</p><p>\"A beneficial fire might not just be one that burns in a part of the landscape where we want it to burn, but it might also be one that doesn't emit a lot of carbon.\"</p><p>Johnstone says prescribed burns can be used early in the spring when the soil is wet, to prevent more severe fires that emit more carbon, like ones that occur in the summer when the soil is dry.</p><p>Beneficial fire in the Yukon</p><p>Yukon Wildland Fire Management already uses beneficial fire, like prescribed and cultural burning, as a \"tool\" to mitigate the risk of wildfire, said Haley Ritchie, a fire information officer.</p><p>Ritchie says in some cases, they will also allow beneficial fires to burn instead of suppressing them.\u00a0</p><p>\"So if a fire is burning in the wilderness zone, whenever possible we want to let it fulfill its natural role in the boreal forest,\" she said. \"And what that can help do is reduce really large catastrophic fires.\"</p><p/><p>Sean Smith, chief of Kwanlin D\u00fcn First Nation, says fire is a part of his people's \"cultural history.\"</p><p>\"I strongly know and understand that people back then knew it was a very powerful tool, but it can also be a very big danger too.\"</p><p>Smith says that with climate change, the threat of wildfires is a concern in his community.</p><p>\"We have a forest around us,\" he said. \"There's some pretty thick areas which are very heavily wooded, have a lot of dead trees and deadfall.... That's the fuel that fuels fires.\"</p><p>In an effort to protect their community and incorporate their cultural values into fire management, Kwanlin D\u00fcn First Nation released a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kwanlindun.com/southern-lakes-wildfire-strategy/#1714772398352-6101d0c2-2704\">Southern Lakes Wildfire Strategy</url> in partnership with Carcross/Tagish First Nation and the Yukon government.</p><p>The strategy outlines values they want to protect and suggests ways to prevent future wildfire, including using beneficial fires like prescribed burns as a tool.</p><p>John Fingland, a Champagne &amp; Aishihik First Nations citizen and historian says that in the past his people would often set fires in the forest that would become wildfires.\u00a0</p><p>\"When we were travelling, if we were coming to another village and wanted to announce ourselves, we would light a tree on fire. And that showed two things, one that people are coming, and secondly, because it was announced that you felt safe.\"</p><p>Fingland says that fire suppression started when settlers arrived.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's created a problem for the villages because as you can see now when fires start they are wildly out of control because of the amount of suppression we've had.\"</p><p>Now, Champagne &amp; Aishihik First Nations, Kluane First Nation and Kluane National Park are working together on a project to restore the forest ecosystem through prescribed burning.</p><p>Fingland says the community is in support of the project, but when it comes to fire, even beneficial ones, there is always some fear associated with it.</p><p>\"What's the risk that can come from that?\" he said. \"It's something that has to be done, we just want to make sure that they're doing it right.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanorthbeneficialfireswildfiremanagementyukon17594691</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCH-6GK3-S24M-W4KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"975\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

The parking lot was just full of vehicles. So that\u2019s the first thing I noticed.\u201d</p><p>The scene at the band office could be described as \u201corganized chaos\u201d as Chief Delores Kakegamic and many of the 200 or so people still in Sandy Lake were hard at work, Mamakwa said.</p><p>Red Lake 12\u2019s damage and the huge fire\u2019s proximity to the community were \u201cvery scary,\u201d he said, but Sandy Lake First Nation was \u201cvery lucky\u201d to have escaped significant damage to vital infrastructure and to have lost no lives to the fire.</p><p>\u201cAnd I think it just speaks to the issues of climate change that we face every summer, and I think every community needs to have an evacuation plan for the summer.\u201d</p><p>Mamakwa\u2019s visit to Sandy Lake also included meeting with MNR firefighters.</p><p>Ontario needs \u201cmore firefighters on the ground\u201d and more supports for wildfire-prone communities in the North, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-41f67a693dbb4aaaa3238132a82a097d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2P-W843-RXCW-C2XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"397\"/><timeReceived>08:12 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 17, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That prompted the government to close the tunnel, inside Whiteshell Provincial Park, to motorized boats and advise paddlers to portage over land.</p><p>The province hired Toban Specialties Inc. to find a way to remove the fallen rock in a project that presented challenges. There were roughly 20 pieces of rock in the water, several metres down from the ground above, in an area not easily accessible. One of the larger rocks was more than a metre in length and a metre in diameter.</p><p>\"The task wasn't what you do every day, but these are projects that I like to focus on,\" the company's Mark Wiebe said in an interview.</p><p>Wiebe and his crew got a backhoe, via a nearby road, to a grassy area above the tunnel entrance. To extend the reach all the way to the rocks, the crew used chains to attach a grapple bucket \u2014 a device with a claw on one side and a bucket on the other \u2014 to the hoe and devised a way to make the grapple bucket open and close.</p><p>\"We were able to manipulate it so that we could face it downwards, so the teeth are facing at the water, and we could put it over the top of a rock and close the grapple and we could pick it up,\" Wiebe said.</p><p>\"Similar to what you have in a wrecker yard, picking up vehicles.\"</p><p>The work was done last week while the area was still suffering the effects of Manitoba's early forest fire season. Backcountry travel and waterways in the area, including the tunnel, had been closed to the public due to the wildfire threat.

Thunder Bay Fire No. 9 consisted of an array of fires over an area of about five hectares; it began to be reported to city and rural fire departments about 3 p.m. on Wednesday. </p><p>Strong winds fanned flames that were spotted along a rail line and in grassy fields in the Twin City Crossroads area, while images of thick black smoke began popping up on social media. Later Wednesday afternoon, provincial waterbombers were dispatched to tamp down the more out-of-control sections, while ground crews mobilized. \"Thunder Bay Fire Rescue immediately deployed multiple pumper crews to respond to the fires, prioritizing the protection of residential properties along the affected corridor,\" the city's fire department said in a news release. \"Crews worked swiftly to contain and suppress multiple fire sites stretching from the airport to Twin City Crossroads.\" It added: \"No structures within the city were damaged. The incident took approximately five hours to bring fully under control.\" The cause of the fires hasn't been released; provincial officials are investigating. Firefighters from Oliver Paipoonge were also involved in the initial response and participated in putting out hot spots on Thursday, said that department's chief, Sean Horan. According to Environment Canada's website, no rain is in the forecast for Thunder Bay for the next several days. Municipal fire bans remain in place in rural areas adjacent to the city, including Neebing and Oliver Paipoonge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-108c165f4d5c4128a9285aff5672bb77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FWC-KP73-RRY3-347G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"299\"/><timeReceived>12:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 23, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DN6R</classCode><className>PUBLIC OFFICIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX001372</classCode><className>PRESS RELEASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Reporter Sarah Simpson has been combing through old newspapers with the assistance of the Kaatza Station Museum and Archives so we can jog your memory, give you that nostalgic feeling, or just a chuckle, as we take a look at what was making headlines this week around Cowichan Lake in years gone by.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week around the Cowichan Lake area\u2026</p><p>10 years ago</p><p>It doesn't matter what year it is, fire season is every year.</p><p>\"Skutz Falls fire 100 per cent contained by Monday\" was the headline on the front of the Lake Cowichan Gazette of Aug. 5, 2015. As of Monday (August 4), a large forest fire that broke out near Skutz Falls was declared to be 100 per cent contained, and is now in \"mop-up\" process. A crew of nine firefighters and a water tender are currently working to put out hot spots. On Tuesday morning (August 4), the area was scanned and additional hot spots were found.</p><p>\"'Crews are working to get hot spots out and we're hoping to get it in control by mid-week,' Coastal Fire Centre information officer Donna MacPherson said. \"We'll be turning it back to industry for patrol.' The fire has since grown to 16 hectares (39.5 acres), though according to the Coastal Fire Centre, crews have it contained within the perimeter, and it is no longer a fire of note.\"</p><p>On page 2 of the same edition was \"Age-friendly action plan taking shape after public consultation\".</p><p>\"The Town of Lake Cowichan's age-friendly action plan has been coming together since the initiative was launched earlier this year. James Van Hemert, the town's contract planner, is now preparing to present the first draft of the report to the public on September 19, following a consultation with the town's senior advocacy committee.</p><p>\"A mobility audit was recently completed as a component of the action plan, which included walk-arounds of the town both on foot and on mobility scooters. Sidewalks, pathways, crossings, signage and street furniture, among other features, were all taken into account during the audit. The report will include several concerns in regards to the mobility of seniors and the disabled, such as the inaccessibility observed in certain businesses and public places, notably older buildings which did not have to comply with the same, newer BC Building Code standards that more recent construction has had to follow.\"</p><p>25 years ago</p><p>\"A great time had by all\u2026 \u2026really\" was the top headline on the front of the Lake Cowichan Gazette of Aug. 9, 2000.</p><p>\"With the town and surrounding areas full to overflowing with curlers, returning grads, jet-ski race enthusiasts, homecoming visitors, campers and just plain tourists we showed just how well we can roll out the welcome mat when we put our minds to it. Campsites from Skutz Falls to Caycuse were bursting at the seams as visitors poured in to get a first hand taste of a cloudless blue summer weekend in spectacular Kaatza country.</p><p>\"'Everything is busy. Stores, restaurants, gas stations, everything!' said Town Councillor, Claude Ruggieri, on hand Sunday at Lakeview Park to help out at the town's first ever jet-ski races. 'We have so much potential in this area. If the facilities are here, people will come.'</p><p>\"At the town barbeque later in the day, Mayor Jack Peake echoed Ruggieri's remarks. 'I've never seen a weekend like this,' says Peake. All over the lake, the water was dotted with powerboats towing skiers and tubers as well as all other manner of craft. Day-sailors, hobycats, wind-surfers as well as jet-skis and jet boats all found their place in the sun and their spot on the glistening blue. Beaches from Youbou to Heather to Mesachie were filled with swimmers and tubers enjoying the warm, clean water.\"</p><p>\"Local women involved in cheque scam\" was a secondary headline.</p><p>\"Late Monday night, North Cowichan and Duncan RCMP reported they had apprehended two Lake Cowichan women during an investigation into the fraudulent use of cheques at several lower Vancouver Island businesses. On Saturday, August 5, RCMP warned Island businesses about a cheque fraud being perpetrated by a woman described as Caucasian, about 30 years old, between five-foot-two and five-six, with dirty blonde hair.</p><p>\"She used ID with the surname 'Smith', which matched the cheques. Police recovered a 'quantity of goods' obtained through the use of stolen cheques. The items have been returned to the victimized businesses.\"</p><p>40 years ago</p><p>\"EDC scrapped\" made the front page of the Aug. 7, 1985 Lake News.</p><p>\"'It's a definite discrimination against people in electoral areas,\" Frank Walker of Honeymoon Bay said Friday reacting to a decision to eliminate the Cowichan Valley Economic Development Commission, starting January 1, 1986.</p><p>\"Walker, regional director for Area 'F', has been chairman of the EDC since December, 1984. The decision to scrap the commission and its Duncan-based office was made at an in-camera meeting of the Cowichan Valley Regional District board July 24 and announced after that meeting. Walker was unable to attend that meeting because he was away from the area at the time. Electoral areas, which are home to half the population of the Cowichan Valley, now effectively are left without assistance in the economic development area, Walker said. Asked why the move had taken place, Walker said he thought the commission had been turned into \u2014 a political football.\"</p><p>And finally, \"Paddlewheeler may be attraction\" was also a rather novel headline on the front page.</p><p>\"Lake Cowichan Community Services has announced a long-term plan for improvement of the area's economy by bolstering tourism here. The three-phase plan was put forward recently for discussion.</p><p>\"The plan, which includes construction and operation of a sternwheeler on Cowichan Lake, development of an 'old town' logging operation and manufacturing of products for possible export, could result in from 15 to 30 long-term jobs, according to Community Services manager Tony White. The first phase is concerned with the sternwheeler, which will be named the 'Kaatza Princess'. This sternwheeler passenger vessel will be 65 feet long, with a diesel engine described as 'fuel efficient and non-polluting.' It will have a capacity to carry up to 100 passengers and a crew of four and is of a type that would be considered 'compatible' in Cowichan Lake by licence granting authorities, according to White.\"</p><p>Copyright 2025 Lake Cowichan Gazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECG-news20250730PLC4748789</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECG2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCR-JHF3-RRVD-J1DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1058\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Writer\u2019s can base their story off of one of two paintings selected by the organizing groups. Maureen Wheeler\u2019s Escape or Cody Tresierra\u2019s Dad\u2019s Skates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">People who are interested in taking part have until August 22 to submit stories. More information can be found on the art gallery\u2019s website.</p><p>A bear with a beautiful backdrop of fire is the main thing you may notice when looking at Maureen Wheeler\u2019s Escape, but once you look closer, you\u2019ll see smaller scenes of bears and a raven.</p><p>The painting was inspired by Wheeler seeing a bear on her property in Quesnel during a particularly difficult forest fire year.</p><p>\u201cThis young grizzly bear appeared in my neighbourhood in town,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had black bears, lots of black bears, but never grizzly bears. I believe it was because the forest fires and the crazy drought conditions that year in 2023. So he was on the lookout for food, water, shelter, maybe.\u201d</p><p>Seeing that grizzly trying to survive in a changing climate is what inspired Wheeler\u2019s piece. Her process involves sketching out what she wants it to look like and picturing it in her mind.</p><p>\u201cThat one was kind of experimental, the way I did the background and stuff. I was trying some new things and I just liked the way it went,\u201d she said.</p><p>Wheeler has been creating art for over 40 years. She started as a child drawing horses and things like that and has stuck with art ever since. As she grew up, she had less time for art but always found time to keep creative on weekends or during evenings.</p><p>\u201cI get a little depressed if I can\u2019t do art for a period of time,\u201d she said.</p><p>She wanted her piece to be part of the contest because it has a story of survival around it and she wanted to see what creative ways people can expand on that story.</p><p>\u201cI hope the stories can reflect the emotion behind the painting. The themes of displacement, survival, the powerful instincts that the animals have and what they have to go through when the world around them is changing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d love to see writers explore the connection between memory and instinct and how the natural world still speaks to us if we\u2019re willing to listen.\u201d</p><p>She said people can do a great job sending that kind of message no matter what perspective the story is written from whether it\u2019s the bear, the raven or a person watching things unfold.</p><p>\u201cI hope the stories carry that sense of awe, urgency and empathy for the wild and for ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Wheeler has always enjoyed painting wildlife and spends a lot of time in nature listening and observing. The year after the grizzly was in her yard, she found an orphaned black bear cub in the same area and the Northern Lights Wildlife Society in Smithers rescued the cub. Because of that, Wheeler is giving a portion of sales from the painting as well as a portion from prints and cards she sells to Northern Lights.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to raise money for them. They\u2019re a good resource, I don\u2019t know if people in Quesnel know they can call them if they find wildlife in trouble,\u201d she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20250625PSCA0004811822</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G48-K553-RSV5-N183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"517\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Even though I was usually at a distant vantage point from all the action, I did see a lot of stuff anyway.</p><p>When I walk my dog around Port Alice, I am shocked to see people pile firewood against the outer walls of their homes. It brings me back to a conversation I had with a forest officer who said, \u201cfirewood piled up against your outer walls is like kindling to burn your house down.\u201d</p><p>The B.C.Wildfire Preparedness Guide says that flammable materials like firewood should be stored in the \u201cextended zone,\u201d 10 to 30 metres from your home. If that is not possible, it advises to store firewood inside a garage or shed or in other \u201cember resistant structures.\u201d</p><p>On July 20, 2023, Chantal Dunne, a forester with Strategic Natural Resource Consultants in Prince George, gave a presentation about wildfire preparedness at the Port Alice Community Centre. She stated that when firefighters need to move firewood away from people\u2019s homes it is a \u201cwaste of resources\u201d when they should be focused on saving the homes themselves.</p><p>In 2003, my mountain lookout was threatened by the Lost Creek Fire. When it was time for me to evacuate, I shut all the windows and doors tightly. As I was hanging out in \u201ccivilization,\u201d I was repeatedly told my lookout would be gone, until I was finally told it was gone. When the fire moved on to its next destination, to everyone\u2019s shock and surprise, my lookout emerged out of the smoke completely intact!</p><p>In addition to the firefighting efforts to save the lookout and its aluminum panelling and metal roof, the fire did not have a path of oxygen for the fire to follow because all my windows and doors were closed. The fire was also prevented from having access to my flammable personal items inside the cabin. The fire, which burned at about 2000 degrees Celsius, came as close as twenty feet to the building.</p><p>So, if you need to evacuate, shutting all the doors and windows\u2014robbing a fire of oxygen and fuel\u2014might save your house.</p><p>At a debriefing after a fire that burned several houses in an Indigenous community, we lookouts were informed that the houses that burned down all had fabric welcome mats! If you don\u2019t want to welcome fire into your home, invest in a wrought iron welcome mat or get rid of your flammable fabric one if it looks like you\u2019re going to be evacuated.</p><p>If you take precautionssometimes very simple onesyou might dramatically improve your luck in that proverbial \u201csummer wildfire lottery.\u201d</p><p>The BC Wildfire Preparedness Guide is available at the Port Alice Community Centre. It is also available online at the BC government website.</p><p>Debra Lynn lives in Port Alice and has a BFA in art and design from the University of Alberta and an MA in art education from Concordia University in Montreal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NRTHIG-news20250625PRCA0004812013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NRTHIG2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G48-K553-RSV5-N15J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

She\u00a0says it's an opportunity to support growers while fighting climate change.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biochar can improve water and\u00a0nutrient retention in soil\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>L\u00e9vesque is testing biochar on grapevines at 11 sites in the Valley to see how it affects carbon sequestration, soil biodiversity, plant growth and nutrient leaching. The experiment will run for four years.</p><p>\"Talking with the grape industry, [they] see some issues in their vineyards, such as soil compaction, nitrogen loss and also water retention, and so we ... brought that idea to test biochar in their vineyards.\"</p><p>Biochar is made by heating organic materials - usually wood, but also crop waste, manure and even sewage - to\u00a0temperatures as high as 1,000 C. That process,\u00a0known as pyrolysis,\u00a0happens without oxygen, meaning materials don't burn, but transform to a gas and a material that's almost entirely solid\u00a0carbon.</p><p/><p>That material is thought to benefit soil in a number of ways.\u00a0</p><p>Biochar is packed with tiny pores.\u00a0Those pores provide habitat for beneficial microorganisms;\u00a0a tablespoon of biochar can have as much surface area as a football field.</p><p>Biochar also retains water - as much as 27 grams per gram of biochar, allowing it to hold and release water over time\u00a0- and aerates soils, helping roots penetrate.</p><p>Atlantic Canada's freeze-thaw cycle causes soils to lose nitrogen from fertilizers to the atmosphere, costing farmers money and producing greenhouse gas emissions. Experiments suggest that biochar is able to retain that nitrogen, reducing emissions and fertilizer use.\u00a0</p><p>Biochar is almost\u00a090 per cent carbon,\u00a0as roasting without oxygen prevents the carbon in the wood from being released into the atmosphere.</p><p>Soils in Atlantic Canada now lose half a tonne of carbon a year, mainly through tillage. Biochar could help reverse that.</p><p>Dalhousie assistant professor Sonil Nanda, who is researching the production and use\u00a0of biochar in\u00a0applications ranging from agriculture to medicine,\u00a0said\u00a0biochar can help Canada make progress on climate change goals, especially when using material that would otherwise go to waste.\u00a0</p><p>\"Canada can be a leader in tapping into these underutilized residues that come from the agricultural sector, forestry sector, municipal solid waste, forest fire wood,\" he said. \"Biochar is one of those integral components ... that will help us move towards net zero.\"</p><p>L\u00e9vesque said\u00a0one current barrier to adoption is the cost - the experiment is using 10 tonnes of biochar per hectare, which adds up to about $10,000. Another is the availability of biochar, as there are currently no large-scale producers in Atlantic Canada.\u00a0</p><p>A Halifax-based company is working to address that.\u00a0</p><p>Sawmills in the province currently have no destination for their residual wood, the remaining material left after usable lumber is cut,\u00a0due to the closure of Northern Pulp.\u00a0</p><p>If that material is left to rot or is burned in an open fire, \"that is at risk of going back into the form of CO2 after the tree worked for 50 or 100 years to make it into carbon,\" said\u00a0Don LeBlanc, president of RDA Atlantic Inc.</p><p>He said the buildup of giant piles of wood chips and shavings at sawmills in Atlantic Canada \"is not a great environmental circumstance.\"</p><p/><p>Instead, RDA is proposing to turn that material into biochar.</p><p>RDA has been working with a reactor design developed and patented in Poland; that reactor, which can weigh up to 40 tonnes, produces biochar in large amounts. RDA is trying to bring the technology to North America, and LeBlanc said they're currently in discussions with a sawmill in Nova Scotia to install a reactor to produce biochar.\u00a0</p><p>In the meantime, RDA is selling biochar\u00a0that's produced in Poland locally, as a way of generating awareness among the public in this province.\u00a0</p><p>\"As the market builds for the product, then we'll be in a better position to justify the construction of the first production facility in Atlantic Canada,\" said\u00a0LeBlanc.</p><p>Biochar is also emerging as a solution to dead wood and other vegetation being produced by climate change.\u00a0</p><p/><p>Joe Lewis, co-founder of the company BioBurn Pros, didn't intend to start producing biochar. His company started in 2023\u00a0to help individuals and communities get rid of piles of vegetation created by natural disasters.\u00a0</p><p>BioBurn Pros offers a way to deal with the waste wood produced by hurricanes and wildfires, using portable burners that can be towed or trucked to a site, and quickly reduce the\u00a0wood to ash and biochar.</p><p>\"It wasn't until we found this business model that made sense and we started pursuing it that we started to learn, oh, one of our byproducts is actually, you know, a valuable resource itself,\" Lewis said.</p><p>Lewis said the company is seeing growing interest\u00a0in biochar, and is investigating a burner design that is specifically aimed at producing more biochar than their existing model.\u00a0In the future, Lewis envisions producing biochar as part\u00a0of disaster preparedness, when communities are taking steps like removing vegetation to prevent wildfires.\u00a0</p><p>\"These communities then need to deal with all the residual from that project, [and] we can give back to the community all the residual char so they can use it at home.\"</p><p/><p>One Nova Scotian\u00a0is already using biochar at home.</p><p>Rick Ketcheson grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan, but spent his career as an engineer. When he retired, he became interested in soil health and sustainable agriculture.</p><p>For the past nine years, he's been producing biochar in a kiln at his property in Annapolis Royal, using waste wood\u00a0from a sawmill nearby, and putting the material in his garden. The process is labour-intensive, said\u00a0Ketcheson,\u00a0but the benefits are clear.</p><p>\"I know that if I maintain a good microbiome and include biochar in the soil that I'm going to have healthy plants, and it works.\u00a0I have some tremendous results.\"</p><p>When it comes to encouraging wider adoption of biochar - which the UN has said can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-4/\">increase soil carbon sequestration and fertility</url> - in Nova Scotia, Ketcheson thinks a range of options can help make it a viable tool for Nova Scotians. In the meantime, he's encouraged by the increasing interest.\u00a0</p><p>\"We need systems that work for small scale\u00a0that people can do on their own farms or in the community ... as well as mid-level and industrial-level production. So I think again it's about diversity.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORE TOP STORIES</emphasis>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanovascotiacancharredwoodhelpnovascotiafarmersandtheclimate17563202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GDW-JD43-RS1T-Y0GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1163\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

(TSXV: CGC)(\"Canadian Gold\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce ongoing drill results from its Phase 4 drill program at the 100%-owned Tartan Mine, near Flin Flon, Manitoba. Results contained in this news release are from the South Zone, which is parallel to the Main Zone (Fig. 1, 2 &amp; 3), and prior to the recent drilling, was planned as a supplemental source of potential ore for future production. However, our objective has been to expand the resource in this area to 1) increase the number of ounces per vertical metre, 2) allow for higher production in a potential mine restart, and 3) drive economies of scale in order to lower future production and development costs. Recent expansion results from the South Zone, which increased the vertical extent of the mineralization by 120%, included 9.4 gpt gold over 3.3 metres and 6.1 gpt gold over 6.0 metres.</p><p>\"Today's results continue to build on the potential we see emerging at the South Zone. Despite the ongoing forest fire evacuation orders of Flin Flon and the surrounding region, including Tartan, our geology team, working diligently offsite, were able to get these encouraging drill results completed. Significant rainfall and cooler temperatures in the region over recent days have helped the firefighting crews and reduced the scope of the forest fires. We eagerly await the 'all clear' from the Province of Manitoba to be able to get back on site and resume the Phase 4 drill program.\" - Michael Swistun, CFA, President &amp; CEO</p><p>Drilling Highlights:</p><p>Hole TLSZ25-35 intersected two separate high-grade gold zones, returning 12.9 gpt gold over 3.0 metres and 7.6 gpt gold over 5.8 metres, both occurring within broader zones of 3.7 gpt gold over 23.0 metres and 3.3 gpt gold over 17.2 metres, respectively.</p><p>Similar to the Main Zone's lower grade material, the Company will be evaluating how best to mine and process this material within the potential mine life to best maximize the financial returns of the project.</p><p>The identification of two distinct zones opens a new target for exploration not previously known at the South Zone.</p><p>This development could materially increase the South Zone's total ounces per vertical metre, enhancing project economics and supporting a larger-scale restart scenario at the Tartan Mine.</p><p>These intersections occur in separate intervals within the same hole, confirming the presence of two discrete zones of gold mineralization between 345 and 376 metres below surface, a new geological development not previously observed at the South Zone.</p><p>Forest Fire Update</p><p>On May 28, 2025, the Company temporarily suspended drilling at the Tartan Mine due to safety concerns related to the forest fires near Flin Flon. The Company will announce when it is safe to resume drilling.</p><p>Table 1. Drilling Assay Highlights</p><p>Table 2.

Those in areas close to the blazes were evacuated; as far south as Chatham, residents were advised to avoid unnecessary outdoor activities. In Toronto, besieged by a brutal heat wave, the urban heat island effect trapped pollutants in the densely packed city, resulting in the dubious honour of being named one of the cities with the worst air quality in the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although authorities have become accustomed to taking action during wildfire season, the increasing intensity, duration and scope of fires mean that their impact is felt in areas that used to be impervious to forest fire fallout, and pre-existing protocols no longer suffice. While organizations and various levels of government conduct drills to help manage emergency situations, there are limits to how effective real-life practice can be if one is facing a previously unheard-of scenario. \"That's where computer modelling comes in,\" says Myrna Bittner, the CEO and co-founder of RunWithIt Synthetics, which has developed an AI-driven platform (she describes it as Google Earth meets Sim City) that can help municipalities and other groups visualize how a particular crisis might play out depending on different variables.</p><p>Virtual models and algorithmic calculations have long been involved in emergency planning, but as climate change makes it harder to anticipate the parameters of wildfires and other natural disasters, old frameworks are no longer effective. \"The failure is in the unimaginable,\" says Bittner, who notes that conventional climate modelling has often focused on incremental shifts over time. What's missing from that approach, she says, are \"the sudden and severe and chronic and compounding disasters\" that people need to understand in order to protect themselves and their communities. For RunWithIt, Bittner uses visualizations and leverages population-specific data that allows her to represent, for instance, how people navigate daily life in their community, how many homes will be permeated by smoke and how many residents will experience health complications.</p><p>Rather than foregrounding the human experience, many predictive tools focus on infrastructure destruction, buildings lost, acreage burnt. This makes it harder for people to grasp the urgency of a potential disaster - and it speaks to how virtual modelling itself needs to evolve. The world is not fixed or binary, Bittner says. \"We need to be constantly revising and augmenting our understanding,\" she adds, \"and the modelling world needs to escape that foundation of being reliant on historical data, because the future is not like the past.\"</p><p>Manzil expands banking options for Muslim Americans </p><p>Toronto-based Manzil, which specializes in financial services that adhere to the core tenets of the Islamic faith, is a unique fintech resource for a group that can struggle to access inclusive banking options. The startup, which has been providing halal mortgages to Canadians since 2020 (Sharia law prohibits transactions that earn interest, so conventional mortgages are verboten), has just launched Manzil Invest USA, an app that will allow American customers to explore different investment options without compromising their religious beliefs.</p><p>X CEO is now ex-CEO</p><p>Linda Yaccarino, who was named CEO of X (formerly Twitter) two years ago, is exiting her role at the corporation.

Nvidia had paused semiconductor trade with China in April due to the U.S. government's licensing requirements on Chinese orders. According to U.S.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the government's decision is related to its negotiations with Beijing over rare earth metals - and, he says, because Nvidia's H20 chip is just the company's \"fourth-best\" model, the administration is not overly concerned about exporting it to China.</p><p>Cheelcare rolls onto the TSX </p><p>Richmond Hill, Ont.-based Cheelcare, which specializes in innovative assistive tech, completed the final steps to become a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange, where it's now listed as CHER.

The City of Greenwood recognizes that it cannot tackle this challenge alone - it demands the active participation and commitment of multiple stakeholders working in concert.</p><p>City Council and the Greenwood Volunteer Fire Department play crucial roles in wildfire preparedness through proactive planning, resource allocation, and personnel training. The Regional District of Kootenay Boundary (RDKB) contributes essential support, expertise and emergency coordination on a wider geographic scale and specifically on the implementation of the FireSmart program. However, the most critical link in mounting an effective defense against wildfires is the engaged involvement of local property owners.</p><p>By maintaining defensible space around structures, utilizing fire-resistant landscaping and construction materials, and having a well-rehearsed evacuation plan, individual residents become indispensable partners in fortifying the entire community's resilience when facing an encroaching wildfire. Only by everyone - from elected officials to firefighters to homeowners - fully embracing their respective responsibilities can Greenwood be optimally equipped to confront the ever-present wildfire threat. Apathy is not an option; the city's wildfire readiness hinges on each person stepping up and doing their part in this essential collective endeavour.</p><p>As the Mayor, I also recognize that education around wildfire is essential. Hence why the City is increasing efforts to provide educational opportunities for the residents of Greenwood. This started on May 3rd with a Town Hall that provided a presentation by the British Columbia Wildfire Service on forest fire fighting 101. Staff are presently working with the RDKB to host another Town Hall that will focus on the FireSmart program and the City of Greenwood's Community Wildfire Resiliency Plan. Further communication tools are being developed including a full section in the new City website (estimated to be live at the end of the summer 2025) dedicated to all aspects of a wildfire event, including key links to the RDKB FireSmart program and grants available to homeowners.</p><p>FireSmart home evaluations are a critical first step for property owners looking to protect their homes and families from the threat of wildfire. These comprehensive assessments, offered free of charge by the RDKB, provide invaluable insights into the specific vulnerabilities and risk factors present on your property. By implementing these expert suggestions, homeowners can significantly enhance their property's resilience to wildfire, reducing the likelihood of ignition and improving the chances of the home surviving a fire event.</p><p>To take advantage of this potentially life-saving service, property owners simply need to visit the RDKB website and click on the FireSmart link under the Public Safety section. From there, booking a free FireSmart evaluation is a straightforward process that could make all the difference in safeguarding your home. However, if the community embraces this process, it can safeguard the entire City of Greenwood. As the Mayor, this is the standard we need to strive towards.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Grand Forks Gazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FORKSG-news20250616PGF4734487</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FORKSG2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2B-V1W3-RVBS-T51W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"550\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

This is Part II.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than 19 months after a forest fire near Saint Andrews, an after-action report promised by the government is still not finished, according to the Department of Justice and Public Safety.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, the department has confirmed to The Courier that it would release the report once it has been completed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kyle Leavitt, the director of the New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization (NBEMO), said in an interview that these reports are done to help understand what happened during an event and what lessons were learned.</p><p>\u201cCommunication is always something that we can do better and making sure that we have the right connections to the right individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest thing for me was always trying to make sure that we understand who is on the ground because not all the time do you have the same people that you think is going to be there and when you don\u2019t, being able to adapt and be able to connect, and be able to get the process going as quick as possible.\u201d</p><p>Leavitt said communication is always an area the organization hopes to improve when it comes to emergency situations.</p><p>While a local government could ask, the only organizations in charge of issuing emergency alerts in New Brunswick are the RCMP and NBEMO \u2013 and all requests must go through them.</p><p>The Department of Justice and Public Safety did not provide The Courier with criteria about the issuing of Alert Ready messages in New Brunswick for the various situations that can arise here.</p><p>Leavitt said the alert is only issued if there is an imminent threat to life or limb.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the intrusive nature of it, it really has to meet the criteria that there is an immediate danger \u2013 an imminent threat to life and limb,\u201d Leavitt said. in an interview. \u201cSo, it has to meet that criteria. That\u2019s why the local officials and authorities on the ground are best positioned to make that call. Once they determine (if) this meets that criteria, then we need to know where the zone is and we need to know what needs to be told to the listeners of the alert or the warning.\u201d</p><p>An Alert Ready ready was never sent during the forest fire in May 2023 near Saint Andrews.</p><p>The RCMP does provide a rough outline for what it considers for the use of the Alert Ready system, including:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>emergent firearm/weapon related offences</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>active shooter/immediate action rapid deployment (IARD) incidents</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>terrorist attacks</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>chemical/biological/radiological/nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) incidents with an established criminal nexus</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>civil disobedience/rioting</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>dangerous animal incidents</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>\u201cDuring a significant incident, we continue to assess the situation to determine if an alert is appropriate, and that an alert would not place the public and/or responding emergency personnel at greater risk,\u201d it said on its website. \u201cRisk assessments during an incident are ongoing and, as more information is received or if the situation changes, an alert can be issued, updated or cancelled at any time.\u201d</p><p>An Alert Ready message can be targeted to a specific geographical area, or even sent provincially or nationally, depending on the type of situation.</p><p>According to the documents obtained by CHCO-TV, the main form of communication about the fire was through social media, mainly Twitter (now known as X) and Facebook.</p><p>\u201cWe can always do better at how well we communicate and how we establish connections beforehand,\u201d said Leavitt.</p><p>Kevin Quigley is a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax who specializes in risk governance and critical infrastructure protection, focusing in particular on public sector responses to rare and high impact events.</p><p>Quigley said in an interview with The Courier that all disasters are different and the variables between them are considerable, including when the emergency happens, at what time, and whether this is common to the area.</p><p>\u201cSo, if you\u2019re dealing with the kind of disaster that people are not as familiar with, then there are other kinds of risks,\u201d he said.</p><p>For example, in the case of a hurricane, he said we usually have a 72-hour lead time, and we have become better at preparing for them and knowing what to do when one strikes.</p><p>Quigley said for areas where wildfires aren\u2019t common, there are other jurisdictions to look to for advice and planning, to be better prepared for the future.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about a rural community wildfires, this is something, if we\u2019re not already kind of learning our lessons, we should be,\u201d he said.</p><p>The professor said he believes New Brunswick\u2019s emergency management team is very good, having known and learned from some of the top officials at NBEMO.</p><p>Single points of failure </p><p>Quigely explained there are many single points of failure in a rural setting like the Saint Andrews area.</p><p>\u201c(In) the Maritimes, we have a lot of vulnerable populations. We have single road access, which is a real challenge, because with risk, you need redundancies to build into a system.\u201d</p><p>He recalled the Halifax wildfires in 2023, which were coincidentally happening at the time as the fire near Saint Andrews, saying colleagues of his pointed out that people were driving toward the fire on roads needed by emergency services.</p><p>\u201cThe problem with the people with the car is (people) who thought they could jump in the car and drive away and say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m just driving into Halifax.\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018No, you\u2019re driving away from Halifax because we have one road and emergency services coming in from that road,\u2019\u201d said Quigley.</p><p>Quigley explained after several high-impact events in Nova Scotia, including the 1998 Swissair Flight 111 crash and Hurricane Juan in 2003, it became clear the need for emergency officials to be in the same room very quickly.</p><p>However, he said in some cases, no one is quick to rush on owning decisions that are made in the midst of a crisis.</p><p>\u201cWhen there\u2019s a crisis, are people willing to put their hand up right away and say, you know, \u2018I did it, it\u2019s my fault,\u2019 you know? Or if they didn\u2019t handle it well? Probably not,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess what you really want to see is you want to see a commitment to learning. You want to see transparency. Really an open account of what happened and how we can improve and who is going to be accountable for that improvement. How they\u2019re going to report back to us and tell us how they\u2019ve improved, not just let it drift away into the next wildfire.\u201d</p><p>He said it is correct to suggest you have to have a lot of information in order to issue an emergency alert that informs the public accurately.</p><p>\u201cNot to just say there\u2019s a fire, but there\u2019s a fire, and this is what you need to do about it,\u201d he said. \u201cGive people some action to actually respond. It\u2019s an important part of risk communication.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-41443a9a128e48c1b0a88fc9afc11cd3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DXH-FP43-RSVT-B4XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1118\"/><timeReceived>09:03 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 17, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public Health Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level). On the other hand, it could also be washing it out.\"</p><p>Rain is, however, a potential filter factor for the AQHI.</p><p>Will air quality alerts continue this summer?</p><p>\"As long as forest fires continues, there will be the potential for more air quality statements. But it all depends on how the winds blow.\"</p><p>For now, the winds are still blowing the smoke to the south, and people should watch the AQHI alerts on weather.gc.ca or on the WeatherCAN app.</p><p>There's also a world air quality index map that you can explore, to see what other impacts are happening across the globe, at waqi.info. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2025060775745808</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCD-H5S3-S3Y2-V02J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public Health Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level). On the other hand, it could also be washing it out.\"</p><p>Rain is, however, a potential filter factor for the AQHI.</p><p>Will air quality alerts continue this summer?</p><p>\"As long as forest fires continues, there will be the potential for more air quality statements. But it all depends on how the winds blow.\"</p><p>For now, the winds are still blowing the smoke to the south, and people should watch the AQHI alerts on weather.gc.ca or on the WeatherCAN app.</p><p>There's also a world air quality index map that you can explore, to see what other impacts are happening across the globe, at waqi.info. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2025060775745781</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCF-DKW3-S79W-P1Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public Health Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level). On the other hand, it could also be washing it out.\"</p><p>Rain is, however, a potential filter factor for the AQHI.</p><p>Will air quality alerts continue this summer?</p><p>\"As long as forest fires continues, there will be the potential for more air quality statements. But it all depends on how the winds blow.\"</p><p>For now, the winds are still blowing the smoke to the south, and people should watch the AQHI alerts on weather.gc.ca or on the WeatherCAN app.</p><p>There's also a world air quality index map that you can explore, to see what other impacts are happening across the globe, at waqi.info. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2025060775745843</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCD-KWN3-RTJ5-33K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

John Herron, the minister of natural resources, said they're expected to make a full recovery.</p><p>However, the bigger, out-of-control wildfire near Miramichi, where there are far fewer people, remains a serious concern.</p><p>Herron said firefighters had successfully steered that fire in the right direction, away from houses, camps and businesses, but had been unable to contain it.</p><p>First detected Aug. 6, the Oldfield Road Fire had grown to 1,358 hectares by Wednesday evening, similar in size to more than 600 football fields. The premier said people who had expressed worry in the nearby communities of Lavillette and Neguac on the coast were still not on standby for evacuation.</p><p>She and Public Safety Minister Robert Gauvin said they were basing their decisions on experts in the field. Should anyone need to be evacuated, they will receive an Alert Ready notification on their phone, computer, TV or radio, authorities said.</p><p>Farther south, people had packed their bags over the last several days were growing increasingly anxious before the standby notice was lifted. Enid Leger, who lives on the Weisner Road, off Shediac Road, said it had been a stressful week in an otherwise quiet rural community.</p><p>She and her partner Terry McRobbie saw the waterbombing aircraft flying over their house all day Sunday and Monday. At times, chunks of smoking hot ash from the fires were landing in their yard.</p><p>They were concerned about the possibility of evacuating, so she loaded her car with family photographs and other important articles. While the order to evacuate didn't come, she believes there should be a better way of communicating with people who live in a danger zone.</p><p>The Weisner Road falls within the new Maple Hills rural community that was created under the province's municipal reform.</p><p>\"Ironically, I had volunteered to serve on a new committee to deal with emergency measures,\" she said. \"Our first meeting was scheduled for Monday and was cancelled because of this.\"</p><p>\"It's really been a waiting game and lots of worry.\"</p><p>The premier said she understood the situation was nerve-wracking.</p><p>\"When you've been told to get ready for evacuation, and you pack your bags and stuff is sitting by the front door, and then you're sitting by the radio or your laptop and you're hitting refresh, you want new information every minute,\" Holt said.\u00a0</p><p>\"The team has been doing their best to provide good and clear communications, as we get information from the ground. As you can appreciate, for those folks, their first task is to put out the fire and then tell us the work they're doing.\"</p><p>To underline the volatility of the situation, by 8 p.m. on Wednesday, the Irishtown fire was listed as \"contained\", after previously being described as \"out of control\" while another fire, east of Bathurst in a sparsely populated area labelled Cach\u00e9, was re-listed as \"out of control.\"\u00a0</p><p>Officials are encouraging people to get up-to-date information by looking at the province's FireWatch page or social media for the Emergency Measures Organization or by contacting their local municipalities.</p><p>The website has a live dashboard and a PDF report that's updated every 15 minutes.</p><p>The latest summary released Thursday morning showed that across New Brunswick, two fires still out of control, two under control, three contained, and seven under patrol for possible flareups. Eleven were considered out.\u00a0</p><p>There was a break in the extreme heat Thursday after a four-day heat wave that saw temperatures soar to the upper 30s C and humidex values hitting above 40. There was also a scattering of showers, but lightning strikes over night also started some fires.</p><p>Although the three leaders at the news conference praised many New Brunswickers for abiding by the law and offering help, they expressed disappointment that some people were still making illegal backyard fires or ripping around on ATVs or side-by sides on public trails.</p><p>Such activities were banned as of the weekend. Asked if any fines had been administered since two were delivered earlier in the week for people making campfires, Holt said the idea wasn't to be punitive but to encourage the right behaviour.</p><p>A burn ban, which includes campfires in provincial parks, remained in place for the entire province Thursday, and recreational activities on Crown lands were not permitted.</p><p>Logging operations such as harvesting, forwarding, skidding, scarification, chipping and all pre-commercial thinning and cleaning were suspended indefinitely over the weekend, on both Crown and private land.</p><p>Officials said some forestry operations would resume Thursday night if the fire risk had dampened. For instance, officials said peat piles may be reduced since they can cause a fire hazard. As well, if a mill has less than a five-day supply of harvested trees, trucks will be allowed to go into the woods to get that supply, provided they have water at the ready for dousing fires.</p><p>Blueberries on Crown land will be allowed to be harvested again, but farmers will have to get a permit and meet specific conditions, such as working at night and with firefighting equipment on site.</p><p>The Department of Natural Resources said in a release it would communicate the conditions with those industries directly.</p><p>Officials at the press conference also encouraged New Brunswickers to conserve water, as the historic drought could soon pose problems for municipal and private wells.</p><p>Moncton Fire Chief Conrad Landry said Moncton, Riverview and Dieppe has had 24 firefighters worked at extinguishing the Irishtown blaze all Wednesday. Fire departments from Havelock, Petitcodiac, Salisbury and other communities also sent vehicles and firefighters to help. The municipal firefighters were working with provincial firefighters to dig at hot spots as temperatures soared above 35 C.</p><p>\"Dealing with the heat and the terrain is the hard part,\" Landry said. \"There are stumps and trees that are half burned, and that is hard on the firefighters.\"</p><p>He said the hard work in the heat was exhausting.</p><p>\"The good news is that it's not the same gear we wear for structural fires. These are special coveralls and a different helmet, and nothing on their back,\" Landry said.</p><p>\"The bad news is that this is hard physical work with shovels and axes to dig at the roots to make sure the fire is completely out. The hot weather and physical work is a tough combination.\"</p><p>Over the last several days, the province has been bombing different fires with water, using 14 air tankers and three helicopters.</p><p>A total of 30 firefighters from other places are helping - five from Prince Edward Island, five from Maine and 20 from Nova Scotia. They have joined more than 100 personnel in New Brunswick who are specially trained to combat wildfires.</p><p>This is short of the 60 Herron had asked for through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. It also hasn't had access to a third superscooper water bomber it had requested from Baie-Comeau, Que.</p><p>But Herron said wildfires were a national threat, and the resources were being shipped where they were most needed, including Newfoundland. Two of New Brunswick's water bombers were temporarily sent to Nova Scotia on Tuesday to help the neighbouring province douse some fires.</p><p>The province on Wednesday reminded people on standby for evacuation that they should have a bag ready with water, food, flashlight, radio, batteries, first aid kit, masks for smoke filtration, prescription medications, cash, and, if needed, pet food and baby formula. Authorities also encouraged people to keep legal documents and passports at the ready.</p><p>\"As a reminder, every household that could potentially be affected should have a kit stocked with everything their family would need for at least 72 hours in the event of an evacuation,\" said Nick Brown, a spokesman for the Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development.</p><p>Ernest Robichaud, mayor of the Alnwick rural community north of Miramichi, said he was happy rain and a change of wind direction was in Thursday's forecast.</p><p>\"A little bit of rain would help. A week of steady rain would probably be better, but we'll take whatever we can get,\" said Robichaud, who lives in Tabusintac.</p><p>\"I commend the people on the front lines fighting the fire. It's hot where we are, so it must be even hotter where they're at.\"</p><p>Herron told reporters at the press conference that five millimetres of rain would \"buy you a day,\" and 50 mm would help get the province back to normal. A heavy rainfall like that is not in the immediate forecast.</p><p>To help people suffering from the hot temperatures, the provincial government set up 15 comfort centres around the province with air conditioning. Old people living alone are considered particularly vulnerable.\u00a0</p><p>The public safety minister, meanwhile, encouraged people to check on their neighbours, families and friends.</p><p>Both he and Herron recently heard from the president of Mount Allison University, Ian Sutherland, who offered his institution's residences in Sackville for anyone who needed to be evacuated until Aug. 26, when students return for the academic year.</p><p>\"Go Mounties!\" Herron joked, a reference to Mount A's sports teams.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e768e6250e764b63b1ea14bdd1a6ddae</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH3-5X23-S5SM-00K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1641\"/><timeReceived>09:43 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 14, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public HealthOntario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public HealthOntario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public HealthOntario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere.

It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public HealthOntario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public HealthOntario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public HealthOntario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public Health Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level). On the other hand, it could also be washing it out.\"</p><p>Rain is, however, a potential filter factor for the AQHI.</p><p>Will air quality alerts continue this summer?</p><p>\"As long as forest fires continues, there will be the potential for more air quality statements. But it all depends on how the winds blow.\"</p><p>For now, the winds are still blowing the smoke to the south, and people should watch the AQHI alerts on weather.gc.ca or on the WeatherCAN app.</p><p>There's also a world air quality index map that you can explore, to see what other impacts are happening across the globe, at waqi.info. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2025060775745795</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCD-KV33-RVNG-M0P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public Health Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level). On the other hand, it could also be washing it out.\"</p><p>Rain is, however, a potential filter factor for the AQHI.</p><p>Will air quality alerts continue this summer?</p><p>\"As long as forest fires continues, there will be the potential for more air quality statements. But it all depends on how the winds blow.\"</p><p>For now, the winds are still blowing the smoke to the south, and people should watch the AQHI alerts on weather.gc.ca or on the WeatherCAN app.</p><p>There's also a world air quality index map that you can explore, to see what other impacts are happening across the globe, at waqi.info. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2025060775745782</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCF-DMG3-S881-40JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public Health Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public HealthOntario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public HealthOntario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public HealthOntario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level). On the other hand, it could also be washing it out.\"</p><p>Rain is, however, a potential filter factor for the AQHI.</p><p>Will air quality alerts continue this summer?</p><p>\"As long as forest fires continues, there will be the potential for more air quality statements. But it all depends on how the winds blow.\"</p><p>For now, the winds are still blowing the smoke to the south, and people should watch the AQHI alerts on weather.gc.ca or on the WeatherCAN app.</p><p>There's also a world air quality index map that you can explore, to see what other impacts are happening across the globe, at waqi.info. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2025060775739433</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G0C-97W3-RRT0-M495-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public Health Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level). On the other hand, it could also be washing it out.\"</p><p>Rain is, however, a potential filter factor for the AQHI.</p><p>Will air quality alerts continue this summer?</p><p>\"As long as forest fires continues, there will be the potential for more air quality statements. But it all depends on how the winds blow.\"</p><p>For now, the winds are still blowing the smoke to the south, and people should watch the AQHI alerts on weather.gc.ca or on the WeatherCAN app.</p><p>There's also a world air quality index map that you can explore, to see what other impacts are happening across the globe, at waqi.info. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2025060775745852</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCD-KWN3-RTJ5-33K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public Health Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level). On the other hand, it could also be washing it out.\"</p><p>Rain is, however, a potential filter factor for the AQHI.</p><p>Will air quality alerts continue this summer?</p><p>\"As long as forest fires continues, there will be the potential for more air quality statements. But it all depends on how the winds blow.\"</p><p>For now, the winds are still blowing the smoke to the south, and people should watch the AQHI alerts on weather.gc.ca or on the WeatherCAN app.</p><p>There's also a world air quality index map that you can explore, to see what other impacts are happening across the globe, at waqi.info. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2025060775745796</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCD-KSK3-RTBX-M3PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Walter Colquhoun Grant planted a European perennial shrub on his farm on T\u2019Sou-ke Nation\u2019s traditional territory (Sooke).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He thought the shrub \u2014 Cytisus scorparius in Latin \u2014 would bring back nostalgia of his Scottish homeland, covered with hills of yellow flowers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One-hundred and seventy-five years later, this shrub is now one of the most notorious invasive species on Vancouver Island known colloquially as Scotch broom. Vast areas of the Island are covered in this plant, exhibiting what a changed landscape can look like if invasive plants are allowed to spread and take over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It competes with native plants, disrupts streams and has no known natural predators. It can also live up to 25 years and produces seeds that can survive in the soil for 30 years.</p><p>Scotch broom is also extremely flammable, leading to growing concern as the climate changes and Earth warms.</p><p>Luckily, one Vancouver Island-wide organization has been working for nearly two decades to decrease the abundance of Scotch broom in local areas, and an invasive species expert says groups such as these, along with other forms of traditional land management that draw on Indigenous knowledge, give him hope that disastrous wildfires sparked by broom can be mitigated or avoided.</p><p>Invasive plants and wildfire:a \u2018sleeping giant\u2019 Hunter Jarratt is an ecological restoration consultant based in the Nanaimo area, and is more famously known as the Invasive Species Guy. He told The Discourse that Scotch broom has a high oil content, so it\u2019s flammable even while it\u2019s still green and alive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about six feet tall, so if you have a pile that\u2019s as tall as me the flames would easily grow to three or four times that in a matter of minutes \u2014 seconds, even,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes Vancouver Island doesn\u2019t see a fire similar to the one in 2023 that devastated Lahaina, Hawaii, and was amplified due to invasive grasses.</p><p>The grasses were left over from sugar cane plantations and, similarly to broom, would crowd out native species. According to reporting from the Washington Post, powerlines fell on the fields of grass in 2023 leading to a disastrous wildfire that killed 102 people.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty concerning, especially the ecosystems that have grasslands that are a mix of these dry grasses, Scotch brooms and maybe some other shrubs in there too. There\u2019s just so much fuel in those places that it\u2019s a sleeping giant,\u201d Jarratt said.</p><p>Jarratt also explained how invasive species can fuel fires by changing the natural fire cycle of an ecosystem. This is referred to as the invasive plant/fire cycle.</p><p>These new invaders, he explained, will add fuel to the ecosystem so more intense and severe fires will occur. After the fire, because those species were already present in that ecosystem, they will be the first to colonize and repopulate those sites.</p><p>Jarratt said the invasive plants push out native species that can\u2019t adapt quickly, taking advantage of sunlight and nutrients. The increase in invasive species makes the ecosystem less resilient, creating a monoculture and setting the stage for another fire.</p><p>This is all amplified by climate change and increasingly common drought conditions, he added.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s leading to a pretty rapid instability of an ecosystem. It\u2019s invade, burn, repeat over and over again. So it\u2019s quite concerning.\u201d</p><p>Jarratt said the undermining of Indigenous knowledge and land stewardship is another big contributor to the spread of invasive species.</p><p>The colonial government has historically put forth policies of fire suppression, such as the 1874 Bush Fire Act that banned Indigenous cultural burning. Research shows these policies have led to a buildup of forest fire fuels, increased fire risk, decreased forest resilience and, in turn, more out-of-control wildfires.</p><p>\u201cAs much as fire is scary, not all fire is bad,\u201d Jarratt said, adding that ecosystems such as the Garry oak ecosystem traditionally relied on regular, low-intensity ground fires to limit the spread of competing tree species.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one thing I always like to talk about with this kind of conversation with burning and with Scotch broom is the Garry oak ecosystem, which there is way less of in the Comox Valley now,\u201d Jarratt said.</p><p>Busting broom Jarratt said he still sees opportunities for people to learn how to manage invasive species in their areas.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of effort to control it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPeople who have farmland and natural areas on their land, as long as you\u2019re doing your part to keep invasive species in check, I think we\u2019d be in a much better position.\u201d</p><p>One of the organizations that inspired Jarratt to learn more about invasive species involves a group of committed people who are determined to get rid of as much invasive Scotch broom as possible:The Broombusters. Bev Agur has been committed to cutting down broom since 2010, when she became involved.</p><p>The organization that was founded in 2006 by Joanne Sales, who noticed a lot of Scotch broom growing near her blueberry farm in Coombs. Since then, this volunteer-run organization has expanded all across Vancouver Island, including in the Comox Valley, Cowichan Valley and Nanaimo.</p><p>\u201cMy husband and I moved out to the Comox Valley in 2009 from Alberta, and we didn\u2019t really know anything about broom,\u201d Agur said.</p><p>She has been cutting broom with the organization since 2010, and is now the area organizer for the Comox Valley\u2019s division of Broombusters. For six days a week, for six weeks of the year when broom is in season, the group of Broombusters goes out to cut it down.</p><p>Like Jarratt, she\u2019s learned how much of a fire risk it is.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s broom that\u2019s growing under a powerline \u2026 if a wildfire gets there, it\u2019ll just take off,\u201d she said.</p><p>Agur said the summer is not the best time to cut broom, because if it is cut and sits and dries out, it is a fire risk.</p><p>\u201cAnd the problem is it\u2019s full of seed pods, so you run the risk of spreading those around,\u201d she said.</p><p>Those who are curious to learn about Comox Valley broom cutting can keep their eyes out for when to join in the spring. She added that there is a video on the organization\u2019s website that explains how to cut broom properly.</p><p>\u201cWe have lots of tools so people could show up and cut broom with us,\u201d she said. \u201cI suggest they bring some work gloves or gardening gloves, and wear dirty shoes and old clothes, because often broom is growing around blackberries and roses.\u201d</p><p>Controlling the fire Jarratt said getting involved with invasive species control and learning more about controlled burning (also known as prescribed burning) are some of the best ways to manage invasive species and fire risk.</p><p>Controlled burning helps reduce the amount of fuel load \u2014 what is available to burn in an area. After years go by, the fuel builds up on the ground as vegetation grows and falls to the forest floor and then is available to burn again, Jarratt explained. He also said some plant species such as Lodgepole pine are dependent on fire, so they won\u2019t germinate unless there is a fire.</p><p>Prescribed burns are often lighter and less hot as well, he said. They\u2019re small enough to support germination but not big enough that it burns the whole ecosystem down.</p><p>On the south Island, Jarratt pointed to biologist James Miskelly who does prescribed burns at Rocky Point, home to a Garry oak ecosystem which has historically relied on controlled burning to keep it healthy.</p><p>In B.C. \u2019s southern interior, known for its dry landscape and frequent wildfires, groups such as the Salish Fire Keepers Society and Ntityix Resources have taken up Indigenous-led controlled burning, something that was suppressed from colonialism after being practiced for millennia.</p><p>\u201cI feel like this is going to be an increasingly important factor as more areas evidently burn on Vancouver Island in the future,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEspecially all these hilly ecosystems that have huge fuel loads that have built up over many, many, many years, but are now also invaded by these highly flammable species like Scotch broom.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVRECO-news20250806PPXA0004868565</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVRECO2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GF7-BWR3-RSJS-N0J0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438259</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1329\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public Health Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level). On the other hand, it could also be washing it out.\"</p><p>Rain is, however, a potential filter factor for the AQHI.</p><p>Will air quality alerts continue this summer?</p><p>\"As long as forest fires continues, there will be the potential for more air quality statements.

Walter Colquhoun Grant planted a European perennial shrub on his farm on T\u2019Sou-ke Nation\u2019s traditional territory (Sooke).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He thought the shrub \u2014 Cytisus scorparius in Latin \u2014 would bring back nostalgia of his Scottish homeland, covered with hills of yellow flowers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One-hundred and seventy-five years later, this shrub is now one of the most notorious invasive species on Vancouver Island known colloquially as Scotch broom. Vast areas of the Island are covered in this plant, exhibiting what a changed landscape can look like if invasive plants are allowed to spread and take over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It competes with native plants, disrupts streams and has no known natural predators. It can also live up to 25 years and produces seeds that can survive in the soil for 30 years.</p><p>Scotch broom is also extremely flammable, leading to growing concern as the climate changes and Earth warms.</p><p>Luckily, one Vancouver Island-wide organization has been working for nearly two decades to decrease the abundance of Scotch broom in local areas, and an invasive species expert says groups such as these, along with other forms of traditional land management that draw on Indigenous knowledge, give him hope that disastrous wildfires sparked by broom can be mitigated or avoided.</p><p>Invasive plants and wildfire:a \u2018sleeping giant\u2019 Hunter Jarratt is an ecological restoration consultant based in the Nanaimo area, and is more famously known as the Invasive Species Guy. He told The Discourse that Scotch broom has a high oil content, so it\u2019s flammable even while it\u2019s still green and alive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about six feet tall, so if you have a pile that\u2019s as tall as me the flames would easily grow to three or four times that in a matter of minutes \u2014 seconds, even,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes Vancouver Island doesn\u2019t see a fire similar to the one in 2023 that devastated Lahaina, Hawaii, and was amplified due to invasive grasses.</p><p>The grasses were left over from sugar cane plantations and, similarly to broom, would crowd out native species. According to reporting from the Washington Post, powerlines fell on the fields of grass in 2023 leading to a disastrous wildfire that killed 102 people.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty concerning, especially the ecosystems that have grasslands that are a mix of these dry grasses, Scotch brooms and maybe some other shrubs in there too. There\u2019s just so much fuel in those places that it\u2019s a sleeping giant,\u201d Jarratt said.</p><p>Jarratt also explained how invasive species can fuel fires by changing the natural fire cycle of an ecosystem. This is referred to as the invasive plant/fire cycle.</p><p>These new invaders, he explained, will add fuel to the ecosystem so more intense and severe fires will occur. After the fire, because those species were already present in that ecosystem, they will be the first to colonize and repopulate those sites.</p><p>Jarratt said the invasive plants push out native species that can\u2019t adapt quickly, taking advantage of sunlight and nutrients. The increase in invasive species makes the ecosystem less resilient, creating a monoculture and setting the stage for another fire.</p><p>This is all amplified by climate change and increasingly common drought conditions, he added.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s leading to a pretty rapid instability of an ecosystem. It\u2019s invade, burn, repeat over and over again. So it\u2019s quite concerning.\u201d</p><p>Jarratt said the undermining of Indigenous knowledge and land stewardship is another big contributor to the spread of invasive species.</p><p>The colonial government has historically put forth policies of fire suppression, such as the 1874 Bush Fire Act that banned Indigenous cultural burning. Research shows these policies have led to a build-up of forest fire fuels, increased fire risk, decreased forest resilience and, in turn, more out-of-control wildfires.</p><p>\u201cAs much as fire is scary, not all fire is bad,\u201d Jarratt said, adding that ecosystems such as the Garry oak ecosystem traditionally relied on regular, low-intensity ground fires to limit the spread of competing tree species.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one thing I always like to talk about with this kind of conversation with burning and with Scotch broom is the Garry oak ecosystem, which there is way less of in the Comox Valley now,\u201d Jarratt said.</p><p>Busting broom Jarratt said he still sees opportunities for people to learn how to manage invasive species in their areas.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of effort to control it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPeople who have farmland and natural areas on their land, as long as you\u2019re doing your part to keep invasive species in check, I think we\u2019d be in a much better position.\u201d</p><p>One of the organizations that inspired Jarratt to learn more about invasive species involves a group of committed people who are determined to get rid of as much invasive Scotch broom as possible:The Broombusters. Bev Agur has been committed to cutting down broom since 2010, when she became involved.</p><p>The organization that was founded in 2006 by Joanne Sales, who noticed a lot of Scotch broom growing near her blueberry farm in Coombs. Since then, this volunteer-run organization has expanded all across Vancouver Island, including in the Comox Valley, Cowichan Valley and Nanaimo.</p><p>\u201cMy husband and I moved out to the Comox Valley in 2009 from Alberta, and we didn\u2019t really know anything about broom,\u201d Agur said.</p><p>She has been cutting broom with the organization since 2010, and is now the area organizer for the Comox Valley\u2019s division of Broombusters. For six days a week, for six weeks of the year when broom is in season, the group of Broombusters goes out to cut it down.</p><p>Like Jarratt, she\u2019s learned how much of a fire risk it is.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s broom that\u2019s growing under a powerline \u2026 if a wildfire gets there, it\u2019ll just take off,\u201d she said.</p><p>Agur said the summer is not the best time to cut broom, because if it is cut and sits and dries out, it is a fire risk.</p><p>\u201cAnd the problem is it\u2019s full of seed pods, so you run the risk of spreading those around,\u201d she said.</p><p>Those who are curious to learn about Comox Valley broom cutting can keep their eyes out for when to join in the spring. She added that there is a video on the organization\u2019s website that explains how to cut broom properly.</p><p>\u201cWe have lots of tools so people could show up and cut broom with us,\u201d she said. \u201cI suggest they bring some work gloves or gardening gloves, and wear dirty shoes and old clothes, because often broom is growing around blackberries and roses.\u201d</p><p>Controlling the fire Jarratt said getting involved with invasive species control and learning more about controlled burning (also known as prescribed burning) are some of the best ways to manage invasive species and fire risk.</p><p>Controlled burning helps reduce the amount of fuel load \u2014 what is available to burn in an area. After years go by, the fuel builds up on the ground as vegetation grows and falls to the forest floor and then is available to burn again, Jarratt explained. He also said some plant species such as Lodgepole pine are dependent on fire, so they won\u2019t germinate unless there is a fire.</p><p>Prescribed burns are often lighter and less hot as well, he said. They\u2019re small enough to support germination but not big enough that it burns the whole ecosystem down.</p><p>On the south Island, Jarratt pointed to biologist James Miskelly who does prescribed burns at Rocky Point, home to a Garry oak ecosystem which has historically relied on controlled burning to keep it healthy.</p><p>In B.C. \u2019s southern interior, known for its dry landscape and frequent wildfires, groups such as the Salish Fire Keepers Society and Ntityix Resources have taken up Indigenous-led controlled burning, something that was suppressed from colonialism after being practiced for millennia.</p><p>\u201cI feel like this is going to be an increasingly important factor as more areas evidently burn on Vancouver Island in the future,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEspecially all these hilly ecosystems that have huge fuel loads that have built up over many, many, many years, but are now also invaded by these highly flammable species like Scotch broom.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPRIV-news20250806PPPA0004868395</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPRIV2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GF7-BWR3-RSJS-N0GT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1329\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level). On the other hand, it could also be washing it out.\"</p><p>Rain is, however, a potential filter factor for the AQHI.</p><p>Will air quality alerts continue this summer?</p><p>\"As long as forest fires continues, there will be the potential for more air quality statements. But it all depends on how the winds blow.\"</p><p>For now, the winds are still blowing the smoke to the south, and people should watch the AQHI alerts on weather.gc.ca or on the WeatherCAN app.</p><p>There's also a world air quality index map that you can explore, to see what other impacts are happening across the globe, at waqi.info. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2025060775739594</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G0C-97W3-RRT0-M4S6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public Health Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public Health Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level). On the other hand, it could also be washing it out.\"</p><p>Rain is, however, a potential filter factor for the AQHI.</p><p>Will air quality alerts continue this summer?</p><p>\"As long as forest fires continues, there will be the potential for more air quality statements. But it all depends on how the winds blow.\"</p><p>For now, the winds are still blowing the smoke to the south, and people should watch the AQHI alerts on weather.gc.ca or on the WeatherCAN app.</p><p>There's also a world air quality index map that you can explore, to see what other impacts are happening across the globe, at waqi.info. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2025060775745773</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCD-H573-RTJ2-B548-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public HealthOntario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public HealthOntario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public HealthOntario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level). On the other hand, it could also be washing it out.\"</p><p>Rain is, however, a potential filter factor for the AQHI.</p><p>Will air quality alerts continue this summer?</p><p>\"As long as forest fires continues, there will be the potential for more air quality statements. But it all depends on how the winds blow.\"</p><p>For now, the winds are still blowing the smoke to the south, and people should watch the AQHI alerts on weather.gc.ca or on the WeatherCAN app.</p><p>There's also a world air quality index map that you can explore, to see what other impacts are happening across the globe, at waqi.info. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2025060775739583</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G0C-97W3-RRT0-M3TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario) Online</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 7, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX001885</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY MONITORING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000056</classCode><className>AIR POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001348</classCode><className>POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp;

Vast areas of the Island are covered in this plant, exhibiting what a changed landscape can look like if invasive plants are allowed to spread and take over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It competes with native plants, disrupts streams and has no known natural predators. It can also live up to 25 years and produces seeds that can survive in the soil for 30 years.</p><p>Scotch broom is also extremely flammable, leading to growing concern as the climate changes and Earth warms.</p><p>Luckily, one Vancouver Island-wide organization has been working for nearly two decades to decrease the abundance of Scotch broom in local areas, and an invasive species expert says groups such as these, along with other forms of traditional land management that draw on Indigenous knowledge, give him hope that disastrous wildfires sparked by broom can be mitigated or avoided.</p><p>Invasive plants and wildfire:a \u2018sleeping giant\u2019 Hunter Jarratt is an ecological restoration consultant based in the Nanaimo area, and is more famously known as the Invasive Species Guy. He told The Discourse that Scotch broom has a high oil content, so it\u2019s flammable even while it\u2019s still green and alive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about six feet tall, so if you have a pile that\u2019s as tall as me the flames would easily grow to three or four times that in a matter of minutes \u2014 seconds, even,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes Vancouver Island doesn\u2019t see a fire similar to the one in 2023 that devastated Lahaina, Hawaii, and was amplified due to invasive grasses.</p><p>The grasses were left over from sugar cane plantations and, similarly to broom, would crowd out native species. According to reporting from the Washington Post, powerlines fell on the fields of grass in 2023 leading to a disastrous wildfire that killed 102 people.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty concerning, especially the ecosystems that have grasslands that are a mix of these dry grasses, Scotch brooms and maybe some other shrubs in there too. There\u2019s just so much fuel in those places that it\u2019s a sleeping giant,\u201d Jarratt said.</p><p>Jarratt also explained how invasive species can fuel fires by changing the natural fire cycle of an ecosystem. This is referred to as the invasive plant/fire cycle.</p><p>These new invaders, he explained, will add fuel to the ecosystem so more intense and severe fires will occur. After the fire, because those species were already present in that ecosystem, they will be the first to colonize and repopulate those sites.</p><p>Jarratt said the invasive plants push out native species that can\u2019t adapt quickly, taking advantage of sunlight and nutrients. The increase in invasive species makes the ecosystem less resilient, creating a monoculture and setting the stage for another fire.</p><p>This is all amplified by climate change and increasingly common drought conditions, he added.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s leading to a pretty rapid instability of an ecosystem. It\u2019s invade, burn, repeat over and over again. So it\u2019s quite concerning.\u201d</p><p>Jarratt said the undermining of Indigenous knowledge and land stewardship is another big contributor to the spread of invasive species.</p><p>The colonial government has historically put forth policies of fire suppression, such as the 1874 Bush Fire Act that banned Indigenous cultural burning. Research shows these policies have led to a build-up of forest fire fuels, increased fire risk, decreased forest resilience and, in turn, more out-of-control wildfires.</p><p>\u201cAs much as fire is scary, not all fire is bad,\u201d Jarratt said, adding that ecosystems such as the Garry oak ecosystem traditionally relied on regular, low-intensity ground fires to limit the spread of competing tree species.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one thing I always like to talk about with this kind of conversation with burning and with Scotch broom is the Garry oak ecosystem, which there is way less of in the Comox Valley now,\u201d Jarratt said.</p><p>Busting broom Jarratt said he still sees opportunities for people to learn how to manage invasive species in their areas.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of effort to control it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPeople who have farmland and natural areas on their land, as long as you\u2019re doing your part to keep invasive species in check, I think we\u2019d be in a much better position.\u201d</p><p>One of the organizations that inspired Jarratt to learn more about invasive species involves a group of committed people who are determined to get rid of as much invasive Scotch broom as possible:The Broombusters. Bev Agur has been committed to cutting down broom since 2010, when she became involved.</p><p>The organization that was founded in 2006 by Joanne Sales, who noticed a lot of Scotch broom growing near her blueberry farm in Coombs. Since then, this volunteer-run organization has expanded all across Vancouver Island, including in the Comox Valley, Cowichan Valley and Nanaimo.</p><p>\u201cMy husband and I moved out to the Comox Valley in 2009 from Alberta, and we didn\u2019t really know anything about broom,\u201d Agur said.</p><p>She has been cutting broom with the organization since 2010, and is now the area organizer for the Comox Valley\u2019s division of Broombusters. For six days a week, for six weeks of the year when broom is in season, the group of Broombusters goes out to cut it down.</p><p>Like Jarratt, she\u2019s learned how much of a fire risk it is.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s broom that\u2019s growing under a powerline \u2026 if a wildfire gets there, it\u2019ll just take off,\u201d she said.</p><p>Agur said the summer is not the best time to cut broom, because if it is cut and sits and dries out, it is a fire risk.</p><p>\u201cAnd the problem is it\u2019s full of seed pods, so you run the risk of spreading those around,\u201d she said.</p><p>Those who are curious to learn about Comox Valley broom cutting can keep their eyes out for when to join in the spring. She added that there is a video on the organization\u2019s website that explains how to cut broom properly.</p><p>\u201cWe have lots of tools so people could show up and cut broom with us,\u201d she said. \u201cI suggest they bring some work gloves or gardening gloves, and wear dirty shoes and old clothes, because often broom is growing around blackberries and roses.\u201d</p><p>Controlling the fire Jarratt said getting involved with invasive species control and learning more about controlled burning (also known as prescribed burning) are some of the best ways to manage invasive species and fire risk.</p><p>Controlled burning helps reduce the amount of fuel load \u2014 what is available to burn in an area. After years go by, the fuel builds up on the ground as vegetation grows and falls to the forest floor and then is available to burn again, Jarratt explained. He also said some plant species such as Lodgepole pine are dependent on fire, so they won\u2019t germinate unless there is a fire.</p><p>Prescribed burns are often lighter and less hot as well, he said. They\u2019re small enough to support germination but not big enough that it burns the whole ecosystem down.</p><p>On the south Island, Jarratt pointed to biologist James Miskelly who does prescribed burns at Rocky Point, home to a Garry oak ecosystem which has historically relied on controlled burning to keep it healthy.</p><p>In B.C. \u2019s southern interior, known for its dry landscape and frequent wildfires, groups such as the Salish Fire Keepers Society and Ntityix Resources have taken up Indigenous-led controlled burning, something that was suppressed from colonialism after being practiced for millennia.</p><p>\u201cI feel like this is going to be an increasingly important factor as more areas evidently burn on Vancouver Island in the future,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEspecially all these hilly ecosystems that have huge fuel loads that have built up over many, many, many years, but are now also invaded by these highly flammable species like Scotch broom.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NRTHIG-news20250806PRCA0004868424</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NRTHIG2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GF7-BWR3-RSJS-N0PC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1340\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public Health Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level).
