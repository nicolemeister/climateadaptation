And we know it's coming our way. So, if we want to protect an area for the future, now's the time to do it. In 10 years, it will be much more difficult.\" </p><p>His organization, along with Ski Beaver, a volunteer cross-country ski group, are acting as stewards for the preserve of mixed hard and softwood forest that's home to threatened species such as the Eastern wood pee-wee, an olive-brown bird with a plaintive song that hunts insects, and an extensive network of hiking, walking and cross-country ski trails. </p><p>Gagnon said the organizations, which run trails through private lands in the heart of the community, were approached by some of the landowners in 2022, asking if they wanted to buy their properties. Having no money, they turned to the Nature Trust of New Brunswick, which had already held community meetings spreading its message of land conservation. </p><p>With its fundraising prowess, the nonprofit land conservation organization established the preserve in March 2023, and recently added more land from another property owner, the possibility more will soon come onboard. </p><p>Executive director Stephanie Merrill said it was a good example of protecting the ecological integrity of an area while providing excellent public access and recreational opportunities. </p><p>\"When you're passing through Grande-Digue, you see the beautiful sign that we erected about a year ago and it greets you as you're passing through the community, and you realize, 'Wow, this a place I can pull off and pop in and go for a lovely walk or ski in the forest in the middle of a community,\" she said. \"This is a thoroughfare for tourists and visitors to the region, so it's a great spot.\" </p><p>The additional land means the Nature Trust of New Brunswick has reached a new land protection milestone, conserving more than 13,000 acres of pristine wilderness across the province. </p><p>Combined with other new preserves saving rich Appalachian Hardwood Forest, critical wetland habitat, and Bay of Fundy islands, the Nature Trust is quickly closing in on a goal to protect 15,000 acres by 2030, which would represent a doubling of its preserve network since launching the campaign four years ago. </p><p>Along with Grande-Digue, it now has 83 nature preserves scattered across the province, with the goal of combining them with provincially and federally preserved areas, helping to conserve larger, intact habitats that will allow plants and animals to thrive. </p><p>This is a big feat for an organization that started preserving land slowly 37 years ago. Merrill says the acceleration in recent years was in part fueled by Ottawa, which announced at the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in Montreal in December 2022 the \"30 by 30\" campaign, working to preserve 30 per cent of Canada's land and marine areas by 2030. </p><p>The pledge from the federal government included a commitment that it would fund in matching dollars nonprofit land conservation efforts, such as those run by the Nature Trust of New Brunswick. </p><p>Merrill said the other key factor is local communities and volunteers pledging to do their part. In the case of Grande-Digue, local people quickly donated $30,000. </p><p>The nature preserve is in an area that burned from a forest fire in the 1940s, so red maples and tamarack are beginning to take over from the birches and spruce. </p><p>\"It's a lovely canopy to lose yourself in a walk,\" she said. \"The farther in from the road and deeper into the woods, the more you can hear the songbirds and the critters popping around the leaves.\" </p><p>Gagnon said it was a great example of groups collaborating to make something special. Besides the landowners who decided to sell, and the Nature Trust buying the land, he said the municipality has agreed to pay $10,000 to help maintain the trail network. </p><p>Local businesses have pitched in too. UNI has donated $8,000 to build more trails and the Co-op in Shediac is also chipping in a yearly amount of $1,000 to $2,000 to help maintain the network. </p><p>The larger trail system, which extends outside the preserve, already has 14 kilometres of pathways. Within the preserve itself there are about four km of trail, which will soon be expanded. The plans include putting crusher stone on a 650-metre section, to allow people with mobility issues to enjoy the trail. </p><p>\"Everybody's talking about the need to preserve biodiversity and natural areas, but we're always looking to our government to do that,\" said Gagnon, a native of the Montreal area who retired from the military as a lieutenant colonel and then worked for NATO in different parts of the world before retiring and settling down in Grande-Digue with his wife, who's from New Brunswick. </p><p>\"This is an example where volunteers and different private organizations got together and did something about it. For the people of Grande-Digue, Beausoleil and the entire area, this nature preserve is so important.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-9e2d00aa528741aa8b9eac96d70106b0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CMX-5HC1-JBVR-30K9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"895\"/><timeReceived>06:26 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 4, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

There's been no big flare-up or open flames there .... It's stable right now.\"</p><p>Still, Lawlor said the weather forecast for Saturday evening had changed for the worse, with gusts expected to reach 40 kilometres per hour, increasing the risk of spreading flames. But that bad news was offset by Environment Canada's prediction that thunderstorms could move into the area overnight.</p><p>\"If we get those thundershowers, that certainly will aid the firefighters and waterbombers in their task,\" Lawlor said. But thunderstorms can be notoriously fickle when it comes to when and where they unload downpours, he said.</p><p>\"Overcast skies do help,\" Lawlor said, adding that cool temperatures at night were also helping. \"It keeps fire behaviour down.\" </p><p>During the next three days, the Churchill Falls area can expect a mix of sun and clouds, and daytime temperatures ranging between 19 C and 25 C. That means more \"extreme fire behaviour\" is possible, Lawlor said.</p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, the utility that operates the massive Churchill Falls hydroelectric generating station, issued a statement saying the fire was still burning on the south side of the Churchill River, which stands between the fire and the town.</p><p>\"Plant operations remain unaffected at this time and is not at immediate risk,\" the Crown-owned utility said in a statement released early Saturday.</p><p>Eight amphibious waterbombers were attacking the 15-square-kilometre fire, which started on June 13 then grew rapidly a week later, prompting the evacuation order. Four of the aircraft are from the province. On Thursday and Friday, two arrived from Quebec, and another two came from Ontario.</p><p>Town officials said fire suppression efforts have kept the fire from growing.</p><p>\"Despite windy conditions, fire crews were able to take effective action on flare-ups.\"</p><p>On Saturday morning, Premier Andrew Furey issued a brief, upbeat statement on social media. </p><p>\"Thank you once again to all first responders for the unwavering and stellar work battling the wildfire near Churchill Falls, and others in the province,\" Furey wrote. \"Your efforts have been effective.\" </p><p>While the generating station was operating as usual, the utility issued a statement Saturday saying there was concern that smoke from the blaze could affect insulators on the power lines, causing \"trips\" that could shut down the flow of electricity.</p><p> This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 22, 2024.</p><p>\u2014 By Michael MacDonald in Halifax</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-5d0deb16072347d098e8c9fddf39e33d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C9Y-CWJ1-JBVR-3056-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><timeReceived>02:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 22, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Vince Rutter, owner of Rutter Urban Forestry, works with his team in the city pruning and removing trees as well as providing treatments to control insects and improve plant health. \"This year's spruce budworm infestation leaves me with big concerns about tree health that start with losses to individual landscape trees and can lead to widespread tree mortality, which results in economic losses to the forestry sector, but worse, can lead to fuel for forest fires,\" Rutter said. </p><p>In the region, there are many spruce and fir trees and Rutter said he noticed significant feeding damage last year. This year he expects more damage and defoliation, a trend continuing for the next few years at least. \"I'm very concerned that the increased fuel load of dead fir and spruce trees will lead to some very explosive forest fire conditions,\" Rutter said. He pointed out the Kamview Nordic Centre as an example of a forest area that is heavily populated with fir trees, of which he expects 90 per cent mortality over the next few years. \"It's not unreasonable to be very alarmed by this,\" he said. Rutter also noted that this outbreak is not climate-change related and populations of spruce budworm tend to explode every 30 years. He said spruce budworms emerge in the spring, begin mining last year's needles and then move into the buds as they expand. As of May 21, the feeding is only noticeable if one looks closely and this will change in a couple of weeks. Rutter expects to receive many calls from alarmed tree owners as they begin to notice the damage. Currently, the small five-millimetre larvae can be found in the expanding buds. They will continue feeding for the next few weeks, and \"in an outbreak\" will eat all of the new needles. Feeding damage will become obvious in mid-June. Rutter called the caterpillars \"messy and wasteful eaters\" that leave webbing and partially eaten needles behind. \"The caterpillars will finish feeding in June and then pupate to become moths,\" he said. \"These moths will emerge in the summer and lay eggs on spruce and fir twigs where the larvae overwinter.\" Moths during an outbreak are noticeable. If the wind is quiet, their flight and feeding are audible. The caterpillars prefer balsam fir and white spruce, and during an outbreak, they can also be found feeding on black spruce and sometimes tamaracks, he said. \"Younger healthy white spruce can withstand several years of defoliation while older white spruce or spruce experiencing stress may not survive and can die after a few years of the infestation,\" Rutter said. Rutter added that Balsam fir does not tolerate spruce budworm infestations well and mortality is usually high in all age classes. Dead fir trees will be noticeable across the region this summer. Many spruce trees will also either look dead or die. Residential spraying can be effective in controlling larvae, however widespread aerial sprays are required for control of the landscape. Rutter said there are no aerial sprays planned for 2024 in the Northwest region, according to his research with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-b77660b0ee214dff878c07a0801f803b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C3J-7XC1-DY9S-T4C5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><timeReceived>12:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 23, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

An evacuation order has been issued by the Plumas County Sheriff's Office and all US Copper staff and contractors have been demobilized from the project and are safe and accounted for. At this point, there has been no damage to the infrastructure at the Superior drill site. The Company is monitoring the situation closely and will provide timely updates on any material developments to the situation. To date, 7 drill holes have been completed, which will provide considerable data relative to the objectives of the drill program. When conditions permit, the Company will review the options for further drilling at that time.</p><p>Further information on the fire can be found online using \"Dixie Fire update\" as a search item.</p><p>About US Copper Corp</p><p>US Copper controls approximately 13 square miles of patented and unpatented federal mining claims in the Light's CreekCopper District in Plumas County, NECalifornia; essentially, the entire District. The District contains substantial copper (silver) sulfide and copper oxide resources in three deposits - Moonlight, Superior and Engels, as well as several partially tested and untested exploration targets.</p><p>The Superior and Engels Mines operated from about 1915-1930 producing over 161 million pounds of copper from over 4 million tons of rock containing 2.2% copper with silver and gold credits.</p><p>The Moonlight Deposit was discovered and drilled by Placer Amex during the 1960's.

It may save a few dollars now but it will cause additional work in the future, at greater expense. It is suggested those opposed to the project get with the agenda, which is building this city so it is ready for the future.</p><p>A city with 200 vehicles needs a 10-bay garage. You don\u2019t want fire trucks and snowplows waiting to be repaired due to a lack of bays. At the rate Nanaimo is growing, it is going to have to build for the future. If Nanaimo built the garage with fewer bays, in a few years it would be building an addition, if there was room. Building it now will be less expensive. At the rate new subdivisions are being built along with apartment buildings, Nanaimo will require its facilities to keep up. Nanaimo is up to the challenge. However, the support services need to be there. We need to keep in mind climate change will most likely provide new challenges. We don\u2019t want a forest fire around the city, and having two fire trucks waiting for repairs because the garage at the works yard isn\u2019t big enough.</p><p>Having lived in Greater Vancouver from 1951 until 2000, there was immense growth in all the cities in the area. It\u2019s a good thing someone set aside land for work yards. Let\u2019s hope Nanaimo does the same. Buying land today and into the future is going to be a very expensive endeavour.</p><p>E.A.

(AP) \u2014 A high school athlete who along with 15 other young people took Montana to court over climate change testified Tuesday that increased smoke from forest fires makes it difficult for him to compete and that a doctor pre-scribed an inhaler to help his breath-ing problems. Mica Kantor, now 15, said he has been worried about climate change since as a 4-year-old he dictated a letter to Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., because he was too young to write it himself. He said it\u2019s increasingly difficult to run or go on hikes with his family, and that the warmer conditions have shortened snowboarding seasons.</p><p>Mica testified on day two of a firstof-its-kind trial in which the 16 young Montana residents are arguing the state is violating their constitutional rights by failing to keep the environment clean. They\u2019re asking a judge to declare unconstitutional a state law that prevents agencies from considering the effect of greenhouse gasses when they issue permits for fossil fuel development.</p><p>State officials have sought to downplay Montana\u2019s contributions to global warming as the trial is being closely watched for possible legal precedents.</p><p>Attorneys for the plaintiffs showed the court photos of Mica participating in protests against climate change at school, the local courthouse and the state\u2019s largest public utility, \u201cto get people to think about climate change, which is the first step to acting.\u201d</p><p>He said worrying about climate change can make it hard for him to fall asleep at night and he hopes the state will move in a direction that gives him hope for the future.</p><p>He shared a poem about being quarantined in the basement of his house when the rest of his family had COVID-19 and it was too smoky to play outside. In his writing, he wondered why nobody was listening and whether they cared.</p><p>The state declined to cross examine Mica, and did not ask questions of the three young plaintiffs who testified Monday.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, Cathy Whitlock, a retired professor from Montana State University, testified about the impact of climate change.</p><p>Whitlock said if fossil fuel burning continues at its current pace, the number of days each with temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) will increase along with the number of \u201cfire weather days,\u201d where hot, dry, windy days make it easier for fires to start.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230614RDA0003648853</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68FY-WS31-JD2C-J2KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"390\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

It was provided by Fleming College. This copy was reviewed and edited by the Metroland editorial team.</p><p><br/><br/> Two new and unique forestry programs at Fleming College are preparing students for rewarding careers in a growing industry.<br/><br/> A leading educator in the forestry sector, more than five decades of industry leaders have tapped into Fleming's forestry graduates for new hiring opportunities.<br/><br/>Fleming's reputation for producing competent and skilled graduates is supported by the college's \"boots-on-the-ground\" approach to its forestry programs, which ensures that graduates are well-prepared to succeed in rewarding careers.<br/><br/> The Frost Campus in Lindsay now offers the new forestry equipment operator certificate. The college says it is the only one of its kind in Ontario.<br/><br/> The 15-week course provides students with introductory training in heavy forestry equipment operation, forestry principles and proper safety techniques. <br/><br/> Hands-on learning opportunities, as well as a focus on preventive maintenance, minor repairs, forest fire preparedness, forestry operations and harvest systems, is also part of the course.<br/><br/> Applied learning is a big part of Fleming's forestry techniques program, as well. This two-semester course teaches students the skills they need to conduct field work and forest management operations in the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence and Boreal Forest regions. Students graduate ready to move directly into the workforce.<br/><br/> As a compliment to these programs, Fleming has also reworked the forestry technician-adaptive practices program.<br/><br/> Now exceeding provincial standards, the new curriculum teaches traditional forestry skills and studies the technical functions of creating, managing, conserving and restoring sustainable forests in public and private operations.<br/><br/> There is also a focus on environmental, social and economic changes within the forestry industry. A special bonus is the paid co-op, providing students with networking opportunities as they meet and work alongside professionals within the forestry industry.<br/><br/> For more information, visit flemingcollege.ca. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2024031870956308</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BK8-95T1-JDV5-F2GC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"359\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 18, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

(TSXV: SGU) (OTCQB: SGGTF) (FSE: 3S30) (\"Signature\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide an update on its 2024 drill program and provide assay results for the first three diamond drill holes. Drilling so far has been highlighted by a larger halo of near surface mineralization that had previously not been tested for as indicated by LM 24-02 which returned 1.84 grams per tonne gold (\"g/t Au\") over 12 metres (\"m\") and LM 24-03 which returned 1.23 g/t Au over 28 m. The Company has completed 12 of the planned 14 holes and anticipates completing the remainder in early November. With the 2024 drilling program nearing its completion the Company remains on track to deliver its initial NI 43-101 resource in early Spring 2025. The resource estimate is being undertaken by the independent geologic consulting firm of Watts, Griffis and McQuat Limited (WGM).</p><p>As previously announced, the Company's 2024 drill program consists of 14 DDH's for a total of approximately 4,650 metres of drilling. The drilling program was carefully designed to improve our knowledge of the Lingman Lake gold deposit, fill identified data gaps and test new targets identified in our updated geologic model completed earlier this year. The drill program includes continuous core assaying for the entire length of each hole, thereby providing total lithological gold distribution, giving us a much more complete data package about the mineralization contained in and outside the mineralized zones. All new drilling information and assays will be incorporated into the geological modelling to expand and build the Lingman Lake deposit. We look forward to these results informing the resource modelling exercise currently underway.</p><p>We are making very good progress on our 2024 work programs. It is exciting to see the new data coming in to continue building our knowledge of the Lingman Lake Project. With drilling nearly finished and the completion of the logging and assaying we remain well on track to deliver our goal of tabling our maiden NI 43-101 resource in the Spring of 2025. This will be a significant step in demonstrating the potential of the Lingman Lake gold deposit. The merging of the zones and the associated encouraging assays suggest a larger envelope of mineralization around the North Zone than what was previously tested, as historical work was mainly focused on high grade sections of the deposit. We look forward to the implications of this new understanding once fully complied in the spring.\"</p><p>- J. Dan Denbow, CFA - President, CEO and Director</p><p>The largest concentration of historical drilling has been conducted east of a diabase dyke and has identified four zones of mineralization beginning with the 11650 Zone on the southern edge moving north to the South Zone, Central Zone and North Zone. The North and South Zones have been the most consistent with respect to mineralization running proximal to the Quartz-Feldspar- Porphyry (QFP) intrusion contact. It is still undetermined if the 11650 Zone is an independent zone or a splay of the South Zone as it begins to converge into the South Zone east from the diabase dyke.</p><p>Figure 1 is the surface view of the 2024 drill program east of the diabase dike (yellow drill traces) relative to the historical drilling beginning in 1987 up to 2021.

Based on the observations from the drill core and the assay results, the gold zones are highlighted on the drill traces in colored rectangles including the newly observed Leopard Zone as well as grade disks representing the assayed results.</p><p>Figure 1. Drilling East of Diabase Dike</p><p>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8296/228579_fc6f4d1284c8a991_001full.jpg\">https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8296/228579_fc6f4d1284c8a991_001full.jpg</url></p><p>As a result of the Spring mapping program and on-going GIS data and drill compilation, the QFP has been interpreted to be an intrusion that bifurcates going from east to west forming a north and south arm. The intervening area between the two arms displays a more fragmented dyke array resulting in a more complex distribution of gold relative to the Central Zone.</p><p>As the QFP narrows going eastward, the North, South and Central zones converge in the vicinity of DDH LM24-03. This convergence is important in that, as the zones merge, they form a wider mineralized area. This is reflected in DDH LM24-03 where the hole intersected the three zones from 46.0 metres to 111.0 metres with only three metres between the South and Central Zone and the Central and North Zone. We will gain more insight into this trend as we get results from the additional five holes that have been completed east of the diabase dyke where there has been lower drill density to date. The final six holes of the program are on the west side of the diabase dyke. Two are testing the possible extension of the South Zone and the other four in the area of Shoe Lake where there is also lower density of drilling. These are targeting the west extension of the West Zone.</p><p>LM 24-01 and LM 24-02</p><p>Historically, drill holes have been collared south of and drilled north to crosscut the strike of the east-west zones nearly perpendicular. The first two holes of the 2024 program, LM 24-01 and LM 24-02, were designed with an oblique orientation drilling from the southwest to the northeast through the area with the highest drilling density, and near the original 1940s underground workings, as recommended by WGM.</p><p>LM24-01 is the longest hole of our drilling program with a total length of 460 metres at a dip of -50 degrees and an azimuth of 035 degrees. The hole intersected all four zones. In addition, it was designed to test for mineralization north of a unit of glomeroporphyry (leopard rock - LR). In the past, the LR was used as the footwall to the North Zone and drilling was terminated within a few metres into it. The North Zone is in the mafic volcanics that are sandwiched between the northern edge of the QFP and the LR package, which appears to be coincident with higher grade mineralization. The length of LM 24-01 was also designed to test for mineralization north and well into the LR and intersected a narrow quartz vein-silicified shear with gold mineralization, as can be seen in Table 1: Assay Results.</p><p>LM 24-02 was drilled to a total length of 347 metres at a dip of -45 degrees and an azimuth of 035 degrees. The hole intersected mineralization in the Central and North Zones, as can be seen in Table 1. It was not expected to cross the South Zone as it was collared north of the South Zone.</p><p>LM 24-03</p><p>The third DDH of the program, LM 24-03, was focused on confirmation of past drilling, using hole 88-64 as a twin hole in order provide higher confidence to the 1980s drill results for the resource model. Due to the forest fire in 2021, which swept through the outer margins of the camp, core racks housing the historical and 2018 drilling were destroyed. Therefore, this hole was critical to establish a relationship between the 1988 results and current results. The hole was drilled to a total length of 152 metres and sampled for its entire length with one metre sample lengths, while 88-64 was originally selectively sampled. A complete comparison of the results of the twinning of this hole is pending, and although some of the assay results from 88-64 are higher, in general, grades and lithology mimic each other.</p><p>There are several completed holes with results pending that will be providing additional data on the theory of convergence of the main zones to the east.</p><p>Table 1: Assay Results</p><p>LINGMAN LAKE PROJECTObserved ZoneFrom mTo mWidthAu result DRILL HOLE LM24-0111650ZONE AVG40433mAVG 0.90 g/t Includes4041Grading 2.14 g/tSOUTHZONE AVG1061093mAVG 2.66 g/t Includes106107Grading 5.71 g/t CENTRAL ZONE AVG2342417 mAVG 1.35 g/tIncludes235236Grading 2.77 g/t237238Grading 4.01 g/tNORTH ZONE AVG3203266 mAVG 3.06 g/t Includes321322Grading 7.23 g/t 322323Grading 9.90 g/tLEOPARD ZONE AVG4214232 mAVG 2.68 g/tIncludes422423Grading 4.73 gptDRILL HOLE LM24-02CENTRAL ZONEZONE AVG132312 mAVG 1.84g/t Includes1415Grading 3.54 g/t1516Grading 2.29 g/t2122Grading 5.23 g/t2223Grading 6.77 g/tNORTHZONE AVG1371437 mAVG 0.24 g/t LEOPARDZONE AVG2002044 mAVG 0.30 g/tDRILL HOLE LM24-03SOUTHZONE AVG48524 mAVG 0.27 g/tCENTRALZONE AVG587921 mAVG 0.49 g/tIncludes6869Grading 1.50 g/t7172Grading 1.40 g/t7374Grading 1.48 g/t7778Grading 2.10 g/tNORTHZONE AVG8311128 mAVG 1.23 g/tIncludes8788Grading 1.02 g/t8889Grading 1.68 g/t8990Grading 1.40 g/t9293Grading 4.80 g/t9394Grading 4.47 g/t9495Grading 5.99 g/t99100Grading 1.24 g/t104105Grading 1.10 g/t105106Grading 2.12 g/t108109Grading 3.26 g/t109110Grading 2.04 g/t</p><p>Notes to Table:</p><p>Reported widths are drill intercepts (core lengths).</p><p>Computer modelling of the zones for true widths is pending.</p><p>LM24-01 was drilled at azimuth 035 degrees, dip -50 degrees.</p><p>LM24-02 was drilled at azimuth 035 degrees, dip -45 degrees.</p><p>LM24-03 was drilled at azimuth 360 degrees, dip -45 degrees</p><p>NORTH ZONE strikes at 093 degrees.</p><p>CENTRAL ZONE strikes at 087 degrees.</p><p>SOUTH ZONE strikes at 082 degrees</p><p>All zones dip steeply south 70-80 degrees.</p><p>Option Grant</p><p>The Board of Directors has granted a combined total of 2,750,000 incentive stock options to the Board, Management and Advisors of the Company.

It was provided by Fleming College. This copy was reviewed and edited by the Metroland editorial team.</p><p><br/><br/> Two new and unique forestry programs at Fleming College are preparing students for rewarding careers in a growing industry.<br/><br/> A leading educator in the forestry sector, more than five decades of industry leaders have tapped into Fleming's forestry graduates for new hiring opportunities.<br/><br/>Fleming's reputation for producing competent and skilled graduates is supported by the college's \"boots-on-the-ground\" approach to its forestry programs, which ensures that graduates are well-prepared to succeed in rewarding careers.<br/><br/> The Frost Campus in Lindsay is honoured to now offer the new forestry equipment operator certificate. The college says it is the only one of its kind in Ontario.<br/><br/> The 15-week course provides students with introductory training in heavy forestry equipment operation, forestry principles and proper safety techniques. Hands-on learning opportunities, as well as a focus on preventive maintenance, minor repairs, forest fire preparedness, forestry operations and harvest systems, is also part of the course.<br/><br/> Applied learning is also a big part of Fleming's forestry techniques program. This two-semester course teaches students the skills they need to conduct field work and forest management operations in the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence and Boreal Forest regions. Students graduate ready to move directly into the workforce.<br/><br/> As a compliment to these programs, Fleming has also reworked the forestry technician-adaptive practices program.<br/><br/> Now exceeding provincial standards, the new curriculum teaches traditional forestry skills and studies the technical functions of creating, managing, conserving and restoring sustainable forests in public and private operations.<br/><br/> There is also a focus on environmental, social and economic changes within the forestry industry. A special bonus is the paid co-op, providing students with networking opportunities as they meet and work alongside professionals within the forestry industry.<br/><br/> For more details on these programs and others, visit flemingcollege.ca. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2024031670940841</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BK2-9Y81-F197-5047-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"365\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The Lake Cavan fire was by far the biggest set by Par\u00e9, burning nearly 873 hectares of forest, she said. It was also one of the first in a series of five blazes Par\u00e9 ignited between May 31 and June 1 \u2014 the spree started three days after the Quebec government banned open fires in or around forests due to dry weather conditions.</p><p>Five fires in a short period of time in the same area raised suspicion, Charron said. Provincial police and first responders \"observed that some of the fires had no possible natural cause,\" she said, adding that evidence was found that some of the fires had been criminally set.</p><p>Charron said police first spoke to Par\u00e9 on June 2. He had been seen in the area around where a fire had started and was considered a witness. While he denied causing the fires, she said Par\u00e9 \"demonstrated a certain interest in fires\" during the interview, which led police to suspect him. </p><p>In June, she said, police began watching Par\u00e9's Facebook page, where he regularly posted about Quebec's record-breaking forest fire season. Among those posts, which remain on his public Facebook page, were claims the fires had been deliberately set by the government to trick people into believing in climate change.</p><p>Par\u00e9's ideology and behaviour \u2014 including those Facebook posts \u2014 matched a profile of the suspect developed by provincial police specialists, she said.</p><p>Charron said police obtained a warrant to install a tracking device on Par\u00e9's vehicle. On Sept. 1 and Sept. 5, she said, that tracking device showed he was at locations where other fires were started.</p><p>Par\u00e9 was arrested on Sept. 7, she said, and when questioned this time, he admitted to starting nine of the fires. </p><p>\"At this point, the accused admitted he was the one who started the fires and, as his main motivation, claimed he was doing tests to find out whether the forest was really dry or not,\" Charron said.</p><p>Par\u00e9, who has been detained since his arrest, said little during the hearing, only responding \"yes\" to a series of questions from the judge.</p><p>A pre-sentencing report has been ordered that will consider both Par\u00e9's mental state and the risk he poses to public safety. It will be submitted by April 22.</p><p>Two other charges \u2014 breaking and entering and causing a public nuisance \u2014 have been conditionally suspended, Charron said. </p><p>More than 700 forest fires burned over 4.5 million hectares of Quebec forest over the summer, according to the province's forest fire service, which said 99.9 per cent of the fires were sparked by lightning. </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 15, 2024.</p><p>\u2014 By Jacob Serebrin in Montreal. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-ca531995d2e54d0dacfe243ca6c0a64f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B42-6081-DY9S-T0TM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"599\"/><timeReceived>05:54 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 15, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We\u2019re seeing a lot of people suffering because of the lack of treatment beds. Sadly, it\u2019s not something that should have been politicized. We need the full spectrum of care and treatment, and not just what we\u2019re seeing right now: knee-jerk, ideological responses. The BC NDP had four years as a majority government, and in that time, Comox Valley did not get any new publicly-funded treatment beds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're seeing the BC Conservatives now call supervised consumption sites drug dens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And they\u2019re promising to close everyone of them down. It just means we're going to see more open drug use on our streets and in our neighbourhoods. So, we obviously need a huge overhaul of the system. I think it's one of the biggest failures of the BC NDP government for our valley.</p><p>We need to reorient the resources to support prevention, especially in schools with young people. We need better access to drug and mental health treatment in B.C. because if we're not doing that it's costing us as taxpayers way more.</p><p>Right now you're seeing the average weight time to see a mental health practitioner in B.C. in months, not hours or days as it should be.</p><p>If we really want to address the physical and mental health challenges of Comox Valley residents, we just need to do better.</p><p>In summary, we need to invest more in addiction treatment beds here in the valley. Just that's what it boils down to.</p><p>Every year, temperature records are broken throughout the province and the forest fire season appears to be getting worse and longer. What does your party see as the best way for carbon reduction, and what goals will you aim to strive in helping the province and Island hit those goals?</p><p>This is an issue that I think the Green Party is extremely well-grounded in. As a farmer myself I live and breathe this day to day. We've all seen with the glacier has looked like in these last couple of days. It's almost gone. That is drinking water. That is also water for farming and irrigation, its water for salmon.</p><p>Last year, we spent a billion dollars trying to fight wildfires in B.C. We have over 300 million hectares that were burned, and yet with all of this, what is the NDP doing?</p><p>They are subsidizing Big Oil and Gas to the tune of 1.3 billion dollars every year.</p><p>And then we have the Conservative Party with John Rustad saying that climate change isn't even a real crisis.</p><p>So as an MLA, it would be my role to balance the power in a minority government and fight to ensure that B.C. actually literally survived this climate crisis.</p><p>We know that young people are so wanting to see action happening and they want to be part of that. I'm looking at green jobs for future for our youth here in the Comox Valley. Things like the installation of solar panels, retrofits, installing heat pumps, firefighting, providing fire breaks, installing community gardens, all of the things that we could be doing to really support the resiliency of our own community.</p><p>I believe that any government that doesn't address the climate crisis is dooming all of British Columbians, all of us, in the future. We know that all economists agree that the carbon tax is the most effective tool at reducing pollution and CO2 levels.</p><p>So the B.C. greens are focused on reforming, and we're not eliminating the carbon pricing. What we are wanting to see is that polluters pay a higher price, and the funds that we collect from the carbon tax are brought back into people's pocketbooks to support the affordability crisis that we currently see. So the Greens are noticing or all loopholes that the B.C. NDP have provided to the oil and gas sector so that they're not paying their fair share. We're going to close those loopholes and bring a large chunk of that money back into people's pocketbooks, And to municipalities that are also feeling the brunt of climate change.</p><p>While there has been an increase in rental housing construction in the Comox Valley, there continues to be a lack of affordable housing. What detailed actions will your party take to increase affordable housing stock here?</p><p>It\u2019s really unfortunate to see that we have such an educated workforce here in the valley who are struggling to find affordable housing.</p><p>Housing and Healthcare are two of the biggest challenges in our economy. So, in short the solution is non-market housing. So BC NDP has spent billions on housing in the last couple of years, but most of it has gone into market housing that makes a few developers wealthy, but doesn\u2019t actually provide affordable housing here for for locals. The only thing that will significantly move the needle on housing affordability is massive investment in non-market housing, including nonprofit housing and co-op housing.</p><p>So we are the only party that are talking about this type of level of investment. Our leader announced a bold plan, 1.5 billion dollar investment into creating 26,000 non-market House housing units.</p><p>On the other hand, we've had the Conservatives who just announced that Rustad rebate to put 3.5 billion dollars of our finances in the hole and not do anything to substantially increase the amount of housing that we have that is affordable here in the valley. So I just want to make sure your readers understand that 3,000 a month in tax breaks. It's a tax credit, so at best, way into 2029, about five years from now, people will possibly save $100 a month so I don't see that as action.</p><p>We have our own BC Conservative candidate. Who is continually going on about non-market housing and yet if you look at the actual Conservative platform, it says no such thing. So I'm wondering where he's getting his talking points from.</p><p>I'm thinking maybe he should be joining the BC Greens if he's like thinking that that's actually a thing</p><p>The area around the Connect Centre in Courtenay continues to face issues and there have been reported increases of crime in the surrounding neighbourhood. The proposed Braidwood Complex aims to address these issues, but has faced pushback from some neighbours. Do you agree with the Braidwood Complex and its location, and how will you aim to make it work effectively? If not, how will you address these issues in its absence?</p><p>I think we all agree that the last four years of warehousing people at the Connect Centre on Cliffe avenue is just not a dignified way of housing anyone. It\u2019s not working for our community, it\u2019s not working for the businesses in downtown, and it\u2019s certainly not working for those who are unhoused. Who, honestly, wants to live in a warehouse with 100 other people? I\u2019ve spoken to the unhoused community themselves, I\u2019ve spoken to the coalition to end homelessness, not once did anyone advocate for a giant shelter.</p><p>A more appropriate lower cost model is the tiny home village model that Duncan has successfully piloted that has helped to move hundreds of people off of the streets in that community.</p><p>Crime has increased in the Comox Valley in recent years, especially according to RCMP statistics. We have a problem. It's clear.</p><p>The most effective way of dealing with and combating crime is prevention. So we need to move people off the streets. We need to put get them access to drug treatment, mental health treatment, and education.</p><p>I do want to point out to readers, however, the cost of hiring more police is extremely high. It's about 300,000 dollars per officer per year, plus the support and infrastructure and equipment. So,\u00a0\u00a0 in recent years we have not been able to recruit enough officers in Canada. So I don't even know if that is an option that we should be looking at, more realistically we need to enact what the Greens saw and the special committee on reform of the police act. There are 11 recommendations from that report that was released in 2022. It included a continuum of response for mental health, substance use and other complex social issues and a focus on prevention and community-led response integrating mental health with 911 calls. And that's something that the BC greens have just recently, released in their full costed of platform: adding mental health onto a 911 call.</p><p>I think it\u2019s a really easy solution to what we're seeing here in the community, but to sum it up.</p><p>We're looking at tiny home Village model instead of the current shelter model that B.C. housing is putting forward.</p><p>I door knocked in the Braidwood community and I put this idea forward to the people that I've spoken to and not one of them said \u2018no, that's not a good idea.\u2019 They were absolutely supportive of a model like this at the property that BC housing purchased as a more appropriate way of providing shelter to the unhoused in their community.</p><p>We don't have a community of NIMBYs who say no, we don't need to shelter the unhoused. We need to do it appropriately for our community.</p><p>School District 71 has policies and resources that create a supportive and inclusive environment for students. Will your government do anything to change or limit SD71\u2019s ability to use these policies and resources?</p><p>In short, not at all. We have to be clear SOGI specific curriculum is anti-bullying policy and anti-bullying education. It improves the school climate for both LGBTQ and heterosexual students. So it's all about reducing discrimination preventing suicidal ideation and really lowering suicide attempts in the student body. It's something that the BC Greens absolutely support. We need to defend our kids from explicit bigotry of the BC\u00a0 Conservatives who want to ban SOGI policies and who is whose leader has compared SOGI to residential schools. It's just the most ridiculous thing. I've heard John Rustad say that being gay is a lifestyle choice. Unequivocally, we do not support what the BC\u00a0 Conservatives have said. I stand with our kids. The BC Greens stand with our kids.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Comox Valley Record</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVRECO-news20241004PCV4651116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVRECO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D40-84N1-JD2C-J3RC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438259</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1660\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Lauffer recently sent an open letter to Smith, who also represents her as the MPP for Parry Sound-Muskoka, criticizing his comments in early June that forest fires are nothing new and there is nothing unusual about the current forest fire season.</p><p><br/><br/> In her letter, Lauffer says there are \"more forest fires than ever, they are stronger, longer, out of control and much more serious\" and she wanted Smith to acknowledge, \"the fires we are experiencing right now are so severe because of the climate change crisis.\"<br/><br/> Smith immediately said \"climate change is real and is happening.\" But he also said even though the number of forest fires and the hectares they have burned are \"slightly above average\" this year, he added this past spring has not been \"an unprecedented year\" for forest fires in Ontario.<br/><br/> Smith says the impact climate change has on forest fires has to be examined over the long term and not the short term because \"there is a huge amount of variability in forest fires in Ontario from one year to the next.\"<br/><br/> As an example, Smith said last year was a light forest fire season with the number well below the 10-year average. Smith says Ontario experienced a dry spring this year with only a light amount of precipitation and that \"led to the ability for more forest fires to start primarily through lightning strikes and some human caused.\"<br/><br/> During the interview with the Nugget, Smith again emphasized the need to look at the impact of climate change on forest fires over a longer span.<br/><br/> He said we should \"not take data from (only) one point in time\" and conclude there is a \"direct causal relationship\" between this year's forest fires and climate change, and then further add this is an unprecedented season, which he again said it is not.<br/><br/> Although Smith acknowledges climate change is real, \"climate change itself is not going to start a forest fire,\" he said.<br/><br/> He says forest fires are caused naturally by a high number of lightning strikes and by people who are careless with a campfire or cigarette butt or even a spark coming off an all-terrain vehicle's brake pad being driven in the woods.<br/><br/> \"Climate change may over the long term have some impacts on the number or severity of forest fires, but I leave that to the scientists to determine over the long term with lots of data on how that plays out,\" he said.<br/><br/> Smith said there are always going to be thunderstorms that contain lightning and given that much of Ontario has boreal forests, when \"lightning strikes at the wrong place, we're going to have a fire. <br/><br/> \"We're never going to eliminate forest fires in Ontario,\" the minister said. \"They are an annual occurrence and part of nature.\"<br/><br/> Smith encourages the public to visit the MNRF website to learn more about forest fires and read how the public can become \"fire smart\" to help mitigate the number of forest fires.<br/><br/> Smith also took a shot at other groups and people who claim the MNRF has cut its forest firefighting budget. He finds this \"extremely aggravating\" and not accurate. Smith said while there is a set budget, the MNRF will spend whatever it takes in any season to fight forest fires.<br/><br/> He said when a heavy firefighting season is followed by a light season and not as much money gets spent, some purposely distort the data and say the ministry spent less money and therefore cut the budget.<br/><br/> \"This is just not true and I think it's an intentional distortion,\" he said. \"The reality is if we need to spend $100 million, $200 million or $250 million on a season fighting forest fires, we're going to spend that much money.\"<br/><br/> When speaking to the Nugget, Lauffer agreed with the MNRF minister that there are both light and heavy forest fire seasons. But she added over time, the number of light forest fire seasons is shrinking. Lauffer said the data indicates forest fires are starting earlier almost every year.<br/><br/> \"They burn longer, are often out of control for weeks and they come more frequently,\" she said. \"We have higher temperatures, drier air, more hot wind and these are all signs of the climate crisis.\"<br/><br/> Lauffer said while climate change itself is not the cause for forest fires, \"it creates the circumstances for the wildfires to be more furious.\"<br/><br/> On the point that people should not draw conclusions by looking at forest fire seasons as annual standalone events, Lauffer agreed with Smith, but added data shows for the most part each year forest fires are worsening.<br/><br/> \"So the overall curve is rising,\" Lauffer said.<br/><br/> She also said the global temperature has risen about 1.5 C and while \"that sounds ridiculously low, that has huge impacts.\"<br/><br/> Lauffer said she's relieved for those years when there are fewer forest fires thanks to positive weather patterns, but repeated the claim the forest fire curve is rising. She said reversing this trend involves things like ending our reliance on fossil fuels, and spending research and development money on alternative energy sources like wind and solar power.<br/><br/> Lauffer said people now employed in the oil and gas sector can be retrained and \"no one needs to be left behind.\" She added if Smith agrees climate change is real, then he should act on it now.<br/><br/> Smith said the Ontario government has been taking action on climate change. He said earlier this year the Ford government passed legislation that allows for the capture of industrial carbon dioxide emissions, then compressing them into a liquid and finally burying them deep underground, which prevents them from being released into the atmosphere.<br/><br/> As of July 24, the MNRF website indicates the number of Ontario forest fires this year is above the 10-year average. While the 10-year average to date is 423 forest fires, Ontario has seen 459 forest fires so far this season compared to 150 forest fires during 2022 for the same period.<br/><br/> Also since 2000, Ontario has had an average of 948 forest fires a year that burned about 60,390 hectares a year. The year with the most forest fires was 2006, when 2,300 forest fires were recorded, while the slowest season was 2022 with 268 forest fires. During 2021 there were 1,197 forest fires across Ontario, which burned a record number of hectares at 793,325, since 2000.<br/><br/> Rocco Frangione is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter.

The comments come a day after U.S. president Joe Biden put forward a proposed peace deal between Israel and Hamas that seeks to enact a three-phase wind-down of the war. Israel's government says putting a permanent ceasefire in place before the conditions are fulfilled is a \"non-starter.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1 - The African National Congress party loses its parliamentary majority in a historic election result. It puts South Africa on a new political path for the first time since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule 30 years ago. With 99 per cent of votes counted, the African National Congress party receives just over 40 per cent.</p><p>2 - Defence Minister Bill Blair says he expressed Canada's concerns about Beijing's foreign interference when he met with his Chinese counterpart. It's the first face-to-face meeting of Canadian and Chinese defence ministers in 11 years. Blair met with Admiral Dong Jun on Friday while attending an international security conference in Singapore. Blair says he also brought up China's financial and economic support for Russia as well as its recent military exercises in Taiwan.</p><p>2 - The Edmonton Oilers are going to the Stanley Cup final for the first time in nearly two decades. The Oilers cap an improbable run to the Stanley Cup Final Sunday night by beating the Dallas Stars 2-1. Edmonton wins the Western Conference in six games and will now play for the Cup for the first time since 2006. They'll head to Florida for Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final in a series set to open on Saturday night.</p><p>3 - Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum will become the first woman president in the country's 200-year history. The climate scientist and former Mexico City mayor has won Mexico's presidential election, a turning point in a mostly conservative country that for more than two centuries has been exclusively ruled by men. Mexican women won the right to vote in 1953.</p><p>3 - The University of Manitoba publicly apologizes for harm it caused to First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis communities more than a century after it began accepting and storing Indigenous remains. The school says it inappropriately accepted and stored ancestral remains as well as burial belongings and cultural artifacts without consent from Indigenous communities. University president Michael Benarroch says the school's founding members desecrated graves and mishandled remains starting in the 1890s. The university started working to repatriate remains four years ago.\u00a0</p><p>3 - The pharmacare bill is headed to the Senate after passing in the House of Commons. The Liberals' bill sets the stage for a future full-fledged universal pharmacare program and would see the federal government offer first-payer coverage of some contraceptive and diabetes medications.</p><p>4 - Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims victory for his coalition alliance and promises India will see a new chapter of big decisions in his third term in office. Despite a lacklustre performance from his party, instead of the landslide he expected, Modi tells a crowd at party headquarters he will push forward with his agenda.\u00a0</p><p>5 - A British museum is returning a ceremonial headdress to a First Nation in Alberta. The Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter, England, is to return the Buffalo Woman's headdress to representatives of the Siksika Blackfoot First Nation. The handover will take place in a ceremony at the museum today. It received the headdress in 1920 from Edgar Dewdney, a former governor of the Northwest Territories from which Alberta and Saskatchewan were carved.\u00a0</p><p>5 - The Bank of Canada cut its key interest rate a quarter point to 4.75 per cent. The first rate cut in more than four years comes as good news for would-be first time homebuyers and people with variable rate mortgages. Governor Tiff Macklem says the central bank has more confidence inflation is moving closer to its two per cent target and that if inflation continues to slow, it is reasonable to expect further rate cuts. But he says those decisions will be taken one meeting at a time.</p><p>5 - \"Self-Portrait in the Zone of Silence,'' written in Spanish by Homero Aridjis and translated into English by Canadian writer George McWhirter, wins the Griffin Poetry Prize. The $130,000 award was announced at a ceremony in Toronto, though Aridjis was not able to attend after undergoing medical treatments. Jurors praised the use of mythical imagery to examine emotional realities and the presentation of \"a rounded human being engaged with total experience.''\u00a0</p><p>6 - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau uses his speech to veterans at Juno Beach on the 80th anniversary of D-Day to talk about democracy still being still under threat. Thirteen Canadian veterans, including one who is 104 years old, took part in the ceremony in Courseulles-sur-Mer, France. Trudeau said the world owes it to the veterans who sacrificed so much for our collective freedom to continue standing up for democracy every day. After observing a moment of silence, Trudeau, the French prime minister and Prince William walked to a sand dune and laid commemorative wreaths.\u00a0</p><p>6 - The world's largest and most powerful rocket blasts off from Texas, soaring above the Gulf of Mexico and heading east. The fourth flight of SpaceX\u2019s mega Starship rocket was successful and returned to Earth in one piece. NASA and Elon Musk are counting on Starship to get humans to the moon and Mars. Last year\u2019s two test flights ended in explosions shortly after takeoff.\u00a0</p><p>6 - Nova Scotia announces it is joining Ontario, Quebec and B.C. in restricting cellphone use in schools, starting this fall. Public school students will have to turn off their phones and other personal electronic devices during classroom hours and store them out of sight. New Brunswick is also imposing restrictions in September.\u00a0</p><p>6 - Ontario Premier Doug Ford is shakes things up with a cabinet shuffle as the provincial legislature heads into its summer break. Education Minister Stephen Lecce and Energy Minister Todd Smith are swapping portfolios. Lecce had been education minister since 2019 while Smith had the energy portfolio for the past three years. Several new people have been promoted into cabinet, with new associate minister positions being created and some other ministries, such as Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, being split into two.\u00a0</p><p>6 - Residents in Calgary are directed to avoid taking showers or baths, while some are told to boil their water as the city grapples with a major water main break. The 1.6 million people living in the city had an emergency notice issued due to a water main break in the city's northwest, where water flooded streets and snarled traffic. Director of water services Nancy MacKay says while water main breaks are common in the city, the size of this one is unprecedented. City officials said they couldn't predict how long the water main repair would take or how long water restrictions might last.\u00a0</p><p>7 - Canadian businessman and billionaire Frank Stronach is arrested and charged in connection with a sexual-assault investigation. Police west of Toronto say the 91-year-old founder and former chief executive of auto parts manufacturing giant Magna International faces five charges, including rape, indecent assault on a female, forcible confinement and sexual assault. The alleged incidents took place between the 1980s and 2023. Stronach is released on conditions and is set to appear in court July 8. He denies the charges.\u00a0</p><p>7 - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is formally elected leader of the National Democratic Alliance coalition, which won the most seats in the national election. The 73-year-old will now form a coalition government and be sworn in as prime minister for a rare third term. This is the first time under Modi's leadership that the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has needed support from its regional allies to form a government.</p><p>8 - Israel rescues four hostages who were kidnapped in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. It marks the largest hostage recovery operation since the latest war with Hamas began in Gaza. The Israeli army says it rescued three people in their 20s and a 40-year-old in a complex special daytime operation in Nuseirat. Israel says more than 130 hostages remain -- with about a quarter of those believed to be dead. Gaza's Health Ministry says 274 people were killed in the operation.\u00a0</p><p>8 - Montreal residents enjoy the newly restored city hall for the first time in five years as the historic building reopens to the public. Visitors are seen waiting in long lines around the revamped heritage building, waiting for their chance to see what $211 million in upgrades look like. The project to restore the building began in 2019 \u2013 with the cost sitting at almost double the original projections.\u00a0</p><p>9 - A four-alarm fire rips through St. Anne's Anglican Church in Toronto, severely damaging a national historic site and several murals by the Group of Seven. The rector of the church confirms the early paintings by three Group of Seven members were in the part of the church destroyed by the blaze. The paintings had been installed in the 1920s.\u00a0</p><p>9 - French President Emanuel Macron dissolves his country's National Assembly and calls a snap legislative election after his party suffers a heavy defeat in European Parliament elections. The first projected results from France put the far-right National Rally party well ahead in the European Union's parliamentary election, defeating Macron's pro-European centrists. The vote for France's National Assembly will take place in two rounds on June 30 and July 7.\u00a0</p><p>9 - The federal government says a new change to the capital-gains tax will take effect on June 25, regardless of whether legislation has passed. The change would apply to all capital gains by businesses but individuals would only face the higher inclusion rate on capital gains of more than $250,000. The Liberal government plans to take legislative steps on increasing the inclusion rate on capital gains, with Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland saying it will improve tax fairness for Canadians. The government has proposed to make two-thirds of capital gains taxable.\u00a0</p><p>9 - \u00a0Reverend James Lawson Junior, an apostle of nonviolent protest who schooled activists to withstand brutality from white authorities during the Civil Rights Movement, dies at the age of 95 after a short illness in Los Angeles. Lawson was a close adviser to the Reverend Martin Luther King Junior.\u00a0</p><p>10 - A Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois motion is introduced in Parliament calling on the government to broaden a public inquiry into foreign interference so it addresses allegations some MPs \"wittingly'' participated in meddling. That bombshell claim was included in a report released the previous week by Parliament's national security committee. The Conservatives and NDP have both penned letters to Democratic Institutions Minister Dominic LeBlanc, saying the inquiry must be asked to report on the allegations.\u00a0</p><p>10 - The UN Security Council approves its first resolution endorsing a ceasefire plan to try to end the eight-month war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The U.S.-sponsored resolution welcomes a ceasefire proposal announced by President Joe Biden. The U.S. says Israel has accepted it and Hamas says it welcomes the resolution and is ready to work with mediators. The resolution was approved by 14 of the 15 Security Council members, calling on Israel and Hamas to fully implement its terms without delay and without conditions.</p><p>11 - The UN human rights office is citing possible war crimes by Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups in connection with a deadly raid Saturday by Israeli forces that freed four hostages in Gaza. Office spokesman Jeremy Laurence expressed concerns about possible violations of rules of proportionality, distinction and precaution by Israel in the raid at a refugee camp. Gaza health officials say at least 274 Palestinians, including dozens of women and children, were killed in the operation. Laurence said Palestinian armed groups holding hostages in densely populated areas are putting the lives of civilians and the hostages at \"added risks.\"\u00a0</p><p>11 - A Delaware jury finds Hunter Biden guilty on all three felony charges related to the purchase of a revolver in 2018. The U.S. president's son faces up to 25 years in prison for being found guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\u00a0</p><p>11 - A controversial motion increasing the proportion of capital gains that are taxed passes in the House of Commons by a vote of 208-118. The Conservatives vote against the motion, issuing a statement saying the party opposed what it called a \"job-killing tax on health care, homes, farms and small business.\" The Liberals say they are increasing capital-gains taxes to help pay for investments in health care, housing and clean technology. The change will take effect June 25.\u00a0</p><p>12 - Manitoba's NDP approves a plan to search a Winnipeg landfill for the bodies of two murdered women. Premier Wab Kinew says the province wasn't able to provide details before now because of the ongoing court case against the women's admitted killer. Kinew says he met with the families of the murdered women to explain the province's plans. Manitoba's former Progressive Conservative government refused to search the landfill, saying the toxic materials buried there would be dangerous for searchers.\u00a0</p><p>12 - The children who survived the 2012 shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut graduate from Newtown High School. Many of them will walk across the stage with a heavy heart, remembering the 20 first-grade classmates they lost in one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.\u00a0</p><p>12 - A Royal Canadian Geographical Society team has found the wreck of Irish explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship Quest about 80 kilometres off Labrador. The 47-year-old was on his way to explore parts of Antarctica when he died aboard the ship in 1922. Sonar scans located the wreck and the expedition leader says it is in incredible condition, other than having a broken mast. A crew is going to head out to capture images of the wreck using remotely operated vehicles.\u00a0</p><p>13 - New regulations are announced that will take effect in B.C. starting right after Labour Day to set minimum-wage and basic protections for ride-hailing and delivery workers using platforms like Uber, DoorDash and SkipTheDishes. The province's labour ministry says the rules will address the top concerns of workers at app-based platforms, including low and unpredictable pay, tip protection and lack of workers' compensation.\u00a0</p><p>13 - Fox Sports acquires the rights to broadcast IndyCar starting next year. The network already broadcasts the first half of the NASCAR schedule but the move will give it two of the biggest races in the world with the Indianapolis 500 and NASCAR's Daytona 500. Fox Sports said all races will be on Fox and the Fox Sports app.\u00a0</p><p>13 - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other G7 leaders take action on Day One of their summit in Italy to reinforce their solidarity with Ukraine. The leaders cleared the way for a US$50-billion loan package for Kyiv that Canada will pump $5 billion into. U.S. President Joe Biden is also preparing to sign a security agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Both moves are intended to show Russian President Vladimir Putin that the world's leading industrialized democracies are standing behind Ukraine.\u00a0</p><p>13 - Thirty-five Global News jobs are cut across Canada. Unifor says some of its members were laid off in major cities in Alberta, Ontario and B.C. as part of changes recently announced by Corus Entertainment. Those positions cut are on top of 11 Unifor members at Global who were already laid off this year. The union calls it a devastating blow to the industry, adding the jobs are desperately needed in the country.\u00a0</p><p>13 - Tesla shareholders vote to restore CEO Elon Musk's record $44.9 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year. The vote sends out a strong show of confidence in Musk's leadership of the electric vehicle maker. The package will likely remain stuck in Delaware Chancery Court and Supreme Court for months, meaning the money won't move despite the win.\u00a0</p><p>14 - Muslim pilgrims converge on a vast tent camp set up in the desert near Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to officially begin the annual Hajj. Saudi officials say more than 1.5 million foreign pilgrims have arrived in Mecca so far and they expect the total this year to surpass the more than 1.8 million people who took part in the annual holy pilgrimage last year. It is mandatory for the Muslim faithful to take the trip to Mecca and take part in the Hajj at least once in a lifetime.\u00a0</p><p>14 - Before flying to speak at the G7 summit in southern Italy about artificial intelligence, Pope Francis welcomes more than 100 of the world's top comedians to the Vatican to celebrate the importance of humour. He told Whoopi Goldberg, Jimmy Fallon, Chris Rock, Stephen Colbert, Conan O'Brien and others that in the midst of so much gloomy news, they have the power to spread peace and smiles. He asked the entertainers to remember that when they manage to bring intelligent smiles to the lips of even a single spectator, they also make God smile.\u00a0</p><p>14 - Cicada chaos flourishes as trillions of crawling cicada nymphs that have spent 17 years underground shed their skin and emerge as adults. They're red-eyed, loud and frisky. Biologist Gene Kritsky estimates as many as five million cicadas crowded into a small patch of Ryerson Conservation Area north of Chicago, where the males are singing for sex. They won't stop until they get a female cicada's flapping wing consent, which is pushing decibel readings to 101 -- louder than a lawnmower.\u00a0</p><p>14 - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi releases a photo of himself shaking hands with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G7 summit. It's the first time the two have met in person since Trudeau accused Modi's government of being involved in the killing of a Sikh activist in British Columbia.\u00a0</p><p>14 - Scientists in British Columbia call it a \"landmark day\" for Caribou conservation efforts, as the province moves forward with a massive park expansion.

Northeast B.C., he added, relies heavily on produced water with current LNG-related drilling ramp-up influencing this.</p><p>'We'9;ve been leveraging [our scientific] expertise, and our proprietary chemical offerings to provide our customers with solutions to alleviate the water issues and the potential restrictions,' Fedora said.</p><p>'We will continue to work with them and fortunately, I think, a lot of the customer base - having experienced drought conditions last year and looking forward to maybe more drought conditions this year - has been doing lots of work to plan for water.'</p><p>Fedora said customers were already well into building pits, storing water, looking at recycle options, looking at produced water options, 'so we don't expect there to be a significant interruption this summer from water restrictions, as I think industry pretty much is ahead of the game.</p><p>'Overall, I would say over half of our customers use non-potable water in their operations, and we expect this to increase.'</p><h>Wildfire impact on operations</h><p>Fedora said Trican was also keeping an eye on recent wildfire increases in their field operations.</p><p>'Unfortunately, we will also be monitoring forest fire activity throughout B.C. and Alberta, as this could impact access to our field operations and delay work from this summer into the fall and into the winter,' he said.</p><p>'As you know, all of our equipment is on wheels and so there's no risk to the equipment or the people, generally, but it may shut down roads and restrict access to certain areas of the basin.'</p><p>Overall, Fedora said Trican expected the second half of 2024 to be good fiscally but not quite as strong as 2023, due to low gas prices as well as potential water issues and wildfires.</p><p>Asked if analysts should assume that the second half of 2024 could see EBITDA go five per cent lower for Trican, translating into a net year-over-year decline in EBITDA in the two per cent to three per cent range, Fedora called that a tough question because of the potential impacts of drought and fires.</p><p>'If we weren't dealing with those issues I would say &amp;lsquo;absolutely,' that's probably a pretty safe assumption to make, but given the unknowns around restricted access to certain areas with firefighting, just to stay out of the way of firefighters, we're not sure how this summer is going to unfold&amp;hellip;. I don't think we want to guide you on those quite yet,' Fedora said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DOILBN-DOB182336</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DOILBN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C8X-MHF1-JCM9-502B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300449</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 \u00c2\u00a9 JWN Media, a geoLOGIC company.

A policeman at the scene told AFP that they appeared to have fled the vehicle on foot but run in the direction of the wind-fanned flames, in a doomed attempt to escape. <br/><br/>- 'Aerial firefighting' - <br/><br/>In areas where the fire had been tamed, grey ash replaced yellowed scrub as far as the eye could see in non-forested areas. <br/> A 67-year-old farmer was arrested and remanded in custody on suspicion of causing the blaze, a charge he denied. <br/> Police said an eyewitness had seen him leaving the village of Arakapas in his car at the same time the fire started there, and could face charges of recklessly causing the four deaths. <br/> Anastasiades visited a crisis management centre in the village of Vavatsinia, a few kilometres (miles) east of the blaze, on Sunday morning, the CNA news agency reported. <br/> The GreekCypriot leader said the blaze had appeared largely contained but could resurge. <br/> Firefighters were seen along the road leading to Vavatsinia and several helicopters hovered above the fire as thick grey smoke obscured the sky. <br/> An AFP correspondent in Ora village reported seeing several burned out homes. <br/> Janez Lenarcic, European Commissioner for Crisis Management, said on Saturday its 'aerial firefighting capacity' had been mobilised, with Italy and Greece sending planes to help. <br/>Israel deployed a C-130 Hercules and two 'Air Tractor' firefighting aircraft. <br/><br/>- 'Homes deemed safe' - <br/><br/>Britain, which has military bases on Cyprus, deployed two search and rescue helicopters. <br/> A government spokeswoman said later that the situation was close to being brought under control. <br/> 'The fire and forestry services inspected the affected communities and now consider them safe,' said spokeswoman Niovi Parisinou. <br/> 'The effort continues as complacency is not allowed until the final extinguishing of all fires,' she said, adding electricity supplies were being gradually restored. <br/> 'Instructions have already been given for people to return where homes are deemed safe.' <br/> Teams would be deployed immediately to start evaluating and registering damaged homes and property for compensation, she added. <br/>Cyprus has experienced extended heatwaves and periods of drought in recent years. <br/> In the past few days, the temperature has topped 40 degrees Celsius (104degrees Fahrenheit) inland and there has been very little rain since mid-April. <br/><url

Colin Dalton, owner of the Rockhouse, was quick to offer his space. </p><p>\u201cHe was so good with anything we needed,\u201d she said. \u201cHe donated the building, of course, we\u2019re doing this at no cost, so all the money raised goes towards the cause.\u201d </p><p>When it came to getting performers, she immediately thought of Eddie Eastman since she knew he would be in town. </p><p>\u201cI sent a message to his wife Paulette \u2013 and she got back and said absolutely,\u201d said Pardy. </p><p>\u201cEddie was instant, Rodney Slade was instant, Dana Reid was instant, Karla Pilgrim was instant, the stars aligned and everyone was available, everyone thought it was a good cause.\u201d </p><p>'Out of the Ashes' </p><p>Eastman, a Canadian country music singer-songwriter who grew up in Terra Nova, had already planned to come to the island to celebrate his birthday and wedding anniversary and was already on the way to Terra Nova when Pardy reached out. </p><p>There was no question that he wanted to be involved in the fundraiser.  </p><p>He was inspired to perform the song 'Out of the Ashes' which he felt would resonate with the situation in Labrador </p><p>\u201cWhen I found out we were going to be doing this little benefit, I said to my wife, my friend LeRoy Anderson, who\u2019s worked on the Tommy Hunter show for many years, wrote a song several years ago that I heard him sing,\u201d said Eastman. </p><p>\u201cSo before I left Nashville, I contacted him in Calgary, Alberta, and said, 'Send me the lyrics and the melody to the song because I think it might be appropriate for what we\u2019re about to do.'\u201d </p><p>Special lyrics </p><p>After getting to Newfoundland, he began working on getting the song together.  </p><p>He felt the second verse wasn\u2019t connected to the story he was trying to tell, so he began a new verse inspired by the ongoing efforts in Labrador. </p><p>\u201c[Anderson] wrote a second verse but it was kind of like a love song type thing and I was thinking well that doesn\u2019t quite fit what I\u2019m trying to do, so I\u2019ve been kind of rewriting the second verse,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been coming together, I\u2019m trying to come up with ideas and that\u2019s when I see some of the stuff that\u2019s going on down there; the firefighters coming in, the waterbombers and that kind of stuff.\u201d </p><p>Pardy posted a video of Eastman performing a snippet of the verse he\u2019s been writing on Facebook. </p><p>Hoping to inspire </p><p>Eastman said he feels that the song can be inspiring for anyone, and is considering recording it once it\u2019s finished \u2013 with Anderson\u2019s permission. </p><p>\u201cI think it suits the mould because it\u2019s an inspiring song not just for the fire situation but for anybody,\u201d he said.  </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to get down, put your head down, and just push forward with whatever you\u2019re doing in life and just get back up and rebuild.\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s hopeful that people will be able to listen and relate to the hardship that those in Labrador are facing. </p><p>\u201cOut of the ashes, we will rise again, like a first blade of grass when a forest fire ends, the old life is over and a new one begins, out of the ashes, we will rise again,\u201d he quoted the new lyrics. </p><p>\u201cI think they could relate to it and relate to the lyrics and I think that\u2019s the important thing is to have people relate to what\u2019s actually going on and have a little empathy for the folks in Labrador.\u201d </p><p>'Our stories' </p><p>While trying to figure out how to pull off this fundraiser on such short notice, Pardy was connected to an evacuee in Goose Bay through a mutual friend. </p><p>She wanted to better understand what evacuees need most so she could find a way to help. </p><p>\u201cI messaged someone I knew in Labrador, and I said to her, 'I need some support, do you think you could start up a Facebook page and spread the word,'\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cGather pictures, gather videos, gather stories and we\u2019ll connect that way to help out with what\u2019s needed and what\u2019s required.\u201d </p><p>Stephanie Parsons, an evacuee from Labrador City, created the Facebook group \u2018Our stories: Labrador West Wildfire Evacuation,\u2019 to connect all those who have been displaced. </p><p>\u201cEverybody was scared when they had to leave their home and everything they own. They don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to have something to go back to,\u201d explained Parsons. </p><p>The group is a way to share their experience both during the evacuation and to connect after finding accommodations. </p><p>Helping from a distance </p><p>Although the evacuation order was lifted Monday at noon, there's still plenty of uncertainty, and Parsons said that having people who are not directly affected take on the effort to show their support is a great help. </p><p>Rio Tinto's Iron Ore Company of Canada has also recently announced that it is donating $200,000 to the people and community of Labrador West.  </p><p>\u201cWith over 9,000 people evacuated, the financial cost is astronomical so I\u2019m assuming that every dollar is going to count,\u201d she said. </p><p>The fundraiser is taking place on Wednesday, July 24, at 9 p.m. at the Rockhouse in downtown St. John's. There will be a $10 entry fee at the door and a donation table inside.  </p><p>Anasophie Vall\u00e9e is a local journalism initiative reporter covering Indigenous and rural issues.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a8f271c0d943429d8dc30874888e3f19</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CPT-WMV1-DY9S-T040-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"995\"/><timeReceived>05:03 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 12, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000769</classCode><className>FUNDRAISING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008XAN</classCode><className>DISPLACED PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009V56</classCode><className>COUNTRY MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009U6U</classCode><className>SONG WRITING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000093</classCode><className>ANNIVERSARIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>GX589</classCode><className>NASHVILLE, TN, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GX429</classCode><className>CALGARY, AB, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS171</classCode><className>NEWFOUNDLAND &amp; LABRADOR, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

A policeman at the scene told AFP that they appeared to have fled the vehicle on foot but run in the direction of the wind-fanned flames, in a doomed attempt to escape. <br/><br/>- 'Aerial firefighting' - <br/><br/>In areas where the fire had been tamed, grey ash replaced yellowed scrub as far as the eye could see. <br/> A 67-year-old farmer was arrested and remanded in custody on suspicion of causing the blaze, a charge he denied. <br/> Police said an eyewitness had seen him leaving the village of Arakapas in his car at the same time the fire started there. He could face charges of recklessly causing the four deaths. <br/> Anastasiades visited a crisis management centre in the village of Vavatsinia, a few kilometres (miles) east of the blaze, on Sunday morning, the CNA news agency reported. <br/> The GreekCypriot leader said the blaze had appeared largely contained but could resurge. <br/> Firefighters were seen along the road leading to Vavatsinia and several helicopters hovered above the fire as thick grey smoke obscured the sky. <br/> An AFP correspondent in Ora village reported seeing several burned out homes. <br/> Janez Lenarcic, European Commissioner for Crisis Management, said on Saturday its 'aerial firefighting capacity' had been mobilised, with Italy and Greece sending planes to help. <br/>Israel deployed a C-130 Hercules and two 'Air Tractor' firefighting aircraft. <br/><br/>- 'Homes deemed safe' - <br/><br/>Britain, which has military bases on Cyprus, deployed two search and rescue helicopters. <br/> A government spokeswoman said later that the situation was close to being brought under control. <br/> 'The fire and forestry services inspected the affected communities and now consider them safe,' said spokeswoman Niovi Parisinou. <br/> 'The effort continues as complacency is not allowed until the final extinguishing of all fires,' she said, adding electricity supplies were being gradually restored. <br/> 'Instructions have already been given for people to return where homes are deemed safe.' <br/> Teams would be deployed immediately to start evaluating and registering damaged homes and property for compensation, she added. <br/> 'We hope that as winds die down and temperatures fall in the evening, the situation will be better, and hopefully by (Monday) morning, the fire will be under control,' forestry department chief Charalambos Alexandrou said, quoted by CNA. <br/>Cyprus has experienced extended heatwaves and periods of drought in recent years. <br/> In the past few days, the temperature has topped 40 degrees Celsius (104degrees Fahrenheit) inland and there has been very little rain since mid-April. <br/><url

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between

JOHN'S, N.L. - Power was restored Wednesday to two iron-ore mines and a small community in western Labrador after a ferocious wildfire jumped across a river and advanced quickly toward Churchill Falls, which is home to a massive power plant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The wildfire knocked out power from two of the plant's transmission lines on Tuesday afternoon, cutting off electricity to the region of Labrador West, which includes the towns of Wabush and Labrador City.</p><p>On Wednesday afternoon, there was a break in the smoke and the flames long enough for workers with Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro to reach the power plant by helicopter and get in to restore power, said Jill Pitcher, a spokesperson for the Crown-owned energy company.</p><p>They managed to reset one of the lines, turning the lights back on for many in Wabush, who had been without electricity for more than 24 hours.</p><p>Meanwhile, Labrador City was still getting power from Fermont, Que., though Pitcher said residents were being asked to conserve as much energy as they could.</p><p>Wednesday provided some much-needed rain and relief from high winds that had been driving the flames closer to the community of Churchill Falls, in central Labrador, Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey said during a news conference in St. John's.</p><p>\"We are finally getting some co-operation from Mother Nature,\" Furey told reporters. \"(The fire) still remains about three kilometres from the town, and the weather conditions are favourable such that the wind pattern, in particular, should keep it away.\"</p><p>The blaze forced some 750 residents and workers to flee Churchill Falls last week, but a skeleton crew had remained at the generating station, which serves Labrador and Quebec. On Tuesday, they too had to be evacuated as the winds once again pushed the flames forward toward the community.</p><p>The fire advanced swiftly toward the town's airport, hurtling across a two-kilometre lake to get there, and then barrelling over the tarmac, Furey said. At one point, it was advancing at a rate of about two kilometres per hour.</p><p>Remarkably, aerial surveys Wednesday morning showed the buildings around the airport were still standing, the premier said. The fire also did not reach the community of Churchill Falls.</p><p>\"It just speaks to the energy and the force of nature that a forest fire actually is ... able to jump a two-kilometre lake and jump an airstrip and not touch anything in between,\" he said.</p><p>It's not yet clear what kind of damage caused the power outages in Labrador City, Wabush and the nearby mines owned by the Iron Ore Company of Canada and Tacora Resources, said Jennifer Williams, president of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro. The IOC mine, as it is known, had to reduce operations, and the Tacora mine was shut down entirely, according to spokespeople from those companies.</p><p>As of early Wednesday evening, their power was back on, Pitcher said, thanks to the workers who were helicoptered in to the generating station.</p><p>Williams said the final evacuation of the plant on Tuesday night was hard on the employees. \"It was a lot for them to drive away. It's their baby, I would suggest,\" she said.</p><p>The Churchill Falls plant, which started delivering commercial power in 1971, is being run remotely from Happy Valley-Goose Bay, a three-hour drive to the east.</p><p>In the meantime, hundreds of people who fled Churchill Falls last week are still waiting for word on when they might be able to return home. Many fled to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, which has a population of about 8,000 people. Others drove two-and-a-half hours west, to Labrador City, which is home to about 7,450 people.</p><p>On Wednesday morning, people in Labrador City were also playing host to people from Wabush, before the power was restored later that day. The outage had affected the town's water pumping system, and officials asked residents to start boiling their water.</p><p>The local Iron Rock Brewery invited Wabush residents to fill up their jugs with clean water at no cost, and a non-profit fitness organization, Work Out World Inc., offered showers to anyone needing them. \"We're just going to help as many people as we possibly can,\" manger Teri Batlett said in an interview.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 26, 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-76f539f44c6e44898cfaf9a0127835c1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CBT-8841-DY9S-T0C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"705\"/><timeReceived>05:34 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 26, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Obviously this is a really heartbreaking issue. We\u2019re seeing a lot of people suffering because of the lack of treatment beds. Sadly, it\u2019s not something that should have been politicized. We need the full spectrum of care and treatment, and not just what we\u2019re seeing right now:knee-jerk, ideological responses. The BC NDP had four years as a majority government, and in that time, Comox Valley did not get any new publicly-funded treatment beds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We\u2019re seeing the BC Conservatives now call supervised consumption sites drug dens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And they\u2019re promising to close everyone of them down. It just means we\u2019re going to see more open drug use on our streets and in our neighbourhoods. So, we obviously need a huge overhaul of the system. I think it\u2019s one of the biggest failures of the BC NDP government for our valley.</p><p>We need to reorient the resources to support prevention, especially in schools with young people. We need better access to drug and mental health treatment in B.C. because if we\u2019re not doing that it\u2019s costing us as taxpayers way more.</p><p>Right now you\u2019re seeing the average weight time to see a mental health practitioner in B.C. in months, not hours or days as it should be.</p><p>If we really want to address the physical and mental health challenges of Comox Valley residents, we just need to do better.</p><p>In summary, we need to invest more in addiction treatment beds here in the valley. Just that\u2019s what it boils down to.</p><p>Every year, temperature records are broken throughout the province and the forest fire season appears to be getting worse and longer.</p><p>What does your party see as the best way for carbon reduction, and what goals will you aim to strive in helping the province and Island hit those goals? This is an issue that I think the Green Party is extremely well-grounded in. As a farmer myself I live and breathe this day to day. We\u2019ve all seen with the glacier has looked like in these last couple of days. It\u2019s almost gone. That is drinking water. That is also water for farming and irrigation, its water for salmon.</p><p>Last year, we spent a billion dollars trying to fight wildfires in B.C. We have over 300 million hectares that were burned, and yet with all of this, what is the NDP doing? They are subsidizing Big Oil and Gas to the tune of 1.3 billion dollars every year.</p><p>And then we have the Conservative Party with John Rustad saying that climate change isn\u2019t even a real crisis.</p><p>So as an MLA, it would be my role to balance the power in a minority government and fight to ensure that B.C. actually literally survived this climate crisis.</p><p>We know that young people are so wanting to see action happening Farmer and BC Greens candidate for Courtenay-Comox Arzeena Hamir highlighted the drought-related issues affecting numerous farmers across the Comox Valley and beyond during a press conference on June 18, 2024.</p><p>and they want to be part of that.</p><p>I\u2019m looking at green jobs for future for our youth here in the Comox Valley. Things like the installation of solar panels, retrofits, installing heat pumps, firefighting, providing fire breaks, installing community gardens, all of the things that we could be doing to really support the resiliency of our own community.</p><p>I believe that any government that doesn\u2019t address the climate crisis is dooming all of British Columbians, all of us, in the future. We know that all economists agree that the carbon tax is the most effective tool at reducing pollution and CO2 levels.</p><p>So the B.C. greens are focused on reforming, and we\u2019re not eliminating the carbon pricing. What we are wanting to see is that polluters pay a higher price, and the funds that we collect from the carbon tax are brought back into people\u2019s pocketbooks to support the affordability crisis that we currently see. So the Greens are noticing or all loopholes that the B.C. NDP have provided to the oil and gas sector so that they\u2019re not paying their fair share. We\u2019re going to close those loopholes and bring a large chunk of that money back into people\u2019s pocketbooks, And to municipalities that are also feeling the brunt of climate change.</p><p>While there has been an increase in rental housing construction in the Comox Valley, there continues to be a lack of affordable housing. What detailed actions will your party take to increase affordable housing stock here? It\u2019s really unfortunate to see that we have such an educated workforce here in the valley who are struggling to find affordable housing.</p><p>Housing and Healthcare are two of the biggest challenges in our economy. So, in short the solution is non-market housing. So BC NDP has spent billions on housing in the last couple of years, but most of it has gone into market housing that makes a few developers wealthy, but doesn\u2019t actually provide affordable housing here for for locals. The only thing that will significantly move the needle on housing affordability is massive investment in non-market housing, including nonprofit housing and co-op housing.</p><p>So we are the only party that are talking about this type of level of investment. Our leader announced a bold plan, 1.5 billion dollar investment into creating 26,000 non-market House housing units.</p><p>On the other hand, we\u2019ve had the Conservatives who just announced that Rustad rebate to put 3.5 billion dollars of our finances in the hole and not do anything to substantially increase the amount of housing that we have that is affordable here in the valley. So I just want to make sure your readers understand that 3,000 a month in tax breaks. It\u2019s a tax credit, so at best, way into 2029, about five years from now, people will possibly save $100 a month so I don\u2019t see that as action.</p><p>We have our own BC Conservative candidate. Who is continually going on about non-market housing and yet if you look at the actual Conservative platform, it says no such thing. So I\u2019m wondering where he\u2019s getting his talking points from.</p><p>I\u2019m thinking maybe he should be joining the BC Greens if he\u2019s like thinking that that\u2019s actually a thing The area around the Connect Centre in Courtenay continues to face issues and there have been reported increases of crime in the surrounding neighbourhood. The proposed Braidwood Complex aims to address these issues, but has faced pushback from some neighbours. Do you agree with the Braidwood Complex and its location, and how will you aim to make it work effectively? If not, how will you address these issues in its absence? I think we all agree that the last four years of warehousing people at the Connect Centre on Cliffe avenue is just not a dignified way of housing anyone. It\u2019s not working for our community, it\u2019s not working for the businesses in downtown, and it\u2019s certainly not working for those who are unhoused. Who, honestly, wants to live in a warehouse with 100 other people? I\u2019ve spoken to the unhoused community themselves, I\u2019ve spoken to the coalition to end homelessness, not once did anyone advocate for a giant shelter.</p><p>A more appropriate lower cost model is the tiny home village model that Duncan has successfully piloted that has helped to move hundreds of people off of the streets in that community.</p><p>Crime has increased in the Comox Valley in recent years, especially according to RCMP statistics. We have a problem. It\u2019s clear.</p><p>The most effective way of dealing with and combating crime is prevention. So we need to move people off the streets. We need to put get them access to drug treatment, mental health treatment, and education.</p><p>I do want to point out to readers, however, the cost of hiring more police is extremely high. It\u2019s about 300,000 dollars per officer per year, plus the support and infrastructure and equipment. So, in recent years we have not been able to recruit enough officers in Canada. So I don\u2019t even know if that is an option that we should be looking at, more realistically we need to enact what the Greens saw and the special committee on reform of the police act. There are 11 recommendations from that report that was released in 2022. It included a continuum of response for mental health, substance use and other complex social issues and a focus on prevention and community-led response integrating mental health with 911 calls. And that\u2019s something that the BC greens have just recently, released in their full costed of platform:adding mental health onto a 911 call.</p><p>I think it\u2019s a really easy solution to what we\u2019re seeing here in the community, but to sum it up.</p><p>We\u2019re looking at tiny home Village model instead of the current shelter model that B.C. housing is putting forward.</p><p>I door knocked in the Braidwood community and I put this idea forward to the people that I\u2019ve spoken to and not one of them said \u2018no, that\u2019s not a good idea.\u2019 They were absolutely supportive of a model like this at the property that BC housing purchased as a more appropriate way of providing shelter to the unhoused in their community.</p><p>We don\u2019t have a community of NIMBYs who say no, we don\u2019t need to shelter the unhoused. We need to do it appropriately for our community.</p><p>School District 71 has policies and resources that create a supportive and inclusive environment for students. Will your government do anything to change or limit SD71\u2019s ability to use these policies and resources? In short, not at all. We have to be clear SOGI specific curriculum is anti-bullying policy and anti-bullying education. It improves the school climate for both LGBTQ and heterosexual students. So it\u2019s all about reducing discrimination preventing suicidal ideation and really lowering suicide attempts in the student body. It\u2019s something that the BC Greens absolutely support. We need to defend our kids from explicit bigotry of the BC Conservatives who want to ban SOGI policies and who is whose leader has compared SOGI to residential schools. It\u2019s just the most ridiculous thing. I\u2019ve heard John Rustad say that being gay is a lifestyle choice. Unequivocally, we do not support what the BC Conservatives have said. I stand with our kids.

The Route du Nord was closed preventatively July 8 following the detection of fires and hot spots on the western side between km 306 and 320, and on the southern part between km 150 and 180. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Closure points were set up at km 4, near Chibougamau, at km 407, and the junction with Billy Diamond Highway at km 274. Another closure point was established at km 394 of the Billy Diamond Highway, where the Muskeg access road begins.  </p><p>\u201cWe did have the three fires near the road near Nemaska and I believe they had another seven fires on the Route du Nord towards Chibougamau,\u201d said Nemaska fire chief Kurtis Black. \u201cSince that\u2019s in an intensive zone, there were water bombers in Chibougamau initiated towards those fires.\u201d </p><p>With many people attending the annual gathering in Old Nemaska, the community dispatched first responders and firefighting equipment to the area as a preventive measure. About 40 SOPFEU personnel were also present. Fires had reached as close as a half kilometre from Old Nemaska road and about 5 km from the Nemaska turnoff junction before being extinguished by rain.  </p><p>Another fire, number 256, had gotten to about 10 km from the community on the other side of the lake but swiftly diminished when it hit an island with muskeg. Most concerning at press time was a quickly growing fire about 30 km northwest of Nemaska, which Black said SOPFEU would attack if it came any closer to Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec infrastructure.  </p><p>Due to increasing fire risk, on July 11 SOPFEU banned open fires in the vicinity of forests and the cancellation of industrial burning permits, which includes burns to destroy material felled during deforestation. With $29 million in new funding, the provincial forest fire prevention agency aims to hire 80 new firefighters in the next two years, increasing staff by 32%. </p><p>With fires near Quebec\u2019s northeast border forcing thousands to evacuate from Labrador City, the town of Fermont recently planted a shield of deciduous trees along its perimeter, in association with Arbre-\u00c9volution. The town had previously reduced density of conifer trees near residential buildings, which the organization said are full of organic oil \u201clike a forest of matches.\u201d </p><p>Following last summer\u2019s record-shattering wildfire season, governments are increasingly leveraging both new technologies and ancient wisdom. In BC\u2019s Okanagan Valley, the Syilx First Nation has been successfully leading traditional prescribed burning practices with the full support of BC Wildfire Service.  </p><p>\u201cThey came with open hearts and minds, wanting to understand and work with Indigenous people,\u201d said James Pepper, the sn\u2019pink\u2019tn community\u2019s natural resources manager. \u201cIt\u2019s great the province and federal government are starting to realize how important that proactive approach is.\u201d </p><p>As the culture\u2019s burning practices had long been outlawed, some techniques had to be modernized to account for decades of accumulated tree debris and other surface fuels. Technologies like environmental monitoring and mechanical tree removal are seated within the Indigenous paradigm. </p><p>With lower intensity burns to maintain plant roots and fungi, Syilx firekeepers would traditionally work when the snow recedes in early spring, focusing on patches dried by the sun with the remaining snow acting as a natural fire break. As more snow melts, the previous burns would serve as fire breaks for further work.  </p><p>Traditional firekeepers work in two-person crews with vast knowledge of soil moisture levels, the land\u2019s slope and other aspects. Before the prescribed burning process begins, a land \u201ctreatment\u201d may consist of a fuel cleanup, stem pruning and some pile burning.  </p><p>\u201cOne Syilx methodology is to carefully prepare the land before the burn, for example, by strategically placing debris,\u201d Pepper told the Nation. \u201cIt\u2019s very relevant what the conditions are after the treatment\u2019s been done. These days it\u2019s a hybridized approach that\u2019s Syilx-led with very strong collaborative work that makes the whole process much stronger.\u201d </p><p>The project has become recognized as a best practice in the field, with treatment areas effectively working as a break against three intense fires in the past two years. The community\u2019s youth have enthusiastically absorbed traditional practices and joined the team, with two former employees starting their own companies focused on prescribed burning.  </p><p>While many First Nations are reviving this millennia-old tradition to reduce risks, rejuvenate lands and return natural habitats, numerous communities are also integrating emerging technologies to battle blazes. Cree fire chiefs have been increasingly looking to satellite imagery and drones to stay ahead of wildfire risk.  </p><p>\u201cWe have one active fire right now, and there\u2019s no way of getting to it except by helicopter,\u201d said Kurtis Black. \u201cWe go observe them and send the drones in to get a better perspective and transfer all that information to CNG and SOPFEU. Drones make a big difference. We started with them about two or three years ago \u2013 we\u2019re trying to get training from Transport Canada.\u201d </p><p>While drones can currently be used for \u201chot spotting\u201d fires invisible to the naked eye with thermal scanners, last summer Transport Canada authorized the operation of drone swarms for fighting wildfires. US agencies use drones that drop \u201cdragon eggs\u201d that detonate with extinguishing chemicals. University of Calgary researchers are testing military predator drones that could travel farther to release water, even scooping up water from lakes inaccessible to piloted planes.   </p><p>Hoping for a storm with plentiful rain, Black continuously monitors weather data from various apps. He was only half joking when he said, \u201cYou need an IT guy at all times.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to check the weather channel every day,\u201d said Black. \u201cWhen I went to bed last night, it said five days of rain. When I checked this morning, two days. You try to depend on Mother Nature to put them out, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-22bca3da22334707ae23f2eb8cb3c3e6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CMG-6W31-JBVR-30TT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1027\"/><timeReceived>10:51 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 1, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Disclosure information is available on the original site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">___</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Author: Ajay Parasram, Associate professor and Founding Fellow, MacEachen Institute for Public Policy and Governance, Dalhousie University</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Western media has been abuzz with speculation that voters want to punish incumbent governments. But as recent elections in France and the United Kingdom suggest, they seem to prefer doing so by rewarding alternatives that seek progressive policy options or \u2014 if that seems too radical \u2014 at least creatively offers something new at the ballot box. </p><p>If we look across the pond, there has been a strong drive to punish incumbents who led their countries through economic downturns, the first (and not likely the last) pandemic in recent memory, continental war in Europe and the existential and catastrophic climate emergency. </p><p>In Canada, we also must add the largely failed attempts to advance reconciliation and sovereignty with Indigenous nations and people, more extreme forest-fire seasons, the housing crisis and societal divisiveness stemming from the so-called Freedom Convoy movement.</p><p>It\u2019s been a busy half a decade, and these are just the most mainstream of issues.</p><p>Exhausted, angry</p><p>Western voters in recent weeks have demonstrated they\u2019re exhausted, angry and frustrated with incumbents \u2014 but they\u2019ve also indicated that when offered a choice between far-right ideology and policies that address their struggles, they\u2019ll opt for the latter. </p><p>The recent French parliamentary elections are an example \u2014 pundits and polls all predicted an unprecedented victory for the far-right Rassemblement National, despite its legacy of racism and promise to distance France from the European Union. </p><p>After the first ballot, it seemed the populist party would accomplish this feat \u2014 but then other parties got together to innovatively offer a clearer choice to voters on the second ballot by agreeing not to run candidates against each other in hundreds of ridings.</p><p>The question posed to the electorate essentially shifted from simply: \u201cAre you angry?\u201d to a more nuanced: \u201cWho is best placed to address your anger? The far right? Or a progressive coalition that wants to focus on liveable incomes, a cap on food inflation, pay increases for public sector workers and a wealth tax on the richest?\u201d </p><p>It wasn\u2019t magic that led to the unprecedented victory for the leftist coalition, it was policy ideas paired with the creative decision to work together ahead of the vote. Voters \u2014 especially younger voters \u2014 tend to be less partisan and much more outraged by the failure of incumbents to act meaningfully on the direct and existential circumstances shaping their lives. </p><p>Offering something new</p><p>What happened in France isn\u2019t necessarily because people are left-wing \u2014 the rise of the far right in the EU elections that preceded the French elections saw huge gains for that movement. The left alliance in France worked hard ahead of the polls to present policy that spoke to people\u2019s needs regardless of their political views. </p><p>As France Insoumise politician Cl\u00e9mence Guett\u00e9 recently explained:</p><p> \u201cThat we were able to rally around a governing program devoted to responding to the social and ecological emergency is what made this alliance possible\u2026it is aimed at responding to the needs of the French people and there is massive support for the measures it includes.\u201d </p><p>Trusting voters ahead of polls arguably explains this shift.</p><p>It was a different story across the English Channel, even if it also led to the most crushing rebuke of the British Conservative Party in centuries. A massive majority government was handed to the Labour Party because the ancient first-past-the-post electoral system does not provide much room for creativity. </p><p>The system delivered Labour 175 more seats than they would have received under a system of proportional representation. </p><p>Canadian politicians have much to learn from studying these elections. The negative message of anger and fear that often characterizes western right-wing populism is good at confirming voters are angry with incumbents, but as France shows us, that populist anger can be channelled into creative policy ideas that inspire votes.</p><p>The supply-and-confidence agreement between the Liberals and New Democratic Party is interesting, but it wasn\u2019t built on trust with voters because it was cobbled together after an election. Coalition-building and co-operation ought to be offered to voters ahead of time, as they are in other countries.</p><p>\u2018Same old choices\u2019</p><p>Polls can\u2019t really capture this dynamic, because they only offer snapshots of what people think in a particular moment, and those moments in western democracies are usually filled with apathy and dissatisfaction with the same old choices. </p><p>The Conservative Party of Canada isn\u2019t doing much more than talking about axing a small carbon tax that\u2019s largely handed back to Canadians in refunds. </p><p>But the Conservatives and their leader, Pierre Poilievre, seem to thrive on the emotional aspect of economic stress  \u2014 anger may be enough, but maybe not when it\u2019s met by an alternative that actually addresses economic justice, reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples and the devastation of runaway climate change. </p><p>Such an option does not yet exist in Canada, but there\u2019s plenty of time to build it. If parties choose to respect voters\u2019 intelligence, Canadians might have something worth voting for in the next federal election. ___</p><p>Ajay Parasram is affiliated with The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, Nova Scotia.  ___</p><p>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

JOHN'S, N.L. - Water bombers from Quebec and Ontario will be helping to battle wildfires in Newfoundland and Labrador, bringing relief and hope to crews trying to keep a blaze near Churchill Falls from crossing a river and spreading to the town.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The four extra planes from the country's two biggest provinces doubled Newfoundland and Labrador's water bomber capacity, as the number of fires burning in the eastern region jumped to 11 on Friday, up from seven the day before.</p><p>\"That's a significant increase for us,\" Mark Lawlor, provincial forest fire duty officer, said in an interview about the added water bombers. The bombers from Quebec arrived on Thursday, and those from Ontario arrived Friday afternoon and would join the fight the following day, he said.</p><p>With help from the four aircraft, crews will focus on preventing the fire nearest to Churchill Falls from growing, and keeping open the Trans-Labrador Highway, which connects the community to Labrador City in the west and to Happy Valley Goose Bay in the east, Lawlor said.</p><p>The fire nearest Churchill Falls has been burning since June 13, but the winds shifted suddenly on Wednesday evening, and the blaze rose up to quickly devour trees and advance toward the town by two kilometres in just 45 minutes. Officials sent out an emergency alert ordering everyone in the town to pack up and get out in less than an hour.</p><p>The community is home to approximately 700 people, as well as a hydroelectric generating station that provides power to Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec. A skeleton team remains at the site to keep it working, and the plant is running at normal capacity, Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro has said.</p><p>However, the company said in a release Friday that smoke could damage parts of the plant's transmission lines, \"resulting in trips.\"</p><p>\"Team(s) are working to understand potential scenarios and mitigate any potential customer impact, should smoke conditions result in a trip,\" the release said.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, the province's wildfire dashboard showed that the fire covered an area of about seven square kilometres, and it was burning roughly 15 kilometres southwest of the town. By Thursday afternoon, officials said its size had more than doubled to about 16 square kilometres, and its flames were just six kilometres away from the community.</p><p>The Churchill River lies between the fire and the town, and fire officials are hoping the wind keeps it that way.</p><p>Lawlor said crews are also working to beat back another wildfire nearby that crossed the Trans-Labrador Highway about 17 kilometres west of Churchill Falls earlier this week. The remote two-lane highway cuts across Labrador's vast, wooded interior, and is the only road connecting communities in the west with the rest of the province.</p><p>More than 500 residents and workers forced to evacuate Churchill Falls on Wednesday drove east along the highway for three hours during a lightning storm to reach Happy Valley-Goose Bay, where they checked in with a local command centre offering cots and emergency supplies.</p><p>By Thursday evening, everyone had a place to stay and nobody needed the cots anymore, officials in Happy Valley-Goose Bay said in a news release.</p><p>Bonnie Learning, vice-president of the local SPCA board, said she and her team were set up at the YMCA Wednesday night until 1:30 a.m. They managed to find foster homes for 13 cats and two dogs that came with families forced to flee Churchill Falls, she said. By Friday morning, most of those families had come to retrieve their pets because friends, family or even total strangers had offered them and their furry friends a temporary home.</p><p>\"Geographically Labrador is a large area, but when it comes to emergency situations, the communities really pull together,\" Learning said in an interview Friday. \"I think it's just that small-town mentality that if someone needs a hand, you lend a hand if you can.\"</p><p>Officials said Friday it was still too soon to say when people might be able to return to their homes in Churchill Falls. In the meantime, Learning said Happy Valley-Goose Bay was bustling with more than 500 extra people in town.</p><p>\"Lineups at (Tim Hortons) are longer,\" she said, laughing. \"Everyone seems to be settled away here for the time being until they get word about what's going on in Churchill Falls, and when they can go back home. But generally speaking, everything's been really positive.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 21, 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-9b70304ff1254a9b898ff1835a3c16d2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C9R-D431-JBVR-30FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"744\"/><timeReceived>03:58 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 21, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

During the past three decades, the average number of forest fires has been about 1,000 fires annually, with an average burnt area of 0.5 ha per fire.</p><p>Longtime wildfire ecologist Robert Gray has been telling us for some time we need to make some changes to our forest practices, including more thinning and prescribed burns at low fire intensity.</p><p>Some people in the forest industry are also promoting some changes to our harvesting practices.</p><p>Ian Kerr, owner of West Kootenays, B.C.-based AcreShakerr Contracting, thinks it is important to incentivize pre-commercial thinning, first and second pass thinning, and good stewardship.</p><p>An article in Canadian Forest Industry by Ellen Cools describes how Kerr has been transitioning to smaller harvesting equipment that causes less damage during his commercial thinning operations.</p><p>His purchase of a F4 Dion forwarder from Michel Dion, based in St. Augustin-de-Martins, Quebec has allowed him to change everything in terms of not having to build any block roads or trails, or construct landings, and being able to have very dense tree retention without any residual damage.</p><p>\"The forwarder on rubber tracks, very small \u2013 six feet wide, 28 feet long \u2013 can haul either cord wood or short logs (16 to 18-foot ) which meet cut-to-length requirements for local sawmills. The forwarder is so small it can move between trees easily. The F4 Dion has a rubber track with an iron cleat, similar to a snowcat, but smoother, with only one point of contact for traction. As a result, it's very light on the ground and does not squash the root maps in the forest.\"</p><p>Locally, Ken Day has also been promoting changing our forest practices as described in a CBC article about a fire that started in the Alex Fraser Research Forest on the afternoon of July 7, 2017.</p><p>More forest thinning is needed which involves removing trees and other vegetation that is dead or slow-growing to make room for new trees and to remove wildfire fuel from the area.</p><p>He goes on to compare us with traditional European forestry practices. They often thin their forests twice when the forest is 15 years old or three times at age 30.</p><p>Sometimes, they even thin forests once more at age 60 and then, when the forest is 80 years old, harvest it. Each of those thinnings puts some fibre into the market as a means of improving the quality of the final harvest and recovering fibre in the interim while the stand is growing.</p><p>READ MORE: FOREST INK: Managing biodiversity in the P.G.

If all are successful, this will nearly double the number of provincially paid firefighters. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The province is working with Natural Resources Canada to increase capacity of wildland firefighting.  </p><p>\u201cThis is us preparing for a worst case scenario,\u201dsaid Mike Montigny, manager of field services for the Department of Environment. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be prepared and have people trained before you need them rather than have to train them if we get into a situation where we get overwhelmed.\u201d </p><p>The risk of wildland fire in Canada continues to escalate due to climate change, community and resource expansion into wildland areas, and declining forest health, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre Inc\u2019s 2024-2029 strategic plan. </p><p>In 2023, 7,511 personnel were mobilized to fight forest fires across Canada. That\u2019s more than double the second highest number of personnel mobilized in a year since 1981. </p><p>\u201cYear after year, the CIFFC member agencies\u2019 response capacity is tested by intense wildland fire events that threaten communities, infrastructure, and natural habitats with increasing frequency,\u201d the report states. </p><p>The CIFFCI\u2019s top strategic priority is to increase people capacity and Natural Resources Canada has launched various initiatives to support the same goal.   </p><p>Mr Montigny said participants from each Island county will partake in the training. </p><p>Successful participants will add to the near 50 already trained wildland firefighters working in the Department of Forests, Fish and Wildlife. </p><p>Most of these firefighters have completed level one or two training, Mr Montigny said. He added through this ranking system, level ones have the most training and experience and level threes have the least. </p><p>The new crew of civil service participants has already begun an online Incident Command System course (ICS 100). Through the level three training that will start this month, they will learn the basics of fire suppression, fire behaviour, fire operations, and safety. They\u2019ll also try their hand at a fitness test they are required to pass. </p><p>Once successful participants gain experience in the field, those showing promise will be able to work toward level two, then level one qualifications, Mr Montigny said. </p><p>Level three firefighters generally aren\u2019t called to support firefighting across the country but level two and one personnel are, he said. </p><p>Civil service workers who respond to fires during working hours will receive their regular salary or rate of pay and a rate will be set to compensate those who respond after hours. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an internal conversation,\u201d Mr Montigny said about the after hours rate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-6036cde31b934803b61f2f88b60c656b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BSC-H9P1-JBVR-3102-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"452\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 10, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
