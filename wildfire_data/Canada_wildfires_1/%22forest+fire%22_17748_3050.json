Mistissini is the second largest Cree community in the province, home to around 4,000 people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's mainly the heavy smoke that's coming into the community that's the big factor,\" Petawabno said, adding that the air quality was expected to worsen over the weekend.</p><p>Members of his community were starting to get anxious, he said, and had been encouraged to stay inside and close their windows because of the smoke. \"Some couldn't even run air exchangers or air conditioners because they could still smell the smoke, so we have to think of the health of the people,\" he said. </p><p>Earlier this month, Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault told a news conference that Mistissini was preparing to evacuate \u2014 a claim that was quickly contradicted by Petawabno. The premier said shortly after that there had been a miscommunication between the town and provincial fire officials. </p><p>Petawabno said Legault's claim sparked panic, as people rushed to get gasoline for their cars and leave town. Now that the community is actually evacuating, he wanted to make sure people had sufficient warning: he issued the order Thursday evening but didn't set a hard deadline for people to leave.</p><p>As of 1 p.m., almost 1,500 vehicles had left town, along with six buses carrying around 300 passengers, he said, adding that around 600 vulnerable people had already been evacuated. Most evacuees would go to Saguenay, Que., about 300 kilometres southeast, he said.</p><p>Petawabno said he was confident the community would be safe from the flames. Canadian soldiers and firefighters from Spain were staying to protect the town, and fire breaks had been built, he said, adding that Mistissini is located on a peninsula and protected by water.</p><p>But even if infrastructure is saved, the charred forests will have an impact on life in the town. For many people, especially elders, the loss of forests \u2014 where they used to hunt \u2014 is difficult, he said.</p><p>\"That's one of the toughest things for our people here, we live off the land, and they're not too happy with all the destruction that's been caused by these fires,\" he said. \"That's where you feel the hurt.\"</p><p>Scott Forward, a member of Mistissini's emergency operations group, said members of the community handed out masks, helped people with mobility issues register with evacuation coordinators, and ensured people's pets were safe.</p><p>\"People really do band together in a situation like this,\" he said in an interview Friday. \"It's calm, and I think one of the reasons why it's calm is because it was well planned.\"</p><p>On Friday afternoon, another Cree community, Waswanipi, about 183 kilometres southwest of Mistissini, said around 230 community members with health conditions, as well as pregnant women and infants would be evacuated on Saturday due to poor air quality. </p><p>Earlier in the afternoon, the northwestern city of Senneterre, Que., ordered the evacuation of 60 cottages in a rural area about 30 kilometres north of the city centre. Mayor Nathalie-Ann Pelchat said in an email that winds were blowing a fire toward the cottages, but added that no other evacuations were expected. </p><p>On Thursday, the northern city of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon ordered residents to leave after the same fire cut off one of the two provincial highways connecting the city to the rest of the province. </p><p>It was the second time in less than three weeks that the city had ordered an evacuation due to the fires. Residents had been allowed to return on Sunday after a 17-day evacuation earlier this month, but most of the community's approximately 2,000 residents didn't return or left earlier in the week.</p><p>For resident Jacynthe Barrette, the second evacuation order was a sign that she made the right decision not to stay in the community when residents were allowed to return. Barrette, who has been staying with her sister in Val-d'Or, Que., around 120 kilometres south of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, said she went back to check on her house and get a few things before leaving again.</p><p>Barrette said she's not worried about her home, adding that Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon is protected by water on three sides, and firefighters, including some from outside the country, were working hard to protect the town.</p><p>\"What I miss the most is getting back to my friends, my normal life, my routine,\" she said in an interview Thursday, adding that she missed her involvement with community organizations, including one that helps new immigrants integrate into the community.</p><p>There were more than 100 fires burning in Quebec Friday, including 24 that were considered out of control, the province's wildfire prevention agency \u2014 SOPFEU \u2014 said, adding that continued dry conditions were causing fires to gain strength. Since the beginning of the week, seven fires that had been contained were once again out of control, the agency said.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 23, 2023. </p><p>\u2014 With files from Thomas MacDonald.</p><p>---</p><p>This story was produced with the financial assistance of the Meta and Canadian Press News Fellowship.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-16a455956eb747bbad0a764e00a5c9a5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68J4-1GT1-JBVR-333T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"896\"/><timeReceived>05:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 23, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Her fear is based on a recently released report by the World Health Organization - the same group that has shown themselves incompetent (or worse) in the current pandemic situation - a group that has appeared to be helping cover for the Chinese government.</p><p>She uses catch phrases like \"according to the best available science,\" but she must be aware that scientific groups often are in error which is why the narrative around the pandemic keeps changing. Even the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) was caught red-handed in the past fudging the numbers of this \"best available science\" to fit their particular agenda.</p><p>She then expresses how \"shocked and frightened\" she was on a recent trip to Kelowna by the forest fire situation - by insinuation attributing it to climate change and demanding immediate action. Neither Ms. Shafir nor I are scientists so we have to rely on others. I would direct her attention to a trained scientist with a proven track record. Patrick Moore, environmental activist and co-founder of Greenpeace, in his book, 'Fake Invisible Catastrophes and Threats of Doom', debunks the false claims that climate change is the cause of forest fires. He produces data showing that in the early 1900s the forest fire situation in the U.S. was far worse than it is now. So, to use this as an argument for increased government action is just nonsense.</p><p>The real danger in all this is the effect this fear-mongering is having on our society and particularly on our youth.</p><p>Finally, I hope Ms. Shafir walked or rode a bike to B.C. - wouldn't flying just add to the problem she is demanding the rest of us take action on?</p><p>L.H.

AMENDED AND NONBINDING NDP OPPOSITION MOTION ON CANADA'S RESPONSE TO THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR.<br/>THE DECISION TO SUPPORT THE MOTION ON MONDAY NIGHT HAS RAISED TENSIONS INSIDE THE LIBERAL CAUCUS.</p><p><br/>   THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE TOUGHEST ISSUES THAT -- NOT ONLY WE HAVE FACED AS A CAUCUS, BUT  I THINK IT'S REFLECTIVE OF JUST WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE IN CANADA.<br/>   I THINK WE HAVE DISAGREEMENTS.<br/>WE HAVE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS.<br/>THAT'S NATURAL.<br/>   OUR SOCIETY HAS GOT CRACKS, DOESN'T IT.<br/>IF CAUCUS WASN'T REPRESENTING OUR SOCIETY, WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING CAUCUS?<br/>   WE ARE ALWAYS HAVING CONVERSATIONS AND THIS IS WHERE WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE VIEWS AND STRENGTHEN CANADA.<br/>   DAVID: ONE OF THE NDP'S OBJECTIVES IN ALL OF THIS WAS TO STOP ALL TRADE IN MILITARY GOODS AND TECHNOLOGY WITH ISRAEL IMMEDIATELY.<br/>BUT TODAY DEFENCE MINISTER BILL BLAIR SAID THIS.<br/>   THE CONTRACTS THAT ARE CONTRACTS AND THEY'LL BE RESPECTED AND MAINTAINED.<br/>ON GOING FORWARD, THAT IS A DETERMINATION TO BE MADE BY THE FOREIGN MINISTER.<br/>   DAVID: OKAY.<br/>WHAT EXACTLY DOES THIS MEAN AND WHAT IS THE LONGER TERM POLITICAL FALLOUT FROM THIS VOTE?<br/>WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS ALL OF THAT WITH THE POWER PANEL?<br/>BRAD LAVIGNE IS A FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE NDP.<br/>AND HERE WITH ME IN STUDIO,<br/>JONATHAN KALLES IS A FORMER QUEBEC ADVISOR TO PRIME <br/>MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU.<br/>CHARELLE EVELYN IS THE MANAGING EDITOR HILL TIMES.<br/>TIM POWERS A FORMER STRATEGIST FOR CONSERVATIVES PARTIES.<br/>BRAD, I NEED TO START WITH YOU, AND I GOT A STATEMENT FROM GLOBAL AFFAIRS SAYING EXPORT PERMITS THAT WERE APPROVED BEFORE JANUARY 8TH REMAIN IN EFFECT.<br/>AND AS YOU HEARD MINISTER BLAIR THERE SAYING EXISTING CONTRACTS WILL BE RESPECTED.<br/>BUT YESTERDAY I ASKED FOREIGN AFFAIRS CRITIC FOR THE NDP HEATHER MCPHERSON WHAT HER UNDERSTANDING <br/>EXISTING ARMED CONTRACTS MEANT,  AND SHE SAID THIS...<br/>   I MADE SURE THAT MINISTER JOLY WAS VERY CLEAR WITH US THAT THAT MEANT THAT NO NEW AGREEMENTS OR CONTRACTS WILL BE SIGNED BUT ALSO THERE WILL BE NO TRANSFER OF MILITARY GOODS.<br/>AND NOT ARMS.<br/>MILITARY GOODS.<br/>   DAVID: BUT IF THE EXISTING CONTRACTS --<br/>   AND THOSE WOULD BE CANCELLED.<br/>   DAVID: OKAY, BRAD, I DON'T KNOW WHAT CANADA IS GOING TO DO ABOUT MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO ISRAEL.<br/>AND I HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS, AND I AM TOLD ONE THING BY THE NEW DEMOCRATS AND I AM TOLD ANOTHER THING BY THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA.<br/>BUT THEN THE NEW DEMOCRATS SAY THEY'VE BEEN ASSURED OF A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING PRIVATELY FROM MELANIE JOLY THAT NOTHING IS GOING TO GO TO ISRAEL.<br/>BUT YOU HEARD BILL BLAIR AND WE HAVE THE STATEMENT SOME THINGS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED WILL GO TO ISRAEL.<br/>WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?<br/>   WELL, IT'S A BIT OF A MESS HERE.<br/>I MEAN...<br/>YOU GOT TO GO TO THE TAPE, AND YOU GOT TO LOOK AT THE WORDING THAT WAS NEGOTIATED AND VOTED UPON.<br/>AND IT IS \"CEASE THE FURTHER AUTHORIZATION AND TRANSFER OF ARMED EXPORTS TO ISRAEL TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH CANADA'S ARMS EXPORT REGIME.\"<br/>SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT HEATHER MCPHERSON WAS TOLD BY MINISTER JOLY.<br/>BUT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS I GUESS WHEN WE DO NEGOTIATIONS A LITTLE BIT LATE IN THE PROCESS AND MAKE IT QUITE COMPLICATED.<br/>MY UNDERSTANDING, THOUGH, I HAVE TO GO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THE SECOND CLAUSE WITHIN THE MOTION THAT WAS ADOPTED.<br/>AND IT SAYS NO FURTHER PERMITS WILL BE ISSUED.<br/>SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS -- IF THERE WAS A SIDEBAR.<br/>BUT IF IT'S NOT WRITTEN DOWN AND IT'S NOT PART OF THE MOTION, THEN, I THINK, THAT IS WHAT IS LENDING ITSELF TO A BIT OF THE CONFUSION.<br/>   JONATHAN, THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE WAS \"SUSPEND ALL TRADE AND MILITARY GOODS AND TECHNOLOGY WITH ISRAEL\" WHICH IS VERY BROAD AND SWEEPING AND COVERS EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF.<br/>THE NEW LANGUAGE IS AS BRAD POINTED OUT \"CEASE THE FURTHER AUTHORIZATION AND TRANSFER OF ARMED EXPORTS TO ISRAEL TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE\"<br/>BLAH BLAH BLAH.<br/>WE ARE TOLD THAT THE PRE-EXISTING THINGS HOLD.<br/>BUT IT FEELS LIKE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO FOREIGN POLICY LIKE A PERSONAL INJURY LAW CASE WHERE EVERYONE MAKES OUTRAGEOUS DEMANDS AND THEN THEY CUT A DEAL ON THE COURTHOUSE STEPS BEFORE TRIAL.<br/>   YES, THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU NEGOTIATE AND CHANGE EMOTIONS WITH -- YOU KNOW, STEVE MACKINNON READ OUT THE AMENDMENTS TO THE ORIGINAL MOTION II SUBSECTION B, WE'RE ADDING THIS WORD, WE'RE TAKING OUT THIS WORD.<br/>I WAS WATCHING IT AND HOW DO YOU FOLLOW ALONG AND THEN THEY WERE VOTING ON IT.<br/>YOU SAW SOME MPS UPSET SIMPLY BY THE FACT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE VOTING ON.<br/>FORGET THE TRANSLATION EVEN.<br/>BUT THAT THEY HAD NO NEW CLEAN VERSION OF THE MOTION.<br/>WHAT AM I VOTING ON?<br/>BUT AS BRAD READ IT OUT AND YOU SAID THE WORD \"FURTHER\" SUGGESTS NEW, ADDITIONAL, TO COME.<br/>AND I MEAN HEATHER MCPHERSON FEELS BURNED RIGHT NOW.<br/>SHE SHOULD HAVE READ THE MOTION.<br/>SHE SHOULD HAVE READ THE AMENDMENT.<br/>IF SHE IS UPSET ABOUT IT, MAYBE SOMEBODY SOLD HER A BAG OF GOODS BUT IT RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF HER.<br/>THEY DIDN'T START NEGOTIATING CHANGES MONDAY AT 6:30.<br/>THEY STARTED NEGOTIATING ON THE WEEKEND, IF NOT EARLIER.<br/>SO, YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE DAY, I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THIS COUNTRY IS DECIDED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND WHEN IT'S DEFENCE EXPORTS, AND THE DEFENCE MINISTER IS INVOLVED AND NOT AN OPPOSITION CRITIC.<br/>THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.<br/>IF SHE IS FEELING BURNED, SHE IS THE ONE WHO PROMISED THE SUN, THE MOON, AND THE STARS -- I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD A REAL LOGICAL EXPLANATION WHY THEY ALLOWED THESE AMENDMENTS SINCE THIS IS -- WHAT WAS PASSED IN THE END WAS SUCH A WATERED DOWN VERSION THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY WERE SORT OF CLAIMING VICTORY.<br/>BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE VICTORY IS.<br/>   DAVID: CHARELLE, I WAS READING THE REPORTING IN THE PUBLICATION HILL TIMES EARLIER TODAY.<br/>   I HEARD OF IT.<br/>   DAVID: AND BANGING OUT THE STORIES, AND SHE HAS THE NARRATIVE OF HOW IT ALMOST FELL APART MONDAY NIGHT AT 6:30 AND THE NDP WALKED AWAY AND MELANIE JOLY CHASED HEATHER MCPHERSON INTO THE OPPOSITION LOBBY TO COME TO THIS COMPROMISE.<br/>WHAT LIGHT CAN YOU SHED ON THIS AS THE MANAGING EDITOR OF THE HILL TIMES AS TO WHAT EXACTLY THE CONVERSATION ENTAILED AND HOW DID THEY GET -- WHAT ASSURANCES WERE GIVEN.<br/>   WELL, I DON'T -- NOBODY IS REALLY SUPER CLEAR.<br/>AND AS WE ARE HEARING TODAY, NOBODY IS SUPER CLEAR --<br/>   YEAH.<br/>   -- WHAT ASSURANCES WERE GIVEN.<br/>THAT'S THE ISSUE.<br/>I THINK EVERYBODY FEELS AS THOUGH THEY GOT WHAT THEY WANTED OUT OF IT.<br/>BUT ULTIMATELY NOBODY IS HAPPY.<br/>YOU KNOW, AS CHELSEA REPORTED TODAY, HEATHER MCPHERSON ON THE PHONE, AND HEARING FROM A LOT OF THE CONSTITUENTS AND LOT OF THE STAKEHOLDERS SAYING WE WANT SOMETHING TO COME OUT OF THIS.<br/>WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO HANG OUR HAT ON.<br/>WE DON'T WANT HEADLINES THE NEXT DAY TO SAY, YOU KNOW, CANADIAN MPS VOTED AGAINST SOMETHING CALLING FOR A CEASEFIRE.<br/>SO THEY WANTED TO GET TO A WIN.<br/>YEAH, THE NDP WALKED AWAY A FEW TIMES AS CHELSEA REPORTED, AND HENCE THE CHASING DOWN TO KIND OF HAMMER THIS OUT.<br/>BUT ULTIMATELY NOBODY REALLY KNOWS -- YOU KNOW, WE HAVE -- AS JONATHAN SAID, WE HAVE WHAT HAS WRITTEN DOWN.<br/>THERE WERE CLEARLY A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS.<br/>BUT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY ON MONDAY DURING THE DEBATE, WE HEARD MELANIE JOLY SAY WE CANNOT MAKE FOREIGN POLICY THROUGH AN OPPOSITION MOTION.<br/>AND IT SOUNDS LIKE REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT IS THEY ULTIMATELY DID TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY FELT THEY COULD ACTUALLY VOTE FOR IT, THEY ARE STILL NOT MAKING THEIR FOREIGN POLICY BASED ON AN OPPOSITION MOTION.<br/>THE MOTION IS NONBINDING.<br/>EVEN IF --<br/>   THEY SAID THEY WOULD COMPLY WITH THAT.<br/>THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID WE'LL --<br/>   WHY WOULD A POLITICIAN SAY SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T MEAN.<br/>   VOLUNTEER TO BE BOUND BY SOMETHING THAT IS NOT BINDING.<br/>   THAT'S THE THING, IT'S NOT BINDING.<br/>IF IT DOESN'T WORK, THEY CAN SAY, OKAY, YES, WE HAVE THIS ELEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR THIS IDEA.<br/>BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE NUTS AND BOLTS, WE, AS, YOU KNOW, THE EXECUTIVE, THE CABINET AROUND THE CABINET TABLE, WE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO HOLD THE PEN AND MAKE THE DECISION.<br/>   SO WE'VE GOT AN ABSENCE OF TOTAL CLARITY, I THINK THAT'S FAIR TO SAY.<br/>THE ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER ISSUED STATEMENTS CRITICIZING.<br/>WE ARE SEEING REPUBLICANS IN THE UNITED STATES CRITICIZING IT.<br/>ANTHONY HOUSEFATHER IS DECIDING WHETHER HE IS GOING TO LEAVE THE CAUCUS AND DO WHATEVER BECAUSE OF THIS.<br/>AND THE NDP ULTIMATELY WALKED AWAY FROM THE RECOGNITION OF THE PALESTINE STATE WHICH IS ONE OF THEIR RED LINES.<br/>NOBODY WON IN THIS.<br/>   I THINK THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT, DAVID.<br/>I THINK -- CHARELLE IS TALKING ABOUT HEADLINES, AND PEOPLE LOOKING FOR GOOD HEADLINES, YOU NEED WHOEVER YOUR DETECTIVE IS, COLOMBO OR JOHN REVUS TO FIND A GOOD HEADLINE HERE FOR ANYBODY FOR THE TWO PARTIES INVOLVED IN ANY OF THIS.<br/>AND AGAIN STEP BACK FROM ALL OF THAT AND ABOVE ALL OF THIS, WHAT GOOD HAS THIS DONE EITHER FOR THE ISRAELI COMMUNITY, IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN CANADA AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRO-PALESTINE.<br/>IT'S DONE NO GOOD.<br/>IT'S FURTHER CREATED DIVISION, CONFUSION, DISORIENTATION.<br/>SO WHEN YOU TRY AND MAKE FOREIGN POLICY DESPITE WHAT THE MINISTER MAY SAY ON THE FLY, THE DAY AFTER ST. PADDY'S DAY DAY IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, GOOD LUCK TO YOU.<br/>YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED PARTYING ON CRESCENT STREET AND DRINKING GUINNESS.<br/>YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A BETTER CHANCE OF SOMETHING SENSIBLE.<br/>UNFORTUNATELY, THE JOKING ASIDE.<br/>IT'S EMBARRASSING, RIGHT?<br/>ULTIMATELY THIS IS EMBARRASSING, BECAUSE THIS WAS ABOUT -- I DON'T KNOW HEATHER MCPHERSON, PEOPLE TELL ME SHE'S A WELL-INTENTIONED INDIVIDUAL.<br/>SO I WILL NOT SPEAK POORLY OF HER OR MELANIE JOLY.<br/>THEY PROBABLY WERE MEANING SOMETHING LEGITIMATE.<br/>BUT OTHER FORCES AT PLAY HERE ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT DOMESTIC POLITICAL CALCULATIONS AND THEY MADE A MESS OF THAT, TOO.<br/>   DAVID: THEY'RE BOTH SERIOUS PEOPLE.<br/>AND WHEN YOU ENGAGE WITH THEM, THEY SPEAK SERIOUSLY ON THINGS.<br/>BUT, BRAD, THE FACT THAT HERE WE ARE, WHAT, TWO, THREE DAYS AFTER THE WHOLE THING HAPPENED AND WE STILL CAN'T SAY WITH SPECIFICITY OF WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS ARE, AND HOW ROBUST THIS WILL ACTUALLY BE INTEGRATED INTO THE POLICY OF CANADA.<br/>THIS IS NOT SHENANIGANS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.<br/>IF THE FOREIGN MINISTER COMMITS TO THIS, WE'RE TALKING POLICY OF CANADA.<br/>ALSO WE KNOW THE CABINET WAS INVOLVED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS.<br/>THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE WAS INVOLVED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS.<br/>IT'S A SERIOUS DECLARATION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, WHETHER IT'S BINDING OR NOT.<br/>AND IT ISN'T AT ALL CLEAR TO CANADIANS AND THEIR ALLIES AND THEIR ENEMIES ON THIS, I SUPPOSE, OF WHAT EXACTLY IT MEANS.<br/>   WELL, YEAH, I THINK THAT THAT -- THAT THAT IS RIGHT.<br/>IT'S -- I MEAN, LISTEN, WE'VE SAID THIS ON THE PANEL MANY TIMES, THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE.<br/>YOU SAY ONE SENTENCE AND THERE'S A MILLION INFERENCES FOLLOWING IT STRAIGHT AFTERWARDS.<br/>WHAT I AM MOST CURIOUS ABOUT HERE IS WHY IS THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT USING AN OPPOSITION DAY MOTION TO BASICALLY LAUNCH ITS MOST RECENT STATEMENT ON THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST?<br/>ON THE CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST?<br/>BECAUSE WHEN YOU -- WHAT NORMALLY HAPPENS WITH OPPOSITION DAY MOTIONS IS THEY JUST FAIL.<br/>AND THE GOVERNMENTS AND THE OTHER OPPOSITION PARTIES -- SOMETIMES THEY VOTE FOR THEM.<br/>THE OPPOSITION PARTIES.<br/>MOST OF THE TIME, THEY JUST GET FAILED.<br/>AND THEY HAVE LEGITIMATE REASON TO SAY WE VOTED AGAINST IT BECAUSE IT WAS THAT PARTY'S OPPOSITION DAY, EVEN IF THERE WERE SOME ELEMENTS THAT YOU LIKED.<br/>VERY RARELY AT LEAST IN MY TEN YEARS ON THE HILL DID OPPOSITION DAY MOTIONS PASS WITH ANY GREAT REGULARITY.<br/>IT IS CURIOUS AS TO WHY THEY ARE WORKING SO HARD.<br/>IS IT BECAUSE THEY SENSE THE ISSUES IN THE MIDDLE EAST ARE SO POPULAR AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT -- THESE LIBERALS NEED TO GET ON THE RECORD IN SOME FASHION THEREIN OR WERE THEY NERVOUS THE NDP PUT IT FORWARD AND THEY VOTED AGAINST IT, FURTHER DIVISIONS IN THE CAUCUS, MORE SO THAN WE CURRENTLY SEE WITH THOSE LIBERALS WHO ARE OFFSIDE WITH THAT MOTION?<br/>IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE TO ME WHY THE LIBERALS WOULD HAVE GONE ALONG WITH THAT.<br/>WHAT IS THE VICTORY FOR THE NDP AND HEATHER MCPHERSON?<br/>I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THEY WOULD PROBABLY BELIEVE THEY HAVE CANADA -- THEY'VE GOT CANADA ON THE RECORD AGAIN REITERATING TWO-STATE SOLUTION.<br/>SEEKING CEASEFIRES AND CEASING NEW WEAPONS TO ISRAEL.<br/>IT'S THE FIRST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO TO SO.<br/>SO I THINK WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH THEM OR NOT, I THINK THEY'RE SAYING WE GOT AN OPPOSITION MOTION PASSED, AND WHILE IT WASN'T EVERYTHING, IT WAS A HECK LOT FURTHER THAN NORMAL NDP OPPOSITION DAY MOTIONS.<br/>I THINK THEY WOULD BE CLAIMING CREDIT FOR THAT TODAY.<br/>   DAVID: AND THAT IS A FAIR POINT.<br/>BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GO THROUGH IT CLAUSE BY CLAUSE IN ITS FINAL FORM -- AND JONATHAN IT KIND OF SUMMARIZES WHAT THIS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SAYING FOR MONTHS NOW.<br/>I MEAN, THEY VOTED FOR A CEASEFIRE AT THE U.N.<br/>MELANIE JOLY HAS REFERRED TO THE SETTLERS AS EXTREMISTS.<br/>THE ARMS EXPORTS WHILE NOT PUBLICLY STATED THERE WAS REPORTING BY DON IVESON, AND TONDA MCCHARLES, AND LOUIS BLOUIN THAT THEY WERE SLOW ROLLING ANY APPROVALS AND NOT LETTING ANYTHING GO.<br/>IT SORT OF CODIFYS WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN THERE.<br/>   THERE'S EVEN A SECTION OF FUNDING UNRWA WHICH WAS A TWO WEEKS AGO STORY.<br/>   YES.<br/>   AGAIN, YOU'RE RIGHT,<br/>IT REITERATES THE POSITION --<br/>   SO WHAT IS THE CALCULATION THEN?<br/>TO TIE YOURSELF SO COMPLETELY TO AN OPPOSITION DAY MOTION LIKE THIS.<br/>WHAT IS THE CALCULATION?<br/>IS IT THE CAUCUS WAS GOING TO VOTE ONE WAY AND CABINET ANOTHER OR WHAT?<br/>ANY IDEA.<br/>   IF YOU REMEMBER THIS MOTION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DEBATED TWO AND A HALF WEEKS AGO.<br/>IT WAS DUE FOR FRIDAY THE DAY AFTER BRIAN MULRONEY PASSED AWAY.<br/>AND THEREFORE THEY DIDN'T SIT THAT DAY.<br/>AND THEY PUSHED IT TO THIS PAST MONDAY.<br/>ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT TWO AND A HALF WEEKS AGO GOING INTO THIS MOTION THE NEXT MORNING, THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEIR POSITION WAS THEN?<br/>AND THEY GOT THE GIFT OF TWO AND A HALF EXTRA WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT.<br/>AND UNTIL 6:30 MONDAY NIGHT THEY STILL DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO VOTE DEPENDING ON WHAT AMENDMENTS THEY COULD POSSIBLY PUT IN.<br/>THERE'S A LOT -- YOU WONDER WHAT THE AIM WAS, THE OBJECTIVE WAS, IT'S UNCLEAR BECAUSE IT TOOK THEM THAT LONG TO EVEN COME UP WITH A POSITION.<br/>THEY WERE LOOKING LIKE THEY HAVE ON THIS CONFLICT FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS TO FIND A WAY TO MAYBE OFFEND THE LEAST AMOUNT OF PEOPLE POSSIBLE.<br/>AND AT THE END, THEY TEND TO OFFEND THE MOST AMOUNT OF PEOPLE POSSIBLE.<br/>THAT'S JUST BEEN THE RESULT.<br/>I DON'T THINK IT'S THEIR INTENTION.<br/>BUT THAT'S WHAT SEEMS TO HAPPEN EVERY TIME BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO SATISFY EVERYBODY.<br/>AND YES, THERE ARE DIVISIONS IN THE CAUCUS.<br/>AND YES, THAT'S A CHALLENGE.<br/>I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS SOME MAGIC WAND THEY CAN -- THEY ALL SING KUMBAYA TOGETHER.<br/>BUT IF THIS HAD GONE THE OTHER WAY, AMENDMENTS HADN'T PASSED, PROBABLY CABINET VOTES AGAINST THIS.<br/>THIS MOTION DOES NOT CARRY.<br/>IT'S A FREE VOTE IN THE CAUCUS.<br/>AND WHAT, SO THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED YES TO THIS UNAMENDED MOTION, WOULD THEY BE THREATENING TO LEAVE CAUCUS BECAUSE THEY WERE OFFENDED BY THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT WENT?<br/>BY NOT DECIDING THIS TWO AND A HALF WEEKS AGO, THEY ALLOWED THIS TO LINGER.<br/>THEY ALLOWED MORE INFIGHTING.<br/>YES, PEOPLE WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO TRY TO GET THEM TO CHANGE THEIR MIND BUT THEY WOULD HAVE SAID THIS IS OUR POSITION AND ALL OF THE LOBBYING THAT WENT ON -- EVERYBODY CALLING AND EMAILING IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EMAILS THAT WERE MADE, LIKE, AT THE END OF THE DAY, IF THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND A WAY THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE LEAST OFFENSIVE, LIKE, IT'S VERY HARD TO RUN FOREIGN POLICY WHERE THAT'S YOUR OBJECTIVE.<br/>   DAVID: BUT, I WONDER, CHARELLE, AND WE GOT TO GO QUICK, IF JUST GETTING THE IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION OF PALESTINE OUT, WHAT WAS THE OBJECTIVE?<br/>THE WHOLE THING IS REWRITTEN.<br/>IT IS LARGELY A LIBERAL MOTION NOW AT LEAST LANGUAGE NEGOTIATED BY THE LIBERALS.<br/>I MEAN, WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF WHY THEY CHOSE TO GO THIS WAY?<br/>   I MEAN, THE ONLY THING I COULD REALLY THINK OF IS IT COMES DOWN TO THE DOMESTIC CALCULUS.<br/>IF YOU HAVE THE MOTION AS WRITTEN UNAMENDED, YOU FURTHER CEMENT THOSE LINES THAT ARE DRAWN IN THE SAND, HAVE THOSE DIVISIONS IN CAUCUS, AND EVERYBODY CAN REALLY SEE CLEARLY WHERE THE LINES ARE.<br/>THE VOICES WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AS VOCAL SO FAR MAY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO MAKE THEMSELVES VOCAL.<br/>AND AT THAT POINT, MAYBE THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A LITTLE BIT OF PROTECTION WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THAT POLITICAL BLOW BACK.<br/>   DAVID: TIM, WHAT DO YOU THINK ANTHONY HOUSEFATHER IS GOING TO DO?<br/>   JON AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT OUTSIDE.<br/>I DON'T KNOW.<br/>HE ACTUALLY SEEMS TO BE A VERY LEGITIMATE, THOUGHTFUL, AUTHENTIC GUY, PERSON.<br/>AND I THINK THIS FOR HIM WAS A LINE KIND OF VOTE.<br/>WAS A LINE CROSSED OR NOT CROSSED?<br/>SO HE'S PROBABLY CONTEMPLATING THAT.<br/>I THINK HE WILL TAKE HIS TIME TO CONTEMPLATE.<br/>HE HAS A LONG PROUD HISTORY IN THE LIBERAL PARTY.<br/>THAT'S A TOUGH DECISION TO MAKE IF YOU'RE GOING TO STEP OFF BECAUSE IF HE INTENDS TO RUN AGAIN, WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO?<br/>IS HE WEAR A LIBERAL JERSEY?<br/>IS HE GOING TO WEAR ANOTHER JERSEY?<br/>THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS FOR HIM TO THINK ABOUT.<br/>I THINK HE'LL TAKE HIS TIME.<br/>   I THINK YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.<br/>MY WHOLE ISSUE WITH THIS, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH ARMS AND ABSOLUTE CLARITY.<br/>   GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.<br/>   DAVID: IN WRITTEN FORM PREFERABLY IF THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA IS WATCHING.<br/>ALL RIGHT, THERE'S -- NO ROOM FOR MISUNDERSTANDING THIS.<br/>CONSERVATIVES WANT AN ELECTION AND THEY WANT IT OVER THE CARBON TAX HIKE.<br/>THE POWER PANEL ON WHO WILL WIN THAT BATTLE OVER POLLUTION PRICING.<br/>THAT'S NEXT.<br/>   DAVID: THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION WANTS TO GO TO VOTERS OVER THE CARBON TAX.<br/>PIERRE POILIEVRE TOLD HIS CAUCUS THIS MORNING THAT HE WILL FORCE A VOTE ON A NONCONFIDENCE MOTION IN THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT OVER THE CARBON TAX.<br/>THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW.<br/>PROMPTING THIS EXCHANGE IN QUESTION PERIOD.<br/>   EVERY SINGLE PROVINCE IN WHICH THIS TAX APPLIES THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES PAY VASTLY MORE THAN THEY GET BACK.<br/>WHY DON'T WE JUST END THE DEBATE AND LET CANADIANS DECIDE AND HAVE A CARBON TAX ELECTION?<br/>   RT. HON. JUSTIN TRUDEAU: WE ARE BUSY DELIVERING FOR CANADIANS A PRICE ON POLLUTION THAT PUTS MORE MONEY IN THE POCKETS 8 OUT OF 10 FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.<br/>AND AN ELECTION ON THE PRICE ON POLLUTION?<br/>WE HAD THREE, MR. SPEAKER.<br/>AND WE WON THEM ALL.<br/>   THEN HE SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO HAVE ONE MORE.<br/>   DAVID: OKAY.<br/>IT'S NOT A NEW THREAT.<br/>BUT IT KEEPS GETTING REPEATED.<br/>WHAT SHOULD CANADIANS MAKE OF THIS?<br/>WHO IS GOING TO WIN THIS BATTLE OF POLITICAL OPTICS OVER THE CARBON TAX?<br/>THE POWER PANEL IS BACK ON THAT.<br/>JONATHAN KALLES, BRAD LAVIGNE, CHARELLE EVELYN, AND TIM POWERS.<br/>SO, TIM, CONSERVATIVES WANT --<br/>   THE ELECTION IS COMING.<br/>   THERE YOU GO.<br/>I THINK EVEN KEN MCDONALD WILL VOTE WITH THE LIBERALS ON A NONCONFIDENCE MOTION.<br/>EAGERNESS TO JUST HAVE AN ELECTION OVER CARBON PRICING, MUST MEAN ONE THING, THAT THE CONSERVATIVE CLIMATE PLAN IS READY TO GO AND TO BE PUT BEFORE THE COUNTRY, RIGHT?<br/>WHAT WE SHOULD INTERPRET THIS?<br/>   AT ANY MOMENT.<br/>I'M SURE IT WILL BE COMING OUT TOMORROW.<br/>THIS IS A PINIATA THAT POILIEVRE LOVES TO WHACK AND WHACK IT WELL HE HAS, AND IT'S STILL SEEING TO BE PLENTY FULL OF CANDIES THAT THE LIBERALS PUT IN TO HIT.<br/>BUT WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING HERE, OF COURSE, WE HAVE ONE WEEK OF PARLIAMENT AND THEN WE HAVE A TWO-WEEK EASTER BREAK.<br/>A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CELEBRATE EASTER OR WHO CELEBRATE THAT WEEKEND IN WHATEVER FASHION THEY DO ARE GOING TO BE GATHERING WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR FRIENDS, AND APRIL 1ST COMES THE DAY AFTER, ON EASTER MONDAY.<br/>THIS IS ALL ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT AND REMEMBER THAT THERE IS A PRICE INCREASE COMING WITH THE CLIMATE PLAN, THAT IT'S GOING TO AFFECT YOU, AND GUESS WHAT, THERE'S A GUY WHO IS GOING TO SOLVE IT.<br/>THERE'S NO WAY THE MOTION IS GOING TO BE DEFEATED UNLESS WE HAVE THAT CRAZY KABUKI THEATER OF THE NDP AND THE LIBERALS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE THAT NIGHT.<br/>AND THEN MAYBE THERE'S AN ELECTION.<br/>   THEY'LL MAKE AN AMENDMENT.<br/>   IT'S A FUNDRAISING PLAY.<br/>BUT IT'S A PLAY TO GET PEOPLE  TALKING ABOUT IT WHEN THE FAMILY GATHER IN TWO WEEKS.<br/>   TWO THINGS ON THIS.<br/>AND I JOKE IT MUST MEAN THE PLAN IS READY TO GO.<br/>THE TAX WILL GO UP.<br/>THE REBATE WILL GO UP.<br/>TEMPERATURES HAVE GONE UP.<br/>THE HOTTEST WINTER IN CANADIAN HISTORY.<br/>THEY'RE ALREADY CONSERVING WATER IN ALBERTA BECAUSE OF DROUGHTS AND WILDFIRES THAT ARE STILL BURNING FROM LAST YEAR THAT THE WINTER COULDN'T PUT OUT.<br/>SO, YOU KNOW, THERE IS THE GAMESMANSHIP OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.<br/>BUT EVERY SCIENTIST AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION SAYS THIS IS A CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND, LIKE, OKAY, YOU DON'T LIKE THE CARBON TAX AS YOU CALL IT, WHAT IS THE PLAN NEEDS TO BE THE CONVERSATION, I THINK.<br/>THAT'S THE TABLE STAKES NOW.<br/>THEY RAN ON SOMETHING LAST TIME.<br/>WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WILL DO THIS TIME SHOULD THEY RUN.<br/>   LAST TIME THEY RAN ON A CARBON PRICE.<br/>   MULTIPLE TIMES, BUT NOT NOW.<br/>   OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE UNDER THE POILIEVRE LEADERSHIP.<br/>YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'VE BEEN IN A CLIMATE EMERGENCY FOR QUITE SOME TIME.<br/>THE DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING THE WEIGHT OF THE COST OF LIVING AND THAT HAS SOMEHOW COUNTERBALANCING OR OUTWEIGHING THE FEELING OF ANY SORT OF IMMEDIACY OF NEEDING DO SOMETHING, BUT RATHER NEEDING TO DO SOMETHING BUT AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T COST THEM ANYTHING.<br/>THAT'S WHERE WE SEE THE CONSERVATIVES REALLY THRIVING SAYING WE WILL FIX IT.<br/>WE'LL DO SOMETHING, WE DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT IT IS, BUT WHAT MATTERS IS RIGHT NOW, THERE IS MONEY COMING OUT OF YOUR POCKET, AND LIBERALS SAY THERE IS MONEY GOING INTO THEIR POCKET, AND THAT IS MONEY GOING INTO YOUR POCKET A COUPLE WEEKS AFTER THE PRICE GOES UP.<br/>THERE'S A TENSION AND THE -- I THINK THE REASON THE CONSERVATIVES ARE KIND OF WINNING THAT GAME OF PUBLIC OPINION IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE ECONOMY ON THEIR SIDE.<br/>THEY HAVE -- OR, YOU KNOW, IF NOT THE ECONOMY, THEN THE PRICES, INFLATION IS STILL A THING, AND PRICES AREN'T GOING TO BE DROPPING EVEN THOUGH INFLATION IS SLOWING.<br/>PEOPLE ARE STILL FEELING THE PINCH.<br/>MORTGAGES ARE STILL COMING UP FOR RENEWAL.<br/>INTEREST RATES ARE STILL HIGH.<br/>ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE FEEDING INTO THE FACT THAT THEY CAN SAY, OKAY, YES, THE CLIMATE MIGHT BE AN ISSUE.<br/>IF WE DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT IT THAT MUCH, THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE THE MORE IMPORTANT THING IS YOUR BANK BALANCED AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO LIVE DAY TO DAY IN TERMS OF GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE AND PUTTING GAS IN THE CAR.<br/>   DAVID: JONATHAN, THERE'S NO CARBON PRICE ON YOUR MORTGAGE.<br/>THERE'S NO CARBON PRICE ON THE RENT.<br/>IT IS NOT MAKING THE BIGGEST THINGS GO DOWN GO AWAY.<br/>FOOD INFLATION HAS GONE DOWN.<br/>EVEN WITH THE CARBON PRICE IN PLACE, AND GALEN WESTON IS STILL RUNNING LOBLAWS DESPITE WHAT THE NDP WILL TELL YOU.<br/>IT'S A MORE COMPLICATED ISSUE THAN THAT, RIGHT.<br/>AND WHILE YOU MIGHT NOT NEED TO ROLL IT OUT FOR POLITICAL REASONS UNTIL THE ELECTION, THERE ARE TARGETS THIS COUNTRY HAS COMMITTED TO FOR 2030 AND PLANS TAKE TIMES TO BE ASSESSED AND IMPLEMENTED.<br/>SO I MEAN DOESN'T THE CONVERSATION HAVE TO MOVE PAST THE TACTICS, THE STRATEGY, AND THE OPTICS OF THIS WHOLE THING IN PARLIAMENT?<br/>NOT JUST ON SHOWS LIKE THIS.<br/>   WELL, DEFINITELY NOT IN PARLIAMENT, HOW SELDOM DO WE SEE SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS THERE WHERE WE SOLVE WORLD AFFAIRS LET ALONE DOMESTIC ONES.<br/>YOU MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.<br/>EVERYTHING YOU SAID I AGREE WITH.<br/>   DAVID: THAT'S ALL I WANTED.<br/>   THE SHOW'S OVER.<br/>   DAVID: THANK YOU FOR WATCHING, EVERYBODY.<br/>   THE PROBLEM IS YOU SAID -- AND WE HEARD IT FOR MONTHS.<br/>THE CARBON TAX, THE PRICE ON POLLUTION WAS A GREAT IDEA, THEY'VE JUST SOLD IT POORLY.<br/>OR THAT IT'S A COMMUNICATION PROBLEM.<br/>YES, THERE IS SOME TRUTH TO IT IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MONEY PEOPLE GET BACK AND HOW OF THE NARRATIVE HAS CHANGED.<br/>AND PIERRE POILIEVRE IS JUST VERY GOOD AT THE ONE LINERS, AND HE IS TAXING THE TAX AND STRIKING THE HIKE, I THINK, IS HIS NEW ONE.<br/>THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION TO ANYTHING.<br/>BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU TALK ABOUT HOW SERIOUS THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS AND HOW, YOU KNOW, FOREST FIRES FROM LAST YEAR ARE STILL GOING.<br/>BUT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE HAVE TRANSLATED THAT INTO HOW IT IMPACTS THEIR LIFE UNLESS THEY ARE LITERALLY LIVING IN THE LINE OF SIGHT OF THE FIRE.<br/>DOES IT AFFECT MY POCKETBOOK?<br/>DOES IT -- DO I NOTICE THE CHANGE IN MY LIFE BECAUSE IT'S WARMER?<br/>WELL, YOU KNOW, I SAVED MONEY ON HEATING BECAUSE IT WASN'T SO COLD THIS WINTER.<br/>LIKE -- SO PEOPLE -- ONE OF THE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO IS EXPLAIN THAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS HAS A MASSIVE COST.<br/>BUT IT CAN'T BE IN THE HUNDRED MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.<br/>NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS.<br/>THE TARGETS FOR COP 20 -- WHATEVER NUMBER WE'RE AT.<br/>THAT DOESN'T IMPACT MY LIFE.<br/>THE CONSERVATIVES SAY YOU ARE UPSET ABOUT THE THINGS THAT COST YOU MONEY.<br/>IN WHAT THE LIBERALS ARE TRYING TO DO.<br/>BUT I THINK THEY'RE SLOWLY GETTING THERE IS IF YOU DON'T DO THESE THINGS, IT'S GOING TO COST YOU MONEY.<br/>IT'S GOING TO IMPACT YOUR LIFE.<br/>WE CANNOT CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH, FINANCIALLY, YOUR LIVELIHOOD, YOUR LIFE WILL BE IMPACTED, FLOODS, WHERE YOU LIVE, FIRES.<br/>I LIVE IN MONTREAL, THERE ARE NO FOREST FIRES AND LAST SUMMER AND SPRING AND THE FOREST FIRES IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, AND THE SMOKE WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE STATES.<br/>IT HAS AN IMPACT.<br/>WE'RE STARTING TO FEEL IT.<br/>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO MY LIFE.<br/>HOW IS THIS IMPACTING ME?<br/>HOW DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?<br/>HOW IS IT THE RIGHT THING?<br/>   DAVID: BRAD, THE SKEPTICS, PUSH BACK, AND SAYING NONE OF THE CLIMATE ACTION STOPPED WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.<br/>WAIT 20 YEARS WITHOUT ACTION AND SEE HOW BAD THE FOREST FIRES ARE.<br/>THERE AN EDITORIAL IN THE GLOBE AND MAIL ON THIS SAYING THE FEDS HAVE MESSED IT UP WITH THE COMMUNICATION AND THE OIL CARVE-OUT BECAUSE THEY UNDERMINED THEIR POLICY.<br/>THEIR WORDS, NOT MINE.<br/>THEY SAY THE OPPOSITION IS MISREPRESENTING THE POLICY, AND THE PREMIERS ARE EXPLOITING A POLITICAL MOMENT TO DISTRACT FROM COST OF LIVING ISSUES THEY HAVE NO CAPACITY OR NO DESIRE TO DEAL WITH IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS, YOU SAY WELL, WE'LL GIVE UP THE EXCISE TAX AND GAS TAX AT VOLUME TO HELP PEOPLE.<br/>HOW DO YOU HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PLANET WHEN YOU'RE A COUNTRY THAT EMITS A HIGH RATE PER CAPITA WHEN ALL ANYONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW DEVASTATING 3 CENTS A LITRE ON A PRICE OF GAS IS GOING TO BE WHEN SOME OF THAT IS ALREADY REBATED?<br/>   RIGHT.<br/>AND I THINK THAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS CAN BE TRUE AT THE SAME TIME.<br/>I DON'T THINK IT HAS TO BE ONE OR THE OTHER.<br/>I THINK THAT -- WHERE -- I THINK WHERE THE LIBERALS -- IT'S NOT ABOUT -- ARE THE CONSERVATIVES WINNING?<br/>I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT, WELL, THEY'RE WINNING THE DEBATE.<br/>I THINK IT'S MOSTLY DUE -- THE BENEFIT IS THE FAILURE OF THE LIBERALS.<br/>IT'S NOT -- LOOK, I HAVE USED THIS BEFORE ON THE SHOW.<br/>TALKING ABOUT THEY ARE HORRIBLE COMMUNICATORS WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE BIG TICKETS.<br/>IT'S VERY COMPLICATED.<br/>THEIR PLAN IS VERY COMPLICATED.<br/>THE NOTION OF A REBATE.<br/>THEN THE NOTION -- YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO SAY I PAY A CARBON PRICE ON CERTAIN ITEMS I BUY AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES ME BACK MORE MONEY AND SOME REASON THIS IS SAVING THE PLANET.<br/>WHERE THEY HAVE GONE WRONG, AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE HOME HEATING AND THE CARVE-OUT.<br/>THE MINUTE THEY DID THE CARVE-OUT, THE WHOLE THING WAS DONE.<br/>NOW LIBERALS AT THE PROVINCIAL LEVEL SAYING THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN BRINGING THEM IN.<br/>WE HAVE NDP, ALBERTA NDP CANDIDATES FOR LEADER TO REPLACE RACHEL NOTLEY, THEY ARE COMING OUT AGAINST THIS.<br/>THIS IS ON THE PERSONAL SIDE.<br/>THERE IS AN INDUSTRIAL CARBON PRICE, AND EVEN CONSERVATIVES BY AND LARGE ARE IN FAVOR OF MAINTAINING THOSE THINGS.<br/>JUST TALKING ABOUT THE CONSUMER PRICE.<br/>BUT THE LIBERALS HAVE FAILED TO TELL US, ARE WE HITTING OUR TARGETS?<br/>IS CANADA ON THE PATH TO HITTING THEIR TARGETS?<br/>AND CAN YOU RUN A THREAD BETWEEN THOSE TARGETS BEING ACHIEVED AND WHAT WE'RE DOING WITHIN OUR PRICING OF CARBON MECHANISM?<br/>IS THERE A DIRECT CORRELATION?<br/>I DO THINK CANADIANS DO WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE EFFORT BECAUSE OF EXTREME WEATHER.<br/>I DO AGREE THAT THINGS WILL COST MORE LATER IF WE DON'T DO THIS.<br/>   DAVID: IF YOU LOOK AT THE REPORT CARD, AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE CLIMATE INSTITUTE PUTS OUT ENVIRONMENT COMMISSIONER PUSS OUT, AND CANADA IS ON TRACK TO HIT THE 2026 INTERIM TARGET AND WITHIN 4 AND 5 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF HITTING THE 2030 TARGETS.<br/>THEY ARE SHOWING PROGRESS.<br/>YOU KNOW, BUT IT STILL NEEDS A BIT MORE TWEAKING.<br/>   WHY ISN'T THE PRIME MINISTER -- YOU JUST PLAYED THE CLIP OF BREATHLESS QUESTION PERIOD RESPONSE.<br/>WHY ISN'T THE PRIME MINISTER AND GUILBAULT THE ENVIRONMENT MINISTER -- THE FRONT BENCH OF THIS GOVERNMENT SINGING THAT FROM THE ROOFTOPS THAT WE ARE ON TRACK TO MEET OUR TARGETS BY AND LARGE.<br/>THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY FOR ME TO SAYING IF I'M IN THE LOWER MAINLAND AND I'M PAYING $2 A LITRE OF GASOLINE, THIS IS GOING TO BE THE WORST SUMMER, BY THE WAY, IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, THE MINISTER IN CHARGE OF WATER, IT'S JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE THE WORST FOREST FIRE SEASON ON RECORD IN BRITISH COLUMBIA.<br/>SO WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING VERY INTENSE CONVERSATIONS NOT ONLY ABOUT CARBON PRICING BUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT WHAT TOOLS ARE EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING THAT.<br/>BECAUSE I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF CANADIANS WANT TO SEE IT EFFECTIVE.<br/>BUT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT -- I DON'T THINK THAT THE MAJORITY ARE SEEING IT AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL AND THAT'S WHY TWO-THIRDS OF ALL CANADIANS BELIEVE THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN THE CONSUMER CARBON PRICING.<br/>   DAVID: LOOK, TIM, MAYBE THERE ARE WAYS TO DO IT BEYOND THE CONSUMER CARBON PRICING.<br/>CAP AND TRADE IN QUEBEC, FOR EXAMPLE.<br/>THEY DON'T HAVE THE CONSUMER PRICING.<br/>THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO AND BRAD THINKS INDUSTRIAL CARBON PRICING WOULD SURVIVE AND, MY COLLEAGUE ASKED PIERRE POILIEVRE THAT QUESTION AND HE DIDN'T ANSWER IT.<br/>I HAVE NO IDEA IF INDUSTRIAL CARBON PRICING WILL SURVIVE, IF HE PUSHES IT ALL DOWN TO THE PROVINCE.<br/>   IN THAT CASE, THE ARGUMENT OF THE MARKETS WANT PREDICTABLE.<br/>   THEY SURE DO.<br/>   FILL THE GAP HERE QUICKLY, THE MESSAGING, YES, JONATHAN IS RIGHT TO POINT OUT THE CHALLENGE.<br/>IT'S THE MESSENGER.<br/>WHERE IS THE COURAGEOUS CLIMATE MESSENGER WITH THE COURAGEOUS CAMPAIGN THAT PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT.<br/>YESTERDAY THE PRIME MINISTER STEPPED IN A PLACE MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE GONE TO A LONG TIME AGO, I'M NOT AFRAID TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS.<br/>THE CHALLENGE IS THE GOVERNMENT HAS HAD AN ALL MESSAGE TRACK, AND NERVE MIND THE CARVE-OUT, LECTURED PEOPLE, AND TRIED TO INDUCE PEOPLE, AND NOW TRYING TO BUY PEOPLE WITH REBATES.<br/>NOBODY WHO HAS CREDIBILITY IS OUT THERE MAKING THE CASE FOR THIS.<br/>LIKE THE LATE PRIME MINISTER MR. MULRONEY, FREE TRADE UNPOPULAR.<br/>UNPOPULAR IN THE DAY.<br/>AND HE MADE THE CASE IN A TIME IT WAS NOT POPULAR.<br/>HE STUCK TO IT.<br/>IF WE WANT TO HAVE A REAL DEBATE ABOUT THIS, SOMEBODY HAS TO EMERGE TO MAKE THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN LOSE IN THE SHORT TERM BUT WHAT YOU CAN GAIN IN THE LONG TERM WITH SACRIFICE.<br/>WE'VE SEEN IN CANADA IN DIFFERENT TIMES THESE THINGS WORK.<br/>BE IT FREE TRADE, BE IT THE DEFICIT WITH MR. CHRETIEN AND MR.

The same was true for June.</p><p>Most Brazilian blazes are manmade, often started illegally by land-grabbers clearing forest for cattle or crops. Fires tend to begin increasing in June and peak in September, according to historical data. They can easily get out of control during the dry season, burning large swaths of forest to the ground.</p><p>Brazil is home to the world\u2019s largest rainforest and tropical wetlands \u2014 the Amazon and Pantanal \u2014 which saw dramatic fires in 2019 and 2020, respectively, that caused the greatest annual forest loss since 2015. That drew global criticism of the response from the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly called for development of the region. </p><p>This year, it\u2019s the Cerrado savanna stretching across Brazil\u2019s center-west region that is suffering more than usual. An area almost as big as Connecticut and New Jersey burned there in the first seven months of 2021.</p><p>Ane Alencar, science director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, said in a July 27 online panel that there have been fewer Amazon fires this year due to cool weather, which limits fire's potential to spread. But deforestation remains on par with the last two years, so much dry material remains on the ground waiting to be burned, she added.</p><p>\u201cI am afraid about the coming months,\u201d said Alencar, who is also coordinator of MapBiomas Fogo, which compiles data on deforestation and fires across the region. \u201cWhen this cold front goes away, the vegetation will be drier and then we will have warmer temperatures. ... I\u2019m not sure that the people who cut down the forest will not light it.\u201d</p><p>Citing heightened hazard due to Brazil\u2019s worst drought in nine decades, the Justice and Environment ministries on July 22 announced a task force to prevent and investigate fires in 11 states of the Amazon, Pantanal and Cerrado biomes. Some 6,000 people, including federal and state police and firefighters, as well as state public security and environmental officials will participate in the effort, according to a statement. </p><p>On June 29, Bolsonaro decreed redeployment of soldiers to the Amazon to combat fires and deforestation, and also issued a 120-day ban on unauthorized outdoor fires. </p><p>Similar measures in previous years didn't prevent illegal fires, however. More than 90% of the Pantanal hot spots detected in 2020 came after a similar presidential ban, according to Vin\u00edcius Silgueiro, coordinator of territorial intelligence at the Center of Life Institute in Mato Grosso state. </p><p>\u201cThe sense of impunity is very high. Enforcement is well below what is necessary,\u201d Silgueiro said.</p><p>In Mato Grosso state, half of whose territory is in the Amazon, the federal and state governments last year began coordinating actions to put an end to overlap that frequently left other areas unmanned and vulnerable, according to Mauren Lazzaretti, the state's environment secretary.</p><p>The state is also purchasing a helicopter and plans to deploy dozens of planes loaned by Pantanal farmers and businesses to drop fire retardant onto blazes.</p><p>Last year, over 4 million hectares (about 15,000 square miles) of the Pantanal went up in flames, or about 27% its area \u2014 by far the most since official record-keeping began in 2003. While the biome regenerates quickly, unlike rainforest, fires often kill local wildlife, such as jaguars, caimans and giant otters.</p><p>\u201cThe size of the fires last year drew society's attention to the component of individual responsibility,\u201d Lazzaretti said. \u201cThe engagement of cities, farmers and even traditional and Indigenous communities is much greater this year.\u201d </p><p>The year before, fires in the Amazon roused global concern, and several European governments openly criticized Bolsonaro\u2019s administration. Bolsonaro countered that fires nationwide and in the Amazon, while up from 2018, were roughly in line with the average of the preceding several years and were down sharply from 15 years earlier. He called on European leaders to mind their own backyards. </p><p>Earlier studies showed the Amazon absorbs about 2 billion of the 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide the world emits into the atmosphere each year, making it an important part of the global effort to curb climate change. But a study led by the Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation,  published in Nature on July 14 \u2014  spanning 10 years and involving nearly 600 flyovers \u2014 found the dry season's intensification and increased deforestation had caused more fires and higher carbon emissions. The southeastern part of the Amazon, particularly ravaged by logging, has become a net source of carbon. </p><p>Paulo Artaxo, professor of environmental physics at the University of Sao Paulo and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said other recent studies have shown even the more preserved western Amazon region is now carbon neutral in terms of emissions, while a few years ago, it was a carbon sink.</p><p>Carlos Nobre, a prominent climatologist, says Brazil\u2019s Amazon is nearing a \u201ctipping point,\" after which the thick jungle will cease to generate enough moisture to sustain its current form and will begin transforming into tropical savanna.</p><p>Nobre said Bolsonaro's government has yet to demonstrate any encouraging change in approach to help save the rainforest.</p><p>The federal government \u201ccontinues incentivizing organized crime in the Amazon that is responsible for the theft of timber, illegal deforestation and fires,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who practice these crimes haven't given any sign of worry that enforcement will become rigorous. They continue to feel rather empowered.\u201d ___ \u00c1lvares is based in Brasilia.

Forward-looking statements in this news release include: ALX's 2023 joint venture exploration plans at the Hydra Lithium Project, and ALX's ability to continue to expend funds at that project. It is important to note that the Company's actual business outcomes and exploration results could differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include that ALX may not be able to fully finance exploration on our exploration projects, including drilling; our initial findings at our exploration projects may prove to be unworthy of further expenditures; commodity prices may not support further exploration expenditures; exploration programs may be delayed or changed due to any delays experienced in consultation and engagement activities with First Nations communities and local landowners in the region, and the results of such consultations; and economic, competitive, governmental, societal, public health, weather, environmental and technological factors may affect the Company's operations, markets, products and share price. Even if we explore and develop our projects, and even if lithium, uranium, nickel, copper, gold or other metals or minerals are discovered in quantity, ALX's projects may not be commercially viable. Additional risk factors are discussed in the Company's Management Discussion and Analysis for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023, which is available under the Company's SEDAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>.

Risks and uncertainties include that ALX may not be able to fully finance exploration on our exploration projects, including drilling; our initial findings at our exploration projects may prove to be unworthy of further expenditures; commodity prices may not support further exploration expenditures; exploration programs may be delayed or changed due to any delays experienced in consultation and engagement activities with First Nations communities and local landowners in the region, and the results of such consultations; and economic, competitive, governmental, societal, public health, weather, environmental and technological factors may affect the Company's operations, markets, products and share price. Even if we explore and develop our projects, and even if lithium, uranium, nickel, copper, gold or other metals or minerals are discovered in quantity, ALX's projects may not be commercially viable. Additional risk factors are discussed in the Company's Management Discussion and Analysis for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023, which is available under the Company's SEDAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/ZAnvEIOXEO\">www.sedar.com</url> .

APPROACH TO BOTH REMIND AMERICAN DECISION MAKERS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND SOMETIMES EVEN MAKE THEM AWARE OF IT.<br/>SO I THINK WHEN GOVERNMENTS DO THINGS WELL, THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING.<br/>AND I THINK IN THIS CASE, THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING.<br/>THEY'RE TALKING TO A WIDE VARIETY OF DECISION MAKERS TO SENATORS TO REPRESENTATIVES TO BUSINESS TO UNION TO LABOR INDUSTRY AND REALLY TRYING TO FIND BOTH COMMON GROUND BUT ALSO REMINDING THEM OF THE MILLIONS OF JOBS, THE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP, THE TRADE RELATIONSHIP.<br/>ALL OF THE THINGS BEING A KEY CAMPAIGN NARRATIVE AS WE HEAD INTO WHAT COULD BE A NEW PRESIDENCY AND CERTAINLY WHAT WILL BE -- YOU KNOW, NEW NEGOTIATIONS AROUND CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TRADE AGREEMENTS.<br/>SO AGAIN I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I THINK THAT THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT MARKET DOING IT.<br/>   KATE, THEY'RE MEETING WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE STATE LEVEL.<br/>IT'S EASY FOR THE TRUDEAU GOVERNMENT TO GET MEETINGS WITH THE BIDEN GOVERNMENT.<br/>I THINK THAT'S FAIR TO SAY.<br/>THEY'RE DEALING WITH A LOT OF CORPORATE LEADERSHIP AND WITH COMPANIES.<br/>I'M NOT HEARING ABOUT THEM MEETING WITH TRUMP PEOPLE.<br/>THAT SEEMS TO BE A CHALLENGE.<br/>   YEAH, AND THEY ARE MEETING WITH SOME REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS BUT NOT NECESSARILY THOSE THAT ARE IN THE TRUMP --<br/>   THE TRUMPIEST.<br/>   AND THE TRUMP INFLUENCE.<br/>WHAT WILL STUNT THIS EFFORT IN TERMS OF BEING EFFECTIVE AND AUTHENTIC IS THAT IN PARALLEL TO THIS EFFORT WE ALSO HAVE THE LIBERAL PARTY RUNNING ADS COMPARING PIERRE POILIEVRE TO TRUMP DONALD TRUMP.<br/>HOW SINCERE CAN WE TAKE THE LIBERALS AT FACE VALUE THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE THE RELATIONSHIP WORK WHEN THEY HAVE A VESTED INFLUENCE TO PAINT DONALD TRUMP AS A NEGATIVE CHARACTER, AND SOMETHING TO BE FEARED IN A CANADIAN DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONTEXT.<br/>NOT SAYING IT'S WITHOUT WARRANT.<br/>BUT THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY IS UPHEAVAL IN THE STATUS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.<br/>AND THIS IS MORE OF A P.R. OFFENSIVE RATHER THAN NECESSARYIVE UNDERSTANDING HOW TRUMP ADMINISTRATION APPROACH GOVERNING SHOULD THEY BE SUCCESSFUL IN NOVEMBER?<br/>   DAVID: FRANCOISE, WHAT ABOUT THAT, REMINDING THE BORDER STATES, AND THE KEY STATES OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP, OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, AND SOMETHING THAT WORKED DURING THE NAFTA NEGOTIATIONS LAST TIME.<br/>IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF TRUMP POTENTIALLY SHOULD HE WIN THIS TIME.<br/>DO THEY NEED TO START MAKING BIG INROADS INTO HIS ORBIT, AND IS THAT POSSIBLE THE PAST RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIM AND TRUDEAU.<br/>   I THINK THAT THE END OF YOUR QUESTION -- IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE.<br/>I THINK THE LIBERALS ARE NOT STUPID.<br/>THEY REALIZE, ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF WHAT KATE WAS JUST SAYING, COMPARING POILIEVRE TO DONALD TRUMP, IT MEANS WHAT IT MEANS.<br/>SO THEN THEY CAN TURN AROUND AND GO TO TRUMP, IF TRUMP WOULD BE ELECTED PRESIDENT NEXT NOVEMBER, AND HEY, WE ACTUALLY LOVE YOU.<br/>WE REALLY THINK YOU'RE A GREAT GUY.<br/>WE WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.<br/>I THINK IT IS A GAMBLE THEY TAKE.<br/>IT'S AN ALL-IN MOMENT, AND IT CAN PAY BIG TIME OR IT CAN LOSE BIG TIME.<br/>I THINK WE HAVE TO AGREE THAT TRUMP NUMBER 2 IN THE WHITE HOUSE WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE NICER THAN TRUMP NUMBER 1.<br/>HE SAID SO HIMSELF.<br/>I JUST TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD.<br/>AS IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO.<br/>SO BASICALLY I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO DO THAT VISIT, THAT TEAM CANADA VISIT -- NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE TRUMP GANG.<br/>BUT FOR THE BIDEN GANG.<br/>BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEM TO FORGET THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS ALSO KIND OF PROTECTIONIST.<br/>SO THEY HAVE TO SECURE THEIR VIEW, AND REMIND -- ALWAYS BREAKS MY HEART AS A CANADIAN, TO REALIZE THAT IN 2024 WE STILL HAVE TO REMIND THEM THAT WE ARE THEIR CLOSEST ECONOMIC ALLY, THAT THERE'S 2 POINT SOME BILLION EVERY DAY IN ECONOMY THAT CIRCULATES BETWEEN OUR BORDERS.<br/>SO BE IT.<br/>THAT IS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AMERICANS.<br/>   EMILIE, BIDEN MAY BE A BIT PROTECTIONIST.<br/>BUT TRUMP IS MAYBE A BIT OF AN ARSONIST WHEN IT COMES TO MULTILATERAL AND GLOBAL DEALS AND CROSSBORDER RELATIONSHIPS.<br/>GIVEN THAT AND GIVEN SOME OF THE LINGERING BAD BLOOD BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL DYNAMICS THERE WITH THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT, I MEAN, DO YOU TRY TO INGRATIATE YOURSELF TO THE TRUMP GOVERNMENT OR GO THE WAY YOU ARE GOING AND THE ARGUMENT BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT CANADA AND THE U.S. AND NOT CORPORATE TIES AND NOT THE INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIPS?<br/>   SO ONE THING THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS THAT THERE REALLY ISN'T SUCH A THING AS TRUMP'S PEOPLE IN TERMS OF -- THERE'S PEOPLE THAT VOTE FOR TRUMP ARE LOYAL TO TRUMP.<br/>BUT TRUMP LISTENS ONLY TO HIMSELF.<br/>SO THERE IS ONLY -- THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO WITH THIS KIND OF A APPROACH OF A MISSION LIKE TEAM CANADA TRYING TO GET YOU TO MEET WITH PEOPLE WHO LIKE DONALD TRUMP AND HOPE THAT THAT IS GOING HAVE AN INFLUENCE IN THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF IN THE ABSENCE OF THE PRESIDENT.<br/>THE PRESIDENT WILL TAKE THE DECISION IF HE IS PRESIDENT AGAIN THAT HE LIKES.<br/>SOMETIMES ON A WHIM.<br/>AND EVERYBODY WHO IS NOT LOYAL TO HIM WILL GET FIRED OR RESIGN AND THEN GO AND TELL ALL --<br/>   WRITE A BOOK.<br/>   --  BOOK IN WHICH IT WILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.<br/>THAT'S HOW YOU DEAL WITH DONALD TRUMP.<br/>YOU DEAL WITH THE GUY HIMSELF.<br/>YOU DO NOT DEAL WITH PEOPLE AROUND HIM.<br/>AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT FRANCOIS-PHILIPPE CHAMPAGNE UNDERSTANDS.<br/>THEREFORE, THEY ARE DEALING WITH THE DEMOCRATS.<br/>THEY ARE DEALING WITH THE REPUBLICANS THAT ARE ACTIVE AT THE STATE LEVEL, AS WELL, BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE AMERICAN SYSTEM IN THE STATE TO STATE RELATIONSHIP.<br/>BUT IN TERMS OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A TRUMP ELECTION, WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THAT ALREADY IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS HAD ON -- I WILL SAY RADICALIZATION IN CANADIAN POLITICS.<br/>WE HAVE SOME OF THE RESULT OF THAT WITH THE OTTAWA CONVOY, THE ANTI-VAX MOVEMENT.<br/>ALL OF THAT IS VERY MUCH AMERICAN-DRIVEN.<br/>IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ECONOMIC DEALS THAT FRANCOIS-PHILIPPE CHAMPAGNE WAS TALKING ABOUT TODAY.<br/>THAT IS MORE SOMETHING THAT TUCKER CARLSON VISITING CANADA IN A WAY HAS MORE POWER THAN TEAM CANADA HAS VISITING IN THE UNITED STATESON THAT ASPECT OF THE CONVERSATION ON CANADA/U.S. RELATIONSHIPS.<br/>   DAVID: THE WHOLE CONVOY PHENOMENON MAY BE MORE OF A GLOBAL THING THAN JUST AN AMERICAN THING.<br/>   ABSOLUTELY.<br/>   WHEN YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EUROPE AND THE ONLINE COMMENTARY THERE.  AMANDA, ON THAT, AT WHAT POINT CAN YOU START TO ZERO IN ON TRUMP DIRECTLY?<br/>OR DO YOU JUST KEEP MAKING SURE MICHIGAN IS WITH YOU, OHIO IS WITH YOU, GEORGIA IS WITH YOU AND COUNT ON THE SCAFFOLDING TO BE BUILT UP TO TRY TO CONTAIN A WILDCARD OF A POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP WITH A PRESIDENT.<br/>   THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.<br/>I THINK RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO TAKE AS WIDE AN APPROACH AS POSSIBLE.<br/>AND YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR THOSE CIRCLES OF INFLUENCE, RIGHT.<br/>YOU'RE LOOKING FOR -- TO FORGE AS MANY RELATIONSHIPS AND ALLIES WHO MAY BECOME IMPORTANT NO MATTER WHO BECOMES PRESIDENT.<br/>AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE MOST DIPLOMATIC WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS AT THIS POINT.<br/>AND THAT MEANS GETTING INTO THE STATES WHERE THERE ARE MUTUALLY MILLIONS OF JOBS THAT ARE AT STAKE.<br/>THERE ARE, YOU KNOW, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TRADE AT STAKE.<br/>AND REMINDING THOSE DECISIONMAKERS AT THE STATE LEVEL WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEM.<br/>YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A FOREGONE CONCLUSION, OBVIOUSLY, THAT IT WILL BE A TRUMP PRESIDENCY.<br/>SO YOU HAVE TO PLAY ON BOTH SIDES.<br/>AND I WOULD ARGUE ALSO THAT THIS IS A GOVERNMENT WHO HAS DONE THE WORK WITH TRUMP.<br/>WHO WAS ABLE TO SIGN NAFTA.<br/>THEY HAVE THE EXPERIENCE DOING IT.<br/>YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THEM, AND THE FACT IT WAS POSSIBLE ONCE BEFORE MAKES IT ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE THAT IT CAN DO IT AGAIN.<br/>BUT THE RIGHT THING AT THIS JUNCTURE NOW LEADING UP TO AN ELECTION WHEN WE KNOW TRUMP CAN BE PARTICULARLY VOLATILE WITH HIS RHETORIC IS TO CONTINUE TO REMIND AMERICANS OF HOW KEY THIS RELATIONSHIP IS.<br/>   DAVID: SO, KATE, LIKE, WE'VE SEEN THE APPROACH THAT THE LIBERALS ARE TAKING.<br/>HOW WOULD THE CONSERVATIVES APPROACH A POSSIBLE TRUMP OR EVEN A BIDEN PRESIDENCY?<br/>WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF HOW A POTENTIAL PRIME MINISTER POILIEVRE WOULD DEAL WITH THIS?<br/>   I THINK THEY WOULD START BY NOT LIKENING THEIR OWN DOMESTIC POLITICAL RIVALS TO POTENTIAL ONES IN THE U.S.<br/>WHAT POILIEVRE IS DISCUSSING IN TERMS OF DOMESTICALLY FOCUSED, FOCUSED ON CANADIAN JOBS HERE.<br/>I THINK A U.S. ADMINISTRATION -- BIDEN, TRUMP, WHOEVER -- WOULD RECOGNIZE AND RESPECT THAT, YOU KNOW, CANADA IS TRYING TO SHORE UP SOME OF ITS OWN DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING, ET CETERA.<br/>   THERE'S INEVITABLY TENSION AND CONFLICT, TOO, RIGHT?<br/>   INDEED.<br/>I THINK THE HARD WORK IS NOT THE P.R. TOUR THAT THE MINISTER HAS EMBARKED ON.<br/>THE HARD WORK IS ACTUALLY MAKING CANADA A MORE DESIRABLE PLACE TO INVEST.<br/>GETTING RID OF THE RED TAPE AND REGULATION THAT PREVENTS U.S. INVESTMENT IN CANADA AND PREVENTS MORE JOBS PULLING BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE COUNTRY.<br/>I THINK CONSERVATIVES WOULD LOOK AT THAT AS OPPOSED TO THE PR EXCHANGE THAT IS HAPPENING AND BE MORE FOCUSED ON THINGS ABOUT HOW TO LOOK AT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, AS ONE OF MANY THINGS THAT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY DO BUSINESS HERE.<br/>   DAVID: FRANCOISE, HOW DOES THAT SORT OF DEREGULATION APPROACH -- I DON'T SAY IT IN A PEJORATIVE WAY, HOW DOES IT JIBE WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT A 10 PERCENT TARIFF WALL RIGHT OFF THE BAT.<br/>THERE ARE MEASURES THAT COME FROM HIS ADMINISTRATION THAT START THROWING UP WALLS FOR TWO-WAY TRADE.<br/>   I DO HOPE THAT WE HAVE GREAT NEGOTIATORS STILL IN EFFECT AT THAT TIME.<br/>IF EVER IT'S PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT GETS ELECTED.<br/>BECAUSE HONESTLY HE'S GOING TO -- HE IS TALKING A LOT ABOUT TARIFFS RIGHT NOW.<br/>THE BORDERS PROBLEM.<br/>AND NOW EVEN THE NORTHERN BORDERS AND THE SOUTHERN BORDERS.<br/>HE WANTS -- THE COUNTRIES WHO IN NATO TO UP THEIR GAME AND CANADA IS PROBABLY ONE THAT HE IS LOOKING AT.<br/>THERE ARE SO MANY FILES OF CONTENTIOUS.<br/>SO BE IT POILIEVRE OR TRUDEAU, THEY HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT FOR THEM.<br/>BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE COMPLICATED.<br/>AND ESPECIALLY NOW -- DONALD TRUMP IS NOT THE SAME DONALD TRUMP THAT IN 2016 BECAUSE THAT WAS HIS FIRST MANDATE -- I THINK EVEN HIMSELF WAS SURPRISED THAT HE GOT ELECTED.<br/>THIS TIME HE THINKS IT'S OWED TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD STILL BE A PRESIDENT.<br/>SO HE'S GOT PLANS.<br/>AND IT'S GOING TO BE A BIT HARDER TO MAKE HIM DERAIL HIS OWN PLANS.<br/>SO THAT'S WHY I SAY OUR NEGOTIATORS ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER BETTER BE READY BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING LIKE GOING TO THE U.N. AND TALKING DIPLOMATIC.<br/>   DAVID: NO.<br/>   THINGS ARE GOING TO BE VERY TO THE GROUND AND MUD FIGHT.<br/>   DAVID: EMILIE, I KNOW THIS TEAM CANADA MOVE BY THE TRUDEAU GOVERNMENT IS REALLY FOCUSED ON ECONOMICS.<br/>BUT IT'S HARD TO IGNORE THE BOARDER IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY MEAN.<br/>VICTOR ORBAN OF HUNGARY THIS WEEK AND SAYING TRUMP WILL END THE WAR IN UKRAINE BY NOT GIVING UKRAINE A DIME.<br/>NOT ONE PENNY, ONE DOLLAR.<br/>HOW DO YOU CALCULATE THOSE ENORMOUS STAKES INTO AN OUTREACH PLAN FOR A POTENTIAL TRUMP ADMINISTRATION?<br/>   THERE WAS A REPORT PUBLISHED EARLY IN JANUARY THAT ESSENTIALLY THOUGHT OF THE U.S. ELECTION AS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO -- THE BIGGEST GLOBAL THREAT, ESSENTIALLY.<br/>AND I REALLY DO THINK WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS AS THAT.<br/>THERE ARE SO MANY DECISIONS THAT COULD BE MADE ON A WHIM OR WITH A CLICK OF THE FINGER BY THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.<br/>WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OBVIOUSLY THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST.<br/>THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE.<br/>WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT REGULATION.<br/>RIGHT NOW, JOE BIDEN IS TRYING TO GET -- TALKING ABOUT GREEN TRANSITION AND CANADA IS VERY MUCH ALIGNING ITSELF WITH INVESTMENT IN GREEN ENERGY TO MATCH WHAT THE AMERICANS ARE DOING IN TERMS OF GREEN TRANSITION.<br/>IF DONALD TRUMP IS GOING IN A VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND GOING INTO THE DIRECTION OF DEREGULATION, AS WELL, IT COULD HAVE MASSIVE CONSEQUENCES ON THE PLANET.<br/>ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TRADE WITH THE AMERICANS, WHO WOULD THEN BE ENCOURAGED TO LOWER THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION.<br/>WE HAVE SEEN IT IN BRAZIL WITH BOLSONARO WHEN HE WAS IN POWER HOW THE AMAZON CAUGHT FIRE.<br/>AND NOW LULA IS BACK IN POWER AGAIN, YOU HAVE THE DECREASE OF DEFORESTATION IN THE AMAZON.<br/>YOU CAN SEE ON THE MAP FROM SPACE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BOLSONARO PRESIDENCY AND LULA'S PRESIDENCY IN BRAZIL.<br/>SO YOU COULD ALSO WITH THE FOREST FIRE IN CANADA SEE FROM SPACE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENCY OR, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND PEOPLE THAT DON'T.<br/>AND SO THAT IS VERY MUCH A GLOBAL THREAT THAT I THINK WE'RE UNDERESTIMATING OR, PERHAPS, NOT INCLUDING ENOUGH WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CANADA/U.S. ECONOMY.<br/>BECAUSE IT IS THE ECONOMY.<br/>   DAVID: NO.<br/>AND I THINK THE REPORT YOU'RE REFERRING TO, I THINK THAT WAS THE EURASIA GROUP THAT CALLED THE U.S. POLITICAL INSTABILITY THE NUMBER 1 GEOPOLITICAL RISK FOR THE YEAR AHEAD.<br/>   THANK YOU FOR THAT, YES.<br/>   IT'S HARD NOT TO DISAGREE.<br/>WE SPOKE TO IAN BREMMER ABOUT THAT ON THE SHOW.<br/>WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK.<br/>COMING UP NEXT, THE NUMBER OF PREMIERS ASKING FOR A PAUSE ON THE FEDERAL CARBON TAX IS GROWING, AND NDP <br/>LEADER JAGMEET SINGH BLAMES THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT'S UNEVEN APPROACH TO THE TAX ACROSS THE COUNTRY.<br/>   WHAT THE LIBERALS HAVE DONE IS CREATED A LOT OF CHAOS.<br/>THEY OPENED THE DOOR TO THIS CHAOS WHEN THEY STARTED PITTING ONE COMMUNITY, ONE REGION AGAINST ANOTHER.<br/>   DAVID: THE POWER PANEL ON THE CALLS TO SUSPEND THE TAX INCREASE.<br/>THAT'S NEXT.<br/>   DAVID: MORE PROVINCIAL LEADERS ARE CALLING ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PAUSE THE CARBON TAX INCREASE SET TO KICK IN NEXT MONTH.<br/>IN A LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER, LIBERAL NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR PREMIER ANDREW FUREY WRITES THIS...<br/>   IT'S A SIGNIFICANT INFLATIONARY PRESSURE POINT.<br/>AND WITH RESPECT TO THE MOTIVES AND THE INCENTIVE BEHIND THE CARBON TAX, WE JUST DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT INSTRUMENT AT THIS TIME.<br/>   DAVID: NOVA SCOTIA PREMIER TIM HOUSTON WROTE HIS OWN LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER SAYING...<br/>NOW THOSE LETTERS FOLLOW A SIMILAR PLEA FROM P.E.I. PREMIER DENNIS KING ON FRIDAY.<br/>WILL OTTAWA LISTEN?<br/>THE POWER PANEL IS WITH ME.<br/>KATE HARRISON, FRANCOISE BOIVIN, AMANDA ALVARO, AND EMILIE NICOLAS.<br/>SO, EMILIE, I MEAN, FRANCOIS LEGAULT IS NOT ASKING THEM TO PAUSE THE CARBON TAX.<br/>HE USES CAP AND TRADE AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.<br/>THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONSENSUS AT THE SUBNATIONAL LEVEL THAT THIS POLICY NEEDS TO CHANGE AND NEEDS TO GO.<br/>WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS ON APRIL 1 AND HOW DOES THIS GOVERNMENT RESPOND?<br/>   FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING ONE TO FOLLOW FROM QUEBEC.<br/>FOR ONCE WE'RE NOT IN THE CENTRE OF A NATIONAL CRISIS.<br/>   DAVID: YOU'RE NOT THE TROUBLEMAKER THIS TIME.<br/>   NO.<br/>EVERYBODY BUT.<br/>THAT BEING SAID, I WILL JUST -- I AM CURIOUS TO HEAR WHAT THE OTHERS HAVE TO SAY.<br/>BUT I WILL START BY ANSWERING THIS...<br/>THE CARBON TAX HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT OF AN ISSUE ESPECIALLY ON THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE PREMIERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.<br/>HOWEVER, WE GOT INTO THE SITUATION WE ARE IN NOW BECAUSE THE LIBERALS PLAYED NICE ON ONE EXCEPTION AND DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING COMING FROM THE PRESSURES -- ESPECIALLY IN THE MARITIMES AROUND HOME GAS HEATING.<br/>AND SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT CREATED THE POLITICAL CLIMATE THAT WE'RE IN NOW, AND JUST SO FROM A POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE, THINKING THAT PLAYING NICE AGAIN, AND BEING, OKAY, YOU WANT TO PAUSE, SURE, LET'S PAUSE, AND THAT PREMIERS ARE GOING TO BE YES, THANK YOU.<br/>THIS IS WHAT WE WANTED.<br/>WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR YOU AND WISH YOU A GOT RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN.<br/>THAT IS NOT THE WAY POLITICS WORK.<br/>AND SO THE LIBERALS SHALL WITNESS THE PREMIERS ARE -- AND PIERRE POILIEVRE ARE AT JUSTIN TRUDEAU'S THROAT FOR THAT.<br/>IF HE DOES IT AGAIN, THAT'S JUST GOING TO SHOW WEAKNESS OF LEADERSHIP.<br/>UNTIL THERE IS NO MORE TAX, PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE PUSHING.<br/>AND SO EVERY PREMIER THAT'S WRITING, YOU KNOW, WE LIKE -- YOU CAN PAUSE THE TAX FOR A BIT.<br/>IF I WAS IN JUSTIN TRUDEAU'S OFFICE, I WOULD NOT BELIEVE A WORD OF THAT.<br/>   DAVID: AND JUST A POINT, IT WAS HOME HEATING OIL PRIMARILY --<br/>   YEAH, SORRY.<br/>   AND NOT HEATING GAS.<br/>WE TOOK YOUR POINT, THOUGH.<br/>AMANDA, WHAT IS THE PATH FORWARD?<br/>ANDREW FUREY IS THE ONLY OTHER LIBERAL IN THE CLUB.<br/>HE'S SAYING NO, DON'T GO AHEAD WITH THIS.<br/>SCOTT MOE IS JUST FLATOUT NOT COLLECTING IT AND REMITTING AND IT WALKING CONSEQUENCE-FREE AS IT SEEMS RIGHT NOW, AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS WAITING TO RESPOND.<br/>FOR SOMETHING THAT IS SUCH A SIGNATURE POLICY, I DON'T KNOW HOW FIRM AND STRONG THEY ARE ON THIS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY ARE.<br/>   WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, DAVID, IF I KNEW THE PATH FORWARD I WOULD HAVE A MAGIC WAND, AND IF THEY WOULD REWIND AND REFRAME THE COMMUNICATION ON THIS, IT WOULD BE THIS ONE, AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE, AND IN APRIL, FAMILIES WILL RECEIVE REBATES AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT PAUSING ON THE INCREASES AND THIS WHOLE NOTION -- THE IDEA OF THE REBATE HAS NEVER PENETRATED.<br/>IT'S JUST -- IT'S NOT PART OF THE CONVERSATION FROM COAST TO COAST.<br/>AND THAT IS SUCH A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR THE LIBERALS.<br/>THEY ATTEMPTED A REBRAND A MONTH APING.<br/>START CALLING IT A REBATE.<br/>I THINK IT WAS CALLED AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM BEFORE.<br/>BUT IN BOTH CASES, IT IS SO HARD FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND.<br/>THEY ARE FEELING IT IN THEIR POCKETBOOKS, AND IT'S EASY FOR THE CONSERVATIVES TO MAKE AN ARRANGEMENT ON THIS ONE, AND IT'S A SIMPLE ARGUMENT TO MAKE, AND THE PROVINCES HAVE SEEN HOW EFFECTIVE THE ARGUMENT CAN BE, AND THEY'VE TAKEN IT UP IN THEIR HOME PROVINCES, AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ON THEIR BACK FOOT SINCE DAY ONE.<br/>   DAVID: CAN I INTERRUPT?<br/>I WANT TO ASK QUICK QUESTION, THE REBATE IS ONE THING.<br/>AND WHETHER PEOPLE FEEL IT OR NOT BRANDING OR NOT.<br/>BUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE POLICY IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING A QUESTION, RIGHT?<br/>THE CLEAN STEEL STUFF THEY'VE DONE WITH ALGOMA, YOU CAN SAY THIS INVESTMENT TAKES THIS AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE ON AN ANNUAL PERMANENT BASIS.<br/>THE SAME WITH ELECTRIFICATION OF CARS AND SWITCHING OFF DIFFERENT FUEL SOURCES.<br/>HAVE THEY MADE THE CASE THAT THIS IS EFFECTIVE?<br/>BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND A CATALOGUE OF WHAT THE CONSUMER PRICE DOES IN TERMS OF REDUCING EMISSIONS.<br/>YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?<br/>   NO, I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE MADE THE CASE.<br/>THEY MADE A JURISDICTIONAL CASE LOOKING AT OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHEN THEY FIRST PUT THE POLICY IN THE WINDOW.<br/>BUT I THINK THEY'VE BEEN SO BUSY HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE AFFORDABILITY SIDE OF THIS POLICY THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THE CLIMATE CHANGE ARGUMENT ON THE POLICY.<br/>AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET INTO THIS -- IT'S A  SNOWBALL EFFECT IN COMMUNICATION WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO PULL BACK ON THE THING THAT IS NOT RESONATING.<br/>THIS HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FROM DAY 1.<br/>WHERE TO GO FROM HERE, I THINK THIS IS A TIME -- I'LL SAY ONE LAST THING, I AGREE WITH EMILIE.<br/>I THINK IF THE GOVERNMENT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE REALLY ATTEMPTING CARVE-OUTS IN DIFFERENT PROVINCES OR REALLY ACQUIESCING TO PREMIERS THAT ARE CALLING FOR SOME OF THESE CARVE-OUTS, I THINK THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN AN EVEN MORE DIFFICULT POSITION.<br/>SO THE ONLY PLACE FOR THEM TO BE RIGHT NOW IS CONTINUE TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT AND TRY TO MAKE IT AS SIMPLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE.<br/>   AND IF THEY DO IT AGAIN, STEVEN GUILBEAULT WILL PROBABLY WALK.<br/>HE SAID ONLY ONE CARVE-OUT ON MY WATCH AND WE GOT THAT CARVE-OUT AND NO MORE.<br/>BUT PIERRE POILIEVRE IS TRAVELLING THE COUNTRY.<br/>HE'S HEADED TO ATLANTIC CANADA WHERE THE PRODIGIOUS LETTER WRITERS ARE ALL BASED RIGHT NOW TO DO AN AXE THE TAX SPIKE THE HIKE TOUR.<br/>CAN THE GOVERNMENT EVEN DO ANYTHING ON THIS WITHOUT LOOKING LIKE IT IS WEAK LEADERSHIP AND ALIENATING WHAT PROGRESSIVES ARE STILL THERE FOR THEM RIGHT NOW?<br/>   YEAH.<br/>WELL, THE PREMIERS ARE A VERY EFFECTIVE CORRESPONDENCE UNIT FOR THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY RIGHT NOW.<br/>HATS OFF TO THEM.<br/>THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO.<br/>I THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS PUT THEMSELVES IN AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DID IN OCTOBER WITH THAT CARVE-OUT FOR HOME HEATING OIL IN IT.<br/>PRIMARILY IN ATLANTIC CANADA.<br/>BECAUSE WHAT THEY DID WAS EFFECTIVELY SAY THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE COMPROMISED ON THIS MARQUEE POSITION THAT WE'VE TAKEN.<br/>SO THEY KEEP IT AS IS.<br/>THEY CONTINUE TO FACE HEAT FROM PREMIERS.<br/>PEOPLE SAYING YOU'RE OUT OF TOUCH WITH OUR AFFORDABILITY NEEDS.<br/>IF THEY OPT TO TAKE IT AWAY, THEY COMPROMISE THEIR BASE OF SUPPORT THAT IS MORE OF THIS LIBERAL/NDP VOTER COALITION THAT BELIEVES THAT THIS IS THE ONLY GOVERNMENT THAT CAN DO SOMETHING ON THE ENVIRONMENT.<br/>THIS IS THE ONLY ISSUE THAT THE LIBERALS CONTINUE TO POLL AHEAD ON WHEN COMPARED WITH THEIR CONSERVATIVE AND NDP COUNTERPARTS.<br/>IF I WERE THEM, DESPITE THIS, I WOULD HOLD THE LINE BECAUSE IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO SEEM YOU ARE CONVINCED IT'S THE RIGHT POLICY RATHER THAN ADMIT IT'S BOTH A POLICY AND COMMUNICATION FAILURE.<br/>   FANSOISE IS THAT A TENABLE POSITION?<br/>EVEN IN THE ALBERTA NDP LEADERSHIP RACE, HAVE YOU CANDIDATES SAYING CONSUMER CARBON TAX, MAYBE IT'S TIME TO RECONSIDER THAT AND FOCUS JUST ON AN INDUSTRIAL BASED SOLUTION.<br/>   WELL, LIKE MY COLLEAGUE SAID, THE PROBLEM WAS LIBERALS BACKING UP FROM THEIR OWN POLICY BECAUSE CARBON TAX WAS A WIN-ALL.<br/>AND IT HAD GOOD VALUE.<br/>NOW SEEING THAT YOU MAKE A FEW AN EXCEPTION AT SOME POINT, HOW GOOD IS THE EXCEPTION IS?<br/>IT GIVES YOUR OPPONENTS -- AND THEY ARE NUMEROUS IN THIS COUNTRY.<br/>ALBERTA AND SASKATCHEWAN HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS TOOTH AND NAIL FOR YEARS.<br/>SO TO SEE THE WAY THEY HANDLED THIS FILE, I DON'T KNOW -- LIKE WE SAID AT THE TIME WHEN THEY DID IT, I DON'T KNOW WHO IS ADVISING THEM, HOW THEY -- THEIR ADVISING AND COMMUNICATING SOMETHING LIKE THAT.<br/>BECAUSE TODAY I WAS ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS FROM SOMEBODY WHO SAID I DON'T GET IT.<br/>YOU SAY THE CARBON TAX IS GOOD.<br/>YOU SEND BACK THE MONEY.<br/>THERE'S 10 PERCENT LEFT THAT GOES IN CERTAIN PROGRAMS.<br/>ARE YOU SURE THEY GO THERE?<br/>AND WHAT DO THEY DO AND SO ON AND SO FORTH?<br/>AND WHO GETS THE MONEY?<br/>AGAIN IT'S BACK TO THE WAY THEY COMMUNICATE THEIR THINGS.<br/>I THINK MAYBE THEY REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.<br/>MAYBE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO IT.<br/>BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME, I AGREE WITH THE COLLEAGUES, IT WOULD LOOK SO BAD POLITICALLY IF THEY WOULD FOLD AND SAY WE ARE NOT GOING AHEAD.<br/>MAYBE THEY CAN DO SOMETHING A BIT LIKE THE BEER.<br/>A BIT LESS HIKE THAN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.<br/>AND LET IT ROLL.<br/>BUT THERE'S NO WAY THAT THEY LOOK LIKE WINNERS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IF THEY DO AS SUCH.<br/>   EMILIE, I JUST WONDER, TO FLIP IT AROUND TO THE PEOPLE SAYING PAUSE IT.<br/>I KNOW THERE'S AN AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGE IN THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW AND A COST OF LIVING POLITICAL CRISIS AND ECONOMIC CRISIS.<br/>INFLATION IS STEADYING AND WE'LL PROBABLY GET SOME INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS THIS YEAR.<br/>BUT FOR THOSE WHO SAY PAYING A CARBON PRICE TOO HARD AND TO EXPENSIVE.<br/>IS GETTING TO A NET ZERO ECONOMY SUPPOSED TO BE CHEAP AND EASY?<br/>I DON'T SEE A PATH WHERE IT IS BOTH THOSE THINGS.<br/>IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO REQUIRE SOME SACRIFICE AND SOME COSTS IF THIS IS A PATH THAT THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO CHOOSE.<br/>   WHEN WE DISCUSSED A COUPLE MONTHS AGO CARVE-OUT, WINTER WAS COMING AND POEPLE WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE PRICE OF HEATING, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL CANADA, WE <br/>COULD HAVE -- AND AT SOME POINT I DID HAVE MY WARM QUICHE BRAIN ON AND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS REASONABLE BECAUSE THIS AND THIS AND THAT.<br/>BUT TO EVEN HAVE THAT WARM KEY CONVERSATION, YOU NEED TO AMONGST PEOPLE WHO SEE THE VALUE OF WORKING TOWARDS ELIMINATING CLIMATE CHANGE.<br/>   DAVID: RIGHT.<br/>   AND ARE TRYING TO LOOK AT THE BEST TOOLS TO GET THERE.<br/>AND SO THEN WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ON THE INSTRUMENTS TO USE -- [INDISCERNIBLE]<br/>-- WAS JUST USED BY ONE OF THE PREMIERS.<br/>IT'S A CONVERSATION -- THE CONVERSATION OF INSTRUMENTS CAN ONLY BE HAD WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SAME GOALS, AND WHEN YOU LOOK TO CERTAIN PREMIERS AND CERTAIN POLITICAL ELEMENTS IN CANADA, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WORKING -- FIRST OF ALL THAT CLIMATE CHANGE JUST EXIST.<br/>OR EVEN IF THEY DO SAY IT EXISTS, IT SHOULD NOT AFFECT WHAT KIND OF INDUSTRY WE HAVE IN CANADA.<br/>THOSE INDUSTRIES SHOULD BE OPERATING WITH THE LEAST ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AS POSSIBLE AND IT SHOULD NOT CHANGE OUR WAY OF LIFE BECAUSE OUR WAY OF LIFE IS SACRED AND HOW DARE THE GOVERNMENT CHANGE OUR WAY OF LIFE.<br/>SO WHEN THAT IS A POLITICAL FORCE IN CANADA, YOU HAVE THAT, IT MAKES IT VERY, VERY, VERY HARD TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT INSTRUMENTS THAT THEN DOES NOT DERAIL THAT PART OF THE CANADIAN CONVERSATION.<br/>   YES, AT TIMES, IT'S LIKE A PRIEST AND AN ATHEIST ARGUING ABOUT GOD.<br/>YOU CAN ASSIGN THE ROLES WHICHEVER WAY YOU WANT WITH THAT DEBATE.<br/>BUT, AMANDA, YOU KNOW, IN THE WINTER, OPPONENTS OF THE INCREASES COMPLAIN ABOUT HOME HEATING.<br/>AND IN THE SUMMER, AS WE SEE IN THE LETTERS, IT'S ABOUT ABOUT THE PRICE OF GAS.<br/>SO THERE'S A SEASONAL CLUB TO HIT THIS POLICY WITH WHENEVER YOU TURN.<br/>   YEAH, AND I THINK ALSO -- LIKE, TO EMILIE'S POINT AT A TIME WHEN CANADIANS CHOSE THIS POLICY, WE WERE IN A VERY DIFFERENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE, AS WELL.<br/>SO WHERE THE ENVIRONMENT AND WHERE CLIMATE CHANGE FALLS ON YOUR LIST OF PRIORITIES MAYBE AT ONE POINT WHEN ECONOMICALLY YOU'RE FEELING BETTER ABOUT THINGS, ABOUT YOUR OWN POCKETBOOK, ABOUT AFFORDABILITY, AND IT COULD TAKE A VERY DIFFERENT POSITION AND FRANKLY HAS WHEN YOU LOOK AT POLLING AND WHERE SOME OF THESE POLICIES AND THE PRIORITIES LAND FOR PEOPLE IN THIS CLIMATE.<br/>AND SO, YOU KNOW, THE GOVERNMENT, UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S STILL ONE OF THEIR SIGNATURE POLICIES.<br/>IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY WERE INITIALLY ELECTED.<br/>AND SO TO PULL BACK ON IT VERY CHALLENGING.<br/>BUT AT THE SAME TIME HAVING TO RECOGNIZE THAT CANADIANS ARE IN A VERY DIFFERENT POSITION TODAY THAN THEY WERE WHEN THEY FIRST CHOSE THIS GOVERNMENT.<br/>NOT TO SAY THAT THE CLIMATE IS NOT IMPORTANT TO THEM.<br/>NOT TO SAY THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IS IMPORTANT TO THEM.<br/>BUT THEY MAY NOT WANT TO PUT THEIR MONEY ON IT RIGHT NOW.<br/>THEY MAY PUT THEIR VOTE ON RIGHT NOW AND NOT ONE WILLING TO WRITE A CHEQUE ON.<br/>SO THE GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS POSITION IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE REALITY OR THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT CANADIANS FIND THEMSELVES IN.<br/>   KATE, DO YOU THINK CONSUMER CARBON PRICING CAN SURVIVE THE NEXT ELECTION?<br/>IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE A VERY WOUNDED RE-ELECTED LIBERAL GOVERNMENT OR SURGENT CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT.<br/>BARRING SOME DRAMATIC CHANGE TO THE NEW DEMOCRATS OR THE BLOC GOING NATIONAL.<br/>   SURE.<br/>   DAVID: DO YOU THINK IT CAN SURVIVE?<br/>[LAUGHING]<br/>   PRIME MINISTER BLANCHET, WHO KNOWS.<br/>   YOU JUST MADE HIM VERY HAPPY.<br/>   HE COULD MAKE AN ALLIANCE WITH ALBERTA.<br/>   THE SHORT ANSWER -- I DON'T THINK SO.<br/>I THINK THE CONSERVATIVES AND CONSERVATIVE PREMIERS HAVE REALLY DISRUPTED THE NATIONAL DISCOURSE ON THIS ISSUE.<br/>IT WAS IN THE NOT TOO RECENT PATH THAT CARBON TAX AND PRICE ON CARBON WAS ACCEPTED.<br/>   DAVID: THE CONSERVATIVES RAN ON IT LAST TIME AND UNDER HARPER.<br/>   THAT'S A MARKED CHANGE FROM WHAT WE HAVE NOW.<br/>AND TO AMANDA'S POINT, THE FISCAL REALITY IS DIFFERENT.<br/>PEOPLE'S AFFORDABILITY REALITY IS DIFFERENT.<br/>BUT NOW THE LIBERALS DON'T SEEM IN TOUCH WITH KIND OF THE -- THEY'RE NOT MEETING THE ENVIRONMENT COMMITMENTS.<br/>THEY'RE NOT COMMITTING THE AFFORDABILITY COMMITMENTS.<br/>IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO NOT HAVE THE NEXT ELECTION AT LEAST IN PART BE A REFERENDUM ON THE CARBON TAX.<br/>AND TO THE CONSERVATIVES' BENEFIT, THEY HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY CLEAR IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY WOULD DO ABOUT THAT.<br/>AND IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE CONTRAST WINS, THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN VERY DELIBERATE ABOUT THE CONTRAST THEY HAVE DRAWN ON THIS ISSUE PERHAPS MARE THAN ANY OTHER ISSUE.<br/>   FRANCOISE, AS WE KNOW, IF BLANCHET BECAME PRIME MINISTER, IT WOULD BE CAP AND TRADE NATIONALLY.<br/>IT WOULDN'T BE CARBON PRICING.<br/>THAT WOULD BE THE PRICE FORWARD.<br/>   EXACTLY.<br/>EXACTLY.<br/>ANYWAY, YOU'RE ALWAYS A LOSER WHEN YOUR KEY POLICY HAS THE WORD \"TAX\" IN IT.<br/>   IT DIDN'T!<br/>   GO AROUND AND TALK ABOUT AXE THE TAX.<br/>DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE, PEOPLE WILL SAY HE'S RIGHT, I HATE THE CARBON TAX.<br/>ANOTHER PLACE IS GOING TO SAY I HATE THE BEER TAX.<br/>IN QUEBEC, I HATE ALL THE TAXES.<br/>IT'S SO -- YOU KNOW, IT'S SUCH AN EASY RALLY TO HAVE.<br/>SO IT'S GOING TO BE FUN TO SEE HOW THE LIBERALS CAN TURN THIS SOMETHING AROUND, IF THEY CAN.<br/>OTHERWISE THEY WILL PROVE MR. FORD RIGHT WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT ANNIHILATION.<br/>BOY, I HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THAT WORD.<br/>   DAVID: ALL RIGHT.<br/>WE GOT TO GO.<br/>AMANDA, TO YOUR POINT, EVEN THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID IT IS NOT A TAX.<br/>IT IS A REGULATORY CHARGE.<br/>   BUT AGAIN.<br/>THAT'S THE COMMS CHALLENGES AND THE SHORTHAND THAT EVERYONE USES ON THIS.<br/>GANG, IT WAS FUN.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH.<br/>THANK YOU TO THE POWER PANEL,<br/>KATE HARRISON, FRANCOISE BOIVIN, AMANDA ALVARO, AND EMILIE NICOLAS.<br/>UP NEXT, CANADA HAS RESUMED FUNDING TO UNRWA.<br/>THE LARGEST U.N.

Disclosure information is available on the original site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">___</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Author: Andrew Weaver, Professor, School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, University of Victoria</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This June was the warmest one ever recorded and unprecedented summer heat waves are now gripping southern Europe, China, the Middle East and the southern United States. </p><p>In the face of such unprecedented heat, one would think that the world would wake up to the urgent need to rapidly decarbonize energy systems, transition to a low carbon economy and increase investment in negative emission technologies.</p><p>California\u2019s Death Valley recorded 56.6 C temperatures, and rather than reflecting on the obvious effects of global warming, tourists flocked to the area. Similarly, thrill-seeking visitors rushed to Xinjiang, China, to experience 80 C surface temperatures and more than 50 C air temperatures.</p><p>Tourists also headed in droves to the beaches and historical sites of Italy, Spain and Greece, where governments were warning them to stay indoors to avoid the potentially life-threatening heat. </p><p>In Canada, we have already experienced our worst recorded forest fire season. And in British Columbia, where I live, we have already broken the previous 2018 record with more than 13,900 square kilometres burnt. And this is just the beginning of the 2023 fire season.</p><p>Remarkable cognitive dissonance</p><p>I doubt those jetting off to visit the heat-ravaged regions of the world are aware that Antarctica has already shattered previous sea ice melt records, with potentially dire consequences for glacial outflow and future sea level rise. </p><p>Are tourists aware that coral reefs worldwide are in the process of dying off on an unprecedented scale?</p><p>Perhaps they might want to reflect on the fact that Earth has already warmed by around 1.1 to 1.2 C since pre-industrial times. </p><p>Many may not realize that even if worldwide fossil fuel combustion was immediately eliminated, the roughly 0.5 C cooling contribution of atmospheric aerosols  \u2014 also the result of existing fossil fuel combustion \u2014 would rapidly dissipate through gravitational settling and precipitation scavenging of these aerosols. This would cause the Earth to warm rapidly to around 1.6 to 1.7 C above pre-industrial levels. </p><p>The warming does not end there, as the planet is on course to go well above 2 C in the decades ahead once reduced aerosol cooling, permafrost melt and other greenhouse gases are taken into account. </p><p>I suspect that these travellers are unaware that when these other pesky greenhouse gases are included, the net radiative effect is equivalent to 523 ppm CO2e, of which only 417 ppm is from CO2 alone.</p><p>The Paris Agreement</p><p>Governments worldwide have signed on to the 2015 Paris Agreement committing nations to collectively limit global warming to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C. </p><p>The Paris Agreement might appear promising. But the reality is that the 1.5 C guardrail cannot be met, and that socioeconomic inertia prevents us from even staying below the 2 C threshold. Even if every country met its promised emissions reductions, global mean temperatures would still soar past 2 C.</p><p>We have known for more than 15 years that \u201cif a 2.0 C warming is to be avoided, direct CO2 capture from the air, together with subsequent sequestration, would eventually have to be introduced in addition to sustained 90 per cent global carbon emissions reductions by 2050.\u201d</p><p>So, while governments, industry and public sector institutions worldwide are announcing their intention to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, the reality is these are nothing more than aspirational goals made by decision-makers who will not be around to be held accountable for the decisions they made.</p><p>Reaching net-zero</p><p>To meet the target of these net-zero claims, most will rely on so-called nature-based solutions such as planting trees, using biochar in soils to enhance soil carbon uptake and restoring mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass meadows.</p><p>To be clear, nature-based climate solutions have an important role to play. </p><p>Human disruption of natural ecosystems has accounted for about 30 per cent of historical greenhouse gas emissions, so it is reasonable to expect nature-based climate solutions to have a key role to play moving forward.</p><p>But there are limits, not the least of which is that global warming will continue to cause increased wildfires in the years ahead. And these wildfires release the carbon stored in the vegetation back to the atmosphere.</p><p>While nature-based solutions can help in climate change adaptation and the preservation of biodiversity, there is a growing danger that governments, industry and the public will come to rely on them to maintain the status quo, thereby delaying what is actually needed.</p><p>We now need an immediate transition towards the decarbonization of global energy systems and the widespread introduction of negative emission technology, such as direct air carbon capture and deep underground carbon sequestration. </p><p>This is the only hope humanity has for a long-term solution to global warming. </p><p>We can take comfort in the very real successes of nature-based solutions and their many benefits. But we cannot take our eyes off the scale of the challenge before us. While all the solutions are known, achieving the goals of net zero emissions in the future is a matter of individual, institutional, corporate and political will.</p><p>Rather than jetting off around the world to feel the heat, perhaps it\u2019s time for everyone to take a good hard look at their individual contribution to global warming. </p><p>Each of us is part of the problem, meaning that each of us can also be part of the solution.

Nearly 16,000 people have been ordered to leave their homes, say officials.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One province west in New Brunswick, officials have conceded a wildfire near the towns of Bocabec and Chamcook will be a \"long, drawn-out firefight\" as it remains uncontrollable as of Monday afternoon. And in Alberta, more than 5,000 residents were still displaced as of this Saturday, as nearly 50 fires continue to ravage the province, 14 of which are listed as out-of-control.</p><p>With even more fires expected this wildfire season - which lasts until the end of October in Ontario - here's how to keep safe if you live or are travelling to a fire-prone region.</p><p>Pack a wildfire emergency kit</p><p>Ensure you have everything you need if you are forced to evacuate by packing an emergency kit. The Government of Canada says an emergency kit should be easy to carry and that everyone in a household knows where it's located. A kit should include at least two litres of water per day per person, a flashlight, windup radio, first aid kit and non-perishable food items.</p><p>Store flammable material away from your home</p><p>If you live in an area with a wildfire risk, do not store flammable materials near the perimeter of your house, recommends Michelle Laidlaw, associate vice president of national home product and portfolio at The Co-operators.</p><p>Bringing a combustible material right outside your house \"can increase the risk of a wildfire doing significant damage to your home,\" she said, noting you should store wood at least 10 metres away from your house. She also said those living in vulnerable areas should keep their lawn trimmed and regularly clear debris, such as branches and leaves around their house.</p><p>Follow all official warnings and emergency evacuation orders</p><p>During wildfire season, it's especially important to stay on top of all advisories and evacuation orders as fires can start and spread rapidly. When outdoor conditions are extremely dry or if firefighting resources are limited, the Ontario government may enact a Restricted Fire Zone, prohibiting open fires in certain areas of the province.</p><p>It's also imperative to stay informed of any evacuation alerts or orders. The former means you should be prepared to evacuate on short notice, while the latter means you are in danger and should evacuate immediately.</p><p>David Arama, a wilderness survival expert, said most townships have post wildfire warning and fire bans on their websites. \"Check with the local townships to find out what the fire danger is,\" he said.</p><p>Build a campfire safely</p><p>During the summer season, Ontario sees an average of one wildfire each day caused by an unextinguished or unattended campfire. Recreational forest users can prevent wildfires by practicing good campfire safety, including: picking a site sheltered from the wind and near water; clearing a space around the fire; keeping the flame small and never leaving it unattended; and ensuring the fire is properly put out.</p><p>Find water if you are outdoors during a wildfire</p><p>If you find yourself in a wildfire, \"the best thing is evacuate and get the hell out of there, obviously,\" said Arama, \"but if that's not possible, then get to a clearing away from all flammable bush.\"</p><p>Forest fires can spread rapidly, so he doesn't recommend trying to outrun a wildfire. The Ontario government advises instead that those trapped should find a river, pond or lake to crouch in. If you're not near water, head to a low-lying area and breath air closest to the ground, ideally through a moist cloth to avoid inhaling smoke. Cover yourself with soil, dirt or anything that can shield you from the heat of the fire.</p><p>What to do if you are forced to evacuate due to wildfire</p><p>If you are told to evacuate, listen to the radio or TV and choose a route away from fire hazards, advises the provincial government. If possible, wear long-sleeve clothes and covered shoes to protect yourself from ashes and sparks. And if you have time before you leave, pack enough supplies for a week (see the tips for an emergency kit above), turn off the gas line, turn on your lawn sprinklers and move flammable items away from your dwelling.</p><p>Keep track of active wildfires</p><p>You can stay informed and plan your trips properly this summer by keeping track of active wildfires. The Ontario government maintains a forest fire info map. Google Maps also has a feature (under \"layers\") that shows users information about the major fires across the country.</p><p>Joshua Chong is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star's Express Desk.

She waited out the evacuation in Alberta with family. </p><p>\"These are my people. These are my neighbours.

The centre was reporting 127 fires in Quebec, 83 in Alberta, 70 in British Columbia and 56 in Ontario.</p><p>Blair says more than 53,000 square kilometres have burned in Canada so far this season, which is almost three times the size of Lake Ontario.</p><p>Cooler weather has stalled growth of a huge wildfire in northeastern B.C. burning just a few kilometres from the Alaska Highway. </p><p>A statement from the wildfire service says travel on the key route linking Yukon and the northeast corner of B.C. to the rest of the province could be affected within a day or two as the 5,000-square-kilometre Donnie Creek wildfire expands.</p><p>Wildfire service information officer Bryan Zandberg said it was now a \"very significant fire\" in historical terms, with the burn zone measuring 136 kilometres at its widest.</p><p>Zandberg said crews are waiting for the right conditions to conduct a controlled burn of a 19-kilometre stretch of woodland along the Alaska Highway, and the area's black spruce and jack pine trees are dry and potentially very volatile.</p><p>An evacuation alert covers both sides of a section of the highway between Fort Nelson and Fort St. John, and Zandberg said people should expect the fire to grow in the next few days, possibly leading to changes in evacuation alerts and orders.</p><p>Containment lines are holding around the Vancouver Island wildfire that closed Highway 4 east of Port Alberni on June 6, cutting off paved access to that city and the communities of Tofino and Ucluelet.</p><p>Efforts to clear fallen trees and rocks above the highway are underway and the province has said limited travel could resume by next weekend.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 15. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-c9719a9959f54c58a6b34eca80cab182</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68GD-7Y11-JBVR-34FN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"873\"/><timeReceived>06:47 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 15, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Tuesday, Nov. 28, 2023, 18 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022 the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> (NEW: NOV. 3, 2023) Cedar Creek, between Runningbrook Drive and Lexicon Drive in Ward 3<br/><br/> Ceremonial Drive, between Chagall Court and Bristol Road West in Ward 5.

Smoke from forest fires burning through Indigenous communities and across northern Ontario contaminated the air throughout the province.</p><p>We know from previous severe forest fire seasons that exposure to forest fire smoke leads to an immediate increase in asthma exacerbations and COPD exacerbations. We also see an increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations, particularly for children. In one Canadian study of the Yellowknife fires of 2014, asthma cases doubled during the fires and salbutamol inhaler prescriptions went up by about 50 per cent. Studies have also linked exposure to air pollutants with adverse pregnancy outcomes including low birthweight.</p><p>The World Health Organization and The Lancet have both declared climate change the number one health threat of this century. Toronto's air quality this week highlights that we are not immune from the health impacts of the climate crisis.</p><p>The poor air quality has also highlighted that, as we have seen over the course of the pandemic, those who are most marginalized are most at risk of adverse outcomes and least able to cope and adapt to health threats. Remote Indigenous communities are suffering most of all from these fires, and in Toronto, people experiencing homelessness, people who work outdoors, and people living in poverty are most at risk.</p><p>We heard many times over the past few days and weeks that \"what we are seeing is the new normal,\" whether in response to the heat dome on the West Coast, the forest fires in British Columbia and northern Ontario, or the flooding across western Europe. Yet we are seeing these extreme weather events at just 1.1 degree of warming. This is not the new normal; things will only get worse.</p><p>We must immediately take measures to prepare our communities for the decades to come.</p><p>We must prepare for more forest fires seasons and heat waves, as well as droughts, floods, vector borne diseases, food insecurity, and migration. We must improve our forest fire management plans, mandate air filtration on buildings, and we need a national adaptation strategy.</p><p>We must also immediately stop subsidizing fossil fuels and stop building fossil fuel infrastructure. We need to decarbonize our transportation and our built infrastructure. We need to begin a just transition for fossil fuel workers to a new low carbon economy. And we'll actually reap some immediate health co-benefits from a decrease in other air pollutants, an increase in active travel, and a move towards a plant-rich diet.</p><p>The pandemic has demonstrated that people are capable of doing so much to support each other's health. We can and must take immediate action now to avert climate disaster.</p><p>Dr. Samantha Green is a CAPE Board Member and a family physician in Toronto, and Faculty Lead in Climate Change and Health at the University of Toronto's Department of Family and Community Medicine.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20210727TTA2021072761683487</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637F-XFP1-F197-54YR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Without their help, we would not have been able to survive.\"</p><p>Provincial fire information officer Sarah Budd said the service is \"grateful\" to the federal government for making the aid available.</p><p>\"We have a long history of working together during particularly challenging wildfire seasons of which this is obviously one,\" she said in an interview Monday.</p><p>Recent data has prompted the federal government and B.C. Premier David Eby to say that Canada and B.C. are on track to record their worst wildfire seasons in 100 years.</p><p>Wildfires have consumed more than 12,900 square kilometres of land so far this year in B.C., already nearing the record of just over 13,500 square kilometres set in 2018.</p><p>Budd said the average area burned by this time of year, going back a decade, is about 1,000 square kilometres.</p><p>\"It is considerably more (this year) and there are a lot of reasons for that, the kind of underlying drought conditions that we had going into the season that are the results (of) longer-term weather patterns,\" she said.</p><p>B.C.'s drought bulletin shows 18 of the province's 34 water basins are at drought Level 4, meaning harm to ecosystems and communities is likely. A further four are at the highest Level 5, when all efforts should be made to conserve water and protect critical environmental flows.</p><p>Such conditions are likely to continue, Budd added.</p><p>\"We haven't had the level of precipitation that would be required to address those underlying drought conditions, so they do persist and when we get lightning strikes the materials out there on the landscape are really susceptible to ignition.\"</p><p>B.C.'s current wildfire situation includes an \"aggressive\" fire that exploded in size over the weekend and cut off highway access near the Central Coast, while more than a dozen new blazes have been sparked since Sunday.</p><p>The BC Wildfire Service says Highway 20 east of Bella Coola was closed Sunday evening as the fire that was discovered near Young Creek just the day before swelled to 22-square kilometres in size.</p><p>No evacuation orders have been issued for the fire.</p><p>The Thompson-Nicola Regional District says the Bush Creek East fire near Kamloops is \"highly visible,\" but no evacuation orders or alerts have been issued even as gusty winds have fanned wildfires around the city.</p><p>B.C. has also made a request for 1,000 international firefighters through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, which co-ordinates firefighting resources across the country.</p><p>Firefighting personnel from the United States, Mexico and New Zealand are already in the province, and teams were set to arrive from Australia over the weekend.</p><p>\"Some of those people are firefighters' boots on the ground (and) some of those people are people who can slot into the incident management system that we use to plan and allocate resources,\" Budd said. \"It's a range of people, but there are more coming.\"</p><p>READ ALSO: Aggressive wildfire closes only road to Bella Coola</p><p>READ ALSO: 'She was one of us': BC Wildfire mourns losing one of their own</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230717PAB4492852</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68R5-XD31-JD2C-J0MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1103\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

The TDEM survey was flown over base metals targets identified by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/MZRG2c1Eyz\">2022 VLF-EM survey and the recent historical data review undertaken</url>  at the Champion Electric Lithium Project (the \" Project\") located in the pegmatite-rich Eeyou Istchee James Bay territory of Quebec.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The TDEM high-resolution airborne survey was completed by Prospectair Geosurveys and data was collected over 351-line kilometres (\"km\") over interpreted areas of interest within the 2022 airborne geophysical survey coverage. The TDEM survey aimed to follow-up on a selection of shallow VLF-EM conductive anomalies spatially correlated with mapped ultramafic rocks of the Lac Guyer Greenstone Belt which are anomalous in Ni (Nickel), Co (Cobalt) and Cr (Chromium) and deemed prospective for base metals mineralisation (see Figure 1).</p><p>\"Although lithium is our primary focus in Quebec, we cannot neglect the fact that our 100% owned 500 km 2 project in James Bay is also highly prospective for base and precious metals. These preliminary targets are very encouraging, and we are looking forward to finalising the interpretation. I am delighted to see that the thorough work done by the technical team results in high-quality targets being generated. The early and systematic campaigns of data collection have already strengthened our exploration portfolio and are a testimony to our drive and ambition to make a significant discovery in the region,\" commented President and CEO Jonathan Buick.</p><p>Figure 1: Interpreted conductive units from the 2022 VLF-EM survey</p><p>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8681/170081_618c33a66488e9bd_001full.jpg\">https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8681/170081_618c33a66488e9bd_001full.jpg</url></p><p>A preliminary review of the TDEM data reveals that discrete late-time conductive anomalies possibly indicative of bedrock massive sulphide mineralisation are present within the interpreted ultramafic horizons (Figure 2). An update will be provided when ongoing processing, modelling, and interpretation of the final TDEM data is completed. Targets generated will be evaluated on the ground concurrent with the planned exploration efforts for lithium-bearing pegmatites once fieldwork resumes.</p><p>Figure 2.

Also feeling the heat, Canada's west coast. Here's BC bureau chief Melanie Nagy.</p><p>MELANIE NAGY (Reporter): Searing heat is scorching several US states, with California once again one of the hardest hit. Take the already notoriously hot Death Valley. Average temperatures this time of year typically hover around 40 degrees. Today they're above 50.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It's abnormally hot for September.</p><p>NAGY: Large parts of the state are under excessive heat warnings as soaring temperatures smash records, and fuelled new wildfires. Outside of LA, one out of control fire prompted evacuations, and sent several firefighters to hospital with heat exhaustion.</p><p>ROBERT GARCIA (Angeles National Forest Fire Chief): Very rapid fire growth, and very, very explosive fire behaviour.</p><p>NAGY: The September heat wave is also severely straining California's electric grid. As air conditioners are cranked up, there's concern the extra usage could cause rolling blackouts, so people are being asked to conserve energy.</p><p>GAVIN NEWSOM (California Governor): All of us have been trying to outrun Mother Nature, but it's pretty clear that it Mother Nature has outrun us.</p><p>NAGY: Sweltering temperatures have also been impacting large parts of BC. For metro Vancouver, the month of August was record-breaking.</p><p>DEREK LEE (Environment and Climate Change Canada): We experienced our hottest August on record, and it was around two to three degrees warmer than our average.</p><p>NAGY: Along with the heat, there's been little to no rain, particularly on the province's south coast.</p><p>LEE: We only received 15 to 20 percent of the total amount that we would usually expect.</p><p>NAGY: With drought conditions in some areas, people are being asked to reduce water consumption. As for BC's wildfires, officials say there's been less activity this season, but the fire risk is expected to remain high throughout September.

(FESBC) board members were able to see the effectiveness of forest fuel management in action on July 11.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During a day-long tour of different funding projects by FESBC, John Walker, Williams Lake First Nation (WLFN) stewardship forester, brought the group to the site of a forest fire which had been sparked by lightning only a few days before.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This is proof that these things work,\" said Walker.</p><p>Right next to the Williams Lake Sportsmen's Association property, where work had been done the year before by WLFN for fuel management, lightning had struck.</p><p>The lightning had started a wildfire, which was discovered and responded to by firefighters on July 7, 2023.</p><p>Thanks to the work done the year before, the forest in that location had been spaced out, reducing the fuel available for a wildfire to burn, reducing its intensity and the ladder fuels had been removed. Ladder fuels are the low branches and underbrush which allow a fire to move from the ground up into the crowns of trees.</p><p>The spacing had opened up the crowns of the trees to provide space between trees as well, so if a fire did climb up and \"go aerial\" it would be harder for it to go from one tree to another.</p><p>While some might wonder why it isn't better to remove all the trees in these \"fuel breaks\" around communities and structures, Steve Kozuki, executive director of FESBC, explained the shading of the remaining forest is also an asset, reducing the relative humidity, reducing the grass undergrowth and reducing temperatures, all of which slow fire spread.</p><p>While the understory burn to remove more of the fuel still on the ground had not yet been done, the spacing, thinning and removal of ladder fuels still ensured the fire did not grow quickly or burn as intensely and stayed on the ground.</p><p>The firefighters were able to relatively easily control and extinguish the fire, reducing the amount of time it would have taken to fight the fire and preventing what could have been a much more volatile fire situation.</p><p>It was just one of the locations the group toured that day, taking in another similar fuel reduction project near Felker Lake, where WLFN was able to treat an area for a fuel break alongside another project they were doing work on and combine efforts to reduce costs and increase the effectiveness of both projects.</p><p>In one PhD. project in the Williams Lake Community Forest, a study of tree rings revealed the historic cycle was for the area to experience a fire on the landscape every two to 15 years. Most of those fires were low-intensity fires, with the occasional high-intensity burn. But for over the last 100 years, fire has been excluded from the landscape, allowing the forest fuels to build up and the forest to become much more dense.</p><p>WLFN Kukpi7 (Chief) Willie Sellars visited two of the projects with the group and spoke about how important it is to mitigate the risk of wildfires and the concerns in the community after 2017 every time there is smoke or fire in the area.</p><p>\"Historically we were much better stewards of our lands in our traditional territories,\" he said, noting how this began to change when forests began being viewed as a commodity. He celebrated the progress which has been made in the recent decades in terms of integrating the knowledge of elders and a more holistic approach.</p><p>He said it is a big step forward now as industry, different levels of government and First Nations are now all taking part in the discussion and he celebrated the work which has been done together to make the community safer.</p><p>\"We do have some great people that are really leading the charge on behalf of our community,\" he said.</p><p>Kozuki said the goal of the landscape fuel break is also largely to restore a more resilient forest, closer to what would have existed historically.</p><p>\"I believe timber is the by-product of doing forest management,\" said Walker, as he explained other benefits to the project, including habitat enhancement, noting how much he has learned along the way. An elder tour the day before had shown him the value the community puts on the other byproducts of opening up the forest like more traditional plants.</p><p>\"When a Saskatoon bush was there, the tour stopped,\" he laughed, noting they need a more open forest for those.</p><p>\"It's about finding that balance,\" said Sellars, between stewardship and economic benefits.</p><p>Ken Day, a retired forester and board member of FESBC said the success they are seeing now in these projects he attributes to the \"really good collaboration in the Cariboo where everybody in this plan area has been gathering for years to discuss priorities.\"</p><p>The fuel treatment in the Felker Lake area is planned for a large-scale burn in the fall and will include some treated areas and some which will just be burned, conditions permitting.</p><p>Kozuki noted how in the southern part of the province where timber values are higher due to longer growing season and bigger timber, the same type of projects can pay for themselves, but in areas like the Cariboo, government has a role in supporting these projects in order to protect communities.</p><p>One challenge mentioned by FESBC was with these plans looking 20 to 40 years out, shorter political cycles can impact long-term funding and planning.</p><p>Kozuki mentioned stocking standards can impact this type of project as well, but overall, the group was very positive about what they saw, with Day pointing out the thinned trees were well-selected as good timber stock for future harvest moving forward.</p><p>\"This is a win and a win and a win and we don't get to score that way very often, not in this business,\" said Day. \"We will grow more timber on fewer trees.\"</p><p>READ MORE: $2 million aimed at helping reduce slash burning, wildfire risk and habitat in Chilcotin</p><p>READ MORE: COLUMN: How local British Columbians are driving change in B.C.'s forests</p><p>Do you have a comment about this story? email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ruth.lloyd@wltribune.comLike\">ruth.lloyd@wltribune.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Williams Lake Tribune</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-news20230715PWL4492284</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68PN-8TH1-F0HF-8038-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1008\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

However, as we head into traditionally busy months of summer, we must also be prepared for wildfires in the U.S.\"</p><p>A total of 649 U.S. personnel have been cycled through Canada since early May as the country contends with a wildfire season that started far earlier than usual and is expected to land in the history books before it's all over.</p><p>That number doesn't include state-level resources that are also assisting, the agency says: provinces and states have numerous regional \"compacts\" to allow them to share firefighters and equipment without needing to make a federal request.</p><p>More than 100 firefighters and support workers have been sent separately to Alberta, Nova Scotia and Quebec so far this year, along with four airtankers from Alaska and Washington state.</p><p>A 17-person suppression crew with members from Connecticut, New York, Maine and New Hampshire was also assembled to help Nova Scotia, and a hand crew is currently being put together to send to Quebec.</p><p>Forest fires in Canada wouldn't normally generate many headlines in the U.S., but the smoke they've been producing has been drifting south, triggering air quality alerts and sending social media into a feeding frenzy.</p><p>\"Welcome to hell, New York,\" declared a Times Square billboard for the new video game Diablo IV \u2014 a product far less frightening than the smoggy, grey-orange sky in the background.</p><p>\"Eh!pocalypse now,\" read the front page of Thursday's edition of the tabloid New York Post, above an all-caps headline urging readers to \"Blame Canada!\"</p><p>The smoke triggered purple and maroon air quality alerts \u2014 \"very unhealthy\" and \"hazardous,\" respectively \u2014 throughout the mid-Atlantic region Thursday, including in Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.</p><p>But cooler temperatures and a stiff breeze helped mitigate the risk Friday as alerts gradually began to ease back to more manageable levels.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre is in constant contact with its U.S. counterpart and is going to need more help for the next little while, said spokesperson Jennifer Kamau.</p><p>\"We are in continued conversations with our American partners and do have a tentative (mobilization) scheduled for next week,\" Kamau said, though numbers won't be available until the plan is confirmed.</p><p>It's still too soon to know what resources might be needed in the coming weeks, or indeed whether Canada will be asked to return the favour anytime soon.</p><p>\"These situations can evolve rapidly,\" Kamau said. \"It would be hard to tell what the fire situation and availability will be like if or when a need arises from one of our international partners.\"</p><p>To be sure, the smoke has been hard not to notice in the U.S. capital, where President Joe Biden has repeatedly cited the pollution as evidence of encroaching climate change and urged residents to take precautions.</p><p>Republicans, on the other hand, are using Canada's fire season to argue for additional federal resources, as well as a more aggressive approach to forest management.</p><p>\"It is a sobering reminder that we must manage our forests to make them more resilient to catastrophic fires,\" Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told a hearing Thursday of the Senate energy committee where he's ranking member.</p><p>More than 32,000 square kilometres of wildlands burned each year between 2017 and 2022, Barrasso said \u2014 double the average annual amount of damage in the 1990s.</p><p>The cost of fire suppression climbed to more than $4 billion in 2021, up from an annual average of $2.86 billion during the previous five years, he added.</p><p>\"It is unsustainable to keep throwing more and more money and resources at suppression without dramatically increasing mitigation,\" Barrasso said. \"Waiting for our forests and communities to burn is not a defensible strategy.\"</p><p>Both sides, however, appear to agree that more wildfires are in North America's future.</p><p>\"As climate change accelerates, difficult-to-suppress wildfires are becoming our new normal. There is no more 'wildfire season,' it's a year-round threat,\" said Sara Kangas, a spokesperson for the group American Forests.</p><p>The Biden administration has spent nearly $20 billion on fire prevention and recovery to date through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, Kangas added.</p><p>\"We're working hand-in-hand with the administration and its agencies to implement climate-adapted forest management as quickly as possible through best available science,\" Kangas said.</p><p>\"Workforce capacity and nursery and seedling capacity will continue to be problems both in preventing catastrophic wildfires and in recovering from them.\"</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230611PAB4480739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68FD-8H41-F0HF-800S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

The fire season runs from April 1 to Oct. 31 each year.<br/><br/> The fire danger rating is determined using the Fire Weather Index, an internationally used method for determining the risk of fires in open air. It uses factors such as the relative humidity, temperature, previous 24-hour rain amount, wind directions and wind speed in combination with the forest fuel type and loads to determine the risk of the forest to certain fire types.<br/><br/> For the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Fire Danger Rating, visit click here.

It was turned off after a ten minute test, as work is still being carried on at the dam, strengthening it and filling in the front. It will be about a month before the water system is completed and then it is expected that both water and light will be in quantity and quality unsurpassed. 'Tis better to go slow than be sorry.^</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Men Wanted: Some of the companies are in want of men in Cariboo, and good men, capable miners, are scarce. It is stated that a number of men will have to be brought up from the coast to supply the demand on some of the properties. As the same scarcity is reported in the Kootenays it looks very well for the labouring men of British Columbia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clinton: A quiet wedding took place here between W.M. Houston, the well known stage driver, and Miss Annie McInnes, of Alexandria. Miss McInnes is one of Alexandria's most charming and accomplished daughters. We wish their union of life to be one of blessed happiness and prosperity, coupled with many years.</p><p>Saucy Boys: Some of our small boys in Ashcroft are inclined at times to be too forward toward their elders. The boys mean no harm and are good hearted children. A village like this is not the best of places for training children. We older ones should remember that all were once young, but the tendency that exists among some of our small boys to be saucy should be so far as possible checked by the parents. In time they will see the folly of too much slang and roughness, nevertheless all boys should be taught that they can be gentlemen even if only small boys.</p><p>100 YEARS AGO: SEPT. 1, 1923</p><p>C.N.R. Jumps Track: C.N.R. No. 1 struck a mud slide at Seddell, nine miles west of Spences Bridge, last night and the engine rolled into the river. Trucks of the express car left the rails, but no passengers were injured. The Engineer had a broken arm and the fireman suffered a broken leg. Of four men stealing a ride, one was killed, one is missing, and two were injured. All injured were taken to Kamloops hospital, but it is not expected that any will prove fatal.</p><p>Interior Roads Best: Mr. A.C. Whaley, C.P.R. agent at Lytton, recently motored from Lytton to Spokane via Lillooet, Marble Canyon, Cache Creek, Kamloops, and Okanagan. He reports that the road between Lytton and Cache Creek was in better condition than any other on the entire route. This is a good compliment to the roads in the Lillooet district.</p><p>A Monster Petition: A petition which it is estimated will contain fifty thousand signatures, and which will be a record for the province of British Columbia, as well as an event of historical importance, is being circulated for signatures throughout the interior covering the Cariboo, Lillooet, Yale, and Kamloops districts, and south as far as Nelson and Penticton, urging the government to build the Coast-Interior highway via the Fraser Canyon. The enthusiasm is so great in the northern section of the province for the restoration of the old Cariboo road that delegates are scouring the whole country for signers. At Boston Bar and North Bend alone over 200 signatures have been secured. This monster petition will be presented to parliament at the opening of the house in October and is expected to carry such weight that the government will have no other alternative than to follow the Fraser and Thompson rivers in the construction of the highway to the interior.</p><p>Hop Picking: The Indians of the district are preparing for the annual exodus to the hop fields of Agassiz and Chilliwack. The crop is reported to be extra heavy and a large number of pickers will be required. It is of great benefit to the Indians to have this highly remunerated work, in which whole families can participate.</p><p>Walhachin Notes: Yes, we have no bananas \u2014 we mean news \u2014 this week. Not much, at least.</p><p>75 YEARS AGO: SEPT. 2, 1948</p><p>Professor In Search Of Old Songs: Professor H. Hughes and wife passed through Ashcroft on Friday last week on their way up country to interview old-timers of the Cariboo on the existence of old songs and jingles of the district. Mr. Hughes spent Thursday night and Friday in Ashcroft securing additional leads and names and verifying facts from Ashcroft residents. Already some good finds have been made, but the words to the old freighters' song \"Freighting on the Cariboo Road\" are proving elusive. Does anyone know the words? It was sung to the tune of \"Climbing Up the Golden Stairs\". Professor Hughes' trip this year is wholly explanatory to convince the Humanities' Research Council and the University of British Columbia that Cariboo ballads do exist. They will spend all next summer recording the actual songs that they will recover this year.</p><p>Accommodation Needed For Teachers: Teachers have been appointed to the various schools in Ashcroft School District No. 30. Temporary accommodation is badly needed in Clinton and Ashcroft until new buildings are erected, which will be finished before the snow flies.</p><p>Ashcroft Locals: Freddy Robertson of the Cariboo Garage returned from Vancouver a few days ago driving a new school bus that will be used to convey children from Cache Creek and the Manor who will attend the Ashcroft school. Fred will be driver of the bus and there will be about 20 children altogether.</p><p>Ashcroft Cannery: The cannery is running at full capacity making tomato juice. They expect to start peeling next week for canned tomatoes.</p><p>50 YEARS AGO: AUG. 30, 1973</p><p>Spences Bridge Annual Derby: The Spences Bridge and Dist. Chamber of Commerce is again sponsoring an annual Steelhead Derby which will be in effect from Sept. 15, 1973 to Feb. 28, 1974. First prize will be a trophy, and several hidden weight prizes are also being offered. This event draws many contestants from the Lower Mainland and Interior B.C. as well as local fishing enthusiasts. Fishermen are requested to weigh every fish caught to be eligible for the hidden weight prizes. Weigh in at Acacia Grove, Shaw Springs, Sportsman Shell, G. and E. Asst*d, and Ellingsen's Store. The derby is open to everyone and no entry fee is charged.</p><p>Walhachin: After only a month of darkness, the street light at the Hall has finally been replaced. This speedy service required just two phone calls and a tantrum. The town phone lines were also repaired Friday afternoon after having been out of order for over 24 hours. These constant breakdowns couldn't possibly be caused because the system is overloaded, could they?</p><p>Campfire Ban Lifted: Campfire bans were lifted in the Kamloops and Nelson forest districts as cooler weather has decreased the fire hazard, the forestry department reported. The number of fires burning in the Kamloops district has been reduced to 38 from 49 Monday. Manpower has been reduced to 42 men as most of the fires are in the mop-up stages, said forestry protection officer Al McPherson. Unless the area experiences another hot spell the forest fire situation looks pretty good, he says. \"There will of course be more fires, but fires are easier to handle in the current weather conditions. It's not as hard to handle a fire now as it is on hot, windy days. It looks as though we're over the hump.\"</p><p>Copyright 2023 Ashcroft Cache Creek Journal</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASHCCJ-news20230830PAS4508942</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASHCCJ2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:692J-MNR1-F0HF-800V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1218\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Options include Fort Nelson, in northern British Columbia, or Hay River to the east.  </p><p>Each of those requires a round trip of at least half a day \u2013 or much more than that, depending on where you start \u2013 and that's if you can make the commute, which for many residents isn't an option. </p><p>\u201cA lot of our Elders rely on the bank for accessing money for essential needs, such as food, rent, clothing, medicine, tobacco \u2013 there\u2019s some challenges there with our Elders using debit cards,\u201d said Antoine. \u201cThere\u2019s some Elders that are having trouble putting food on the table, paying bills, paying rent, clothing, medicines, and taking care of their loved ones as well.\u201d </p><p>The issue ripples out, affecting residents who need to spend time preparing for the coming winter. </p><p>\u201cThis is a time of year when a lot of our people and our Elders try to get out on the land, to harvest food for the whole winter,\u201d said Antoine.  </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not able to access their own funds and it\u2019s making it very difficult for them to plan traditional harvesting activities. It hinders our self-sufficiency and our self-reliance. It\u2019s got an impact on our cultural practices and our customs. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating for us to see all this unfold. Our people in this day and age, especially our Elders in their twilight years, are trying to pass on their knowledge to the younger people and their families \u2013 and just seeing that not be able to happen is heartbreaking.\" </p><p>When the region is cash-depleted, people who do odds-and-ends jobs are out of luck.  </p><p>For some in Fort Simpson, Rowe\u2019s Recycling Depot is a source of side cash, but there are others who rely on the income to afford essentials. With the bank out of action, the recycling depot has closed its doors because it ran out of cash. </p><p>\u201cA lot of people do depend on the bottle depot, say, for on-hand cash,\u201d said Diane Harold, office manager at Rowe\u2019s Recycling Depot. \u201cYou have your regular customers that, you know, they do it quite faithfully.\u201d </p><p>One resident of Wrigley came to Fort Simpson to cash a $1,000 cheque. After three earlier attempts by his brother to cash the cheque, this resident \u2013 who asked not to be identified \u2013 was determined to make sure it happens this time around. </p><p>He\u2019s now staying at a hotel in town until the bank opens, facing a dilemma: he can\u2019t pay the hotel and leave until he cashes his cheque, and he can\u2019t cash his cheque until the bank reopens. He's racking up a higher and higher bill for his stay in Fort Simpson \u2013 one that\u2019ll be taken off his cheque once it\u2019s finally cashed. </p><p>It\u2019s not clear whether CIBC grasps the urgency of the situation. </p><p>With limited cash on hand, leaving Fort Simpson gets complicated. Water levels are low \u2013 really low. The water level currently reads 1.9 metres at the Liard River ferry crossing, according to Environment Canada\u2019s Hydrometric index. Sean Whelly, the mayor of Fort Simpson, has previously indicated that 1.8 metres is a crucial number when assessing potential ferry closures.  </p><p>That means the ferry may well close early this year, temporarily cutting off the route to any other bank until the ice road comes in. </p><p>\u201cThe people who have the least ability to weather this are the ones that are suffering the most,\u201d said Whelly. \u201cWe need CIBC to realize they have a social responsibility here in this community.\u201d </p><p>Whelly has heard many reasons why the branch hasn\u2019t reopened. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of staffing issues, the evacuation of Yellowknife, and difficulties in getting cash into Fort Simpson,\u201d he said. According to Whelly, there is one CIBC employee currently working at the Fort Simpson branch. However, one employee is not allowed to operate alone, which has forced the branch to close. </p><p>This past July, one resident of Fort Simpson applied to a job at the branch, but was turned away by the manager. \u201cShe said: 'No, we\u2019re not taking applications in person. You\u2019ve got to apply online,\u2019\u201d recalled Josh Campbell, the applicant. </p><p>\u201cI was frustrated and I didn\u2019t follow up ... I took my time and went to see you. I gave you my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter,\" he said, describing his feelings toward the bank. \"Why couldn\u2019t they accept it?\u201d </p><p>Maintaining staff at any northern business is a challenge, but Fort Simpson resident Anna Pontikis McLeod, who said she had formerly worked as a TD Canada Trust manager, questioned whether CIBC was paying enough to fill vacancies. </p><p>\u201cThe problem is, the CIBC doesn\u2019t pay northern rates. So, a secretary here in the Northwest Territories for the GNWT could make more than a banker,\u201d said Pontikis McLeod.  </p><p>The bank's pay scale in Fort Simpson could not be immediately verified. An advertisement for a job at the Fort Simpson branch, found online, promised a \"competitive salary\" and incentive pay, alongside a range of benefits, but did not mention any form of northern living allowance or isolation pay. </p><p>Pontikis McLeod said the bank's closures have been an issue for virtually the entire year. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been more than two weeks,\" she said. \"It\u2019s been off and on for more than seven months.\u201d   </p><p>And with communities totally reliant on digital transactions when the branch isn't open, another issue arises. </p><p>More than 100 km east of Fort Simpson, a wildfire is burning along the highway near Trout River. The fibre-optic line connecting Fort Simpson to the wider world runs along that highway and does so above ground, suspended on poles, beside that stretch of road. </p><p>Should the fire damage that cable, residents would have no way to access money. </p><p>\u201cLiterally, we\u2019d have nothing. There\u2019d be no business going on here at all,\u201d said Whelly. </p><p>\u201cThat can happen in a heartbeat right now, and we had it happen once already this summer.\u201d </p><p>Last week, Antoine raised his concerns to CIBC in a letter. To date, he said on Monday, he has received no response. </p><p>\"The frustration and inconvenience experienced by our community members have led to growing discontent with CIBC,\" Antoine's letter read in part.  </p><p>\"We have always valued our partnership with them. But the extended closure of the branch without clear communication has eroded our confidence in the bank\u2019s commitment to serving our community.\u201d </p><p>Whelly planned to address the issue at a council meeting on Monday night, and said he intends to write a letter from council to CIBC. </p><p>One Fort Simpson resident said she had filed an urgent complaint with CIBC\u2019s head office and was told the expected date of reopening would be a month away. </p><p>Cabin Radio asked CIBC\u2019s head office when residents should expect services to resume. </p><p>Tom Wallis, a spokesperson for the bank, replied: \u201cOur team is taking this extraordinary and difficult situation very seriously, and acting urgently to restore full banking services to the community.  </p><p>\"This includes plans to re-supply the ATM in the coming days and adding new team members at the local banking centre, who are expected to start shortly.\u201d </p><p>In a later email, Wallis clarified: \u201cOur team is working hard and expects to reopen the banking centre this week.\u201d  </p><p>However, no commitment was made to reimburse residents and businesses who took a financial loss as a result of the bank\u2019s closure. </p><p>\"We need to take a good, hard look at who's willing to provide us a service that we can trust,\" said Antoine.  </p><p>\"We need to explore alternative financial solutions.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-0915ef10a8bd438e8ce22284afffe2c6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:696N-GGP1-DY9S-T133-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1399\"/><timeReceived>10:46 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 18, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Tapping the ubiquitous Aleppo pines for their resin, the viscous, sticky substance the trees use to protect themselves from insects and disease, provided a key source of income for hundreds of families.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But now, hardly any forest is left. A devastating wildfire, one of Greece\u2019s most destructive single blazes in decades, rampaged across northern Evia for days earlier this month, swallowing woodland, homes and businesses and sending thousands fleeing. </p><p>The damage won\u2019t just affect this year\u2019s crop, resin collectors and beekeepers say, but for generations to come.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all over. Everything has turned to ash,\u201d said Christos Livas, a 48-year-old resin collector and father of four. </p><p>Resin has been used by humans since antiquity and is found today in a dizzyingly broad array of products, from paint and solvents to pharmaceuticals, plastics and cosmetics. The north of Evia, Greece's second-largest island, accounted for around 80% of the pine resin produced in Greece, and about 70% of the pine honey, locals say. </p><p>Satellite imagery shows the wildfire destroyed most of the island's north. The devastation is breathtaking. Tens of thousands of hectares of forests and farmland were reduced to a dystopian landscape of skeletal, blackened trees silhouetted against a smoke-filled sky.</p><p>For trees to grow back to the point where resin can be extracted will take more than two decades, and probably twice as long for the production of pine honey.</p><p>\u201cIn 10 years, the forest will become green again,\u201d Livas said. \u201cBut for tapping, it will take 20, 25 years. For me, it\u2019s all over. Even for a 30-year-old - what\u2019s he going to do, find a job and then come back when he\u2019s 50, 60 to tap pines? His legs won\u2019t even hold him.\u201d</p><p>Livas walked through the still smoldering remnants of the forest on the outskirts of his mountain village of Agdines, puffs of white and grey ash rising from beneath his boots as he surveyed the damage.</p><p>\u201cThis one, I remember since I was a young boy, from 15 years old,\u201d he said, pointing to a blackened pine, the strip of peeled bark where resin had been extracted still visible. \u201cThis must have been tapped for 32, 33 years.\u201d </p><p>Most of his livelihood has literally gone up in smoke, lost in a horrifying roar as the giant wildfire raced toward the village. </p><p>\u201cYou could hear a rumble....It was like an earthquake,\u201d Livas said.</p><p>The flames moved fast, leaving no time to collect the thousands of plastic bags pinned to the trees to gather the precious resin. Instead, local residents turned their attention to the village, ignoring an evacuation order and staying to save their homes. </p><p>They managed. But they couldn\u2019t save the forest. And the villagers' anger - at the government for not sending more firefighters sooner, for ordering evacuations when they say locals could have helped fight the flames - is palpable.</p><p>Livas had been extracting resin from about 3,000 trees, producing about 9-10 tons per year at 27 euro cents (32 cents) per kilogram. Of all the trees he was tapping, just one survived.</p><p>He supplemented his income by farming olive trees, raising animals and occasionally logging. But there are no trees to log now, and most of the olive trees are gone too. </p><p>\u201cI have nowhere left. Everywhere I\u2019ve been, everything is burnt,\u201d he said. </p><p>With four young children to support, the eldest just 13, Livas said he\u2019d look for new kinds of work. But with only a primary school education and unable to read or write, he seemed overwhelmed by the thought. The forest, farming, and collecting resin, which he\u2019s been doing since he was 15, are all he\u2019s ever known.</p><p>\u201cWhat will I do now?\u201d he said, stumbling for words. \u201cI\u2019ll look for a job. What will I do? Do I know what to do now?\u201d</p><p>Others were even worse off, he said. Some had several family members collecting resin, gathering around 30-40 tons a year. There were entire villages in northern Evia working almost exclusively in resin collection. </p><p>Fellow villager Antonis Natsios felt the same. He started collecting resin at the age of 12, learning the technique from his father, who had learned it from his father before him. </p><p>Now 51 and with three children, two of them in college, Natsios is unsure how he\u2019ll make ends meet. Some of his fig trees were singed but would probably survive and produce a new crop, he said, and about 20% of his olive trees remained. But of the pine trees, his main source of income, \u201czero. Not even a branch.\u201d</p><p>He sees few options. \u201cEither the state, or God, if he helps. Or migration,\u201d Natsios said.</p><p>The government has vowed to compensate all those affected by the fire. But nothing can make up for the loss of the source of their livelihoods for decades to come, the residents of north Evia say. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve lost everything for the next 30-40 years,\u201d said beekeeper Makis Balalas, 44, who relied on Evia's forests for pine honey each year. The forest's destruction, he said, was far worse than the loss of any beehives.</p><p>\u201cI can create new beehives,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this that has been lost, you can\u2019t create that again.\u201d</p><p>For Natsios, it's the loss of the forest he grew up in that pains him the most.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the future, it\u2019s what we see. When you\u2019ve been living something for 50 years and now you see this thing, this charcoal...\" he trails off. \u201cNow I, who was born in this forest, I have to breathe this blackness.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP's coverage of climate change issues at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-dbc7ae10b90692a558a4c551c8a5a97a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63F1-NN31-JBVR-3352-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><timeReceived>05:40 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 22, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

However, as we head into traditionally busy months of summer, we must also be prepared for wildfires in the U.S.\"</p><p>A total of 649 U.S. personnel have been cycled through Canada since early May as the country contends with a wildfire season that started far earlier than usual and is expected to land in the history books before it's all over. </p><p>That number doesn't include state-level resources that are also assisting, the agency says: provinces and states have numerous regional \"compacts\" to allow them to share firefighters and equipment without needing to make a federal request.  </p><p>More than 100 firefighters and support workers have been sent separately to Alberta, Nova Scotia and Quebec so far this year, along with four airtankers from Alaska and Washington state. </p><p>A 17-person suppression crew with members from Connecticut, New York, Maine and New Hampshire was also assembled to help Nova Scotia, and a hand crew is currently being put together to send to Quebec. </p><p>Forest fires in Canada wouldn't normally generate many headlines in the U.S., but the smoke they've been producing has been drifting south, triggering air quality alerts and sending social media into a feeding frenzy. </p><p>\"Welcome to hell, New York,\" declared a Times Square billboard for the new video game Diablo IV \u2014 a product far less frightening than the smoggy, grey-orange sky in the background. </p><p>\"Eh!pocalypse now,\" read the front page of Thursday's edition of the tabloid New York Post, above an all-caps headline urging readers to \"Blame Canada!\" </p><p>The smoke triggered purple and maroon air quality alerts \u2014 \"very unhealthy\" and \"hazardous,\" respectively \u2014 throughout the mid-Atlantic region Thursday, including in Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.</p><p>But cooler temperatures and a stiff breeze helped mitigate the risk Friday as alerts gradually began to ease back to more manageable levels. </p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre is in constant contact with its U.S. counterpart and is going to need more help for the next little while, said spokesperson Jennifer Kamau. </p><p>\"We are in continued conversations with our American partners and do have a tentative (mobilization) scheduled for next week,\" Kamau said, though numbers won't be available until the plan is confirmed. </p><p>It's still too soon to know what resources might be needed in the coming weeks, or indeed whether Canada will be asked to return the favour anytime soon. </p><p>\"These situations can evolve rapidly,\" Kamau said. \"It would be hard to tell what the fire situation and availability will be like if or when a need arises from one of our international partners.\" </p><p>To be sure, the smoke has been hard not to notice in the U.S. capital, where President Joe Biden has repeatedly cited the pollution as evidence of encroaching climate change and urged residents to take precautions. </p><p>Republicans, on the other hand, are using Canada's fire season to argue for additional federal resources, as well as a more aggressive approach to forest management. </p><p>\"It is a sobering reminder that we must manage our forests to make them more resilient to catastrophic fires,\" Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told a hearing Thursday of the Senate energy committee where he's ranking member. </p><p>More than 32,000 square kilometres of wildlands burned each year between 2017 and 2022, Barrasso said \u2014 double the average annual amount of damage in the 1990s. </p><p>The cost of fire suppression climbed to more than $4 billion in 2021, up from an annual average of $2.86 billion during the previous five years, he added. </p><p>\"It is unsustainable to keep throwing more and more money and resources at suppression without dramatically increasing mitigation,\" Barrasso said. \"Waiting for our forests and communities to burn is not a defensible strategy.\"</p><p>Both sides, however, appear to agree that more wildfires are in North America's future. </p><p>\"As climate change accelerates, difficult-to-suppress wildfires are becoming our new normal. There is no more 'wildfire season,' it\u2019s a year-round threat,\" said Sara Kangas, a spokesperson for the group American Forests. </p><p>The Biden administration has spent nearly $20 billion on fire prevention and recovery to date through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, Kangas added. </p><p>\"We're working hand-in-hand with the administration and its agencies to implement climate-adapted forest management as quickly as possible through best available science,\" Kangas said.</p><p>\"Workforce capacity and nursery and seedling capacity will continue to be problems both in preventing catastrophic wildfires and in recovering from them.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 9, 2023. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-b226b7d050e3468c9f62abd04878b138</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68F4-FDJ1-DY9S-T4BT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"927\"/><timeReceived>06:27 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 9, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It was the third multi-homer game of Raleigh\u2019s career and his first this season. He also hit a two-run homer off Anthony Bass in the eighth.</p><p>Taylor Trammell and Tesocar Hern\u00e1ndez also homered for the Mariners, who won for the first time in six extra-inning games this season.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re down like we were, it\u2019s easy to pack it in and say \u2018Hey, it\u2019s not our time up here in Toronto,\u2019\u201d manager Scott Servais said. \u201cOur guys didn\u2019t do that. Credit to them.\u201d</p><p>Paul Sewald (2-0) worked one inning for the win and Canadian Matt Brash pitched the 10th for his first career save, ending it by retiring Vladimir Guerrero to strand a pair of runners.</p><p>\u201cJust a really good win for us,\u201d Brash said.</p><p>Seattle is no stranger to comeback wins in Canada. Last October the Mariners overcame an 8-1 deficit to win Game 2 of their wild card series with Toronto, sweeping the Blue Jays out of the postseason.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about this place,\u201d Brash said.</p><p>Bo Bichette hit a 460-foot home run and Matt Chapman had three hits but Toronto couldn\u2019t hold on.</p><p>Seattle jumped out to a 4-0 lead when Trammell, who was activated off the injured list before the game, hit a grand slam in the first inning.</p><p>Trammell\u2019s homer, his first, gave the Mariners more runs with one swing than they had scored in the previous three games combined. Seattle lost 1-0 at Philadelphia on Thursday, then lost 3-2 Friday and 1-0 Saturday.</p><p>Chapman halved the deficit with a two-run double off Mariners left-hander Marco Gonzales in the bottom of the first, and Bichette put the Blue Jays in front with a mammoth homer in the second. </p><p>Bichette\u2019s homer, his sixth, came off the bat at 113 miles per hour. It landed in the center field party deck, denting the wall where it touched down.</p><p>Danny Jansen hit an RBI double in the third and Santiago Espinal followed with a two-run single, putting Toronto up 8-4.</p><p>Fans cheered when former Blue Jays slugger Hern\u00e1ndez cut it to 8-5 with a solo shot in the sixth, his seventh. They weren\u2019t cheering when Raleigh made it 8-7 by connecting off Bass.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s going to have a bad day,\u201d Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. \u201cToday was missed spots and probably some pitch selection that could have been a little bit different.\u201d</p><p>Seattle tied it in the ninth when Tommy LaStella drew a leadoff walk against right-hander Yimi Garcia. Pinch runner Jose Caballero advanced on a ground ball and scored on Crawford\u2019s two-out single.</p><p>TRAINER\u2019S ROOM</p><p>Mariners: OF Julio Rodr\u00edguez hit in the cage before the game but was held out of the starting lineup. Rodr\u00edguez left in the sixth inning Saturday because of a sore lower back. Seattle is off Monday. \u2026 RHP Easton McGee, who took a no-hitter into the seventh inning in his first big league start Saturday, was placed on the 15-day injured list because of a strained forearm.</p><p>WOAH, CANADA</p><p>In seven career games north of the border, Raleigh is 9 for 27 with a double, five home runs and 10 RBI.</p><p>ROSTER MOVES</p><p>Toronto acquired C Tyler Heineman from Pittsburgh in exchange for INF Vinny Capra and assigned him to Triple-A Buffalo.

However, this will not continue without changes made.</p><p>A number of our long-time and hard-working members have decided to step away after many years of service. Accordingly, we have many gaps in our directorships and even executive positions that need to be filled by our annual meeting occurring Thursday, Nov. 17.</p><p>If a sufficient number of old and new members do not commit to providing the time needed to attend society meetings from January to June of 2023, then the few long-standing current members/directors have no choice but to cancel proceeding on a 2023 Festival. By January, we usually will have paid deposits to headlining bands from outside Quesnel, have circulated a list of corporate sponsors with which to meet and collect in-kind and cash funding, and have participants committed to all our key directorships from corporate fundraising to stage director to parks supervisor and parade manager, etc.</p><p>We have a wonderful group of local businesses who annually provide money or products or services to the society\u2019s festival, so funding is not the main concern, but the lack of people willing to help definitely is.</p><p>If there is a possibility you can spend a few hours monthly doing the work involved in any one directorship as well as actively attending the four days of festival then now is the time to bring your names and information forward to us.</p><p>If not, then a resolution will probably be brought forward at an upcoming meeting to start the process of cancelling our 2023 festival while waiting for more active participation from the Quesnel area residents, which could result in hosting a festival again in 2024.</p><p>If interested in any of the above, contact any society directors you may already know, or leave a message at our office telephone of 250-992-1234 or by email to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:office@billybarkerdays.ca\">office@billybarkerdays.ca</email> or text myself at 250-316-6298 or email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:maureen.murray.1@outlook.com\">maureen.murray.1@outlook.com</email> This information collected will be part of the discussion at our November session.</p><p>Maureen Murray, Souvenir Director and Past President Quesnel Billy Barker Days Society</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20221109PSCA0003122371</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66TV-RMX1-JD2C-J4J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"412\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

It is evident that whatever the city decides, not everyone is going to be happy, and that is a given in most cases.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">McDonald\u2019s may leave its mark on the citizens and visitors in Kimberley, but is it the end of the world or the beginning of Kimberley\u2019s demise? If anything it could be the start of new growth, which the city does need.</p><p>The mayor is right; once a large or small company comes, others will follow. But to think they will all have negative health impacts could be a stretch. If, as stated \u201cWe can choose to welcome the businesses that will move us toward a healthy future we all want.\u201d It is obvious that \u201cwe\u201d will not necessarily include all.</p><p>Are the comments about healthy eating valid? Of course they are. Is there anything positive about eating at a fast food place? Actually there are a few:It gives you the option to eat something instead of skipping a meal.</p><p>Helps you to manage a schedule more effectively.</p><p>The industry provides you with the nutritional information of each item.</p><p>There are more healthy choices at fast food restaurants today than ever before.</p><p>The fast food industry provides a significant economic boost to most communities.</p><p>It is an affordable way to experience new or different food choices.</p><p>On the negative side:It can have a negative impact on your skeletal system over time. But so can driving a car too fast.</p><p>Eating fast food can lead to issues with edema, bloating, and swelling.</p><p>People who eat at fast food restaurants underestimate their calorie intake.</p><p>Fast food can have an adverse impact on the cardiovascular and digestive systems.</p><p>It is true that almost any other option is a better choice than fast food for your regular eating habits because of the high levels of fat, sugar, and salt found in most items. But if used with moderation, getting daily, moderate exercise, and eliminating the sugary sodas from the equation, the impacts of eating at a fast food place can be reduced.</p><p>Another point to seriously consider is, don\u2019t you think we should give parents credit for looking after their kids and making choices to keep them healthy and active. Nowadays it seems if it isn\u2019t endorsed by some health expert we shouldn\u2019t be doing it.</p><p>As far as the environmental impact of \u201canother\u201d gas station let\u2019s consider a few facts. The primary cause of the global diversity crisis is human induced alterations and loss of natural habitat. Housing development also has a detrimental effect to adjacent green spaces or protected areas. Most would probably agree housing is an issue, not just in Kimberley but Canada wide and it isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. But housing development isn\u2019t a panacea to the problem.</p><p>If anything, housing development increases impervious surfaces and risk of fire, which in turn spreads pollutants, changes nutrients and biological cycles. Changing land use and removing natural land cover introduces barriers to wildlife movements. Wow! Does that mean more or fewer deer in Kimberley? When it\u2019s all over it does add to the merits of living in Kimberley. But I forget to mention, first you have to cut all the trees down to make room for development, and then spend money to grow more trees, and then be afraid of a forest fire. And worse, if all the firefighters are at McDonald\u2019s \u2013 you lose everything.</p><p>On a more serious note:Like many I have concerns about new development in Kimberley, not with hampering growth but with safety. As Kimberley grows, and it will, there needs to be serious consideration for traffic signals on the Highway intersection, between the Marysville School /proposed Day Care, activity at the area, Fire Hall and new development in the area. That particular intersection is an accident looking to happen. And it will.</p><p>Final comments. Nowadays everything seems to be based on a new study. Not long ago fast food places where blamed for obesity, later another study said it wasn\u2019t, and the list goes on. Every study is right until another study proves it wrong.</p><p>The kids of today have the solution:A new study states:Kids would rather learn from smart robots than less smart humans.</p><p>Ron Kerr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIMDBU-news20230404PPLA0003469780</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIMDBU2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67XX-8531-F0HF-81G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May 2021, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Monday, Nov. 20, 2023, 22 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022 the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> (NEW: NOV. 3, 2023) Cedar Creek, between Runningbrook Drive and Lexicon Drive in Ward 3<br/><br/> Ceremonial Drive, between Chagall Court and Bristol Road West in Ward 5.

President's Message An active fourth quarter of leasing activity capped off another strong year in 2023. PrairieSky entered into 50 leasing arrangements in the quarter earning bonus consideration of $11.2 million, primarily from leasing of Duvernay rights, the highest quarterly bonus consideration earned since 2017. Annual bonus consideration totaled $26.0 million, the highest annual bonus consideration earned since 2017, with PrairieSky entering into 202 leasing arrangements with 110 different counterparties. In both 2022 and 2023, leasing activity was focused on oil targets which has resulted in strong organic oil growth on PrairieSky's royalty properties. PrairieSky averaged a record 12,844 barrels per day of oil royalty production in the quarter which was 6% above Q4 2022. Annually, average oil royalty volumes reached a record 12,438 barrels per day, 6% above 2022. With the incremental Duvernay leasing, we anticipate long-term light oil royalty production growth to complement the growth in heavy oil from PrairieSky's Clearwater and Mannville Stack oil plays. Total royalty production averaged 25,608 BOE per day in the fourth quarter generating royalty production revenue of $122.0 million which combined with $11.2 million of bonus consideration, $2.9 million of lease rentals and $0.5 million of other revenues drove Q4 2023 funds from operations of $111.1 million. Annually, total royalty production averaged 24,857 BOE per day generating $474.6 million in royalty production revenue. Funds from operations totaled $382.5 million for 2023 generated primarily on strong oil royalty production revenue which made up 79% of royalty production revenue combined with $26.0 million in bonus consideration. PrairieSky's annual 2023 dividend was $229.2 million or $0.96 per common share, resulting in an annual payout ratio of 60%. PrairieSky executed on $58.4 million in acquisitions and directed the remainder of funds from operations to retiring bank debt. At December 31, 2023, PrairieSky's net debt totaled $222.1 million, a decrease of 30% from $315.1 million at December 31, 2022. Management believes PrairieSky's business model is uniquely suited to provide sustainable returns to shareholders through all commodity price cycles and we are pleased to announce a 4% dividend increase effective for the March 29, 2024 record date. During Q4 2023, PrairieSky added incremental royalty acreage through $22.2 million in acquisitions which included undeveloped lands in the Mannville Stack oil play. We have focused our acquisition strategy since 2016 on entering early stage plays such as the Clearwater and Mannville Stack. This strategy has driven strong oil royalty production growth and we anticipate these acquisitions will continue to provide strong returns on invested capital. In addition to early-stage opportunities, PrairieSky acquired approximately 67,000 acres of producing and non-producing royalty acreage in Central Alberta for $14.0 million before customary closing adjustments, which closed on December 6, 2023. The acquisition included royalty production volumes of 90 BOE per day (72% liquids) and seismic covering the acquired assets. It was an active fourth quarter on our royalty properties with 197 wells spud, comprised of 184 oil wells, 12 natural gas wells and 1 helium well. Drilling activity in the quarter spanned from Northeast British Columbia to Southwest Manitoba and was focused on oil plays including 44 Clearwater oil wells across our 1.4 million acres of Clearwater acreage, 48 Mannville Stack oil wells and 33 Viking oil wells primarily on fee leases in Saskatchewan. With the level of third-party drilling activity and new leasing, management expects oil royalty production volumes to maintain momentum into 2024. In 2023, there were 805 wells spud, down from 850 wells in 2022. PrairieSky estimates that $2.0 billion (net - $112 million) in third-party capital was spent in 2023 drilling and completing wells on PrairieSky's royalty properties, up from $1.5 billion (net - $84 million) in 2022. Capital spending by third-party operators targeted oil plays, including those where PrairieSky has made strategic investments, with the most active plays being the Clearwater oil play, Mannville Stack heavy oil play and the Viking oil play. We were very pleased with the level of organic growth in oil royalty volumes we have achieved over the last two years and the level of activity across our land base. We anticipate 2024 will continue to be active and we will remain disciplined, focusing on our core strategies of leasing land, managing controllable costs and conducting royalty and land compliance activities. We are pleased to welcome Michael to our team and look forward to working with him to meet our corporate objectives. We would like to thank our shareholders for their support, and our staff for their continued hard work. Andrew Phillips, President &amp;CEO Q4 2023 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS //st * PrairieSky generated funds from operations of $111.1 million or $0.46 per share (basic and diluted) in Q4 2023, an increase of 18% over Q3 2023 and 7% below Q4 2022. The increase in funds from operations over Q3 2023 was driven by a combination of organic growth in oil royalty production volumes and increased bonus consideration earned on new leasing activity. These positive impacts were more than offset by lower WTI and AECO benchmark pricing as compared to Q4 2022. * PrairieSky's royalty production volumes totaled 25,608 BOE per day and generated royalty production revenue of $122.0 million in Q4 2023. A further breakdown is as follows: * PrairieSky achieved record oil royalty production volumes of 12,844 barrels per day, a 6% increase over both Q3 2023 and Q4 2022 as royalty production from new wells on stream more than offset natural declines. Oil royalty production volumes included 24 barrels per day related to acquisitions in the quarter. * Oil royalty production revenue totaled $98.4 million, a decrease of 4% from Q3 2023 as higher royalty production volumes were offset by weaker WTI benchmark pricing and wider light and heavy oil differentials. Oil royalty production revenue was lower than Q4 2022 due to lower WTI benchmark pricing and a wider light oil differential partially offset by stronger royalty production volumes, a narrowed heavy oil differential and a weaker Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar. * Natural gas royalty production volumes averaged 60.4 MMcf per day in Q4 2023, a 6% decrease from Q3 2023 and 9% from Q4 2022 as new wells on stream were offset by natural declines. * Natural gas royalty revenue totaled $12.2 million, a 5% increase over Q3 2023 due to certain royalty volumes being sold at higher Sumas pricing. Natural gas royalty revenue decreased 62% from Q4 2022 when daily AECO pricing averaged $5.11 per mcf and monthly AECO pricing averaged $5.58 per mcf which was more than 50% above Q4 2023 AECO pricing. * NGL royalty production volumes averaged 2,697 barrels per day, flat with both Q3 2023 and Q4 2022 as new wells on stream offset natural declines. * NGL royalty revenue totaled $11.4 million, down 12% from Q3 2023 and 16% from Q4 2022 due to lower benchmark pricing. * PrairieSky generated $11.2 million in bonus consideration in Q4 2023, the highest quarterly bonus consideration earned since 2017, which was earned on entering into 50 new leasing arrangements with 43 different counterparties. PrairieSky earned an incremental $2.9 million in lease rentals and $0.5 million in other revenue in the quarter. Compliance recoveries totaled $2.0 million in Q4 2023. * Cash administrative expenses totaled $5.6 million or $2.38 per BOE, in line with Q4 2022. * PrairieSky declared a dividend of $57.3 million ($0.24 per share) during Q4 2023, representing a 52% payout ratio. Remaining funds from operations were allocated to acquisitions and to retiring bank debt. * During Q4 2023, PrairieSky acquired undeveloped lands in the Mannville Stack as well as incremental producing and non-producing royalty interests and seismic for cash consideration of $22.2 million. ANNUAL FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS //st * PrairieSky generated annual funds from operations of $382.5 million ($1.60 per share basic and diluted), 25% below 2022, as record oil royalty production volumes and strong bonus consideration were more than offset by the negative impacts of lower benchmark commodity pricing. * Royalty production volumes averaged 24,857 BOE per day, flat year over year, as increased oil royalty production volumes were offset by lower natural gas royalty volumes which were negatively impacted during the year due to facility maintenance downtime and forest fire related shut-ins. Average oil royalty production volumes reached a record 12,438 barrels per day, 6% higher than 2022. * PrairieSky achieved total revenues of $513.2 million, comprised of $474.6 million of royalty production revenue and $38.6 million of other revenue. Other revenue included $26.0 million of bonus consideration, the highest annual amount since 2017, earned on entering into 202 new leasing arrangements with 110 counterparties. Compliance recoveries totalled $6.6 million for the year. * Administrative expenses totaled $45.0 million or $4.96 per BOE, below 2022 administrative expenses of $48.8 million or $5.30 per BOE. Cash administrative expenses totaled $47.9 million or $5.28 per BOE higher than 2022 cash administrative expense primarily due to share-based compensation payments, including a termination payment related to a leadership change and a director retirement. * During 2023, PrairieSky completed acquisitions of fee mineral title and GORR interests primarily targeting Mannville Stack heavy oil for $58.4 million. Annually, acquisitions added 35 BOE per day to royalty production volumes. * PrairieSky declared cumulative annual dividends of $229.2 million or $0.96 per share with a resulting annual payout ratio of 60%. * At December 31, 2023, PrairieSky's net debt totaled $222.1 million, a decrease of $93.0 million or 30% from December 31, 2022 net debt of $315.1 million. ACTIVITY ON PRAIRIESKYS ROYALTY PROPERTIES Third-party drilling activity remained strong in Q4 2023 with 197 wells spud on PrairieSky's royalty properties consisting of 95 wells spud on Fee Lands, 93 wells spud on GORR acreage and 9 unit wells spud. Activity was focused on oil targets with 184 wells spud which included 48 Mannville Stack oil wells, 44 Clearwater oil wells, 33 Viking oil wells, 17 Mannville oil wells, 13 Cardium oil wells, 11 Mississippian oil wells, 6 Duvernay oil wells, and 12 additional oil wells spud in the Bakken, Belly River, Charlie Lake, Jurassic and Nisku formations. There were 12 natural gas wells spud in Q4 2023, including 5 Montney natural gas wells, 7 Mannville and Spirit River wells, and 1 helium well. PrairieSky's average royalty rate for wells spud in Q4 2023 was 7.2% (Q4 2022 - 6.4%). Spuds on PrairieSky's royalty properties in 2023 totaled 805 wells, as compared to 850 wells in 2022. The average royalty rate for wells spud in 2023 was 7.2% (2022 - 7.3%). For 2023, PrairieSky estimates that $2.0 billion (net - $112 million) in third-party capital was spent drilling and completing wells on PrairieSky royalty properties, up from $1.5 billion (net capital - $84 million) in 2022, representing a 33% increase in net capital spent on PrairieSky's land base year over year. The increase was primarily a result of inflation in the service sector. ANNUAL DIVIDEND INCREASED 4% TO $1.00 PER SHARE PrairieSky is pleased to announce a 4% increase in its annual dividend to $1.00 per common share in 2024, to be paid on a quarterly basis effective for the March 29, 2024 record date. In determining changes to the dividend level, the Board of Directors considers a number of factors including current and projected activity levels on PrairieSky's royalty lands, the current commodity price environment, the working capital and bank debt balance and net earnings of the Company. 2023 RESERVES INFORMATION PrairieSky's proved plus probable reserves totaled 65,762 MBOE at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - 66,719 MBOE) and include only developed assets (developed producing and developed non-producing properties) and do not include any future development capital on undeveloped lands. Proved plus probable reserves remained relatively flat with 2022, with year over year changes comprised of additions related to third-party drilling and improved recovery (7,111 MBOE), technical additions (971 MBOE), acquisitions (14 MBOE) and economic factors (19 MBOE) less 2023 royalty production volumes of 9,072 MBOE. At December 31, 2023, the before-tax net present value of total proved plus probable reserves, discounted at 10%, decreased 5% to $1.84 billion (2022 - $1.94 billion) primarily as a result of lower near-term natural gas and NGL commodity price assumptions. PrairieSky's year end 2023 reserves were evaluated by independent reserves evaluators GLJ Ltd. The evaluation of PrairieSky's royalty properties was done in accordance with the definitions, standards and procedures contained in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook and National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities.

The planet's average temperature hit new records in the last few days, rising to an unofficial high of 17.18 C on Tuesday and Wednesday, breaking Monday's short-lived record of 17.01 C, according to the University of Maine's Climate Reanalyzer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, has sought to bring attention to the need for greater heat adaptation as Canada is set to experience higher daily temperatures and longer heat waves under climate change.</p><p>Feltmate's research projects that between 2050 and 2080, almost all major Canadian cities will see an increase in maximum daily temperature between 3 C and 5 C, and the number of summer days above 30 Cwill double, triple, or quadruple in some cases. </p><p>In Toronto, that looks like maximum daily temperatures increasing to around 38 C, and the number of days exceeding 30 C rising from 15 to 16 days per summer up to 60.</p><p>\"We need to think of access to cooling as a fundamental human right because if we don't make that provision literally people are going to die, Canadians are going to die, not just in the hundreds but potentially into the thousands,\" said Feltmate. He pointed to extreme heat events that led to more than 600 deaths in B.C. in 2021 and more than 80 deaths in Quebec City in 2018.</p><p>\"As hot as it is now, and (Wednesday) set a new global record for the planet in terms of overall temperature, things are going to get hotter going forward.\"</p><p>Feltmate said there are approximately 500,000 people in the Greater Toronto Area who live in apartment buildings that are at least 40 years old and eight storeys or higher. If a major heat wave happened to coincide with an extended electricity outage, residents of those buildings could be without air conditioning, fans, elevator access or even water flow. </p><p>\"The results could be lethal,\" he said.</p><p>Avoiding those deadly situations requires immediate steps to reduce heat stress. Feltmate said that could look like backup electricity generation for a couple of days for all apartment buildings, or subsidies for small,portable air conditioners,similar to a new B.C. program offering such ACs to low-income households.</p><p>Awnings over windows, window glazing to limit direct sunlight, trees and vines planted in and around buildings to provide shade can all reduce the impact of heat on residential buildings, Feltmate said. </p><p>Improving insulation and airtightness can also cut heating and cooling costs, he said.</p><p>Municipalities should play a large part in improving cooling access, he said, in particular to mitigate the \"heat-island effect,\" in which urban areas are significantly warmer than surrounding areas. Dark and tarred buildings, roads and other infrastructure absorb and retain more heat from the sun than natural landscapes, contributing to warming between 3 and 5 C.</p><p>The heat-island effect could be combated with white, \"cool\" roofs or more trees and vegetation, among other design considerations.</p><p>But these actions require a combined response from all levels of government, particularly on the federal level, Feltmate said, as cities and towns would be better equipped to make such changes if directed by Ottawa.</p><p>Last week, Canada released its new national climate adaptation strategy, which will tie future federal infrastructure transfers to the provinces to projects that incorporate adaptation efforts. </p><p>One of the targets is for 80 per cent of health regions to have a plan to protect people from extreme heat by 2026, something officials said could include making sure there are adequate cooling centres available during heat waves. Another is the elimination of all heat-related deaths by 2040.</p><p>Some municipalities are getting ahead of the curve. Hamilton is poised to become one of Canada's first municipalities to require landlords install air conditioning to ensure indoor temperatures don't exceed 26 C, after an \"adequate temperature\" bylaw was passed by council in May.</p><p>Changes can't come fast enough for people most vulnerable to extreme heat, such as those who live and work outside and are already bearing the brunt of climate change, advocates say.</p><p>Chris Ramsaroop, an organizer with advocacy group Justice for Migrant Workers, called on Ontario to enact immediate emergency measures to protect the province's farm workers from the heat, including sheltering and cooling periods, access to free water, shade requirements and shutting down farms in extreme crisis events.</p><p>He said many of those workers, who fear threat of deportation for speaking out, are facing hot working conditions in greenhouses and are experiencing headaches and near-fainting due to the heat, but have been expected to keep up theregular pace of work.</p><p>\"It's imperative the province enact steps and measures to protect all workers who have to endure this heat,\" said Ramsaroop. </p><p>In a statement, provincial Labour Minister Monte McNaughton called Ontario's farm workers \"heroes\" who are protected by health and safety laws, \"regardless of their passport.\"</p><p>\"As we experience increasing heat waves and the hazards of forest fire smoke, and a changing nature of outdoor work, we will not hesitate to take further action to protect those who put food on the table for families across our province,\" he said. The Ministry of Labour added it conducts inspections to ensure employers are meeting health and safety standards and urged workers who feel unsafe to report their concerns.</p><p>In response to this week's heat alert, Toronto activated its Heat Relief Network, which includes cooling locations such as libraries, community centres, private malls and municipal pools. </p><p>However, community worker and longtime advocate for the homeless, Diana Chan McNally, said many of those spaces are inappropriate for people experiencing homelessness, who may be subjected to harassment.</p><p>\"Having an unhoused adult, for example, cool off in a children's splash pad is obviously going to set off some alarm bells,\" she said, criticizing the city for not having dedicated emergency cooling centres as it did in the past.</p><p>The City of Toronto said it \"recognizes the need for additional services to help meet the complex needs of those living outdoors during heat warnings but the city continues to face significant financial pressures.\"</p><p>Chan McNally said emergency weather will come in all seasons, so there needs to be a shift from thinking of seasonal spaces in the summer or winter to year-round, 24-7 dedicated emergency weather spaces.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 7, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-18939662e4214507a643da7c48499618</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68MW-NFX1-JBVR-33SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1143\"/><timeReceived>04:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 7, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

However, this will not continue without changes made.</p><p>A number of our long-time and hard-working members have decided to step away after many years of service. Accordingly, we have many gaps in our directorships and even executive positions that need to be filled by our annual meeting occurring Thursday, Nov. 17.</p><p>If a sufficient number of old and new members do not commit to providing the time needed to attend society meetings from January to June of 2023, then the few long-standing current members/directors have no choice but to cancel proceeding on a 2023 Festival. By January, we usually will have paid deposits to headlining bands from outside Quesnel, have circulated a list of corporate sponsors with which to meet and collect in-kind and cash funding, and have participants committed to all our key directorships from corporate fundraising to stage director to parks supervisor and parade manager, etc.</p><p>We have a wonderful group of local businesses who annually provide money or products or services to the society's festival, so funding is not the main concern, but the lack of people willing to help definitely is.</p><p>If there is a possibility you can spend a few hours monthly doing the work involved in any one directorship as well as actively attending the four days of festival then now is the time to bring your names and information forward to us.</p><p>If not, then a resolution will probably be brought forward at an upcoming meeting to start the process of cancelling our 2023 festival while waiting for more active participation from the Quesnel area residents, which could result in hosting a festival again in 2024.</p><p>If interested in any of the above, contact any society directors you may already know, or leave a message at our office telephone of 250-992-1234 or by email to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:office@billybarkerdays.ca\">office@billybarkerdays.ca</email> or text myself at 250-316-6298 or email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:maureen.murray.1@outlook.com\">maureen.murray.1@outlook.com</email> This information collected will be part of the discussion at our November session.</p><p>Maureen Murray,</p><p>Souvenir Director and Past President</p><p>Quesnel Billy Barker Days Society</p><p>Copyright 2022 Quesnel Cariboo Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20221105PQC4392739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66V2-R531-JD2C-J468-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"418\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

And when some other factors come together, that can sometimes lead to the development of severe thunderstorms, which have the capability of producing tornadoes in addition to damaging hail, strong winds and flash floods.\"</p><p>The Star asked experts about what to expect from Ontario's weather this summer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mercury climbing</emphasis></p><p>\"The big story province-wide for the forecast is a continuation of the warm weather temperatures,\" said Coulson. \"And the forecast models seem to be saying this in general across the province.\"</p><p>The models don't show how much above normal the temperature will be.</p><p>\"The second half of July and the first part of August is traditionally our warmest time of the year, where daytime highs can routinely get up into the high 20s,\" said Coulson. \"So if the models are indicating warmer than normal, the implication would be we could see more 30-plus degree days during the second half of July, the first week of August.\"</p><p>Although Ontario hasn't experienced the temperature extremes seen in B.C., Coulson says meteorologists don't pigeonhole climate into one province or one part of the country.</p><p>\"It's a global system,\" he said. \"While we didn't necessarily see that impact here in Ontario, the concern would be that those changes happening out West could happen anywhere in the country in extreme weather.\"</p><p>In terms of precipitation, there is no strong trend in Southern Ontario, he says, but the models are indicating that NorthwesternOntario is expected to remain drier than normal, a concern since the forest fire season in that region has started early this year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rainfall over the Great Lakes</emphasis></p><p>This year, the months of March, April and May, referred to as the meteorological spring, were the driest on record in the Great Lakes Basin since 1965, says Frank Seglenieks, the Canadian secretary of the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Board, which manages outflows from Lake Ontario, through Cornwall's Moses-Saunders Power Dam, according to a joint Canadian-U.S. agreement.</p><p>The recent lack of precipitation is the result of global weather patterns, he says, where some high pressure zones around the Great Lakes deflected the jet stream, which can pull storms along with it.</p><p>Seglenieks says it's difficult to say that conditions during a particular season are the result of climate change.</p><p>\"But one thing we have found in our climate change studies are more extremes ... the weather pattern kind of locking in, with wet conditions or dry conditions,\" said Seglenieks. \"So what we've seen kind of follows the narrative of what we would expect under climate change.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Drought in the Basin</emphasis></p><p>Water levels in Lake Ontario are down an average of about 30 centimetres due to the drought conditions.</p><p>The upper Great Lakes - Superior, Michigan, Huron and Lake Erie - haven't been impacted as much by the drought because of record high water levels in the years leading up to 2020, when Michigan and Huron water levels were about a metre higher than normal.</p><p>Levels in those lakes are still above average because of the earlier high point.</p><p>Typically, water levels in Lake Ontario peak in May because there is less rainfall in July and August, but the recent rain has improved water levels by a few centimetres, says Seglenieks.</p><p>But he adds one month of rain doesn't get you out of a drought, which is a long-term forecast.</p><p>The board recently decreased the outflow of water from Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence because the low water levels triggered a change in regulations.</p><p>But Seglenieks says the improvement will be measured in centimetres and won't make much of a difference to cottage owners who might have a boat sitting in mud depending where they are on the lake.</p><p>\"The board controls the outflow from the Lake Ontario, but not the inflow,\" said Seglenieks. \"It's Mother Nature and the weather that move the water levels by metres. And the regulation moves it by centimetres.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forest fire season starts early</emphasis></p><p>Thousands of hectares of forest near Kenora are on fire and the province has issued an Emergency Area Order to allow for special measures to protect people and critical infrastructure in parts of NorthwesternOntario.</p><p>More than 100 firefighters from Mexico, part of an international agreement to share wildland firefighting resources, arrived on Friday to help manage the situation.</p><p>A restricted fire zone is in effect, which means no outdoor fires of any kind.</p><p>Dry conditions have contributed to an early start to the forest fire season in the northwest quadrant of the province, as well as dry lightning, a term that refers to lightning that isn't accompanied by enough rainfall to prevent a fire.</p><p>During a storm, \"a lightning strike will happen in that area and sometimes they can sit underground for days and days and emerge once conditions on the surface are more receptive to fire,\" said Chris Marchand, a fire information officer with the Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>Pilots with the branch fly small Cessna Skymasters, looking for smoke that could indicate a wildfire.</p><p>Patty Winsa is a Toronto-based data reporter for the Star.
