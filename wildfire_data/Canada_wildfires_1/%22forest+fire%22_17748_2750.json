Firefighters always hope to get through spring. We come out of winter and the ground cover is dry, it's brown, the vegetation hasn't taken on much hydration.<br/><br/> \"We believe that climate change contributes to volatility,\" he said. \"We're seeing more severe storms than we've seen before. Winds are very important to us. We're seeing wind action that exacerbates fires, and certainly long dry spells are becoming more common in many regions.\"<br/><br/> By Monday morning, temperatures had dropped, and the wind had receded somewhat, shifting direction so the fire was moving back on itself, a small bit of good news, said Meldrum. But he characterized the fire as \"uncontrolled\" and said, with residents relocated, firefighters were prioritizing protecting homes and buildings still threatened by the fire. <br/><br/> Meldrum said there was no timeline for residents to return to their homes. Once fire crews do get the blaze contained, he said, there will still be days of mop-up work, stamping down any smoldering portions of the fire that might reignite the forest.<br/><br/> \"Traditionally, we want to get hose lines around the entire perimeter of a fire and have what's called a wet hose line around the perimeter. This is a big perimeter.\"<br/><br/> At the same time as wildfires burned outside of Halifax, Nova Scotia fire crews were also battling another, larger wildfire in Shelburne County, in the southwestern part of the province.<br/><br/> Provincial officials said the uncontrolled wildfire in the remote area around Barrington Lake had nearly tripled in size to 2,296 hectares by Monday morning, propelled by high winds and high temperatures.<br/><br/> Evacuation orders were also in place for several communities in that area along with highway closures.<br/><br/> Meanwhile, about 400 homes in southwestern New Brunswick had been evacuated because of forest fires that began Sunday after an all-terrain vehicle burst into flames. Mayor Brad Henderson of Saint Andrews, N.B., said the fires were burning near the towns of Bocabec and Chamcook, and that flames have destroyed one home.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">With files from The Canadian Press</emphasis><br/><br/> Steve McKinley is a Halifax-based reporter for the Star.

The Stampeders (4-8) trailed by 15 points after three quarters. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the fourth, Maier rushed for Calgary's first touchdown of the game. He threw a pass to Reggie Begelton in the end zone that Calgary successfully challenged for pass interference, which led to a Tommy Stevens short-yardage touchdown.</p><p>Maier then marched the offence 84 yards downfield on 10 plays, with Dedrick Mills scoring the winning touchdown on a four-yard run with 20 seconds remaining.</p><p>After losing six games this season in the final three minutes, pulling out a late win to end a three-game losing streak \u2014 in front of 26,741 at McMahon Stadium \u2014 was a shot of confidence the Stampeders desperately needed.</p><p>Calgary head coach Dave Dickenson said there was a lot of love for Maier in the locker room following the game because of the quarterback's poise and his pace moving the chains on the final drive.</p><p>\"The greatest compliment you can get as a quarterback is when you feel like your teammates respect you and they revere you in these types of situations,\" Maier said. \"That means a lot to me when you see a large group of men and guys that played their asses off and they have your back.\"</p><p>Calgary's Rene Paredes kicked field goals from 15, 24, 32 and 48 yards, while Cody Grace contributed a punt single.</p><p>Edmonton (2-10) dropped to 2-2 since Canadian quarterback Tre Ford took over as starter. Alberta's CFL clubs meet again Saturday in Edmonton.</p><p>Ford rushed for 135 yards Monday. The 25-year-old University of Waterloo product completed 14 of 23 passes for 136 yards and a touchdown pass without an interception.</p><p>\"I've never seen that at the professional level where a guy can be that elusive and never get tired,\" Maier said. \"The guy just keeps going. He's got a hell of a motor. He obviously has a bright future in this league and he's going to be a problem again next weekend.\"</p><p>Edmonton slotback Steven Dunbar caught a pair of touchdown passes and third-string quarterback Taylor Cornelius scored a one-yard rushing touchdown.</p><p>Dean Faithfull kicked field goals from 20, 39 and a season-high 46 yards, and Jake Julien added a punt single for the Elks.</p><p>\"That's as tough a loss as I've been involved in,\" said Elks coach and general manager Chris Jones. \"We didn't tackle really well in the fourth (quarter) and that really hurt us.\"</p><p>Down 28-13, Maier scored Calgary's first touchdown early in the fourth quarter by running wide to the end zone's corner for a five-yard touchdown. A Paredes convert had the hosts trailing by eight points.</p><p>\"In my mind, I ran for 25 yards, took a hit, a lot cooler in my head than it ended up being, but it was necessary,\" Maier said. </p><p>Faithfull's 46-yard field goal gave Edmonton an 11-point lead, but Calgary successfully challenged for pass interference on a Maier pass to Begelton in the end zone with just over three minutes remaining. </p><p>After backup quarterback Stevens scored a subsequent one-yard plunge, Maier connected with Luther Hakunavanhu on a two-point convert pass that had the hosts trailing by three points. </p><p>An Edmonton two-and-out gave Calgary the ball back with two-and-a-half minutes to go when chants of \"Go Stamps Go\" erupted at McMahon, and set the stage for the Stampeders' final drive capped by Mills' carry and a Paredes convert.</p><p>The Stampeders played a poor second quarter on both sides of the ball to trail 18-10 at halftime. Maier was booed late in the half when he fumbled the ball on a second-and-15 and recovered it.</p><p>Edmonton scored on its next drive, with wide receiver Kyran Moore taking a handoff from Ford and throwing a 19-yard pass to Dunbar in the end zone.</p><p>The Stampeders also hurt themselves with penalties in the third quarter. An 18-yard carry to Edmonton's doorstep by Mills was negated 15 yards by his unnecessary roughness penalty after the play. </p><p>Maier's subsequent throw to Begelton in the end zone was called back because of Brandon Weldon's holding penalty, so Calgary settled for another Paredes field goal to trail 21-13.</p><p>Ford capped an eight-play, 64-yard drive with a five-yard toss to Dunbar and a 28-13 lead for the Elks to end the third quarter.</p><p>\"Are we the greatest team? Maybe not, but we keep fighting,\" Stampeders head coach and general manager Dave Dickenson said.</p><p>\"We probably got outplayed for three quarters. Proud of our guys for continually putting it out there and believing, with effort, sometimes we can overcome mistakes. We were able to do that in this game.\"</p><p>SMOKY SKIES</p><p>Forest fire smoke drifted into the city overnight Saturday. Environment Canada's air quality index for northwest Calgary at 5 p.m. MT kickoff Monday read nine out of 10, or \"high risk.\"</p><p>CFL associate vice-president of officiating Darren Hackwood told media during a June pre-season conference call that the threshold to play a game was seven.</p><p>A game can start at an AQI of seven provided air quality is projected to not worsen, Hackwood said in June.

(\"Happy Creek\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the results of field work and geophysical modelling completed at the Company's 100%-owned, 240-square-kilometre Highland Valley project in southern British Columbia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- A deep-looking, audiomagnetotelluric (\"AMT\") survey was completed in December, 2023 in the northern part of the project area. The data was further processed by 3D inversion modelling. This method is useful in identifying geology and areas of sulphide mineralization, rock fracturing and alteration which can be closely associated with porphyry copper mineralization.</p><p>- The AMT work successfully identified several very large resistive or conductive anomalies over one kilometre in diameter and extending to depths of greater than one kilometre. These features occur beneath or in proximity to known porphyry copper-molybdenum-gold-silver mineralization in rock and soil at surface, or in shallow drill holes.</p><p>- In addition, new 3D inversion modelling of airborne magnetic data has identified similarly large and deep anomalies, with kilometre-scale footprints and depth extents. The most interesting features are magnetic lows which are interpreted to represent younger, low-magnetic felsic intrusions and/or altered rocks that may be associated with untested copper mineralization extending to depth. Some of these are associated with the AMT anomalies.</p><p>- Interpretation of new soil and stream sediment geochemical survey results has identified multiple copper anomalies of up to 500 by 750 m in diameter, particularly in the Mystery Zone 2 trend, north of Knight Lake, and southeast of Billy Lake.</p><p>- Rock sampling in the Abbott area of the West Valley property discovered several new bedrock occurrences of copper mineralization with grab samples returning up to 0.32% copper. Sampling of trench dump material from the historical \"TAR\" MINFILE showing assayed 2.37% copper, 100 ppm molybdenum and 31.8 ppm silver.</p><p>- Overall, the results have identified multiple new anomalies both near surface and at depth that will be targeted for future drill testing.</p><p>Michael Cathro, Happy Creek's President and CEO commented: \"The new geophysical, geochemical and rock sampling results provide further evidence for a large-scale copper porphyry deposit at our Highland Valley Project. The results suggest that known near-surface copper mineralization could extend to depths greater than one kilometre. The work also identified new copper mineralization at surface in areas with limited historic drilling. We are very excited about these results and plan to drill test the new geological and geophysical anomalies as soon as possible.\"</p><p>The Highland Valley Project</p><p>The Company's 100-percent-owned Highland Valley Project, comprising the contiguous West Valley and Rateria properties, totals approximately 240 square kilometres. Happy Creek's Highland Valley Project is adjacent to Teck's Highland Valley Copper (HVC) mine that is Canada's largest copper mine with continuous production over a 60 years (See Reference Note 1).</p><p>Happy Creek's Zone 1 and Zone 2 discoveries, which lie just 6.5 kilometres southeast of HVC's Highmont open pits, show laterally continuous mineralization that has been outlined with 28,000 metres of drilling and remain open in several directions.</p><p>2023-2024 Field Work and Geophysical Processing</p><p>As announced on December 18, 2023, the Company recently completed rock and soil geochemical sampling, a deep-looking ground audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) survey, and 3D inversion modelling of AMT resistivity and airborne magnetic data. The geophysical survey and modelling were conducted by Peter E. Wallcott and Associates Limited and focused on the northeastern part of the property covering the Zone 1 and Zone 2 copper deposits and nearby targets (Figure 1). Geological work and rock sampling was also performed on the Abbott area in the southwestern part of the property.</p><p>Geophysical Survey Results</p><p>In December 2023, Happy Creek completed a ground-based AMT survey on the Highland Valley Project. This was the first AMT survey ever completed on the project and has successfully identified several very large and deep resistive or conductive features partially coincident with known mineralization at surface and in drill holes (Figures 2 and 4). The AMT survey results indicate areas with high resistivity that may potentially represent important younger-aged felsic intrusions, and/or low resistivity (more conductive) areas that are interpreted to represent rock- fracturing, structures and associated alteration. Both are useful to interpret geology which can be associated with buried copper porphyry mineralization. (See news release of December 18, 2023 for further details).</p><p>Several strong, deep, sub-circular magnetic low anomalies are seen in the 3D inversion modelling (Figures 3 and 4). These are interpreted to represent younger, low-magnetic felsic intrusions and/or altered rocks that may be associated with untested mineralization extending to depth. They occur in proximity to known mineralization and/or untested soil and rock copper geochemical anomalies.</p><p>Rateria Soil, Stream Sediment Sampling Program Results</p><p>In 2023, the Company collected 165 reconnaissance soil (glacial till) and 10 stream sediment geochemical samples in the north part of Rateria property. The results indicate several new areas of interest at the Mystery Lake target, the Knight Lake area and southeast of Billy Lake. The thickness and composition of glacial till is variable, and therefore, care must be taken interpreting the results.</p><p>Soil samples returned values from 18 to 1,580 ppm copper and 1 to 293 ppm molybdenum. Based on several thousand samples collected by the Company and others over the years, values for greater than 90 ppm copper and 3 ppm molybdenum are considered minimum anomalous values (85th percentile) in this environment.</p><p>Several new or expanded soil and stream sediment geochemical anomalies were outlined, particularly in the Mystery Zone 2 corridor, north of Knight Lake and southeast of Billy Lake. These anomalies have received only cursory exploration and almost no drilling. Copper-in-soil anomaly outlines are shown on Figures 2 and 3.</p><p>Values from the stream sediment samples range from 220 ppm to 3,250 ppm copper and 2 to 80 ppm molybdenum with 5 samples greater than 500 ppm copper.</p><p>Figure 1 Geology plan map of Highland Valley project showing key Happy Creek deposits, prospects and targets in red, and location of Figures 2 and 3.</p><p>Review of Key Target Areas</p><p>Zone 1 and Yubet Target</p><p>Previous drilling at the Zone 1 copper deposit has encountered broad and locally strong grades of copper mineralization including 236 metres (m) grading 0.27% copper (Cu) in drill hole R10- 12, and 95 m grading 0.65% Cu in hole R11-01. The copper mineralization has been defined over a strike distance of approximately 1,200m and to a depth of approximately 250m and remains open to depth.</p><p>The new 3D geophysical modelling over Zone 1 indicates it is underlain by a circular resistivity high, and a strong north-trending magnetic low feature, both of which extend to depth (Figures 2, 3, 4). Based on previous drilling results, the magnetic low is associated with porphyry-related fracturing, alteration and copper mineralization near-surface, and the magnetic low feature extends to more than 1500 m below surface. Sub-circular and linear shaped strong magnetic low features to the southeast and west, including the Yubet target, are only sparsely drill tested and represent similar, parallel targets as Zone 1.</p><p>Zone 2, Zone 2 NE and Billy South</p><p>Drilling at Zone 2 has traced porphyry copper-molybdenum-gold-silver mineralization over a length of 1000 m and to a depth of 300 m. It remains open in several directions. Highlight results include 105.5 m grading 0.37% Cu and 0.14 g/t Au, including 46 m grading 0.64% Cu and 0.30 g/t Au in hole R17-05, and 152.5 m grading 0.35% Cu and 0.06 g/t Au in R12-2.</p><p>The 3D geophysical modelling results indicate the mineralization occurs above and on the flank of a coincident resistivity high and magnetic high (See Figures 2, 3, 4). Strong magnetic lows extend to depths of 700 m to the east and west of the zone, and a very prominent sub-circular resistivity low (conductivity high) extends to depths of greater than 1000 m below surface and is coincident with the magnetic low to the east. This area, known as the Zone 2 NE target, has a strong copper-in-soil anomaly and has been only tested by three drill holes. Hole R17-02 returned 5 m grading 4.41% Cu, 0.03% Mo, 0.21 g/t Au, 20 g/t Ag and 6.86 g/t rhenium (Re).</p><p>Further east, additional deep magnetic and resistive features are associated with the south end of the 3.5-kilometre-long Billy copper-in-soil anomaly. Grab rock samples at the Billy Road prospect have returned values in the range of 1-3% copper with corresponding anomalous gold and silver values. One historic drill hole, 93CVS-5, tested a small portion of this very large target, and returned anomalous values up to 0.11% copper1.</p><p>Mystery and Billy North</p><p>The Mystery target area is located approximately 3.5 km southeast of the Highmont open pit1 (Figure 1). Mystery covers an area of approximately 2,500 m by 1000 m and includes historic drill hole 93CVS-11 that is reported to have cut 230 m of intense sericite and potassium feldspar alteration, quartz-sulphide veining and several short zones of porphyry-style copper-molybdenum mineralization extending to the end of the hole (see news release of October 11, 2023 for further details). A second hole located 400 m to the southwest, 93CVS-13, cut weaker mineralization. The Mystery target is underlain by Bethsaida, Skeena and Bethlehem rock units (Core Phases) which host the main deposits in Highland Valley.</p><p>The AMT model defines a 500 m by 500 m resistive high near hole 93CVS-11 that extends to greater than 1500 m depth. The resistive anomaly is surrounded by two broad conductive zones (low resistivity) with a coincident strong magnetic low extending to greater than 750 m below surface. New copper-molybdenum soil geochemical anomalies were defined by 2023 surface sampling in the Mystery target areas. Six hundred metres to the east of hole 93CVS-11 and in the heart of magnetic and resistivity low features, an outcrop of sericite-altered quartz diorite with local quartz veins and trace copper minerals was found in 2023, and a grab sample returned 0.165% copper. A historical rock sample containing 1.45% copper is located 250 m southeast1.</p><p>At the Billy Lake North target to the east, geological work in 2023 located outcrop with dikes of the favorable younger intrusive phase, cut by quartz-sericite veins. Assays of grab rock samples returned up to 1.35% copper and 0.031 ppm gold, confirming that the 3.5-kilometre-long Billy Lake copper soil anomaly is associated with in-place porphyry-style mineralization. In this area, geophysical modelling indicates a strong, irregular shaped magnetic and resistivity low (conductive zone) extends to over 1500 m below surface (Section A-A'). Together these features are interpreted to represent a potential altered porphyry centre beneath anomalous copper in soils and rocks at surface. There is no record of previous drilling in this area.</p><p>West Valley Prospecting and Mapping</p><p>In the Abbott area of the West Valley claim block, field investigations were conducted in an area affected by extensive 2021 forest fire damage, road building and salvage logging, which provide new rock exposures. Mapping shows the Guichon Creek batholith is in northwesterly contact with Nicola Group volcanic sediments to the southwest, and the younger Spences Bridge Group overlies the older rocks. Numerous copper showings occur in the Guichon Batholith and the Nicola Group rocks.</p><p>In 2023, additional copper showings with skarn-like character were located within the Nicola Group, and a quartz vein with chalcopyrite returned 0.322% copper. This sample occurs adjacent to an IP geophysical anomaly and the regional-scale Lornex fault.</p><p>The historical TAR showing was located and a sample of trench dump material containing chalcopyrite, bornite and chalcocite returned 2.37% copper, 100 ppm molybdenum and 31.8 g/t silver hosted by Guichon batholith diorite. Green feldspar porphyry dikes, k-feldspar, quartz, chlorite, epidote and sericite alteration with copper-molybdenum values are similar to several other copper showings up to 3-4 km away in the Abbott-Skuhun creek area that together indicate potential for a large-scale mineral system.</p><p>The interpreted results of the geophysical, soil, sediment and rock sampling survey results are shown in the following compilation maps and sections.</p><p>Qualified Person Statement</p><p>The technical and scientific contents of this release have been prepared, verified and approved by David Blann, P.Eng., a director of the Company, and a qualified person pursuant to National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.

In total, over 1.2 million hectares have burned so far this year throughout the province, compared to a 10 year average, which is roughly 76,000 hectares.</p><p>Lighting strikes, ( with 51,000 strikes recorded in B.C. in the last seven days with 76 per cent of those concentrated in the Northwest and Prince George Fire Centres) and dry weather conditions are further challenging firefighters.</p><p>\"We have had 392 fires in the last seven days, 230 of those fires remain out of control and many of those fires are present in the Prince George and Northwest fire centres,\" said Ryan Chapman.</p><p>More than 2,000 firefighters are in the province right now and the wildfire service is asking for an additional 1,000 through the Canadian interagency Forest Fire Center.</p><p>Another 200 to 300 are expected from Australia, Mexico and the U.S. over the next six to 10 days. The province has also requested people, helicopters and aircraft from the federal government.</p><p>\"We're continuing to plan ahead for the next two months,\" Cliff Chapman added.</p><p>But he said finding help is a challenge because resources are spread thin due to wildfires in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta.</p><p>Northwest Fire Centre update:</p><p>\"Our main priority is to prevent these fires from impacting life and property,\" Ryan Chapman said. However, owing to weather conditions, not all fires can be fought at this time,</p><p>Chapman said firefighters are focusing on the west side of the fire closest to Burns Lake and the south part of the fire that's near the Tintgael residential area. Parrot Lake and Peacock Creek, which is south of Houston, are also drawing in resources.</p><p>\"So we have had favorable winds over the west. We have been able to get quite close to the fire so we're using heavy equipment bulldozers, excavators followed up by ground crews. And we have established a guard from this line here which is a main 500 kilowatt transmission line. We're building that guard as close to the fire as possible. And our main goal is to try to stop the fire at that guard.\"</p><p>\"We're running air controls every day. We appreciate the public finding fires and phoning them in. We are expecting to keep finding new fires and addressing those as quickly as we can while they're small.\"</p><p>Public is also being told unnecessary risks and be aware of fire locations heading into the woods.</p><p>Vanderhoof and Fort St. James area update:</p><p>Vanderhoof and Fort St. James have seen 54 new wildfires since July 7. There are currently 63 fires burning and majority of those are out of control, said Todd Flannagan, the incident commander for the area.</p><p>Currently, in Vanderhoof's G4 zone there are 36 active wildfires and 2,500 hectares burning. In Fort St. James G5 zone there are 27 active wildfires and 35,000-plus hectares burning.</p><p>Heavy smoke is expected to continue through the next several days.</p><p>\"At this time, our main objective is to keep transportation corridors open for access and to support fire operations and all evacuations,\" Flannagan said, adding, \"The number one priority for the BC wildfires services is to ensure the safety of first responders and all personnel all wildfire response personnel.\"</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230714PAB4492100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68PF-B121-F0HF-8025-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

She said a fire that came to within 500 metres of Norm\u00e9tal, Que., 720 kilometres northwest of Montreal, was among those that were out of control, although the flames were spreading west toward the Ontario border, away from the community.</p><p>There was no rain in the forecast for the next four days in the most impacted sectors of the province, she said, adding that the flammability index \u2014 or risk of burning \u2014 could rise in several regions from \"very high\" to \"extreme.\"</p><p>\"The situation is critical for the next days, for as long as there is no major precipitation that falls,\" she said. </p><p>The province's public security minister, Fran\u00e7ois Bonnardel, said close to 1,000 people across the province had been evacuated or were expected to be asked to leave their homes or workplaces in the coming hours. Those people included residents of three sectors of the western Quebec city of Val-d'Or, as well as hundreds of vulnerable people who were expected to be evacuated from the Cree community of Mistissini on Wednesday.</p><p>Mistissini community leaders asked residents to monitor the radio and social media, saying a wider evacuation order could come during the day if the fire threatening a nearby road worsened.</p><p>The province said in an email on Wednesday that 1,982 workers and residents were listed as displaced -- including 530 from a gold mine in the James Bay region and several hundred from Indigenous communities -- although Val-d'Or was the only municipality with an official evacuation order in place as of early afternoon. </p><p>Residents of the northern Quebec town of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, who only recently returned home, were warned that they may need to evacuate for a second time if the flames further threaten a major route in and out of the region.</p><p>Mayor Guy Lafreni\u00e8re told residents Wednesday that smoke was making the air quality in town poor, and citizens who could leave were advised to do so. The town's approximately 2,000 residents spent more than two weeks out of their homes because of the fires before being allowed home on Sunday.</p><p>Lafreni\u00e8re said the town remained in a state of pre-alert and new evacuations could be ordered if Highway 113 would be cut off by fire either north or south of the town.</p><p>\"We have to be ready to evacuate at any moment,\" he said in a video message. \"For citizens who are ready, and who have a place to go, we recommend you go there as of today.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec announced it was evacuating about 190 workers from a pair of hydro stations in northern Quebec as a preventive measure. A spokesman for the utility said the LG-3 and LG-4 stations weren't at risk from fire but flames could cut off the only road linking the two facilities. Some employees would remain on site to ensure the facilities continue to operate, Francis Labb\u00e9 said.</p><p>The province's forest fire prevention agency, known as SOPFEU, said there were 110 forest fires in the province as of midday Wednesday, including about 20 that were considered out of control.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 21, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-044bd7fea3d04abdb9591a49dae5eaeb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68HP-3C31-JBVR-30M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"641\"/><timeReceived>03:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 21, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In total, over 1.2 million hectares have burned so far this year throughout the province, compared to a 10 year average, which is roughly 76,000 hectares.</p><p>Lighting strikes, ( with 51,000 strikes recorded in B.C. in the last seven days with 76 per cent of those concentrated in the Northwest and Prince George Fire Centres) and dry weather conditions are further challenging firefighters.</p><p>\"We have had 392 fires in the last seven days, 230 of those fires remain out of control and many of those fires are present in the Prince George and Northwest fire centres,\" said Ryan Chapman.</p><p>More than 2,000 firefighters are in the province right now and the wildfire service is asking for an additional 1,000 through the Canadian interagency Forest Fire Center.</p><p>Another 200 to 300 are expected from Australia, Mexico and the U.S. over the next six to 10 days. The province has also requested people, helicopters and aircraft from the federal government.</p><p>\"We're continuing to plan ahead for the next two months,\" Cliff Chapman added.</p><p>But he said finding help is a challenge because resources are spread thin due to wildfires in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta.</p><p>Northwest Fire Centre update:</p><p>\"Our main priority is to prevent these fires from impacting life and property,\" Ryan Chapman said. However, owing to weather conditions, not all fires can be fought at this time,</p><p>Chapman said firefighters are focusing on the west side of the fire closest to Burns Lake and the south part of the fire that's near the Tintgael residential area. Parrot Lake and Peacock Creek, which is south of Houston, are also drawing in resources.</p><p>\"So we have had favorable winds over the west. We have been able to get quite close to the fire so we're using heavy equipment bulldozers, excavators followed up by ground crews. And we have established a guard from this line here which is a main 500 kilowatt transmission line. We're building that guard as close to the fire as possible. And our main goal is to try to stop the fire at that guard.\"</p><p>\"We're running air controls every day. We appreciate the public finding fires and phoning them in. We are expecting to keep finding new fires and addressing those as quickly as we can while they're small.\"</p><p>Public is also being told unnecessary risks and be aware of fire locations heading into the woods.</p><p>Vanderhoof and Fort St. James area update:</p><p>Vanderhoof and Fort St. James have seen 54 new wildfires since July 7. There are currently 63 fires burning and majority of those are out of control, said Todd Flannagan, the incident commander for the area.</p><p>Currently, in Vanderhoof's G4 zone there are 36 active wildfires and 2,500 hectares burning. In Fort St. James G5 zone there are 27 active wildfires and 35,000-plus hectares burning.</p><p>Heavy smoke is expected to continue through the next several days.</p><p>\"At this time, our main objective is to keep transportation corridors open for access and to support fire operations and all evacuations,\" Flannagan said, adding, \"The number one priority for the BC wildfires services is to ensure the safety of first responders and all personnel all wildfire response personnel.\"</p><p>Copyright 2023 Vanderhoof Omineca Express</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VANDER-news20230713POV4491845</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VANDER2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68PF-B121-F0HF-805S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438216</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"711\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

A meal program is offered there between 1 and 2 p.m. daily.<br/><br/> The air quality led to cancellation of some outdoor events in the Peterborough area, including a tailgate party planned for prior to Thursday night's Peterborough Lakers season home opener and some soccer games.<br/><br/> The Peterborough Baseball Association has continued with scheduled games this week while the Peterborough City Soccer Club cancelled its Tuesday and Wednesday games but then proceeded with games on Thursday.<br/><br/> The Peterborough Victoria Northumberland and Clarington Catholic District School Board hosted recess and physical education classes inside on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the air quality and was also reviewing class trips and other extracurricular activities on a day by day basis. Outdoor activity in the Catholic schools resumed \"with caution\" on Thursday.<br/><br/> Canada Post issued an advisory Thursday that there may be delays in post deliveries across Eastern Ontario due to the poor air.<br/><br/> Conditions in Peterborough and the Kawarthas were exasperated by three somewhat nearby forest fires: a 43.7-hectare forest fire at Centennial Lake in the Madawaska area and two in northeastern Algonquin Park. Those fires started on the weekend and are now listed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry as either being under control or held.<br/><br/> Algonquin Park 6 was discovered at 18 hectares in size at 3:54 p.m. on Saturday and Algonquin Park 7 was 2.1 hectares and discovered at 4:06 p.m. that same day. Both fires are in the northeast portion of the park, southeast of Lake Travers. <br/><br/> By 3:55 p.m. on Monday, Algonquin Park 6 had grown to 30 hectares, while Algonquin Park 7 stayed at 2.1 hectares, according to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services. After initially being classified as \"not in control,\" by 8 a.m. on Tuesday the fires had been classified as \"being held\" at their current size. At 8 a.m. on Wednesday, the fires had not grown but were active and \"being held.\" At 8 a.m. on Thursday, there was no change in the status of the fires.<br/><br/> Air conditions had improved enough in parts of Eastern Ontario and parts of northeastern Ontario that Environment Canada lifted a number special air quality statements on Thursday, including for Barry's Bay, Killaloe, Smiths Falls, Perth, eastern Lanark County, Renfrew, Arnprior, Calabogie, Petawawa, Pembroke, Cobden, Brockville, Prescott, Cornwall, Ganonoque and Charleston Lake.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- with files from Kim Good, Torstar</emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">*****</emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wildfire smoke blankets Toronto, poor air quality prompts cancellations, warnings</emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Canadian Press</emphasis><br/><br/> TORONTO -- Canada's most populous city is experiencing hazy skies and poor air quality as smoke from wildfires in Ontario and Quebec moves over Toronto.<br/><br/> Environment and Climate Change Canada has issued a special air quality statement for Toronto, warning of high levels of pollution and deteriorated air quality as a result of smoke from the fires. <br/><br/> The Toronto District School Board and the York Region District School Board have moved recess and other outdoor events indoors today, while the Toronto Catholic District School Board says its schools can consider indoor recess based on the air quality health index.<br/><br/> The City of Toronto says it is adjusting programming in response to the air quality, with some city-run outdoor recreation programs being cancelled or moved indoors while outdoor activities at city-run daycares have been suspended.<br/><br/> The city also says it has outreach teams connecting with people experiencing homelessness, conducting wellness checks, providing water and encouraging them to come indoors. It says it is working to open additional temporary spaces at some homeless shelter sites as well. <br/><br/> The Toronto Zoo says it is responding to air quality warnings by reducing its hours to only run from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. today in order to protect its animals, staff and volunteers.<br/><br/> Environment and Climate Change Canada says people with lung or heart diseases, older adults, children, pregnant people and those who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects from the smoke. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wildfire battles continue as heat, air quality alerts affect most of Canada</emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mia Rabson</emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Canadian Press</emphasis><br/><br/> OTTAWA - Air pollution from wildfires remained well above healthy levels across much of southern and northern Ontario and several communities in British Columbia and Alberta on Thursday.<br/><br/> But there may be some hope on the horizon, after the number of fires burning across the country fell overnight.<br/><br/> The fires and the blankets of smoke affecting millions of Canadians prompted a debate in the House of Commons, during which members of Parliament expressed solidarity with the people affected and discuss the role climate change is playing in this year's more-severe fire season.<br/><br/> \"Climate change is real and we are seeing and living its impact every day,\" Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said during the debate.<br/><br/> This, he said, is the worst fire season Canada has ever experienced and it has had devastating consequences.<br/><br/> \"People have lost everything,\" he said.<br/><br/> As debate continued over the motion brought forward by the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, the air outside the Parliament Buildings had mostly cleared following several days of air quality so poor people were told to limit or avoid outdoor activities completely.<br/><br/> But further south, toward the Greater Toronto Area and in areas around Sudbury and North Bay, the air quality remained poor.<br/><br/> There are also many warnings of moderate or high risks due to bad air quality in parts of British Columbia and Alberta, as out-of-control fires continued to burn in almost every province and territory across Canada.<br/><br/> Environment Canada's air quality forecast suggests things will remain at unhealthy levels in most of southern Ontario and in western Canada through Friday.<br/><br/> Multiple health studies have linked wildfire smoke to serious health consequences including heart attacks, strokes and breathing problems, and the poor air quality has prompted cancellations or changes to outdoor activities as a result.<br/><br/> The Toronto District School Board joined several of its counterparts across the region in cancelling outdoor activities and moving recess inside for a second straight day Thursday. The Toronto Zoo also announced it would close early.<br/><br/> As of midday Thursday, there were 431 fires burning in nine provinces and two territories. That was down from 441 Wednesday, with Quebec extinguishing 10 fires since Wednesday morning.<br/><br/> The number of out-of-control fires also fell from 256 on Wednesday to 234 on Thursday, including a change in status for more than a dozen fires in Quebec.<br/><br/> The eastern United States has been seeing the effects from wildfire smoke drifting south, with cities like New York and Washington, D.C., issuing air quality warnings of their own.<br/><br/> The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration grounded flights out of Philadelphia International Airport on Thursday morning and slowed traffic to and from New York City-area airports as wildfire smoke reduced visibility. <br/><br/> Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke on the phone with U.S. President Joe Biden about the issue on Wednesday. A readout of that call said both leaders agreed the situation pointed to the urgency of addressing climate change. <br/><br/> More than 42,000 square kilometres have burned so far this year, making 2023 the second-worst year for fires on record. That's before the hottest months of the year have even begun. <br/><br/> In 2014, more than 46,000 square kilometres burned, the most ever in a single year. At the current pace, that total is expected to be passed this weekend.<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2023060868133902</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DW-2RY1-F197-53J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario) Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 8, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Physical Education Classes</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUQ1RTdBMDEzRDFCNDM4RDg2OUUwQkEwNTYzREUyNjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUZEQjQzQjY5NDRGNEVCNUIwMEZBMjAzMjQxRjRENEQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

Twisters in the south like this one in Louisiana, and watch as this sign comes crashing down on a car. The storm is now tracking east to New England but as CTV's LA bureau chief Tom Walters reports, some residents in California are still stranded a week after the wild weather first hit.</p><p>TOM WALTERS (Reporter): For days now, the mountains northeast of Los Angeles have been snowbound. And for those stranded, supplies are running out.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It feels like it's the end of the world or something.</p><p>WALTERS: The town of Big Bear is a ski resort, so it's not that snow is unusual. It's that so much fell so fast.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: We'll get this much snow but it's takes the whole season, not in one, at one shot, you know.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: So, as you can see, we even got about eight feet of snow.</p><p>WALTERS: Snow so deep that people have dig down to dig out.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: This is my car, down here.</p><p>WALTERS: While in many places, digging out leads only to roads that are still impassable.</p><p>DAN MUNSEY (San Bernardino County Fire Chief): The weather came in much worse than it's ever been anticipated in Southern California.</p><p>WALTERS: That means many were caught unprepared. Communities like Lake Arrowhead are full of vacation homes and short-term rentals, places where a lot of people go to spend a weekend with no reason to stock up for a long haul.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: These people up here, we don't have supplies to last seven to ten days.</p><p>WALTERS: And it's hard to get more. In the town of Crestline, the only grocery store collapsed. These long lines formed when the owners started giving away what they could salvage and when community groups turned this into a distribution point for donated supplies. Some food is arriving by helicopter, but with mountain roads closed, these trucks, full of groceries, can't get in. Officials say more help is coming.</p><p>SHANNON DICUS (San Bernardino County Sheriff): There are snowploughs everywhere and you are going to see direct relief coming to your doorsteps shortly.</p><p>WALTERS: But even with the work of forest fire crews and the National Guard, it's still expected to be another week before everyone who is snowed in can get out.

As of May 6, the Alberta government declared a state of emergency over wildfires, and at the time of writing this article, nearly 30,000 people had to be evacuated. Although it is too early to establish a precise assessment of this extreme episode, recent research allows us to place it in a broader context.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In North American boreal forests, several million hectares can go up in smoke in a single year. On the other hand, these forest fires can seem almost negligible for several consecutive years. During the past 60 years, the number of forest fires has actually increased, presumably because of climate change. Or at least that\u2019s part of the explanation. </p><p>However, to better understand the long-term trends it is important to take a step back. This is the work our team of forest and fire ecology specialists recently carried out. </p><p>The results of our research contradict the common wisdom about North American boreal forests \u2014 that they burned more in the past than they do today. But before we go into more detail about this, we feel it\u2019s important to provide some background and context.</p><p>What causes a forest fire?</p><p>Scientists have been asking this question for a long time. Thanks to research carried out in the last few decades, the answer can now be summed up by three factors: vegetation, weather, and triggers.</p><p>Vegetation, which can be thought of as fuel, is a determining factor. For example, large areas of dense coniferous forest are more likely to burn down than are deciduous forests with wetter undergrowth, or less dense forests. </p><p>Meteorological factors also influence the flammability of fuels; dry, windy conditions are highly conducive to the ignition and spread of fires. </p><p>However, this combination of favourable conditions, itself, is not enough to generate a forest fire; there also needs to be a trigger. There are two types of triggers: lightning and humans. Although humans have been the cause of most fires started in recent decades in Canada, lightning has actually been responsible for the largest area of burned forest.</p><p>Impacts on society</p><p>When we hear about forest fires in the media, the news is usually tragic for communities. As a recent example, during the 2016 Fort McMurray disaster, some 600,000 hectares went up in smoke and over 88,000 people were evacuated. </p><p>Fires also have an economic impact on the forestry industry, as they consume millions of trees originally destined for mills. Moreover, fires accelerate climate change, as the burning of vegetation causes a massive release of CO2 into the atmosphere.</p><p>A strong influence on ecosystems, but not necessarily negative</p><p>The landscape we see a few weeks after a fire often looks apocalyptic. Forest fires leave significant traces on ecosystems and biodiversity. This is the case for certain species such as the Woodland Caribou, which depend on the presence of mature coniferous forests to survive. Fires are therefore a threat to its survival.</p><p>But, on the other hand, fires have always been part of forests, and are sometimes even essential to their ecological functioning. Most of the time, the burned landscape will gradually give way to vigorous young trees, which grow into a mature forest in some 50 to 100 years. Some tree species are even dependent on fire to regenerate and as a result, maintain themselves. This is the case notably of jack pine and black spruce, which the forestry industry loves.</p><p>Many animal species are also fond of burned forests. Charred tree trunks provide food for certain insect species, such as the black long-horned beetle. Insects in turn provide abundant food for birds, like black-backed woodpeckers, which use snags (dead standing trees whose roots are still anchored to the ground) to nest.</p><p>In other words, fires are neither entirely good, nor entirely bad. It depends on your point of view. Additionally, as is often the case, it is also a question of balance\u2026</p><p>Reconstructing the history of fires over the last centuries</p><p>Accurate records required to reconstruct the history of forest fires in Canada only go back to the 1960s. So how can we reconstruct the history of burned areas over the last few centuries? We can use the information contained in the trees themselves, and more specifically, their age. </p><p>In boreal forests, fire is a dominant natural disturbance. So, by determining the age of the oldest trees in a forest, provided these have not been cut down, we can figure out the last time a forest burned.</p><p>A downward trend in burned areas over the past few centuries</p><p>We gathered 16 studies that had independently applied the same method to different areas across North American boreal forests, from Alaska to Qu\u00e9bec. After reanalysis of all this data in what scientists call a \u201cmeta-analysis,\u201d the results are striking: North American boreal forests burned much more 150 years ago than they do today. In the earliest period covered by our data, between 1700 and 1850, the annual area burned was between two and more than 10 times greater than what has been observed over the past 40 years.</p><p>What explains this long-term downward trend? It is difficult to say based on the current state of research. Obviously, climate change is one of the suspects. The period from 1700 to 1850 was the end of what is known as the Little Ice Age, a period known for being colder, but probably also drier and, therefore, more conducive to fires. </p><p>The vegetation could also have changed and become less flammable, particularly as a result of cuts by the logging industry over the 20th century. Also during the 20th century the technological and financial means allocated to firefighting continued to increase, culminating in the 1970s with the appearance of water bomber aircraft. Fire suppression policies could therefore have also played a role in reducing fires in some areas. </p><p>However, fires began to decline as early as the 19th century, long before human communities had a significant impact on the North American boreal forest environment. It seems more likely that climate change is the primary cause of the decrease in fires, superimposed by the impacts of human activity.</p><p>We hope new research will soon allow us to answer these questions. A better understanding of why fires have decreased or increased over the past few centuries will give us a head start in predicting what to expect from future climate change. ___</p><p>Rapha\u00ebl Chavard\u00e8s has received funding from Fonds de recherche du Qu\u00e9bec - Nature et technologie (FRQNT).</p><p>Yves Bergeron has received funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Fonds de recherche du Qu\u00e9bec - Nature et technologie (FRQNT).</p><p>Victor Danneyrolles does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. ___</p><p>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Park Hill is next and then Coyote Park, although neither of these latter two parks is slated to be logged as much as Little Mountain Park.</p><p>All of this logging is supposed to make us safer from forest fires. Yet in 1998, when a forest fire was on our very doorstep and firefighting crews were working to create fire guards along the base of Mount Ida, no one said, \"If only we had logged our woodland parks, our homes would be safe now.\"</p><p>Of course not. The true danger from fire is in the foothills surrounding our city, not in our parks.</p><p>The city's own Community Energy and Emissions Plan states that \"Community planning which preserves the surrounding natural environment can have significant health and well-being impacts.\"</p><p>Surely preserving the beauty, serenity, peace and privacy of places for our citizens to walk in nature is more important than the very limited benefit such a moon-scaping of our environment would have in preventing or mitigating a forest fire.</p><p>Another concern is the decision to do this logging appears to have been made without any consultation with park user. Such a radical change to our parks should never have been undertaken without extensive public consultation. The city asks for input when other public facilities are being changed. Widespread input was solicited on the planned upgrading of the aquatic centre. The future of Lakeshore Road even warranted a public survey.</p><p>Why weren't park users consulted?</p><p>Read more: Deadfalls in Salmon Arm pose risk for wildfires</p><p>Read more: Salmon Arm council's concerns eased over Mount Ida logging</p><p>Read more: Public asked to be mindful of wildfire mitigation work underway at Salmon Arm park</p><p>Consultation could have been done by posting signs at park entrances; putting a notice in the newspaper; or doing an online survey.</p><p>Even something as simple as a heads-up phone call to the naturalist club would have been helpful. Ideally, consultation needs to be done at the very beginning of the planning process \u2013 not after city staff have spent hours producing (and committing to) a plan of action.</p><p>Better late than never though. I ask that the city do this consultation work now.</p><p>Find out whether our citizens truly want this logging.</p><p>A good start would be to attend a meeting on this issue being held at 2:30 p.m. on May 20 at the Field of Dreams entry to Little Mountain Park.

He also demanded that the entire province be labelled a disaster zone so that authorities could disburse funding to ameliorate the effects of pollution.</p><p>The court heard from agencies involved and expert witnesses, including the dean of Chiang Mai University's Faculty of Medicine, the director of the National Health Security Office Zone 1, and the director of Maharat Nakhon Chiang Mai Hospital, during the hearing.</p><p>According to the court, fine PM2.5 air pollutants had worsened year after year and has harmed people's health in both the short and long term, based on witness testimony.

PM2.5 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less, which is small enough to be inhaled into the respiratory system and can have adverse effects on human health.</p><p>Thailand experiences elevated levels of PM2.5 pollution, particularly during the dry season from December to April. There are several sources of PM2.5 pollutants in Thailand, including vehicular emissions, industrial activities, biomass burning, construction dust, and agricultural activities.</p><p>The main contributors to PM2.5 pollution in Thailand are:</p><p>1. Vehicular emissions: The increasing number of vehicles on the roads, especially in urban areas, leads to a significant release of PM2.5 pollutants from exhaust emissions.</p><p>2. Industrial activities: Industrial processes, such as power generation, manufacturing, and construction, release PM2.5 pollutants into the air. The presence of industrial estates and factories in certain areas contributes to localized pollution.</p><p>3. Biomass burning: Open burning of agricultural waste, forest fires, and the practice of slash-and-burn agriculture release substantial amounts of PM2.5 pollutants into the atmosphere, especially during the dry season.</p><p>4. Construction dust: Rapid urbanization and construction activities generate significant amounts of dust particles, including PM2.5 pollutants, which can become airborne and contribute to pollution.</p><p>The Thai government and various organizations have been taking measures to address PM2.5 pollution. These measures include:</p><p>1. Regulation and enforcement: The government has implemented stricter emission standards for vehicles and industrial activities, aiming to reduce the release of PM2.5 pollutants into the air. Efforts are being made to enforce these regulations more effectively.</p><p>2. Public awareness campaigns: Public awareness campaigns are conducted to educate the public about the health risks associated with PM2.5 pollution and the importance of adopting practices to reduce emissions.</p><p>3. Alternative transportation: Encouraging the use of public transportation, promoting electric vehicles, and implementing measures to reduce traffic congestion can help reduce vehicular emissions and subsequent PM2.5 pollution.</p><p>4. Forest fire prevention: Steps are being taken to prevent forest fires, including increased monitoring, early detection, and rapid response to fire outbreaks. Efforts are also being made to educate local communities about sustainable farming practices and alternatives to burning agricultural waste.</p><p>5. Regional cooperation: Thailand is working with neighboring countries, particularly in the ASEAN region, to address transboundary air pollution issues. Collaborative efforts aim to mitigate the impact of cross-border haze and reduce the influx of PM2.5 pollutants from neighboring countries.</p><p>It's important to note that while measures are being taken to address PM2.5 pollution in Thailand, it remains a complex and ongoing challenge that requires sustained efforts from various stakeholders to achieve significant improvements in air quality.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIRAI-CHIANGRAITIMES110720230001014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIRAI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68NY-HDR1-JCH9-G26Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472526</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"856\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CTN News - Chiangrai Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Chiang Rai Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 11, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Business &amp;

Now the dean of Lakeland College emergency training centre in Vermilion, Alta., McKerry previously helped battle some of Alberta\u2019s most ferocious and historic wildfires.</p><p>That included the 2011 Slave Lake wildfire that destroyed more than 400 buildings and the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire that forced nearly 90,000 people to flee Canada\u2019s oilsands region and reduced thousands of homes to ash.</p><p>After a gruelling day on the fire lines, he said most firefighters are completely exhausted and camp is their refuge.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to keep them motivated, high morale and keep them working, you\u2019ve got to try to be able to support them where (you) can,\u201d he said in an interview.</p><p>\u201cCamps aren\u2019t the most ideal experience, (but) fortunately, you\u2019ve got a lot of motivated people who want to go out and help, that are willing to sacrifice some of those comforts \u2014 or almost all of those comforts \u2014 to get out there and assist in the effort.\u201d</p><p>Those efforts continue to be tested as crews across Canada battle the worst season on record. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre has reported more than 131,000 square kilometres of land and forest have been scorched across the country.</p><p>B.C. is experiencing its most destructive season on record for area burned with more than 15,000 square kilometres charred, surpassing the previous record of 13,543 square kilometres set in 2018.</p><p>In a social media post last month, the BC Wildfire Service highlighted the contracted staffers it said play \u201ccritical\u201d roles in the provincial fire fight.</p><p>Such jobs include heavy equipment operators, First Nations crew members, first aid attendants and medics, camp and facility managers, kitchen staff, danger tree assessors, fallers, food service staff, forest industry experts, contract firefighters, pilots and air support staff, as well as various other trades, the service said.</p><p>Provincial fire information officer Mike McCulley said such workers are often easily overlooked by those outside the service.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really complex organization and there are many moving pieces to the puzzle,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI think folks just think that it\u2019s just firefighters on the ground fighting fire and that\u2019s so far from the truth.\u201d</p><p>McKerry said, after a day in the field, most firefighters needs are simple.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get back to camp, the best luxury you can have is clean washrooms and access to food,\u201d he said.</p><p>At the Takla camp, Callihoo said most firefighters sleep in tents, but working showers, washrooms and a workable kitchen equipped with a dining area are set up on site.</p><p>Food quantities are determined based on the number of firefighters on scene, with groceries delivered once a week, she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a juggling process because you want to make sure you have enough food for everybody,\u201d Callihoo said.</p><p>Excess is much better than not having enough, and any unused food will be sent to another camp, she said, noting that numbers at the camp change quickly as the service often rearranges how many firefighters are at each site based on needs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a day-by-day operation here,\u201d Callihoo said.</p><p>She added that most of the problematic fires are burning elsewhere in the province.</p><p>\u201cFires here, to my understanding, are a little bit more controlled, but they don\u2019t want to leave them. With warmer weather coming up, it may cause sparks so we\u2019re going to leave a team here until we start seeing what\u2019s going to go on.\u201d</p><p>McKerry said such camps are often only used when fires are burning in rural locations and it is not possible for staff to stay at hotels.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about accessibility,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom an emergency management perspective, if you have access to hotels, that\u2019s a godsend because then you\u2019re not relying on those other pieces of infrastructure.\u201d</p><p>But when camping is necessary, firefighters always recognize the value of staffers like Callihoo, he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the things you may not necessarily think about, but it\u2019s beautiful to have those people there that just come in and ultimately make everybody else\u2019s life a little bit more easy and comfortable.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRESVA-news20230817PQAA0003803396</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRESVA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YP-BW81-F0HF-82KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438283</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"859\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Whitehorse Council has made this one of their top priority issues. A detailed study was made in 2020 to more clearly understand the risk of a 'wildland/urban interface fire \u2013 WUI' to Whitehorse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To reduce the risk, the city and territorial government have started to reduce the fire fuel in the area south of the city. To improve the ability to communicate with Whitehorse residents in the event of a WUI, the City has offered the Whitehorse Alert service to those who sign up.</p><p>These are all good moves but, for this fire season at least, the public has received very little information on evacuation in case of fire. Our group, the Citizens for a Firesmart Whitehorse wants to help fill this important gap. We urge Whitehorse residents to take the following steps:</p><p>Before the end of May</p><p>\u07e6 Sign up for the City of Whitehorse \"Whitehorse Alert\" at Whitehorse.ca/emergency. It's free! By doing this, emergency information about things like fires, evacuation orders, earthquakes can be communicated to you quickly.</p><p>\u07e6 Review your 72-hour kit to make sure its ready (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.getprepared.ca\">www.getprepared.ca</url>)</p><p>\u07e6 Make a plan for your evacuation if and when it is ordered. Where will you go if heading north or south (authorities will advise details in the event)? How will you communicate with friends and other family members?</p><p>\u07e6 Clean the area around your house for potential fire starters (dead leaves, lumber or firewood close to your house, pine needles in your eavestroughs, etc.)</p><p>\u07e6 For rural residents, if you have one, test your home sprinkler system.</p><p>During fire season</p><p>\u07e6 Abide by any \"no burn\" announcements. Remember all open fires are prohibited within the City of Whitehorse, with the exception of a personal fire pit on your personal property or registered campsite with an appropriate fire pit for the purposes of cooking food. Exceptions may be made through the issuance of a permit; generally, these permits do not allow burning May through October.</p><p>\u07e6 Keep your vehicle's fuel tank full in case you have to evacuate.</p><p>\u07e6 Be prepared to camp or be self sufficient for several days.</p><p>\u07e6 Monitor the 'fire weather index' (as shown on the fire risk signs along the highway) and adjust your activities accordingly with respect to potential sources of fire such as cooking fires, smoking, and sparks from combustion engine exhaust.</p><p>\u07e6 Post your evacuation planning on your refrigerator or near the door so all residents know about it.</p><p>\u07e6 In hot dry weather be aware that the fire risk can quickly become extreme. Watch for lightning strikes and smoke in the sky from any nearby fires.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Tuesday, Jan. 30, all 22 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> TICKETS<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.<br/><br/> PAST LOCATIONS<br/><br/> \\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8<br/><br/> \\x95 Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and

Now the dean of Lakeland College emergency training centre in Vermilion, Alta., McKerry previously helped battle some of Alberta\u2019s most ferocious and historic wildfires.</p><p>That included the 2011 Slave Lake wildfire that destroyed more than 400 buildings and the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire that forced nearly 90,000 people to flee Canada\u2019s oilsands region and reduced thousands of homes to ash.</p><p>After a gruelling day on the fire lines, he said most firefighters are completely exhausted and camp is their refuge.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to keep them motivated, high morale and keep them working, you\u2019ve got to try to be able to support them where (you) can,\u201d he said in an interview.</p><p>\u201cCamps aren\u2019t the most ideal experience, (but) fortunately, you\u2019ve got a lot of motivated people who want to go out and help, that are willing to sacrifice some of those comforts \u2014 or almost all of those comforts \u2014 to get out there and assist in the effort.\u201d</p><p>Those efforts continue to be tested as crews across Canada battle the worst season on record. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre has reported more than 131,000 square kilometres of land and forest have been scorched across the country.</p><p>B.C. is experiencing its most destructive season on record for area burned with more than 15,000 square kilometres charred, surpassing the previous record of 13,543 square kilometres set in 2018.</p><p>In a social media post last month, the BC Wildfire Service highlighted the contracted staffers it said play \u201ccritical\u201d roles in the provincial fire fight.</p><p>Such jobs include heavy equipment operators, First Nations crew members, first aid attendants and medics, camp and facility managers, kitchen staff, danger tree assessors, fallers, food service staff, forest industry experts, contract firefighters, pilots and air support staff, as well as various other trades, the service said.</p><p>Provincial fire information officer Mike McCulley said such workers are often easily overlooked by those outside the service.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really complex organization and there are many moving pieces to the puzzle,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI think folks just think that it\u2019s just firefighters on the ground fighting fire and that\u2019s so far from the truth.\u201d</p><p>McKerry said, after a day in the field, most firefighters needs are simple.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get back to camp, the best luxury you can have is clean washrooms and access to food,\u201d he said.</p><p>At the Takla camp, Callihoo said most firefighters sleep in tents, but working showers, washrooms and a workable kitchen equipped with a dining area are set up on site.</p><p>Food quantities are determined based on the number of firefighters on scene, with groceries delivered once a week, she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a juggling process because you want to make sure you have enough food for everybody,\u201d Callihoo said.</p><p>Excess is much better than not having enough, and any unused food will be sent to another camp, she said, noting that numbers at the camp change quickly as the service often rearranges how many firefighters are at each site based on needs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a day-by-day operation here,\u201d Callihoo said.</p><p>She added that most of the problematic fires are burning elsewhere in the province.</p><p>\u201cFires here, to my understanding, are a little bit more controlled, but they don\u2019t want to leave them. With warmer weather coming up, it may cause sparks so we\u2019re going to leave a team here until we start seeing what\u2019s going to go on.\u201d</p><p>McKerry said such camps are often only used when fires are burning in rural locations and it is not possible for staff to stay at hotels.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about accessibility,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom an emergency management perspective, if you have access to hotels, that\u2019s a godsend because then you\u2019re not relying on those other pieces of infrastructure.\u201d</p><p>But when camping is necessary, firefighters always recognize the value of staffers like Callihoo, he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the things you may not necessarily think about, but it\u2019s beautiful to have those people there that just come in and ultimately make everybody else\u2019s life a little bit more easy and comfortable.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRAILD-news20230815PSXA0003795060</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRAILD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68Y8-CMN1-JD2C-J556-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"859\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Travellers can access free N-95 masks from their local Public Security Officer and should carry proof of residence identification to cross community checkpoints. </p><p>Local PSOs are working with fire and police departments as the \u201ceyes and boots on the ground,\u201d patrolling access roads early in the morning to send daily reports to SOPFEU about fire and smoke conditions. SOPFEU typically gathers these reports for a 10:30am meeting with the regional operational committee, then decisions at a 4pm meeting are made public by 6pm. </p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to open the roads really fast just in case it goes out of control,\u201d said regional fire marshal Lee-Roy Blacksmith. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had enough rain to completely put out the fires. Food and gas deliveries are starting so they\u2019re catching up with their supplies.\u201d </p><p>While most people have returned home following evacuations in Eastmain and other communities, the Cree Health Board said that those evacuated from Chisasibi will remain in Montreal until further notice. Air transportation to appointments remained mandatory for clients and caregivers from coastal communities as Cree people who made their appointments independent of Wiihichiituwin were not being allowed to travel south by road. </p><p>Canada hired over 300 Indigenous firefighters and acquired specialized equipment to strengthen capacity this summer. Cree recruits have eagerly taken SOPFEU training as quickly as it becomes available. Auxiliary forest firefighters work under the supervision of SOPFEU staff to combat hotspots, small fires that reignite after a blaze has moved on.  </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re limited based on the instructors for SOPFEU because they\u2019re all out in the field working,\u201d explained Blacksmith. \u201cI keep asking SOPFEU if we can have another course, but the best reply I get is they\u2019re low on staff. My intention is to get as much as I can.\u201d </p><p>After 40 people from Waswanipi and Ouje-Bougoumou received their three days of training, 30 spots in Chisasibi were filled in under half an hour. Although blocked access roads previously prevented recruitment from other coastal communities, 19 candidates from Waskaganish recently completed training to be deployed on the community\u2019s access road, and Blacksmith is working on adding another cohort from Wemindji. </p><p>As the fires and restrictions gradually diminish, some Cree in southern communities have been able to assess the damage in the bush. Blacksmith cautioned that there\u2019s a risk these areas may rekindle and SOPFEU remains present. He\u2019s advised the Cree Trappers\u2019 Association not to enter restricted areas until given the go ahead. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still assessing the impacts of the forest fires,\u201d said the CTA\u2019s Thomas Stevens. \u201cThe local trappers anxious to check their camps had an open window \u2013 it\u2019s a complete disaster for some of the tallymen. When we have the final numbers, I think it will be over 100 cabins that have burned in Eeyou Istchee.\u201d </p><p>Each community gathered information about local impacts that will be compiled in a CTA report. Waswanipi has nearly completed its bleak assessment, revealing a total loss of some traplines and an estimated 26 cabins burned down. As coastal community members begin to inspect their camps, some have shared similar devastation. Stevens said 155 traplines overall have been impacted by this summer\u2019s fires.  </p><p>While there are about 900 camps and over 10,000 cabins in Eeyou Istchee, Stevens said only a little over 200 cabins were insured, including likely fewer than 10 of those that were destroyed. When the current policy comes up for renewal following this crisis, he\u2019s worried how insurance companies may respond.  </p><p>\u201cThe land users are concerned, especially in the remote areas that fly in and out,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cWe have to come together as a Nation to help the hunters and trappers affected by these forest fires and the wildlife and culture that\u2019s been lost.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-1be5c2264b214b20b7e048c7c676ad88</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YD-GST1-JBVR-33V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><timeReceived>10:44 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 14, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The rain should provide some relief to firefighters over the next three or four days \u2014 and hopefully bring good news for displaced residents eager to return home, Bonnardel said.</p><p>\"People want a little hope,\" he told reporters Tuesday in Montreal. \"I'm going to try to give them some by telling them that with the weather forecasts for the next hours, we should be able to give you good news in the next 24, 48 hours.\" </p><p>He said there were slightly more than 7,200 evacuees as of Tuesday morning, down from more than 13,500 late last week \u2014 the number varies from hour to hour.</p><p>Residents of Chibougamau, 500 kilometres northwest of Quebec City, were returning home after an evacuation order was lifted Monday, and people from a handful of smaller communities would be able to go home on Tuesday, Bonnardel said.</p><p>The situation, he said, remained concerning in Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, which has been threatened by two different fires. One fire that came within about two kilometres of a pulp mill was being successfully held back, but another powerful fire further to the south risked getting bigger should the winds shift, he added.</p><p>He urged the town's 2,000 or so residents to be patient, adding that he hoped all evacuation orders would be lifted this week.</p><p>\"I know people are nervous, are anxious, are eager to return home,\" Bonnardel said. \"And I'm telling them to be patient. I know it's not simple or easy for them.\" </p><p>He said the fires were being \"well-fought\" in Norm\u00e9tal, located 720 kilometres northwest of Montreal, in the Abitibi region, where flames had reached within 500 metres of town limits in recent days.</p><p>There were more than 1,250 people fighting fires in Quebec on Tuesday, Bonnardel said, including members of the Canadian Armed Forces and sizable contingents from France, New Brunswick and the United States.</p><p>He said the fire effort would be bolstered by the arrival this week of two contingents of American firefighters, with more reinforcements from Spain and Portugal expected to arrive Wednesday. By the end of the week, he said, there should be 1,500 firefighters on the ground. </p><p>There were 125 actives fires in the province as of Tuesday afternoon, down from about 130 on Monday. The province's forest fire prevention agency \u2014 SOPFEU \u2014 said 36 of those were out of control. There were two more fires reported in the previous 24 hours, while other fires \"regained some vigour\" due to windy conditions on Monday, the agency said in an update.</p><p>\"The passage of the rain expected as of (Tuesday) on the northwest of the province should make it possible to calm the intensity of the fires if the quantities are sufficient, and this, for a few days,\" the update said. \"This should make it possible to contain several fires, that is to say to stop their progress, at least temporarily.\"</p><p>The sheer number of fires burning at once has forced the province to let many burn freely and instead concentrate resources on a few dozen that pose the biggest threat to towns or infrastructure. However, the arrival of more reinforcements should soon allow firefighters to start tackling other, less dangerous blazes, the agency said.</p><p>There have been a total of 451 fires this season, about double the 10-year annual average for this time of year.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 13, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-04f4c124f79a4ee58b38b2bd7f0b1166</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68G0-9TT1-DY9S-T3TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><timeReceived>05:22 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 13, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I am in southern Ontario, about 200 kilometres from the nearest forest fire but the air is hazy, there is smoke in every breath, our windows are closed and the air is being filtered. I can only imagine what it is like for those on the front lines, living in the danger zones or working as firefighters. </p><p><br/><br/> There are the obvious costs to families forced to flee from forest fires - homes lost, health compromised, communities hammered, but there is also the less obvious cost: the fires are spewing millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It is a vicious circle where climate heating encourages more fires and more fires cause the climate crisis to deepen. <br/><br/> On May 31, the Ontario's minister of natural resources was in northwestern Ontario to announce a new government program whose purpose, stripped of all the bafflegab, is to burn more wood. <br/><br/> Through a series of sleight of hands biomass energy (burning wood) is considered a renewable energy source. Bizarre as it sounds, renewable energy sources are wind, water, solar and burning wood. <br/><br/> Admittedly, Ontario isn't alone in this fiction. The conventional view is that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from burning wood can be offset by the carbon dioxide sequestered by trees planted to replace those burned. This supposed carbon neutrality assumes that forests are carbon sinks. Instead, we now know Canada's forests are carbon sources. <br/><br/> The minister was announcing funding of about $20 million under the Forest Biomass Action Plan. The Ford government has taken a climate-threatening practice - burning wood to make energy - and has transformed it into a pillar of the new green economy.<br/><br/> The Forest Biomass Action plan describes the initiative as \"helping to reduce emissions and addressing climate change.\" And argues it will, \"position Ontario as a leader in the growing circular and green economy.\"<br/><br/> The greenwashing makes it easy to forget that, for the most part, the initiative will generate more greenhouse gas by burning wood. <br/><br/> At the top of the Action Plan's objectives is this: \"The Forest Biomass Program will support projects to harvest more wood from Crown forests ... \" Throughout are references to \"underutilized species\" and \"uncommercial trees.\" But whether a tree is uncommercial or from an underutilized species, if it continues to grow it is sequestering carbon.<br/><br/> The Action Plan also includes a completely cynical effort to broaden the definition of green hydrogen - hydrogen created by using solar and wind renewable energy - to include hydrogen created by burning wood.<br/><br/> There are opportunities, innovations and breakthroughs that can occur from rethinking our approach to forests, wood harvesting and biomass. There is an international scramble among countries to emerge as major players in the new bio-economy. <br/><br/> Forests can support biodiversity, pharmaceuticals and medicines, fibres and bio plastics. There are ways to use our forest resources more sustainably with less wood waste. <br/><br/> But in Ford's Ontario, we have been forced to think about the balance of probabilities. Is the Action Plan about using wood residues and waste more effectively and seeing intact forests as a resource or is it about more clear cutting, the threat of deforestation and burning more wood?<br/><br/> In the last few years, on separate occasions, hundreds of scientists have asked governments around the world to recognize that burning wood emits more carbon than fossil fuels and poses major health risks. <br/><br/> Scientists have asked government leaders to stop subsidizing biomass energy.<br/><br/> The European Union has revised its Renewable Energy Directive by tightening the sustainability criteria and prohibiting the use of biomass from primary and highly biodiverse forests.<br/><br/> This week as fires burn across the country, the Ontario government is encouraging us to burn more wood. And providing more subsidies for forest biomass energy. <br/><br/> The announcement is another in a long list of Ford's bad energy choices.<br/><br/> David Robertson is retired and volunteers with Seniors for Climate Action Now! <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023061068146755</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68F4-HNG1-JDV5-F06K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Allen, Professor, Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University and Stephanie Cleland, Assistant Professor, Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Air quality in Canada has improved over the past several decades, and Canada\u2019s air is among the cleanest in the world. But that progress is threatened by smoke from wildfires, which are becoming more frequent and more intense with climate change. </p><p>Canada\u2019s 2023 wildfire season is the worst on record, with more than 5,800 reported fires and over 15 million hectares burned to date. </p><p>Globally, air pollution is a leading cause of death and disease. One of the best indicators of health risk from air pollution is the concentration of very small particles called PM2.5 (which stands for particular matter smaller than 2.5 micrometres). </p><p>PM2.5 particles can deposit deep in the lungs and long-term exposure can cause a wide range of health effects including respiratory and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung cancer and pregnancy complications. Health effects can occur even at low concentrations, including those below current Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards.</p><p>Wildfires produce enormous quantities of PM2.5 and several other hazardous pollutants. Wildfire smoke can travel long distances, exposing large populations \u2014 both close to and far away from fires \u2014 to very high concentrations of pollution. </p><p>The health impact of wildfire smoke</p><p>The pollution mixture and chemical composition of wildfire smoke is often different from the pollution emitted by other sources, and these differences may influence toxicity. The toxicity of wildfire smoke also depends on the type of vegetation and burning conditions and may change as the smoke \u201cages\u201d in the atmosphere. This underscores the need to distinguish the health impacts of wildfire smoke from the impacts of other pollution sources. </p><p>Evidence linking wildfire smoke with adverse health effects has been accumulating for years and the notion that wildfire smoke is \u201cnatural,\u201d and therefore less harmful than other types of air pollution, is not supported by the evidence. </p><p>Most studies have evaluated the relationships between daily changes in smoke levels and indicators of health such as emergency department visits, hospital admissions or deaths. </p><p>There is strong evidence that these \u201cacute\u201d exposures to wildfire smoke increase the risk of respiratory illness and death, and evidence of effects on the cardiovascular system is also growing. Older adults, people living in low-income areas, and those with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and other chronic conditions are most susceptible. </p><p>The health effects of wildfire smoke likely extend beyond the lungs and heart. Recent studies indicate that exposure during pregnancy may increase the risks of preterm birth and decreased birth weight. Smoke may also reduce attention measured on cognitive tests and increase dementia risk. </p><p>More studies are needed, but these effects could have important implications for health during vulnerable stages of life. </p><p>Much less is known about the impacts of exposure to wildfire smoke over longer durations or from multiple episodes. As more Canadians are exposed to smoke, and as the duration of the forest fire season increases, it will be critical to understand the long-term health impacts of repeated smoke exposure, especially among the most at-risk populations. </p><p>Strategies to protect health</p><p>Unlike anthropogenic sources of air pollution, emissions of wildfire smoke cannot be readily controlled at the source. But there are strategies that individuals and communities can use to reduce exposure and health risks. </p><p>Before fires begin, those with chronic conditions can discuss strategies for managing their health with their health-care providers, and ensure access to necessary medications. During smoke events, staying indoors can be beneficial because buildings reduce exposure to outdoor-generated pollution when windows and doors are closed. </p><p>Correctly sized portable HEPA filter air cleaners can reduce indoor PM2.5 by as much as 80 per cent. And well-fitting N95 respirators (or comparable respirators designed and certified for occupational use) can reduce PM2.5 exposure when outdoors or in transit. The Air Quality Health Index and smoke forecasts can help Canadians decide when these strategies are needed.</p><p>These strategies also have limitations. For example, the recommendation to stay indoors assumes that individuals have stable and safe housing. It is also complicated by heat, a major threat to health that may amplify the effects of PM2.5. </p><p>Portable air filters are prohibitively expensive for some families, they do not remove the gases found in wildfire smoke, and they will be less effective for those who spend time in other locations, such as outdoor workers. High quality respirators may be unavailable in some communities, may cause discomfort and a good facial fit will be impossible for many children and some adults.  </p><p>Government and public health agencies can help to offset some of these limitations and ensure more equal protection from smoke by providing accessible and clear messages to the public and establishing clean air shelters in libraries, schools and other public buildings. </p><p>Multiple overlapping strategies are needed to mitigate the health impacts of Canada\u2019s worsening wildfires.</p><p>___</p><p>Ryan Allen has used portable air cleaners purchased at a discounted rate from Woongjin-Coway in his research.</p><p>Stephanie Cleland does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</p><p>___</p><p>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

While fires continued to burn throughout Eeyou Istchee, most are under observation and don\u2019t pose a threat to communities or infrastructure.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The biggest concern at press time was the Wemindji fire 602, which was slowly progressing from the community access road to the Billy Diamond Highway. Thickening smoke from that fire forced the highway\u2019s partial closure on August 27 but it reopened the following morning.  </p><p>High winds projected at 50 km/h prompted a Phase 1 evacuation of 230 of Wemindji\u2019s most vulnerable residents to Chisasibi after a state of emergency was declared August 16. Marking the first time that evacuees had been sent to another Cree community, volunteers hosted most in private homes with the remainder accommodated at the hotel or construction camps.  </p><p>\u201cIt was a short-term evacuation, a precautionary measure,\u201d explained regional fire marshal Lee-Roy Blacksmith. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have had an access road if they wanted to evacuate. Only by air or, if it was really intense, out in the bay. Evacuating over 2,000 people with no access road would have caused a major issue.\u201d </p><p>Blacksmith said SOPFEU had a ground crew working on Fire 602 and was conducting fly-by observations on fires near Waskaganish and the Trans-Taiga Road. While bush and forestry roads were open, travellers were warned to be cautious and to verify their status before heading out. </p><p>On August 29, Eastmain honoured outstanding members of its community, including the many emergency service workers and volunteers who kept it safe during this summer\u2019s forest fires. Eastmain was fully evacuated in mid-July with Chinook helicopters sent by the Canadian Air Force.  </p><p>\u201cIt was pretty hectic on evacuation day, picking up people and transporting them to the airport,\u2019 said Jeremy Shanush, Eastmain\u2019s firefighting team leader. \u201cWe were told by midnight the closest it would get was six kilometres from the community. We were in a rush to make a fire line behind backyards and wetted the wooded areas near the community.\u201d </p><p>When predicted precipitation didn\u2019t arrive because the satellite had confused the heavy smoke with rain clouds, winds fortunately took the fire in the other direction. Shanush said it was strange seeing the community so empty, with only about 15 people left behind, and he stepped in as cook when the blazes were too intense for ground crews. </p><p>With fires between km 70 and 42 along the access road, the Eastmain team started from one end to battle hot spots, meeting up with SOPFEU somewhere in the middle. Trained in forest firefighting 10 years ago, this was the first time Shanush had worked with both SOPFEU and his son, who was one of the new recruits this summer.  </p><p>While SOPFEU\u2019s mandate is to protect communities and infrastructure, Shanush argues that the Cree Nation should have its own forest firefighting entity to protect bush cabins and other \u201ccultural infrastructure.\u201d He did get permission to protect some local camps. </p><p>\u201cAt km 70 where the fire was raging and had gotten past the road, we managed to get through and save camps,\u201d said Shanush. \u201cWe wet the area, left the sprinkler system on overnight and left. The smoke was very dense. There\u2019s a video of my son walking in front of me as my guide. I had to listen to walk the roads.\u201d </p><p>On a night mission to protect a camp at km 38, they arrived just as smoking embers were creeping from under the newly built cabin and managed to extinguish them. While a bulldozer had previously pushed away the surrounding foliage, fire had passed through some remaining vegetation. The cabin\u2019s owner emotionally thanked them at the fire hall the following day. </p><p>Another night they were called at 3am to reinforce the Wemindji fire department. They arrived at 6:30am and went straight to work, battling fires near the airport all day. When SOPFEU workers complained about the smoke, Shanush joked \u201cthis is nothing \u2013 in the teepee you can barely see the guy across from you when we\u2019re cooking.\u201d </p><p>With a fire truck hauling water along the roadside, the crew would pump whatever they could find from nearby creeks with hoses in the woods. Walking the fire edge looking for hot spots, they would sometimes have to extinguish them two to three feet underground, so they didn\u2019t flare up again. </p><p>\u201cSometimes in the woods doing hot spots a sudden flare-up will happen and there\u2019s a big flame right beside you,\u201d Shanush told the Nation. \u201cYou have to be careful with the trees that were burnt. Give a little nudge or step on that root and it could fall on you.\u201d </p><p>While firefighters wait at the base during water bomber missions, Shanush said those trapped in the woods can shoot their hose skywards to communicate their presence. He was impressed by a team from the Yukon that drops self-igniting \u201cdragon eggs\u201d from the air.  </p><p>\u201cThe Yukon boys said we\u2019ll fight fire with fire while the wind is in our favour,\u201d explained Shanush. \u201cThey were afraid the fire would jump the lake, spread to the vegetation and continue along the road to Eastmain so they used that dragon to ignite a dry area. When the wind shifted there was no vegetation, so the plan worked.\u201d </p><p>Visiting firefighters had impromptu lessons on Cree culture in the bush, enjoying traditional goose meals and a visit to the sweat lodge. Shanush introduced a M\u00e9tis crew chief who had long been searching for a ceremonial drum to a friend, who gifted one to him. </p><p>\u201cHe started crying receiving this drum and said I\u2019m very grateful I met you,\u201d shared Shanush. \u201cThey\u2019re far away from home. I hear people complain SOPFEU\u2019s not doing this or that. It\u2019s not true \u2013 I was very thankful for them.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-9e02e888340345c9986473a81c96d5fd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:695C-NJF1-DY9S-T14R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><timeReceived>07:17 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 12, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(Midland) is pleased to announce that work will resume in the vicinity of the recent nickel-copper (Ni-Cu) discovery named Santos. This zone was discovered during the maiden drilling program completed by Rio Tinto Exploration Canada Inc. (RTEC) on the Tte Nord property. The upcoming drilling program will begin shortly to test new prospective geophysical targets located near Santos as well as further south in the vicinity of the Palmeiras and Savane showings. Located near the town of La Tuque, Quebec, the Tte Nord property is currently wholly owned by Midland but is subject to an option agreement with RTEC since December 2021 (see press release by Midland dated December 2, 2021). Highlights:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Commencement of a new drilling program with 6 drill holes totalling up to 1,900 metres;</p><p>Several new drilling targets identified in the Santos and Palmeiras areas, north of the former Lac Edouard Ni-Cu mine;</p><p>New drilling targets at Savane. New drilling targets at Santos and Palmeiras Over the past few months, ground-based gravity surveys were completed in the vicinity of the new Santos Ni-Cu zone and further south along the same N-S-trending structure, in the vicinity of the Palmeiras showing. The gravity survey led to the identification of new prospective drilling targets, favourably located near the two showings. This new drilling campaign will consist of six (6) drill holes totalling up to 1,900 metres and is scheduled to begin in early July, depending on the forest fire situation in this part of the province of Quebec. During the maiden drilling program, drill hole MDLD0015, designed to test a VTEM anomaly and an off-hole anomaly detected in drill hole MDLD0009, intersected from 14 metres to 80 metres downhole depth, several layers with Ni-Cu mineralization within altered gabbro horizons. From 20.11 to 22.79 metres, the drill hole intersected 1.10% Ni and 0.71% Cu over 2.68 metres. Further down, from 33.02 to 43.39 metres, a mineralized interval graded 0.45% Ni and 0.18% Cu over 10.37 metres(see press release by Midland dated April 27, 2023). Regionally, this new Santos zone is favourably located along a N-S-trending structure, approximately 8 km north of the former Lac Edouard Ni-Cu mine. Modelling of the ground gravity survey completed this summer in the Santos area led to the identification of a new anomaly located a few hundred metres northwest of the Santos zone. A total of three (3) drill holes totalling up to 900 metres will be completed in the Santos area. Two of these drill holes will test possible extensions of the Santos zone to the south and west, and the third drill hole will be collared northwest of Santos to test the new gravity anomaly. Approximately two kilometres south of Santos, along the same N-S-trending structure, a large gravity anomaly was detected immediately north of the Palmeiras showing, where mineralized Melagabbro to pyroxenite outcrops were identified near VTEM anomalies. One (1) drill hole totalling up to 300 metres is planned to test this new geophysical target. Additional drilling on the Savane showing A gravity survey was also completed in the Savane showing area. During the maiden drilling campaign, a mineralized interval intersected in drill hole MDLD0001 graded 1.07% Ni and 0.13% Cu over 0.78 metre, from 101.87 to 102.65 metres. Modelling of the gravity survey resulted in a better definition of the geometry of the mineralized intrusion at Savane and the identification of two lobes possibly representing previously unknown parts of the mineralized intrusion. Two (2) drill holes totalling up to 700 metres will be completed to test these intrusive targets. In addition, prospecting work will be conducted approximately 750 metres northwest of the Savane showing, to explain the presence of a new gravity anomaly like the one associated with the mineralized intrusion at the Savane Ni-Cu showing. About the Tte Nord Ni-Cu property The Tte Nord property covers mafic and ultramafic rocks of the La Bostonnais Complex north of La Tuque, which hosts the former Lac Edouard mine that historically produced 50,000 tonnes of ore grading 1.50% Ni and 0.50% Cu (source: SIGEOM NTS sheet</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2023 Market News Publishing Inc.

The amount would also fund a temporary FireSmart co-ordinator. The grant is through the UBCM Community Resiliency Investment Program, which has funded fire mitigation work around the province, including Kimberley, for several years.</p><p>In a report to Council, Fire Chief Rick Prasad noted that Kimberley has been impacted by wildfires since it was established in the late 1800s.</p><p>\u201cIn 1917, most of the City was lost to a large wildfire that originated to the southwest of town. Since 1917 there have been over 40 recorded wildfires that have either directly impacted the City or threatened the City. The most recent was the 2018 Meachum Creek Fire which resulted in a two-week evacuation alert. To date most of our efforts have concentrated on the landscape to the southwest of town where we expect the \u201cproblem\u201d fire is likely to originate.</p><p>\u201cMore recently, there has been a pattern throughout the province of large project fires making long distance runs due to passing cold fronts. In the case of Kimberley, this would suggest a wildfire to the northwest of town being driven by northwest winds and running down Mark Creek into the community. Work in the Townsite area would start to anchor a treated buffer for that contingency. The outcomes of the proposed treatments include greater firefighter success in initial attack, improved firefighter safety, and greater resilience for the ecosystem \u201cThe 8th Avenue area is heavily used by hikers and mountain bikers and has been treated in the past, Prasad said. The area west of Forest Crowne is also heavily used hikers and bikers, and the adjacent St. Mary\u2019s Lake Road is heavily used with high potential for human-caused ignitions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIMDBU-news20221122PPLA0003152014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIMDBU2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66XM-BG21-F0HF-84YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"307\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

I can only imagine what it is like for those on the front lines, living in the danger zones or working as firefighters. </p><p><br/><br/> There are the obvious costs to families forced to flee from forest fires - homes lost, health compromised, communities hammered, but there is also the less obvious cost: <url normalizedValue=\"https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/climate-change-is-exacerbating-forest-fires-and-vice-versa-experts-say\">the fires are spewing millions of tons of green house gases into the atmosphere</url>. It is a vicious circle where climate heating encourages more fires and more fires cause the climate crisis to deepen. <br/><br/> On May 31, the Ontario's minister of natural resources was in northwestern Ontario to announce a new government program whose purpose, stripped of all the bafflegab, is to burn more wood. <br/><br/> Through a series of sleight of hands biomass energy (burning wood) is considered a renewable energy source. Bizarre as it sounds, renewable energy sources are wind, water, solar and burning wood. <br/><br/> Admittedly, Ontario isn't alone in this fiction. The conventional view is that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from burning wood can be offset by the carbon dioxide sequestered by trees planted to replace those burned.

Remaining blazes are still observed by satellite and occasional flyovers to ensure communities are not endangered. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cYou won\u2019t see the fires on satellite because the humidity is high,\u201d said Blacksmith. \u201cPeople want to know if it\u2019s safe to go to their camps. The restriction has been lifted. The roads are open but be cautious that the fires are still burning in those intense areas.\u201d </p><p>As this unprecedented fire season winds down, the Cree Nation Government has launched a cabin damage assessment registry, in collaboration with the Cree Trappers\u2019 Association and Niskamoon Corporation. Data gathered from reporting the extent of loss and damages to dwellings and other cultural infrastructure will support remediation efforts and the development of a regional comprehensive strategy.  </p><p>With devastating impacts to numerous camps and traplines, land users have begun reflecting on the long-term repercussions to wildlife and the Cree way of life. Fred Tomatuk, chairperson of the Eeyou Marine Region Wildlife Board (EMRWB), told the Nation he had concerns about the forest\u2019s conditions since last winter\u2019s freeze-up. </p><p>\u201cThere was no snow when it started freezing so there was a bed of permafrost where the snow sat,\u201d said Tomatuk. \u201cWhen things did start melting down, whatever melted by day was frozen in the night again. The fires went down four to five feet deep because the soil had never really gotten wet.\u201d </p><p>According to traditional knowledge, winters need a warm spell to have good growth in the spring, but that didn\u2019t happen this year. Tomatuk also knew something was wrong when another predictor of summer growth, the pussy willows, didn\u2019t come out until nearly June instead of late March as usual.  </p><p>\u201cI keep a diary of weather observations,\u201d said Tomatuk. \u201cDuring the 41 days we were at our goose camp it only rained for 10 hours. Where the normal shoreline is [on the Eastmain River] you could see the rocks and mud flats. In early spring, I had about 500 sparrows on my yard \u2013 nothing was growing so they concentrated where they could find food.\u201d </p><p>While he\u2019s previously witnessed two forest fires that swept east to west, this summer\u2019s destruction blazed an immense path north to south. No foliage or blueberries can now be seen along Eastmain\u2019s access road from km 40 to 70, \u201conly black soil and all kinds of rocks you never saw before.\u201d </p><p>Since fires ripped through marshlands at nesting season, Tomatuk has observed almost no waterfowl, and an eerie silence has replaced the once plentiful frog song. He said smoke residue forms a slimy barrier on pond surfaces that pushes surviving life to hibernate in the depths. With fish catches a small fraction of their usual level, otter and mink lose their food sources, which is disastrous for the already struggling fur market.  </p><p>Observing two moose on a small island of a burnt-out lake along with some beavers, Tomatuk worries where they will find food. The wildfires have upended the EMRWB\u2019s fish research and programs that share harvests with the community. Land users who relied on berry harvests or materials for snowshoe-making are finding their economic prospects uncertain. </p><p>\u201cIt means a total relocation of the wildlife,\u201d Tomatuk lamented. \u201cComing back from evacuation, it broke my heart. I got emotional and cried a bit. I can only imagine how some of the Elders feel.\u201d </p><p>Before the time of climate change, Waswanipi tallyman Paul Dixon said nomadic Cree hunters looked forward to a new world growing after a forest fire. Birch and aspen sprout up first, mixed deciduous bush that is ideal habitat for moose and smaller game. These are considered natural fire barriers by the Cree but unmarketable \u201cweeds\u201d by the forestry industry, which seeks more flammable spruce and pine. </p><p>\u201cWhen Smokey the Bear outlawed traditional burns, my ancestors moved traditional burns to the main canoe routes only on islands to create blueberry or bear hills,\u201d shared Dixon. \u201cForestry cannot compare \u2013 heavy machinery destroys the earth; scarification destroys the rest. The land starts to erode because no trees are left to stabilize the ground.\u201d </p><p>As Waswanipi is the Cree community most impacted by forestry, this summer\u2019s fires have radically altered consultations with Quebec\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests. Salvage planning began July 4 while fires were still burning in the region, a fast-track process to appease forestry companies desperate to get back to work. </p><p>\u201cOnce they\u2019re authorized, they\u2019re going to go into the green areas if we don\u2019t have the salvage plans,\u201d said forestry consultant Allan Saganash. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us \u2013 we want them to stay away from the green areas. The amount of timber that burned in Eeyou Istchee is equal to nine annual forestry plans.\u201d </p><p>However, industry wants to return to green areas next year, arguing burnt wood will be too damaged by insect infestation and isn\u2019t accessible by road. Saganash said the Crees are filing complaints with the ministry to protest this wastage. While salvaging burnt timber is nothing new, having fires impact 36 of 62 traplines was unimaginable and Saganash believes the Paix des Braves agreement should be amended in response.  </p><p>According to a clause in the agreement, seven traplines will close to logging for at least five years after this season because their protected area will be affected over 40%. This will put more harvesting pressure on the remaining traplines.  </p><p>With Zone 17 almost completely burned, traplines in Zone 22 will be particularly active as the moose hunting season begins. The CTA is considering how to limit harvests of the declining moose population while supporting the many Cree hunters who lost their camps. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much wildlife and habitats lost,\u201d said Saganash. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling. They won\u2019t be able to hunt in peace for at least five or six years but they\u2019re still going out there. Even the guy whose trapline burned 100% will go out hunting with the hope there will be some moose in the green areas.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-139c9afa96a64f879fa387e2120aa110</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6985-8PF1-JBVR-310N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1034\"/><timeReceived>01:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 25, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000187</classCode><className>BIRDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DNK2</classCode><className>DIARY KEEPING &amp; JOURNALING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A38F</classCode><className>MARINE MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008X9E</classCode><className>MARSHALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001832</classCode><className>WETLANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE000A4UW</classCode><className>PAT QUINN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I am in southern Ontario, about 200 kms from the nearest forest fire but the air is hazy, there is smoke in every breath, our windows are closed and the air is being filtered. I can only imagine what it is like for those on the front lines, living in the danger zones or working as firefighters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are the obvious costs to families forced to flee from forest fires - homes lost, health compromised, communities hammered, but there is also the less obvious cost: the fires are spewing millions of tons of green house gases into the atmosphere. It is a vicious circle where climate heating encourages more fires and more fires cause the climate crisis to deepen.</p><p>On May 31, the Ontario's minister of natural resources was in northwestern Ontario to announce a new government program whose purpose, stripped of all the bafflegab, is to burn more wood.</p><p>Through a series of sleight of hands biomass energy (burning wood) is considered a renewable energy source. Bizarre as it sounds, renewable energy sources are wind, water, solar and burning wood.</p><p>Admittedly, Ontario isn't alone in this fiction. The conventional view is that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from burning wood can be offset by the carbon dioxide sequestered by trees planted to replace those burned. This supposed carbon neutrality assumes that forests are carbon sinks. Instead, we now know Canada's forests are carbon sources.</p><p>The minister was announcing funding of about $20 million under the Forest Biomass Action Plan. The Ford government has taken a climate threatening practice - burning wood to make energy - and has transformed it into a pillar of the new green economy.</p><p>The Forest Biomass Action plan describes the initiative as \"helping to reduce emissions and addressing climate change.\" And argues it will, \"position Ontario as a leader in the growing circular and green economy.\"</p><p>The greenwashing makes it easy to forget that, for the most part, the initiative will generate more greenhouse gas by burning wood.</p><p>At the top of the Action Plan's objectives is this: \"The Forest Biomass Program will support projects to harvest more wood from Crown forests ...\" Throughout are references to \"underutilized species\" and \"uncommercial trees.\" But whether a tree is uncommercial or from an underutilized species, if it continues to grow it is sequestering carbon.</p><p>The Action Plan also includes a completely cynical effort to broaden the definition of green hydrogen - hydrogen created by using solar and wind renewable energy - to include hydrogen created by burning wood.</p><p>There are opportunities, innovations and breakthroughs that can occur from rethinking our approach to forests, wood harvesting and biomass. There is an international scramble among countries to emerge as major players in the new bio-economy. Forests can support biodiversity, pharmaceuticals and medicines, fibres, and bio plastics. There are ways to use our forest resources more sustainably with less wood waste.</p><p>But in Ford's Ontario we have been forced to think about the balance of probabilities. Is the Action Plan about using wood residues and waste more effectively and seeing intact forests as a resource or is it about more clear cutting, the threat of deforestation and burning more wood?</p><p>In the last few years, on separate occasions, hundreds of scientists have asked governments around the world to recognize that burning wood emits more carbon than fossil fuels and poses major health risks. Scientists have asked government leaders to stop subsidizing biomass energy.</p><p>The European Union has revised its Renewable Energy Directive by tightening the sustainability criteria and prohibiting the use of biomass from primary and highly biodiverse forests.</p><p>This week as fires burn across the country the Ontario government is encouraging us to burn more wood. And providing more subsidies for forest biomass energy.

HON. JUSTIN TRUDEAU: IF PIERRE POILIEVRE WANTED TO BE A RESPONSIBLE LEADER -- I'LL EVEN GIVE HIM THE WORDS.<br/>THIS IS WHAT HE SHOULD SAY.<br/>I REJECT CATEGORICALLY THE ENDORSEMENT AND THE SUPPORT OF DIAGOLON AND OF ALEX JONES.<br/>   DAVID: MEANWHILE, THE CONSERVATIVES ARE TRYING TO CAPITALIZE ON TRUDEAU'S LOW POPULARITY BY INVITING MARK CARNEY, WHO IS OFTEN TOUTED AS A POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR TO TRUDEAU, TO GIVE HIS THOUGHTS ON THE BUDGET AT A PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE.<br/>TIME TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS WITH THE FRIDAY \"POWER PANEL.\"<br/>YOU HEAR PAUL IN THE BACKGROUND.<br/>NIIGAAN SINCLAIR, JASON MARKOSOFF, PAUL WELLS AND MARIE VASTEL.<br/>PAUL, LET'S START.<br/>I GUESS THIS IS A NORMAL WEEK NOW IN NATIONAL POLITICS.<br/>A DISCUSSION OF POLICY AND INVESTMENT AND INDUSTRIAL INITIATIVES AND THESE WEDGE THINGS ON THE CULTURE SIDE OF THINGS AND TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE LEADERSHIP.<br/>WHERE DO YOU THINK WE ARE ON THE DAY?<br/>   WHERE DO YOU THINK WE ARE AT THE DAY?<br/>   I BELIEVE MARK CARNEY WILL BE A CANDIDATE FOR THE LIBERAL LEADERSHIP AT SOME POINT.<br/>I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT 10 DAYS AGO.<br/>IF HE'S NOT GETTING READY TO RUN TO LAUNCH A CANDIDACY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE'S DOING.<br/>AND FAIR.<br/>THERE'S A GROWING CONSTITUENCY WITHIN THE PARTY WHO THINK OF HIM AS A VERY GOOD NEXT-TIME CANDIDATE AND THAT MIGHT BE NEXT WEEK FOR ALL WE KNOW.<br/>THE THING ABOUT POILIEVRE INCREASINGLY CALLING HIM THE NEXT LEADER IS CLASSIC POST-HARPER CONSERVATIVE TACTICS.<br/>THEY RAN AN AD IN 2007-8 IN WHICH MICHAEL IGNATIEFF HARANGUES STEPHANE DION ABOUT FAILED ENVIRONMENT POLICY.<br/>AND I WROTE A COLUMN SAYING THIS IS TO SET LIBERALS AMONGST THEMSELVES, AND A CONSERVATIVE STRATEGIST OF THE DAY WROTE TO ME AND SAID IF THE JOURNALISM THING DOESN'T WORK OUT, YOU CAN COME WORK WITH US AS A STRATEGIST, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING.<br/>AND THE REST IS FOR THE OTHER PANELLISTS.<br/>CARNEY IS SEEN AS A JUICY TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY BY THE CONSERVATIVES.<br/>   DAVID: OKAY.<br/>NIIGAAN, WHAT'S YOUR VIEW OF THIS?<br/>YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GO WHERE YOU WANT WITH THIS?<br/>DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC STUFF, WEDGE STUFF, OR FOCUS ON THIS FOR THE WHOLE PANEL?<br/>   [ LAUGHTER ]<br/>WELL, I WAS GOING TO SPEND SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS HONDA INVESTMENT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A VERY CLASSIC SITUATION WHERE DOUG FORD IS USING AND ARGUABLY TRUDEAU AS WELL, ARGUING THAT INVESTMENT IS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY AS OPPOSED TO WHAT MARK CARNEY CRITICIZED THE BUDGET FOR, WHICH IS NOT ENOUGH INVESTMENT.<br/>AND THAT IS A VERY CLASSIC DISTRACTION SCENARIO THAT I THINK ALSO TALKS A LOT ABOUT WHAT POILIEVRE IS DOING WITH HIS POLITICAL STRATEGY.<br/>WE SEEM TO BE IN THE POLITICS OF DISTRACTION, MAYBE WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF IT.<br/>MAYBE WE ARE AT THE TAIL END OF IT.<br/>WHO KNOWS.<br/>THE POLITICS OF DISTRACTION REALLY LOOKS LIKE WE ARE IGNORING THE FACT THAT FOREST FIRES STARTED THIS WEEK AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CARBON TAX WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT FOREST FIRES STARTED OUT ON THE WEST COAST AND WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT ALBERTA INTO SASKATCHEWAN, EVEN INTO MANITOBA, AND THAT THAT FOREST FIRE ISSUE IS A CRITICAL ISSUE INVOLVING CLIMATE CHANGE AND IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ARGUE FOR ANY SITUATION OR ANY ISSUE AROUND THE CARBON TAX WHEN IT COMES TO DISCUSSING FOREST FIRES, AND ON TOP OF THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU DISCUSS THE HONDA INVESTMENT FOR EVS, YOU REALLY JUST IGNORE THE FACT THAT DOUG FORD'S GOVERNMENT HAS COMPLETELY FAILED WHEN IT COMES TO THE RING OF FIRE IN TERMS OF INDIGENOUS CONSULTATION AND THE FACT IS YOU CANNOT SIMPLY MOVE IN TO TRY TO TAKE LITHIUM OR ENERGY OF ANY KIND WITHOUT FIRST NATIONS CONSULTATIONS.<br/>SO THE FACT THAT DOUG FORD HASN'T REALLY DEALT WITH THAT ISSUE WHATSOEVER AND IS MAKING MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT ANNOUNCEMENTS REALLY INDICATES THAT BOTH HIM AND PERHAPS TRUDEAU ARE REALLY JUMPING THE GUN AND FOCUSING MUCH MORE ON ECONOMIC ISSUES THAN SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY CRITICALLY FACING THE COUNTRY.<br/>   DAVID: OKAY.<br/>TO CORRECT YOU ON THE WILDFIRES, THEY DIDN'T START THIS WEEK.<br/>THE EVACUATION ALERTS STARTED THIS WEEK.<br/>THOSE WILDFIRES HAVE BEEN SINCE LAST YEAR.<br/>WINTER DIDN'T PUT SOME OF THEM OUT, WHICH UNDERSCORES THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE ISSUE YOU'RE RAISING.<br/>MARIA, WHY DO YOU THINK WE ARE AT THE END OF THE WEEK OF BUDGET CONTINUES THE BIG HONDA DEAL AND NOW WEDGE ISSUES GALORE?<br/>   WELL, TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.<br/>I THINK ON THE BUDGET IT'S TRUE THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN A BUMP DESPITE FOUR WEEKS OF SELLING IT, WHICH COULD BE SURPRISING, BUT I WAS LOOKING AT THE ANGUS REID POLL, I THINK IT WAS YESTERDAY, WHERE THE CONSERVATIVES REMAIN 20 POINTS AHEAD OF THE LIBERALS AFTER ALL THIS EFFORT TO SELL -- FIRST OF ALL, TO THROW MONEY AT SOLUTIONS FOR HOUSING AND AFFORDABILITY AND THEN THROWING ENERGY I GUESS AT SELLING IT.<br/>AND THE POLLS HAVEN'T REALLY MOVED.<br/>BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLICIES, WHICH ANGUS REID ACTUALLY ASKED ABOUT, PHARMACARE, DENTAL CARE, DISABILITY BENEFITS, THOSE ARE ALL SUPPORTED BY OVER 70 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS.<br/>AND THINGS LIKE LEASING FEDERAL LAND FOR HOUSING OR INVESTING IN HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE, THOSE ARE 58, 65 PERCENT SUPPORT.<br/>SO THERE IS AN APPETITE FOR WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET.<br/>SO I'M CURIOUS TO SEE IF OVER TIME THESE NUMBERS MOVE IF THOSE POLICY ANNOUNCEMENTS START TO PERCOLATE IN PEOPLE'S MINDS OR WHETHER IT'S A LITTLE TOO LATE AND PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT ANYMORE FROM THIS GOVERNMENT OR THIS PRIME MINISTER.<br/>BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE POTENTIAL FOR MOVEMENT, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE PIERRE POILIEVRE AND JUSTIN TRUDEAU HAVE LARGE UNFAVOURABLES.<br/>SO NO ONE REALLY SEEMS THAT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT EITHER OF THEM.<br/>ON THE WEDGE ISSUE, I NOTICED THAT THE PRIME MINISTER IS MORE ON THE OFFENSIVE AS OF LATE, KIND OF RESPONDING TO WHAT PIERRE POILIEVRE -- AND I UNDERSTAND THE URGE, AND I'M NOT SAYING IT'S WRONG.<br/>I JUST WORRY SOMETIMES ABOUT THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE AND PUBLIC POLICY.<br/>THINGS LIKE THE HONDA DEAL, ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY.<br/>SOMEONE FROM CTV ASKED ABOUT JOB NUMBERS, WHICH IS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION THAT PEOPLE ASK, AND THE PRIME MINISTER VERY INSTANTLY SORT OF BARKS BACK WITH AN ATTACK ON THE CONSERVATIVES.<br/>I DON'T KNOW IF THAT REALLY SERVES PUBLIC DISCOURSE OR PUBLIC POLICY.<br/>IF YOU LOOK AT GUN CONTROL, FOUR YEARS LATER WE STILL DON'T HAVE A BUYBACK PROGRAMME.<br/>IT'S A GREAT WEDGE ISSUE, BUT PERHAPS BUYBACK PROGRAMME IS MORE PORN THAN HAVING A WEDGE ISSUE FOR THE NEXT ELECTION.<br/>SO I UNDERSTAND THE -- I'M NOT SAYING THE LIBERALS ARE WRONG FOR DOING IT.<br/>I JUST WORRY ABOUT THE LEVEL OF DISCOURSE IN THIS COUNTRY IF WE'RE GOING DOWN INSTEAD OF TRYING TO GO UP.<br/>I DON'T THINK GOING UP WILL COME FROM THE CONSERVATIVES.<br/>SO I'M NOT SAYING --<br/>   DAVID: THERE'S A LOT OF LIBERAL SUPPORTERS PROBABLY WATCHING THIS NOW SAYING YOU'RE BLAMING TRUDEAU FOR THIS?<br/>   I'M NOT BLAMING TRUDEAU.<br/>I'M JUST AS A CITIZEN A LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT WHERE THINGS ARE GOING.<br/>I'M NOT SAYING IT'S TRUDEAU'S FAULT MORE THAN POILIEVRE'S FAULT.<br/>CERTAINLY NOT.<br/>AND I UNDERSTAND THE URGE TO RESPOND WHEN SOMEONE IS SAYING YOU'RE SPEWING BULLSHIT ALL THE TIME, BUT I JUST AS A NAIVE CITIZEN AND VOTER, I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE THINGS --<br/>   DAVID: LOOK, I AGREE WITH YOU.<br/>DIRECTIONAL --<br/>   MY OPTIMISM IS HURT.<br/>   DAVID: I AGREE WITH YOU.<br/>DIRECTIONALLY THE CONVERSATION OF THE COUNTRY, SOME PEOPLE WON'T EVEN COME ON SHOWS LIKE THIS AT ALL TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION.<br/>JASON, JUST TO TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET FOR A SECOND, AS MARIE POINTS OUT, INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE POLICIES MAY BE POPULAR BUT THE WHOLE IS LESS THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS WHEN IT COMES TO WINNING OVER EITHER AN OVERSATURATED OR EXHAUSTED ELECTORATE OR JUST A DISINTERESTED ELECTORATE.<br/>WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT THIS ROLL-OUT THAT WAS PRAISED FROM A COMMUNICATIONS PERSPECTIVE BY SOME PEOPLE HAS POLICIES THAT PEOPLE LIKE ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND THEN THE HONDA ANNOUNCEMENT STILL HAS PEOPLE DONE WITH THIS PRIME MINISTER, AT LEAST FROM WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY?<br/>   I MEAN, THE COMPONENTS ARE NOT WHAT PIERRE POILIEVRE IS ATTACKING.<br/>HE'S NOT ATTACKING THE HOUSING MEASURES OR DENTAL CARE, PHARMACARE.<br/>HE HASN'T BEEN ATTACKING THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX.<br/>HE WON'T BE ATTACKING ALONG SIDE, YOU KNOW, DOUG FORD AND JUSTIN TRUDEAU'S HONDA ANNOUNCEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER EV ANNOUNCEMENTS.<br/>THOSE ARE SEEMINGLY, YOU KNOW -- HE MUST SENSE THEY ARE POPULAR ENOUGH NOT TO WAN TO ATTACK.<br/>ALL HE HAS TO DO IS ATTACK THE FIGUREHEAD WHO IS ANNOUNCING THESE THINGS AND THAT SEEMS SUFFICIENT.<br/>THE THING IS, THIS IS WITH A -- THE FIRST WEEK OF THE BUDGET AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO BOUNCE.<br/>LIBERALS WOULD HAVE SAID GIVE IT TIME.<br/>BUT AS MARY SAID, THIS IS WEEK FOUR OF THE BUDGET ANNOUNCEMENTS AND STILL NOTHING.<br/>I THINK A LOT OF LIBERALS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS WAS A ONE BIG INDIRECTION POINT.<br/>THERE ARE NOT MANY BIG INFLECTION POINTS TO COME BEFORE NEXT OCTOBER.<br/>ONE MORE BUDGET.<br/>THE U.S. ELECTION MAYBE.<br/>THIS SEEMED TO THEM LIKE A CHANCE TO TURN THE PAGE AND THE PAGE HAS NOT BEEN TURNED.<br/>THE POLICIES MAY BE POPULAR.<br/>THEY MAY APPRECIATE THAT THEY'RE TAKING MORE SERIOUS TONE ON HOUSING, BUT THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE THANKS FOR IT.<br/>   DAVID: YEAH.<br/>AND, YOU KNOW, TO MARIE'S POINT I THINK IT WAS ON THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND AS YOU SAID, THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN THE BAIT ON THAT FIGHT IT SEEMS.<br/>YOU KNOW, I THINK THE LIBERALS WANT TO DEBATE THEM INTO A FIGHT OVER TAXATION AND FAIRNESS AND THE LIBERALS HAVEN'T BITTEN ON THAT.<br/>PAUL, I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO MARK CARNEY FOR A SECOND.<br/>I WANT TO SHOW A STATEMENT HE ISSUED TODAY IN A RESPONSE TO A QUESTION TO COME TO OGO.<br/>CARNEY SAYS, I'M NOT INTERESTED IN PLAYING GAMES ON SUCH IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR CANADA'S ECONOMIC FUTURE.<br/>CANADIANS RIGHTLY EXPECT OUR ELECTED PARLIAMENTARIANS TO PRODUCE SOLUTIONS TO CANADA'S CHALLENGES RATHER THAN PERFORMING POLITICAL STUNTS OR MINDLESSLY REPEATING SIMPLISTIC SLOGANS.<br/>AN INTERESTING REBUTTAL THERE, PAUL.<br/>SHACHI KURL WAS ON THE SHOW LAST NIGHT SAYING WITH POILIEVRE HAVING SUCH A CEMENTED LEAD FOR SUCH A PERIOD OF TIME, MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO START TALKING ABOUT WHAT HIS SPECIFICS WOULD BE.<br/>SOMETHING I THINK JOURNALISTS TRY TO DO AND DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A LOT OF LUCK.<br/>WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT ARGUMENT FROM THE FORMER BANK HEAD THERE?<br/>   UM...<br/>I WOULD HAVE RESPONDED THE SAME WAY IN THE UNLIKELY SCENARIO WHERE ANYONE IN PARLIAMENT TRIED TO HAUL ME IN FRONT OF A COMMITTEE.<br/>[ LAUGHTER ]<br/>I THINK THERE IS A LITTLE RISK IN CALLING A PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE A GAME.<br/>A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT'S THE BUSINESS OF PARLIAMENT AND IT'S SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO SPEND A LOT OF HIS TIME THERE MIGHT WANT TO POP BY.<br/>BUT I WAS STRUCK BY THE TONE, WHICH IS -- OF MR. CARNEY'S RELEASE, WHICH IS VERY FORMAL.<br/>AND SEEMS AN ODD FIT FOR THE POILIEVRE ERA.<br/>BUT PART OF ME WONDERS IF HE WANTS TO BE THE NEXT, NEXT-TIME GUY.<br/>HE'S SETTING THE TABLE FOR A BRIEF CATASTROPHIC POILIEVRE PRIME MINISTERSHIP AFTER WHICH CANADIANS MIGHT BE YEARNING FOR ADULT SUPERVISION.<br/>THAT'S A HELP OF A BANG SHOT.<br/>IT'S A -- THERE'S A LOT OF IFS IN THAT STRATEGY.<br/>   DAVID: PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN MANIPULATE THE POLITICAL UNIVERSE -- I'M NOT SAYING HE'S DOING THAT.<br/>THERE HAVE BEEN NET GREAT HOPES AND IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.<br/>   MORE SIMPLY, THE FACT THAT CARNEY IS NOT AT ALL LIKE THE PERSON HE'S FACING MIGHT BE VERY APPEALING TO LIBERALS.<br/>ALMOST EVERY NEW PRIME MINISTER THAT I HAVE COVERED SEEMED LIKE A HORROR TO THE PARTY THAT THEY REPLACED, RIGHT?<br/>CHRETIEN SEEMED LIKE A BUFFOON TO MULRONEY CONSERVATIVES.<br/>AND JUSTIN TRUDEAU, NICE HAIR, BUT NOT A SERIOUS -- JUST NOT READY AND YET -- AND SO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORSE PLACED TO JUDGE THE EFFECT THAT AN OPPONENT MIGHT HAVE ARE THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM HE'S AN OPPONENT.<br/>ANYWAY.<br/>   DAVID: AND, NIIGAAN, WHAT'S YOUR SENSE ON THIS PUSHBACK FROM CARNEY SAYING ESSENTIALLY THIS IS A STUNT AND IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS YOU HAVE TO GO BEYOND SLOGANS BECAUSE THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE RATHER EFFECTIVELY STUCK WITH THE DISCIPLINE OF AXE ATTACKS, FIX THE HOMES, STOP THE BUDGET, STOP THE CRIME.<br/>EVERYONE KNOWS THE TERMS NOW.<br/>WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HEM TRYING TO ENTICE -- HIM TRYING TO ENTICE HIM INTO COMMITTEE TO GET HIM TO CRITICIZES THE CURRENT PRIME MINISTER AND HIS ECONOMIC PLAN?<br/>   YEAH, THERE'S TWO BIG ONES THERE.<br/>ONE IS HE ALREADY CRITICIZED THE PRIME MINISTER.<br/>AND SECOND IS HIM BY PLAYING THE KIND OF GAME OF -- HE'S CALLING THE VERY COMMITTEE A GAME IS -- BOTH PLAY INTO A REAL SORT OF CONSERVATIVE NARRATIVE.<br/>YOU KNOW, POLLING COMES OUT RECENTLY ABOUT WHO WOULD BE THE POSSIBLE NEXT SUCCESSOR, AND THE THREE CANDIDATES ARE MELANIE JOLY AND CHRYSTIA FREELAND AND MARK CARNEY.<br/>AND NONE OF THEM BROKE THE 20 PERCENT BARRIER.<br/>WHAT DID BREAK THE 20 PERCENT BARRIER WAS WE DON'T KNOW ANYONE OR I DON'T KNOW.<br/>THAT'S WHAT CANADIAN POLLS SAID.<br/>AND SO THAT TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT, \"A,\" WHETHER TRUDEAU HAS THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO RUN IN THE NEXT FEDERAL ELECTION.<br/>AND I THINK ALL SIGNS POINT TO THAT HE'S GOING TO MAKE A RUN FOR IT.<br/>   DAVID: YEAH.<br/>   WHAT HAS HE GOT ELSE LEFT EXCEPT FOR TO TRY TO CEMENT A LEGACY OR RECOVER A LEGACY IN SOME KIND BECAUSE HE'S REALLY AT HIS LAST LEGS POLITICALLY.<br/>AND THEN ALSO THERE REALLY ISN'T A BIG SUCCESSOR WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GREAT NEXT HOPE, THE WORDS PAUL MARTIN CAME IN MIND TO ME BECAUSE WHILE LIBERALS PUT ALL OF THEIR EGGS IN THE MARTIN BASKET, IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T TURN OUT VERY WELL.<br/>AND ENDED UP WITH THREE REIGNS OF STEPHEN HARPER.<br/>THE REACTION IS LIBERALS SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT NOT JUST THIS UPCOMING ELECTION, BUT WHAT THE NEXT FEW LOOK LIKE.<br/>IF THEY ARE LOOKING AT LOSING THEN WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT SUCCESSOR AND WHAT WOULD BE THAT SUCCESSOR THAT COULD TAKE THEM LONG TERM INTO AT LEAST TWO ELECTIONS?<br/>AND THE REALITY IS IT NEEDS TO BE SOMEONE WHO IS WELL-KNOWN TO CANADIANS, AND IF JUSTIN TRUDEAU IS GOING -- IS HE GOING TO HEAD INTO THE NEXT ELECTION -- IF HE'S GOING TO HEAD INTO THE NEXT ELECTION, HOW MUCH OF A MULRONEY-LIKE DAMAGE WILL THAT BE?<br/>WILL IT BE A COMPLETE AND ABJECT FAILURE?<br/>THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND THOUGHT ABOUT RIGHT NOW.<br/>   DAVID: MARIE, WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF THAT?<br/>I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER COVERED A POLITICIAN WHO IS CAMPAIGNING WHO DOESN'T THINK THEY CAN WIN.<br/>'CAUSE I THINK YOU NEED THAT IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND TO HAVE THE ENERGY TO DO WHAT IS REQUIRED.<br/>AND THE MINUTE THEY LOSE THAT YOU JUST SEE THEM KIND OF PHYSICALLY SHUT DOWN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.<br/>THERE'S NO INDICATION TO ME THAT TRUDEAU IS GETTING READY TO LEAVE OR PEOPLE AROUND HIM ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT.<br/>   YEAH.<br/>   DAVID: BUT HOW DO YOU THINK THEY NEED TO LOOK AT THE NEXT 18 MONTHS AHEAD?<br/>DO YOU THINK THEY THINK THEY CAN CREDIBLY GET IT BACK OR IS IT ABOUT RAISING THE FLOOR POTENTIALLY OF WHERE THE NEXT ELECTION MIGHT GO?<br/>   I DON'T GET THE SENSE HE WANTS TO LEAVE.<br/>I THINK THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL FIGHT FOR HIM.<br/>I THINK HE WANTS TO SAVE HIS LEGACY, QUOTE, UNQUOTE, HIS WORDS, NOT MIND.<br/>THIS FIGHT WITH POILIEVRE I THINK HE TAKES PERSONALLY THAT THIS IS NOT WHAT HE WANTS CANADA TO LOOK LIKE.<br/>I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING ANYWHERE.<br/>I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS PUSHING HIM TO GO ANYWHERE QUITE FRANKLY.<br/>EVEN IF SOME PEOPLE THINK IT MIGHT BE BETTER WITH SOMEONE ELSE, NO ONE'S GOING TO PUSH OUT THE GUY WHO ESSENTIALLY SAVED THEM FROM THEIR ASHES BECAUSE WHEN MR. TRUDEAU CAME ALONG THE LIBERALS WEREN'T DOING THAT WELL.<br/>   DAVID: THEY WERE NOT.<br/>   AND SO I THINK HE WILL BE AROUND.<br/>I THINK THIS BUDGET WAS AN ATTEMPT BY THEM, THIS NEW CALM STRATEGY, TALKING ABOUT THE BUDGET TWO WEEKS AHEAD, HE'S MORE -- HE'S DIFFERENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.<br/>YOU HAVE SEEN A CHANGE OF TONE.<br/>HE'S MORE CONFRONTATIONAL LIKE I WAS SAYING AGAINST THE CONSERVATIVES.<br/>SO THEY ARE TRYING A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS.<br/>SO FAR THE NUMBERS AREN'T MOVING.<br/>   DAVID: RIGHT.<br/>   I THINK THEY THINK SOMETHING LIKE MR. POILIEVRE GOING TO VISIT AN ENCAMPMENT AND BEING CAUGHT ON TAPE, YOU KNOW, SAYING ALL THESE THINGS, I WON'T REPEAT THAT WORD, I SAW YOUR FACE, PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID BS.<br/>   DAVID: IT'S A SUPPER-TIME SHOW STILL.<br/>[ LAUGHTER ]<br/>   I THINK THAT TO THEM THEY SEE THIS AS A POSITIVE, BUT YOU CAN'T JUST BANK ON PEOPLE GETTING COLD FEET ABOUT THE OTHER GUY.<br/>I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL ARE ASKING THEMSELVES QUESTIONS.<br/>MAYBE BLUE LIBERALS THINKING I'M TIRED OF TRUDEAU, BUT I JUST CAN'T -- I'M NOT SURE ABOUT POILIEVRE.<br/>BUT THAT'S A BIG, BIG BIT AFTER 9  YEARS, MAYBE 10 IF WE GET TO THE NEXT ONE.<br/>   DAVID: SO, JASON, ON THAT POINT, YOU KNOW, TO TALK ABOUT THIS TRIP TO THE PROTEST CAMP, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST SORT OF CONVOY OR CONVOY-ADJACENT EVENT THAT PIERRE POILIEVRE HAS ATTENDED WILLINGLY.<br/>AND THE LIBERALS I THINK ARE PRETTY CLEARLY HOPING TO DRAG DOWN HIS PHOTOGRAPHS, DRIVE UP HIS NEGATIVES, BECAUSE REHABILITATING JUSTIN TRUDEAU'S POSITIVES IS A DIFFICULT PROPOSITION.<br/>THIS IS WHY THEY ARE USING -- PUTTING THIS FRONT AND CENTRE AND THEIR VIEW, THE ARGUMENT YOU HEAR FROM LIBERALS, THE MORE PEOPLE HEAR THIS STUFF THEY'LL DISLIKE PIERRE POILIEVRE.<br/>HOW DO YOU THINK A MOMENT THIS WEEK COULD POTENTIALLY PLAY IN THE BROADER POLITICAL THING OR IS IT SOMETHING AS THE CONSERVATIVES SAY IS JUST NONSENSE THAT LEGACY MEDIA IS TRYING TO DRUM UP TO SAVE THEIR SUBSIDIES, WHICH I BELIEVE IS WHAT THEY SAID IF THEIR FUNDRAISING PITCH THIS WEEK.<br/>   THAT'S KIND OF THEM.<br/>APPRECIATE THAT.<br/>[ LAUGHTER ]<br/>LOOK, THE LIBERALS ARE GOING TO USE WHAT THEY CAN.<br/>   M'HM.<br/>   I WOULD POINT OUT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY'VE SEIZED ON SOMETHING THAT SOME ASSOCIATION OR SOME MEETING OR SOME ATTENDANCE NEXT TO BE THAT POILIEVRE OR THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE I THINK BACK TO THAT GERMAN FAR RIGHT POLITICIAN THAT SOME OF HIS MPS --<br/>   DAVID: CHRISTINE ANDERSON.<br/>   YES, THAT'S CORRECT.<br/>THAT'S THE ONE.<br/>YOU KNOW, I WOULD NOTE THAT THEY WERE, YOU KNOW -- SINCE THOSE HAVE HAPPENED, POILIEVRE HAS BECOME MORE POPULAR -- AND I'M IN THE -- SAYING THAT'S CAUSATION.<br/>I'M SAYING INSIDE OF ALL THAT.<br/>BUT THEY WILL KEEP TRYING.<br/>THEY HOPE THAT LIKE WITH THEIR BUDGET AND LIKE ALL THESE MEASURES THAT THEY'RE PUTTING OUT, IT'S THE ACCUMULATIONS WILL STACK UP AND CREATE AN IMPRESSION.<br/>HASN'T HAPPENED YET, BUT YOU KNOW, THEY WILL USE THE HOPES THAT THEY CAN.<br/>CONTRAST THAT WITH THE STEADY CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, CHARACTER ATTACKS ON LEADERS SUCCESSIVELY THAT THEY HAVE DONE OVER TIME, GOING BACK TO WHAT PAUL SAID ABOUT THE ATTACKS ON DION EARLY.<br/>WHAT STRIKES ME ABOUT THIS CARNEY THING IS THEY'RE NOT ONLY ATTACKING THE CURRENT LEADER, BUT SOMEBODY WHO HASN'T DECLARED LEADERSHIP FOR A LEADERSHIP RACE THAT DOESN'T EXIST.<br/>THEY ARE VERY DETERMINED TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO USE THEIR AMPLE WAR CHEST TO ATTACK AND -- AND THEIR RHETORIC TO ATTACK ANY POTENTIAL LEADER THEY CAN.<br/>THE TRUDEAU GOVERNMENT NEVER DID THAT.<br/>THE LIBERALS NEVER DID THAT REALLY WITH POILIEVRE.<br/>AND NOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND FROM THE PRIME MINISTER'S MOUTH AS OPPOSED TO FROM CABINET MINISTERS OR SOME TALKING HEAD'S MOUTH, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE WORKED.<br/>ON LEADERSHIP QUESTION, ONE LAST POINT, I KNOW TRUDEAU DOESN'T WANT TO SEEM TO GO AT ALL, BUT WHY -- YOU KNOW, THE QUESTIONS AS TO WHY THE BUDGET HASN'T FOAL.<br/>WHY ALL THESE STEPS THAT PEOPLE HAVE -- HASN'T FOLD -- BEEN IMPRESSED WITH HAVEN'T HAD AN ANSWER.<br/>ARE PEOPLE TIRED OF THE LIBERALS OR ARE PEOPLE TIRED AND DON'T TRUST THE LEADER SPECIFICALLY?<br/>MAYBE, AGAIN, THE ACCUMULATION OF THAT MAY WIND UP PUSHING TRUDEAU TO DO SOMETHING HE HAS NOT WANTED TO DO.<br/>   DAVID: SO, PAUL, WHY TO GO BACK TO THE USING OF THE CONVOY CAMP VISIT THIS WEEK, AND THE POLITICAL ATTACKS THERE AND BRINGING UP ALEX JONES AND THE REFUSAL TO DENOUNCE THAT ENDORSEMENT, YOU KNOW, BY NOTED AMERICAN CONSPIRACY THEORISTS, THERE'S A LOT OF ANALYSIS THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WANTS TO RUN AGAIN TO CEMENT HIS LEGACY OR SAVE HIS LEGACY.<br/>IT ALSO SEEMS CLEAR THEY WANT TO STOP PIERRE POILIEVRE.<br/>THEY FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSE WHAT HE REPRESENTS, YOU KNOW, FROM A VALUE SET.<br/>CAN THIS SORT OF TACTIC OF POINTING TO -- GOING TO EVENTS LIKE THAT, IS THAT A THING THAT CAN WORK?<br/>IS THERE FERTILE GROUND THERE DO YOU THINK?<br/>   THERE SURE IS.<br/>IF NOTHING ELSE TO RALLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN VOTING LIBERAL ANYWAY.<br/>   YES.<br/>   OR ARE ALREADY RELUCTANT TO CONSIDER POILIEVRE.<br/>IN A COMPLEX -- ONE OF THE SUPER SIMPLE GRADE SCHOOL THINGS THAT I KEEP FINDING IT USEFUL TO REMIND PEOPLE IS THAT IF A COMPLEX COUNTRY WITH 340 ODD RIDINGS, MANY EFFECTS CAN COME FROM AN ACT.<br/>SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT POILIEVRE REMINDS CONSERVATIVE LEADING VOTE -- LEANING VOTERS THAT HE'S PLAIN FOLKS WHO LIKES HANGING OUT WITH PLAIN FOLKS.<br/>AT THE SAME TIME AS LIBERALS AND -- PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN VOTING LIBERAL, BUT REALLY DON'T LIKE JUSTIN TRUDEAU WILL SAY, WELL, MY GOD, WHERE'S THE COUNTRY GOING IF THIS GUY GETS IN AND THEY COME HOME?<br/>WHAT'S LEFT OUT IS A CENTRE, BUT IS THE CENTRE IS WHERE MICHAEL IGNATIEFF FOUGHT, SO WHO NEEDS IT, YOU KNOW.<br/>   DAVID: AND THEN THE PUSHBACK IS THIS IS, YOU KNOW -- THIS IS \"THE TORONTO STAR.\"<br/>THIS IS CBC.<br/>THERE IS AN ATTACK ON CTV THAT'S JUST GONE OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA FROM THE CAUSE.<br/>IT'S DENOUNCED THE MEDIA WHO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS AND ATTACK IT.<br/>SO IT PLAYS INTO THE NARRATIVE THAT THE CONSERVATIVES ARE BUILDING, TOO, RIGHT?<br/>THAT IT'S THE ESTABLISHMENT TRYING TO SAVE THIS GUY AND CALLING NORMAL PEOPLE EXTREMISTS, AND IT SEEMS TO BE FUELLING BOTH SIDES OF THIS WHOLE ARGUMENT THIS WEEK.<br/>   BUT TO PAUL'S POINT, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE IN THE QUOTE, UNQUOTE, CENTRE, LARGELY CENTRE, RESONATE WITH THAT, YOU KNOW, MEDIA ARE LYING, THE PRIME MINISTER IS LYING.<br/>I THINK THERE IS A RISK TO THIS STRATEGY BY PIERRE POILIEVRE.<br/>AND, LIKE, THE ENCAMPMENT, FINE, HE WANTS TO GO ENCOURAGE THEM, FINE.<br/>THE DIAGOLON FLAG, IT'S INSIDE THE RV.<br/>IT'S SMALL.<br/>HE MIGHT NOT HAVE SEEN IT.<br/>BUT THEN THE WAY HE TALKS TO THOSE PEOPLE KIND OF LIKE SPEWING THE ANGER AND -- WHICH ALSO, BY THE WAY, CAN BACKFIRE BECAUSE THAT ANGER CAN TURN ON SOMEONE ELSE IF SOMEONE ELSE IS IN GOVERNMENT AND DECEIVES THEIR EXPECTATIONS.<br/>BUT THAT SPEWING THE ANGER, THE WORDS I WON'T REPEAT, THAT IS WHAT'S UNBECOMING OF SOMEONE WANTING TO GOVERN A COUNTRY, AND I THINK THERE IS A RISK THAT THAT TURNS OFF SOME PEOPLE OF THIS BROAD BLUE TENT CONSERVATIVE COALITION THAT MAYBE DON'T LIKE THAT SIDE.<br/>IT'S ONE THING TO TALK TO NORMAL PEOPLE, REGULAR PEOPLE, THE GUY IN HIS RV WHO IS REALLY, REALLY BUMMED ABOUT THE CARBON TAX, THAT'S ONE THING.<br/>IT'S ALL THE OTHER STUFF AROUND IT.<br/>THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO POSE FOR A PICTURE IN FRONT OF THAT \"F\" TRUDEAU FLAG.<br/>THE FACT THAT, YES, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.<br/>   DAVID: IF YOU SAID THAT WE'D HAVE A PROBLEM.<br/>   THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, HE SEEMS TO KNOW THAT IT'S EITHER INAPPROPRIATE OR COULD LOOK BAD FOR HIS OWN POPULAR CAMPAIGN.<br/>THAT'S WHAT LOOKS WEIRD TO ME.<br/>EITHER HE KNOWS IT'S NOT A GREAT IDEA OR -- POLITICALLY OR MORALLY, AND HE'S KIND OF DOING IT HOPING NO ONE FINDS OUT -- I THINK THAT'S ALSO WHERE THE RISK IS.<br/>WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A STRATEGIC COURTING CERTAIN PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN WAY.<br/>   DAVID: WE ALL LEARNED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN THAT ENCAMPMENT PUT IT ON THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA.<br/>IT WAS NOT ON MR. POILIEVRE'S SOCIAL MEDIA, WHICH IS WHERE HE LIKES TO PUT PICTURES OF HIMSELF MEETING WITH NORMAL CANADIAN FOLK.<br/>BUT I WONDER, LIKE -- HE MAY NOT HAVE SEEN THE DIAGOLON SIGN AND ALL THESE THINGS, AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST HE DID.<br/>BUT I FLIP IT AROUND.<br/>IF JUSTIN TRUDEAU PULLED OVER TO A PROTEST GROUP WITH \"F\" PIERRE SIGNS AND JUST DROPPED IN TO SAY HI BECAUSE THEY WERE RUNNING THOSE FLAGS, I IMAGINE THE CRITICISM WOULD BE FIERCE AND INTENSE, YOU KNOW.<br/>I JUST WONDER WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE WAY PEOPLE VIEW IT WHEN IT'S LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION GOING INTO AN \"F\" TRUDEAU ENCAMPMENT?<br/>   WELL, I MEAN, TO BE FAIR, TRUDEAU HAS GONE TO CERTAIN PROTEST CAMPS, INDIGENOUS IN PARTICULAR, THAT DO HAVE SIGNS LIKE \"F\" CANADA, AND WHILE HE DOESN'T APPEAR BESIDE THOSE THINGS, THERE HAS BEEN WAYS IN WHICH TRUDEAU HAS STOPPED AT CERTAIN CAMPS.<br/>I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT POILIEVRE CHOSE TO DO, THOUGH, BY GOING TO THIS CAMP.<br/>THIS WAS AN IMPROMPTU STOP.<br/>IT WAS PROMPTED BY THE FACT HE HEARD IT WAS A CARBON TAX CAMP.<br/>AND SO IT PLAYS REALLY INTO THAT NARRATIVE.<br/>AND I THINK IN MANY WAYS ONCE YOU GET IN THAT CIRCLE, YOU'RE IN THE CIRCLE.<br/>WHATEVER IS IN THERE IS GOING TO BE THERE.<br/>AND THERE IS A VERY BIG DIAGRAM WITH THOSE WHO HATE THE CARBON TAX AND THOSE WHO HATE VACCINATIONS WHO ARE BURN IT ALL DOWN AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT ARE CONSPIRACY THEORY BELIEVERS.<br/>THE FACT WAS HE WAS THERE AND HE ALSO MAYBE PERHAPS HAS A BASE TO BUILD.<br/>I MEAN, THESE ARE LIKELY MAYBE CERTAINLY COMING FROM MANITOBA I CAN TELL FROM YOU FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE THESE MAY BE MAXIME BERNIER SUPPORTERS, PEOPLE'S PARTY SUPPORTERS WHO MAY NEED A SMALL BASE TO GROW THERE -- MAYBE THAT'S THE OPTIMISTIC WAY OF THINKING MAYBE HE THOUGHT HE COULD BUILD SOMETHING THERE.<br/>BUT I'D SAY THE PROBLEM WITH TRUDEAU FRAMING POILIEVRE IN THESE CONSTANT ALEX JONES AND FRAMING HIM WITH CELEBRITIES IN THE UNITED STATES IS SOME OF THOSE ARE VERY MAINSTREAM PEOPLE LIKE JOE ROGAN --<br/>   DAVID: ALEX JONES IS NOT.<br/>   ABSOLUTELY.<br/>BUT I THINK POILIEVRE MAY NOT HAVE SEEN -- KNOWN EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS GETTING INTO WHEN IT WAS COMING TO THIS PROTEST CAMP, BUT CERTAINLY HE DIDN'T LEAVE, WHICH TELLS YOU I THINK A LOT ABOUT HIS VIEW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT BEING A VOTING BASE, BUT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE WHAT MARIE SAID.<br/>THAT ANGER, WHEN YOU STOKE THAT ANGER, THAT ANGER IS UNCONTROLLABLE.<br/>IT'S LIKE A FIRE OUT OF CONTROL, AND IT WILL COME BACK AND HURT YOU.<br/>   DAVID: SO, JASON, JUST A FINAL THOUGHT FROM YOU.<br/>IS THIS JUST WHAT WE'LL ENDURE BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT ELECTION, LITTLE WEDGE TACTICS, YOU KNOW, BIG CULTURE WAR SORT OF ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE CHARACTER AND NATURE OF THE POLITICIANS RATHER THAN SORT OF THE IDEAS AND THE PLANS AND THE POLICIES FOR THE FUTURE?<br/>BECAUSE IT SURE SEEMS THINGS AREN'T MOVING OFF SLOGANS IN A BIGGER WAY IN THE BROADER CONVERSATION.<br/>   THE WORLD WILL TURN.<br/>THERE WILL BE MORE CAR COMPANIES COMING FROM MORE ELECTRIC VEHICLE PLANTS.<br/>THERE WILL BE MORE TAX CREDITS FOR VARIOUS INITIATIVES AND CABINET TOURS AND EVERYTHING.<br/>BUT IT'S HARD TO WALK BACK FROM THE MOMENT WHEN AN OPPOSITION LEADER TELLS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY ANGRY THAT THE PRIME MINISTER LIES ALL THE TIME.<br/>IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT FOR US TO WALK BACK FROM JUSTIN TRUDEAU USING SOME SOCIAL MEDIA THING FROM ALEX JONES WHO JUST TALKED ABOUT PIERRE POILIEVRE TO SAY THIS IS, YOU KNOW -- BECAUSE OF SOMETHING AN AMERICAN PUNDIT SAID, YOU SHOULDN'T VOTE FOR MY OPPOSITION RIVAL.<br/>THOSE ARE VERY HARSH EXTREME THINGS TO WIND UP SAYING, AND, YOU KNOW, THINGS THAT ARE MORE PERSONALITY DRIVEN BY THE LEADERS, NOT BY THEIR -- YOU KNOW, THEIR -- YOU KNOW, THEIR SECONDS, THEIR NUMBER TWOS OR NUMBER THREES.<br/>THIS IS THE LEADERS TALKING.<br/>AND THEY WILL CONTINUE HAVING THIS TRASH TALK RAP BATTLE, AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO GET A WHOLE LOT BETTER UNTIL OCTOBER 2025, WHENEVER IT IS.<br/>   DAVID: I'M NOT TRYING TO CLUTCH MY PEARLS AND WRING MY HANDS ABOUT THIS, BUT THERE IS A DIRECTIONAL THING HAPPENING AT AN ANGRY TIME IN AN ANGRY COUNTRY IN AN ANGRY WEST COAST PANDEMIC WHERE THINGS ARE GOING IN THIS DIRECTION.<br/>DO YOU THINK THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE FOR THE NEXT 18 MONTHS IN TERMS OF THE HIGH-LEVEL CONVERSATION AMONGST THE LEADERS?<br/>   OH, YEAH.<br/>I MEAN, THE LIBERALS HAVE BEEN VERY UPSET FOR TWO YEARS THAT POILIEVRE IS THE VOICE FOR ANGRY CANADIANS, AND THE PRIME MINISTER IS BECOMING A BIT MORE OF A VOICE OF ANGRY -- OF A DIFFERENT COHORT OF ANGRY CANADIANS, AND THE OLD SOCIAL NICETIES.<br/>I MEAN, STEPHEN HARPER'S POLITICS SEEMED REALLY QUITE SURPRISING AND RAW WHEN HE CAME ON THE SCENE.<br/>AND HE NOW SEEMS LIKE A FIGURE OF BARBNESSNESS COMPARED TO -- BASHFULNESS COMPARED TO PIERRE POILIEVRE.<br/>   DAVID: IF ERIN O'TOOLE WAS THE LEADER TRUDEAU MIGHT LEAVE.<br/>BUT I DON'T THINK HE WILL.<br/>GANG, ALWAYS APPRECIATE IT.<br/>HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND.<br/>HAPPY FRIDAY.<br/>JASON MARKUSOFF, NIIGAAN SINCLAIR, MARIE VASTEL AND PAUL WELLS.<br/>   UP NEXT...<br/>   HE'S ALREADY HERE.<br/>DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE'LL BE COMING OUT?<br/>   HE CAME IN THIS WAY AND THEN JUST VIEWED IN.<br/>   HE'LL PROBABLY COME BACK OUT --<br/>   CAN YOU DO ME A FAIR?<br/>   YEAH.<br/>   I'M ON BOARD WITH YOU GUYS, BUT JUST NO PROFANITY.<br/>   DAVID: IN THIS VIDEO THE OFFICER IS HEARD SUPPORTING AND POSSIBLY HELPING THE PROTESTERS.<br/>A FORMER NBC DEPUTY COMMISSIONER HAS -- FORMER RCMP DEPUTY COMMISSIONER IS NEXT WITH HIS TAKE.<br/>    I'M DAVID COCHRANE AND THIS IS THE \"POWER &amp; POLITICS\" PODCAST FOR FRIDAY, APRIL 26TH.<br/>ALBERTA WANTS TO GIVE ITSELF MORE POWER OVER CITIES AND TOWNS.<br/>WE'LL ASK MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS MINISTER RIC MCIVER WHY.<br/>AND THE TRUDEAU GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO SELL ITS ECONOMIC PLAN EVEN THOUGH THE BUDGET HASN'T RESULTED IN THE BOUNCE LIBERALS HOPED FOR.<br/>THE \"POWER PANEL\" DEBATES THE DIRECTION THEY TAKE NEXT.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Here's a look at developments Saturday:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Australian firefighters battling flames approaching Alberta community</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Officials say a fire that prompted the evacuation of Edson, Alta., on Friday is now just 1.5 kilometres south of the town, and local leaders are urging anyone who stayed behind to get out immediately.</p><p>The Alberta government says sustained winds, high temperatures and dry conditions are making firefighting \"extremely dangerous\" in the area.</p><p>An Australian contingent of firefighters worked with Yellowhead County to patrol and set up structure protection throughout the community of Ansell, which is about nine kilometres west of Edson.</p><p>A cold front is forecast to move into the area this evening, but the province says it could bring gusty, sustained winds from the west which could pose challenges on the fire's eastern flank.</p><p>--- </p><p>Rain brings relief as fire threatens northeastern British Columbia town</p><p>Shifting winds and cooling temperatures today are helping firefighters battling the out-of-control wildfire threatening the northeastern British Columbia community of Tumbler Ridge.</p><p>Wildfire B.C. information officer Forrest Tower says the winds that were blowing the intense blaze westward towards the community have shifted and are now moving the fire east and south from town.</p><p>The community's roughly 2,400 residents were ordered to evacuate earlier this week as the fire approached to about five kilometres from Tumbler Ridge.</p><p>Tower says despite the improving conditions, it is still too early to lift the evacuation order.</p><p>---</p><p>Rain coming for Ontario and Quebec</p><p>Environment and Climate Change Canada says there is rain in the forecast this weekend for Ontario and parts of western Quebec.</p><p>Warning Preparedness Meteorologist Gerald Cheng says rain is expected in Ontario beginning late Sunday, and in western Quebec on Sunday night.</p><p>Cheng says Rain will hit northern Quebec, where much of the fire is raging, on Tuesday.</p><p>He says it remains to be seen whether the rain will help firefighters douse the flames in those provinces.</p><p>---</p><p>Smoke still a concern</p><p>Cheng says the fires in Ontario and Quebec have been significant contributors to the smoke that turned skies varying shades of smoggy oranges and yellows in Ontario and parts of the eastern U.S.</p><p>Cheng says while smoke concentrations in the U.S. have let up somewhat, there are still concerns for Canada, particularly for parts of Quebec.</p><p>He says smoke is also due to return to parts of Northeastern Ontario on Monday, and smoky skies could reach into Lake Superior.</p><p>Fire smoke will still choke the skies over Quebec on Monday, particularly around the Chibougamau and Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean regions.</p><p>---</p><p>Next 48 hours are crucial for Quebec fires</p><p>Warm, humid temperatures are expected in Quebec until the rain arrives in western parts of the province later this weekend, and in northern regions on Tuesday.</p><p>Officials say there are more than 130 fires burning in the province and teams have prioritized 37 of them, with 861 firefighters on the ground and 20 water bombers joining in the fight.</p><p>Public Security Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bonnardel says authorities are concerned for Norm\u00e9tal, located 720 kilometres northwest of Montreal in the Abitibi region, where fires are burning nearby. </p><p>Another major fight is taking place in Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, a northern municipality where the province's largest fire is about five kilometres southeast of the community but also within a few kilometres of the Nordic Kraft pulp mill.</p><p>The situation remains stable in Chibougamau,  Mistissini, Chapais and Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou, where numerous teams are deployed.</p><p>Provincial authorities say 13,810 Quebecers have been evacuated due to the wildfire situation.</p><p>---</p><p>Nova Scotia still ablaze</p><p>The largest forest fire in Nova Scotia's history continues to burn out of control in Shelburne County, though officials say the flames are no longer spreading.</p><p>The fire broke out May 27 near Barrington Lake and it has since devoured more than 234 square kilometres of land.</p><p>About 130 firefighters are continuing their battle today to knock it down.</p><p>---</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 10, 2023. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

There has been no substantial rain in the region, and in most cases, there has been no recordable rainfall since the snow melted. Environment and Climate Change Canada\u2019s meteorologist Terri Lang says the Prairies are shifting out of a La Ni\u00f1a pattern,  where colder Pacific Ocean temperatures prolong cold, winter air and bring late-season snow events, into an El Ni\u00f1o pattern which usually means milder and drier winters. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/summer-weather-lookahead-prairies-1.6838672\">https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/summer-weather-lookahead-prairies-1.6838672</url>) While many in the province will celebrate milder winters, the drier part is concerning. Since the extreme heat season of 2021 which dried up many already shrinking ponds and sloughs, surface water levels have not recovered, and drier winters will not help. Many livestock producers are carefully monitoring water sources and will be hoping for rain to sustain pastures and forage crops. Computer models used by ECCC have predicted a 70 to 90 percent chance that portions of northern Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba will record above-normal temperatures through May, June, and July. This is not good news for farmers or firefighters. The fire forecast predicts worsening conditions for the month of June in Manitoba while conditions stay as an extreme risk for much of Saskatchewan and Alberta. (weather.gc.ca) </p><p/><p>This year, unusually hot temperatures have contributed to the increase in wildfires. As temperatures rise, potential fuel sources like leaves, grass, twigs, and downed logs get drier as the moisture evaporates. Dry fuel burns longer and hotter. As of the morning of Sunday, May 21st, there were 27 active fires to contend with, 25 in the province (the other two reflect equipment deployed to Alberta and British Columbia) with seven contained and seven uncontained, one where crews are protecting property and twelve that are undergoing continued assessment according to a release from the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency. Closer to home Wakaw-Hoodoo Fire &amp; Rescue has responded to four grass fires since the snow disappeared and one of those, they attended for three days in a row. The latest fire on Monday, May 15th, was on the east side of the river near the Gabriel Bridge. It was determined that the fire started in the ditch and with winds out of the southwest, it then spread into a nearby yard. Neighbours and firefighters rallied together to stop the fire from continuing to spread north along the riverbank. The family home in the yard was saved.  </p><p>In an article published by CBC News on May 15th, (After early heat, experts say Prairies to face climate challenges in season ahead), Lori Daniels, a professor in the Forest and Conservation Sciences Department at the University of British Columbia, is quoted as saying that while it is common for wildfires to occur between snow melt and the trees coming into full leaf, this year\u2019s quick and severe start to the fire season, with massive areas already burned, reminds her of 2016, the year that brought a disastrous and devastating fire to Fort MacMurray. That fire started amid \u201csimilar conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know the warmer, drier weather is coming.\u201d  </p><p>\u201cWe're moving into a multi-year pattern here where we're at risk for prolonged drought and additional fire,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that at the beginning of this fire season, we already have large, fast-moving fires having such consequence in Alberta is really a warning sign.\u201d  </p><p>According to fire ecologist Bob Gray from Chilliwack, BC, as the global temperature has increased, so have wildfires. Hotter temperatures mean longer fire seasons, drier fuel, hotter fires, and more smoke which therefore means more greenhouse gasses. More greenhouse gases contribute to even hotter temperatures, and the cycle continues. Experts also agree that wildfires are predicted to only get worse, not better, in the coming years. Ellen Whitman, forest fire scientist with Natural Resources Canada, says that in years to come there is likely to be an increase in the frequency of fires and in the total area burned. </p><p>It is hard to comprehend the total area impacted by the wildfires in Saskatchewan this year already and the number of hectares burned is, to many, just that, a number. Based on the data released on Friday, May 19th by the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency, the total number of hectares actively burning was 287,334.3. By converting that number to square miles, it equates to 1,109.4 square miles which is roughly half the size of the greater Toronto area. Put another way, the area covered by active fires in Saskatchewan is more than the combined land area of the cities of Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, and Regina. Already this year Saskatchewan has recorded 180 wildfires, almost double the five-year average of 94. </p><p>On average every year in Canada, wildfires burn an area of about four times the size of Prince Edward Island and is double what it was fifty years ago. Nearly 20 years ago, Mike Flannigan, professor emeritus at the University of Alberta and the BC Innovation Research Chair in Predictive Services, Emergency Management and Fire Science at Thompson Rivers University, conducted research that suggested that Canada would see a doubling of area burned by 2100. However, on May 17th, he shared with a staff reporter for the Toronto Star, \u201cWhat we\u2019ve [had] in British Columbia since 2017, I wasn\u2019t expecting to see until at the earliest the 2030s, probably not [until] the 2040\u2019s.\u201d </p><p>As fires grow more intense and more frequent, the impact on the trees is obviously more devastating, but the composition and quality of the soil also change. In the past, most fires were surface fires that burned the undergrowth and litter on the forest floors, but thick bark mature trees were able to survive. Fires now are more often crown fires according to Lori Daniels. Crown fires spread from the surface to the treetops and \u201cburn all the living tissues and the bugs and the needles that they need to photosynthesize and survive\u2026.\u201d Crown fires kill more trees, consume more of the organic material on and in the ground, and change the nutrients within the soil, which results in a change in the ecological system.  </p><p>One challenge for firefighters is the buildup of \u201cfuels\u201d in certain areas. Downed trees and dead grasses in grasslands and forests are the perfect fuel for wildfires. As the temperature warms, thunderstorms are more frequent and result in more lightning strikes, and the atmosphere gets more efficient at pulling moisture out of trees and grasses leading to the creation of more fuel\u2026the perfect recipe for the type of high-intensity wildfires that spread quickly and are difficult to extinguish\u2026ones that we are becoming all too familiar with. </p><p>Wildfires affect us all either directly through evacuations and property loss, or indirectly through air quality, disruption of services, or destruction of infrastructure. The overwhelming majority of wildfires are the result of human activity. Although Smokey the Bear has been retired as a mascot for forest fire awareness in some parts of Canada after nearly 80 years, his very first message from August of 1944 is still true, \u201cCare will prevent 9 out of 10 fires\u201d.  </p><p>Here are some safety tips to remember to be fire smart: </p><p>*Be aware of weather, drought, and fire risk conditions and avoid any activities that involve fire or sparks when it is hot, dry, and windy. </p><p>*If camping build campfires far away from flammables, use a fire pit if available, and have water ready to extinguish the fire completely before leaving it. This goes for backyard fires as well. Douse the fire with at least one bucket of water, stir the embers, douse with another bucket of water, and stir the embers again to ensure that no burning embers remain. Embers should be cold enough to touch. </p><p>*Keep vehicles off dry grass. Exhaust systems can reach temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius depending on many factors, so it is safest to avoid driving or parking over dry grass. </p><p>*Regularly maintain equipment and vehicles as they can shoot sparks from the exhaust systems. </p><p>*When pulling trailers, check tires, bearings, and axles. Ungreased bearings and axles easily overheat and can catch fire. </p><p>*Obey fire ban orders. Even if you think it is just \u201ca little pile of garbage\u201d or \u201ca little campfire\u201d bans are issued when the risks of fire development are extremely high. </p><p>*If conditions are safe to conduct a small burn of debris on your private land, make sure to do a \u201cmop up\u201d with water once the burn is finished. Wildfires often start from debris piles that were not properly extinguished days or even weeks after they were first burned, as the one wildfire the St. Louis Fire Department was called to on May 4th proved to be. </p><p>Fires can happen at any time, the best way to be ready is to prepare as if you expect it to happen.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-317ed6b88e614670a82d44ecd30e1892</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68BJ-SP01-DY9S-T23R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1480\"/><timeReceived>01:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 29, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Now the dean of Lakeland College emergency training centre in Vermilion, Alta., McKerry previously helped battle some of Alberta\u2019s most ferocious and historic wildfires.</p><p>That included the 2011 Slave Lake wildfire that destroyed more than 400 buildings and the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire that forced nearly 90,000 people to flee Canada\u2019s oilsands region and reduced thousands of homes to ash.</p><p>After a gruelling day on the fire lines, he said most firefighters are completely exhausted and camp is their refuge.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to keep them motivated, high morale and keep them working, you\u2019ve got to try to be able to support them where (you) can,\u201d he said in an interview.</p><p>\u201cCamps aren\u2019t the most ideal experience, (but) fortunately, you\u2019ve got a lot of motivated people who want to go out and help, that are willing to sacrifice some of those comforts \u2014 or almost all of those comforts \u2014 to get out there and assist in the effort.\u201d</p><p>Those efforts continue to be tested as crews across Canada battle the worst season on record. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre has reported more than 131,000 square kilometres of land and forest have been scorched across the country.</p><p>B.C. is experiencing its most destructive season on record for area burned with more than 15,000 square kilometres charred, surpassing the previous record of 13,543 square kilometres set in 2018.</p><p>In a social media post last month, the BC Wildfire Service highlighted the contracted staffers it said play \u201ccritical\u201d roles in the provincial fire fight.</p><p>Such jobs include heavy equipment operators, First Nations crew members, first aid attendants and medics, camp and facility managers, kitchen staff, danger tree assessors, fallers, food service staff, forest industry experts, contract firefighters, pilots and air support staff, as well as various other trades, the service said.</p><p>Provincial fire information officer Mike McCulley said such workers are often easily overlooked by those outside the service.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really complex organization and there are many moving pieces to the puzzle,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI think folks just think that it\u2019s just firefighters on the ground fighting fire and that\u2019s so far from the truth.\u201d</p><p>McKerry said, after a day in the field, most firefighters needs are simple.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get back to camp, the best luxury you can have is clean washrooms and access to food,\u201d he said.</p><p>At the Takla camp, Callihoo said most firefighters sleep in tents, but working showers, washrooms and a workable kitchen equipped with a dining area are set up on site.</p><p>Food quantities are determined based on the number of firefighters on scene, with groceries delivered once a week, she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a juggling process because you want to make sure you have enough food for everybody,\u201d Callihoo said.</p><p>Excess is much better than not having enough, and any unused food will be sent to another camp, she said, noting that numbers at the camp change quickly as the service often rearranges how many firefighters are at each site based on needs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a day-by-day operation here,\u201d Callihoo said.</p><p>She added that most of the problematic fires are burning elsewhere in the province.</p><p>\u201cFires here, to my understanding, are a little bit more controlled, but they don\u2019t want to leave them. With warmer weather coming up, it may cause sparks so we\u2019re going to leave a team here until we start seeing what\u2019s going to go on.\u201d</p><p>McKerry said such camps are often only used when fires are burning in rural locations and it is not possible for staff to stay at hotels.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about accessibility,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom an emergency management perspective, if you have access to hotels, that\u2019s a godsend because then you\u2019re not relying on those other pieces of infrastructure.\u201d</p><p>But when camping is necessary, firefighters always recognize the value of staffers like Callihoo, he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the things you may not necessarily think about, but it\u2019s beautiful to have those people there that just come in and ultimately make everybody else\u2019s life a little bit more easy and comfortable.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20230810PRAA0003787535</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68X6-JMV1-F0HF-82K9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"859\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.
