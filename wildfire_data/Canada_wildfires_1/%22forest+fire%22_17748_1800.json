In addition to having a good evacuation plan, it would help to build a group of volunteer forest firefighters and first aid attendants, with machines, tools and resources strategically placed and stored in preparation for small site fires or a wildfire to sweep through the area. As many physically able people as possible, 18 and over, could or should take a Yukon-certified forest firefighting course, as well as an introductory first aid course. They are worthy investments to replace not knowing what to do \u2014 and fear and panic \u2014 with education, training, knowledge, capability and the confidence to help if needed. </p><p>Yukon University and Grade 12 classes could offer students a forest firefighting and first aid course to train the present and future generations of the Yukon. There wouldn\u2019t need to be an urgent need to request other territory, provincial, armed forces or international firefighters to help if many locals trained as firefighters and supporting services. Locals would be able to respond much sooner, preventing the fire from spreading. Each residential area could have a coordinated network of trained and equipped neighbourhood volunteer firefighters, able to respond if a fire needs to be fought. Neighbourhood fireproof sheds could be established at strategic places to hold tools and supplies like axes, pulaskis, water spray cans, water pumps, hoses, nozzles, chainsaws, oxygen tanks, drinking water and safety and first aid equipment. Residents can also safeguard their properties independently. To help fight potential fires, water reservoirs on towers or at ground level at higher elevations, with gravity pressure power and supporting generator pumps to feed water hoses, could be placed on the edges of residential areas and rural homes. Independent water wells with pumping stations and water hydrants could be dug around the perimeter of each residential area in case the community water supply is cut off. Extra water trucks or unused logging skidders with water tanks attached to them could be purchased and stored. As mentioned in the previous news story, forest fire breaks, also known as fire guards, could be cut bordering each residential area. The fire guards do not need to be seen as an eye sore or sad thing to do, as it is like building a shield, a safety fence around your community, intending to prevent the oncoming forest fires from burning homes down. Instead of burning fire guards, timber could be cut, harvested and processed as a resource and financial benefit. The harvestable wood could be many things:years of household firewood, thousands of feet of fence poles and posts, custom wood furniture and other building projects and proper boards \u2014 if large enough. The smaller material can be chipped and turned into wood pellets for pellet stoves to warm homes. The size of the fire guards need not be intimidating, with the amount of work to be done and people with machines needed to accomplish it. As devastating as they have been to the forests of British Columbia, there are hundreds of feller buncher machines, skidders and logging trucks that are looking for work and could be employed to do the job. There is no time to waste. Each summer is getting hotter and longer, with the forest drying out more and more. What is happening to other towns and cities in Canada can happen to Whitehorse and the Yukon. Along with cutting fire guards and preparing to protect our communities, evacuation plans are also very important, as is preparing in advance with extra supplies, should one have to travel somewhere else to survive while they wait for the fire to pass or go out. Where will 30,000-plus people go and stay for three, seven, 14 or more days? Evacuation plans are needed for hospital patients, care homes, the Whitehorse Correction Centre and those with medical needs. Planes may be able to fly some out, and school buses may be needed to transport those who do not own vehicles. A plan would also be needed if the highway was cut off, preventing food, medicines and other goods from getting to the Yukon. The potential economic impact of providing jobs to B.C. and Yukon workers while cutting the fire guard may encourage some B.C. towns to host those needing a destination during an evacuation. Good communication updates are needed, utilizing all the different channels:TV, radio and social media, especially the many Whitehorse and Yukon Facebook community pages. People will want to know when and where to go, how they survive being away and when they can go home. Let\u2019s hope they won\u2019t have to leave home and be grateful for all of the recent rain showers effectively saturating the soil and watering trees so they are less of a fire risk next summer. Remember, though, one can always hope and pray that the area does not burn, yet the risk remains and investing in some evacuation preparation, as well as training and helping to protect the area so an evacuation may not be needed, is a good idea for the community\u2019s future.

I was elected three years ago as a trustee. In those three years we researched how to manage and have a business plan. We put that to the community in a referendum. 75 per cent voted in favour of our plan. We then chose an architect, contractor and owners'representative. We have begun tendering contracts and equipment will be visible later this month. Concrete will be poured this summer and steel will be up in the fall.</p><p>What is the biggest challenge facing the district, and how do you plan to face it? Resiliency. The job of a trustee is to ensure our training, staffing and equipment to respond is adequate and remains within budget. About 60 per cent of our calls are rescue medical and/or assistance. Our firefighters are trained first responders Level III (highest level). Some also have Emergency Medical Responder (EMR) training. Firefighters are called out at the same time as BC Ambulance. With two BC Ambulances on island one may be doing a patient transfer and the other may be busy. Often it is a fully qualified firefighter who is there first. It was the fire department working with BC Hydro that cleared trees off roads in the windstorm of 2015. It was firefighters who helped with rehabbing of Fulford Ganges road during the atmospheric river. Firefighters are our emergency response.</p><p>At the end of a future term as trustee, what accomplishment would you hope to look back upon as a success? Completing the Firehall is Job #1. Bringing it in on time and on budget. Having fully trained firefighters with the equipment to respond.</p><p>Jenny McClean What do you bring to the table, and how has that motivated you to run for a trustee position ? I am familiar with local politics, and I know a lot of people. I am interested in forest fire mitigation from an ecological lens. I am a good communicator and reach a lot of people in my daily travels. I hope to be able to use my communication skills to speak with people about the goals of the fire board and to bridge any communication gaps as things roll out for the new fire hall. I am interested in the Fire Smart program and other public service educational programs run by the fire department. I know the community of school aged parents well and would like to be a part of community outreach. I am a mother and I feel it is a good to have a mix of women and men serving on the fire board. It is also a good idea to have new people at the table.</p><p>What is the biggest challenge facing the district, and how do you plan to face it? I think the biggest challenge facing the district is how to build a new fire hall that has the least impact on the neighbourhood in terms of noise and also drainage issues. To house a new fire hall is significant for the residential community and I see that to be well accepted it should have the most ability to merge with the surrounding area and also keeping with the residential character of the neighbourhood in a way that is acceptable to those living close by.</p><p>At the end of a future term as trustee, what accomplishment would you hope to look back upon as a success? I would feel very successful to have been able to learn from the fire board in terms of how they serve the community of Salt Spring. There is a lotto learn and the fire board does a good job and I would like to learn from them.</p><p>Dennis Lucarelli The candidate chose to respond to all questions with a single statement.</p><p>For eight years I was Director for Transition Salt Spring, including three as Secretary and two as President. I also served two years as the founding Secretary for Stqeeye'Learning Society. I'm running for Trustee as I value and respect our Fire/Rescue employees and volunteers for all that they have achieved.</p><p>After earning my law degree (California Berkeley, 1977) I spent a decade abroad including five years in Tokyo, where I worked on maritime finance contacts, patent/trademark agreements, and real estate partnerships. In 1999 I earned my PMP certification (Project Management Professional) and taught workshops for the next 18 years, to project managers at an electric utility, various government offices (including one whose staff who referred to their workplace as \"the Agency\"), and at a micro-chip maker's corporate campuses across North America, Europe, and Asia.</p><p>If elected I will join the push for completing the new Fire Hall on-time and under budget, which I hope is a prelude to upgrading both the south end Fire/Rescue Training Facility (it needs earthquake-proofing and other upgrades) and the Central fire hall which, if north-islanders agree, could feasibly be moved further north, closer to more homes for faster emergency response.</p><p>My primary aim would be that the Trustees, firefighters, emergency personnel and volunteers alike, will continue to enjoy the trust and respect that I share with so very many Islanders. If we're also able to accomplish future safety and structural upgrades, so much the better.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUDFWD-news20240410PGWA0004308804</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUDFWD2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BSC-36F1-F0HF-800B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484148</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

It forced more than 230,000 people from their homes \u2014 including the entire city of Yellowknife \u2014 and created unprecedented smoke conditions across much of the country and into the United States.</p><p>Eight firefighters died battling the blazes and Canada expects to spend more than $750 million in disaster assistance alone. That does not include the billions of dollars spent fighting the fires in the first place.</p><p>A briefing document forecasting the fire risk for this spring shows conditions are already ripe for an early and above-normal fire risk from Quebec all the way to British Columbia in both April and May.</p><p>The forecast is based on having had a warmer-than-normal winter with minimal snow and widespread drought, particularly in the Prairies. There is also a high probability for above-normal temperatures in April, May and June. Western Canada, eastern Ontario and western Quebec are currently facing the highest risk.</p><p>The briefing includes a caveat that forecasting precipitation levels is not very reliable so the warnings are based on current conditions, and could change if more rain falls this spring than is currently expected.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre lists 65 fires already burning, mainly in B.C., Alberta and the Northwest Territories. More than half are fires that started in 2023, smouldered underground throughout the winter and have since re-emerged. Most of the fires currently burning are under control.</p><p>Human activity is typically the main fire risk factor in the spring, said Michael Norton, the director general of the Northern Forestry Centre at Natural Resources Canada.</p><p>Preventing fires from starting in the first place is critical, and in the spring most fires are human-caused, including through careless burning, campfires, fireworks, and the heat from off-road vehicles igniting grass or other debris on the ground. </p><p>Lightning becomes a primary source of wildfires during the summer, once thunderstorms become more common.</p><p>About 70 per cent of the fires between January and May 2023 were started by humans, compared with fewer than 20 per cent of the fires that started in June, July and August.</p><p>The low level of snow in most of Canada is among the key reasons for the higher risks this spring. British Columbia\u2019s snowpack for April is at a record low 67 per cent, said Jonathan Boyd, a hydrologist with the BC River Forecast Centre. </p><p>\"Typically speaking, drought and wildfire go hand in hand, so it's not setting up to be a great season,\" Boyd said.</p><p>\"But it still just depends on what the weather conditions are. If we have last year's spring weather conditions this year, it will be worse.\"</p><p>Sajjan said Canada and the provinces and territories have been working for months to prepare for a bad fire season this year and will be ready.</p><p>That includes more equipment and more trained firefighters, said Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson.

So, a one can see I'm the last person on the earth qualified to comment on fire fighting techniques. The crap it is done! Anyway, in my day, firefighting was an adventure. We were young, poorly paid, and really didn't care. As we dragged the canvas hoses through the trees and muskeg.

Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark proposed a series of regulations along with a bill that would allow for more housing to be built beyond urban boundaries and in rural areas. But farmers expressed concerns about a proposed move to allow up to three new lots on parcels of farmland, saying it would hamper growth of livestock farming, fragment the agricultural land base, and risk inflating farmland prices, shutting out prospective new farmers. More than a dozen groups including the National Farmers Union - Ontario, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, the Beef Farmers of Ontario and the Dairy Farmers of Ontario issued a joint letter urging the government to abandon the proposal. Clark has now told farmers in a letter that he has heard their concerns, and the government will not be moving forward on the lot severance proposal. The government originally suggested the severances as a way to support multi-generational farm families, but Clark says he is now extending the public comment period for the other regulations.<br/><br/> Fire forces <br/><br/> highway closure<br/><br/> Ontario Provincial Police closed a highway between the northern communities of White River and Hornepayne due to a forest fire causing \"extremely dangerous conditions\" in the area. Police posted photos online showing heavy black smoke alongside Highway 631. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry says there was a wildfire burning 5.5 kilometres west of White River that was not under control. It said there was another forest fire burning north of Highway 17, in the Kakakiwibik Esker Conservation Reserve, that was not under control.<br/><br/> News Services <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2023053168038512</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68C0-TM01-F197-526T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"447\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 31, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002A6V</classCode><className>ESKER SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NATIONAL FARMERS UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC7371 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>ALESK (PAR)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000A0RH</classCode><className>CATHOLICS &amp;

Board trustees voted 6-4 against a motion to fly the flag during a meeting Monday night that was attended by advocates, protesters and spectators. The motion put forward by the board's Gender, Sexuality and Catholic Education Committee asked for the Progress Pride flag to be flown outside the board's Catholic Education Centre in June to mark Pride Month. Several trustees spoke against the motion while others supported it during the meeting. Trustee Michaela Barbieri said she was against the motion because it didn't do much to address the struggles and challenges LGBTQ youth face in Catholic schools. Trustee Jennifer Wigston, who supported the motion, said flying the Pride flag would promote a safe and welcoming environment.</p><p><br/><br/> Farmland plan is abandoned<br/><br/>Ontario has backed off a housing proposal that farmers say would have had a \"catastrophic\" impact on farmland and livestock operations. Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark proposed a series of regulations along with a bill that would allow for more housing to be built beyond urban boundaries and in rural areas. But farmers expressed concerns about a proposed move to allow up to three new lots on parcels of farmland, saying it would hamper growth of livestock farming, fragment the agricultural land base, and risk inflating farmland prices, shutting out prospective new farmers. More than a dozen groups including the National Farmers Union - Ontario, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, the Beef Farmers of Ontario and the Dairy Farmers of Ontario issued a joint letter urging the government to abandon the proposal. Clark has now told farmers in a letter that he has heard their concerns, and the government will not be moving forward on the lot severance proposal. The government originally suggested the severances as a way to support multi-generational farm families, but Clark says he is now extending the public comment period for the other regulations.<br/><br/> Fire forces <br/><br/> highway closure<br/><br/> Ontario Provincial Police closed a highway between the northern communities of White River and Hornepayne due to a forest fire causing \"extremely dangerous conditions\" in the area.

Board trustees voted 6-4 against a motion to fly the flag during a meeting Monday night that was attended by advocates, protesters and spectators. The motion put forward by the board's Gender, Sexuality and Catholic Education Committee asked for the Progress Pride flag to be flown outside the board's Catholic Education Centre in June to mark Pride Month. Several trustees spoke against the motion while others supported it during the meeting.

Trustee Jennifer Wigston, who supported the motion, said flying the Pride flag would promote a safe and welcoming environment.</p><p>Farmland plan is abandoned</p><p>Ontario has backed off a housing proposal that farmers say would have had a \"catastrophic\" impact on farmland and livestock operations. Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark proposed a series of regulations along with a bill that would allow for more housing to be built beyond urban boundaries and in rural areas. But farmers expressed concerns about a proposed move to allow up to three new lots on parcels of farmland, saying it would hamper growth of livestock farming, fragment the agricultural land base, and risk inflating farmland prices, shutting out prospective new farmers. More than a dozen groups including the National Farmers Union - Ontario, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, the Beef Farmers of Ontario and the Dairy Farmers of Ontario issued a joint letter urging the government to abandon the proposal. Clark has now told farmers in a letter that he has heard their concerns, and the government will not be moving forward on the lot severance proposal. The government originally suggested the severances as a way to support multi-generational farm families, but Clark says he is now extending the public comment period for the other regulations.</p><p>Fire forces</p><p>highway closure</p><p>Ontario Provincial Police closed a highway between the northern communities of White River and Hornepayne due to a forest fire causing \"extremely dangerous conditions\" in the area.

The motion put forward by the board's Gender, Sexuality and Catholic Education Committee asked for the Progress Pride flag to be flown outside the board's Catholic Education Centre in June to mark Pride Month. Several trustees spoke against the motion while others supported it during the meeting. Trustee Michaela Barbieri said she was against the motion because it didn't do much to address the struggles and challenges LGBTQ youth face in Catholic schools. Trustee Jennifer Wigston, who supported the motion, said flying the Pride flag would promote a safe and welcoming environment.</p><p>Farmland plan is abandoned</p><p>Ontario has backed off a housing proposal that farmers say would have had a \"catastrophic\" impact on farmland and livestock operations. Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark proposed a series of regulations along with a bill that would allow for more housing to be built beyond urban boundaries and in rural areas. But farmers expressed concerns about a proposed move to allow up to three new lots on parcels of farmland, saying it would hamper growth of livestock farming, fragment the agricultural land base, and risk inflating farmland prices, shutting out prospective new farmers. More than a dozen groups including the National Farmers Union - Ontario, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, the Beef Farmers of Ontario and the Dairy Farmers of Ontario issued a joint letter urging the government to abandon the proposal. Clark has now told farmers in a letter that he has heard their concerns, and the government will not be moving forward on the lot severance proposal. The government originally suggested the severances as a way to support multi-generational farm families, but Clark says he is now extending the public comment period for the other regulations.</p><p>Fire forces</p><p>highway closure</p><p>Ontario Provincial Police closed a highway between the northern communities of White River and Hornepayne due to a forest fire causing \"extremely dangerous conditions\" in the area.

So, a one can see I'm the last person on the earth qualified to comment on fire fighting techniques. The crap it is done! Anyway, in my day, firefighting was an adventure. We were young, poorly paid, and really didn't care. As we dragged the canvas hoses through the trees and muskeg. Fired up the Wajax pumps - it was 'fun' and since most of the fires moved slowly, we were in little danger. We slept in the hay barn at night, eating our meals from cans and had a great time.

He was speaking of the September 2022 stabbing spree carried out by Myles Sanderson that resulted in 11 people being killed and 17 injured at James Smith Cree Nation and in the nearby village of Weldon. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201c(We were) not knowing the full picture of a larger attack in the community in many places and towards many people, so an emergency alert app could have given the membership heads up that morning,\u201d said Head. </p><p>Peter Chapman is one of the three bands that comprises the James Smith Cree Nation. The Nation also includes the Chakastaypasin Band and the James Smith Cree Nation. </p><p>The app, a joint effort of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) and TryCycle Data Systems, was announced this morning, barely two weeks after the conclusion of the coroner\u2019s inquest into the September tragedy. </p><p>One of the 15 recommendations that came from the inquest was for the federal public safety minister to establish a national alerting system in consultation with law enforcement on a platform where the public can sign up to receive the broadcast of immediate alerts. </p><p>FirstAlerts is a new feature in the Talking Stick app and is a free download in the App Stores, also co-created by the partners. </p><p>Head says that although the RCMP did issue an alert Sept. 4, 2022, \u201cit was hours into the attacks that day.\u201d </p><p>Had James Cree Smith Nation had its own emergency alert, the warnings could have been timely and included the local names for the areas of the reserve that members had to be aware of, says Head. </p><p>\u201cWe know our community. There's all kinds of different areas that have nicknames. If we can just have our own system in place then we can style the message where it will be most meaningful and powerful for our membership,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve listened to the voices of First Nation leaders, echoing the urgent need for effective ways to communicate with their membership during a crisis. With the introduction of FirstAlerts in the Talking Stick app, we are putting the control of the messaging directly into the hands of Indigenous communities,\u201d said John MacBeth, CEO of TryCycle Data Systems. </p><p>FirstAlerts will be employed in three situations: missing persons, natural disasters and public safety. </p><p>Head points out that a 911 call for a missing person results in a 24-hour wait. The local FirstAlerts can be issued right away. </p><p>As for natural disasters, Head notes that grass fires and bush fires can break out quickly. </p><p>\u201cIf there's a windy day and there's a fire that gets out of control and it's moving towards households in the community, the First Nation can get on this app and issue a warning to all the people (that there\u2019s a) forest fire approaching from the west. \u2018Everyone be on guard\u2019 and that kind of thing,\u201d said Head. </p><p>Placing the alerts on the app will be the responsibility of each First Nation\u2019s emergency management services. Alerts will be verified before they are issued. </p><p>\u201cIt'll be a process for every First Nation to set up how the app will be initialized and used,\u201d said Head. </p><p>Head and MacBeth expect other Saskatchewan First Nations will come on board in using the app. Head notes that interest has already been expressed by a couple.There are 74 nations represented by the FSIN. </p><p>The Talking Stick app was created to allow anonymous communication with trained Indigenous peer advocates who are ready to listen judgment-free and provide compassionate support. It\u2019s only available in Saskatchewan. Launched in 2022, it has reached more than 22,000 Indigenous people. </p><p>Ottawa-based TryCycle Data Systems was established in 2017 to empower at-risk communities and vulnerable populations with accessible digital solutions. </p><p>Windspeaker.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-2603f8bc8dc4407fb3b0d4780080466c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BBN-8XW1-DY9S-T1K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><timeReceived>07:22 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 15, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I watched every special and flick I could find. When I finally got my library card at age eight, I was checking out books by the bagloads, learning about all things prehistoric.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When you\u2019re a dinosaur kid, you become very familiar with mass extinctions, which are frightfully common in the Earth\u2019s geological history.</p><p>In summary:Some change in global conditions, either a massive release of carbon dioxide and methane (and oxygen in one case) into the atmosphere, continental drift, one or more invasive species, or, on rare occasions a foreign body like a meteor or major geological disaster causes local circumstances in an ecosystem to change enough so whatever is living in that ecosystem can\u2019t sustain itself anymore.</p><p>Usually the creatures that have the hardest time are the ones which take the longest to breed the next generation, which in our current time, includes the human race.</p><p>The last mass extinction before the industrial revolution was the loss of the megafauna \u2014 mammoths, woolly rhinoceros, and short faced bears in our neck of the woods, which evidence suggests, was caused by the spread of humans across the planet, who slashed and burned heavy foliage along the way to building their homes.</p><p>I bring this up as we are entering another week of Inuvik being encased in a cloud of smog from a nearby forest fire which, at least as of this writing, is not poised to burn the town to a crisp.</p><p>Regardless, I strongly recommend you wear an N95 mask when you go outside, as forest fire smoke is very different from smoking tobacco or cannabis.</p><p>This is ash and soot, the charred remains of tree bark and furry little animals. You really don\u2019t want to breathe that in.</p><p>But, unfortunately, we collectively made our choice, de-ciding that enriching a select few of us was more important than ensuring the long-term viability of civilization.</p><p>Now, we\u2019re clearly in the \u201cfind out\u201d phase.</p><p>As it turns out, climate change isn\u2019t just no more glaciers.</p><p>It\u2019s also runaway inflation as climate disasters and crop failures disrupt supply chains. Of course, any comment on inflation needs to point out costs of goods have been artificially kept low for decades by globalization, where we used gigantic greenhouse gas emitting transport vessels to move goods from economies with low valued currency to our privileged shores.</p><p>Not only did this create widespread inequality across the Earth, it also accelerated climate change.</p><p>If you think things are bad now, just wait until there\u2019s droughts across the Midwest of the United States, also known as the breadbasket of North America.</p><p>Inflation will seem like a minor problem when there is no food available. Here in the North we\u2019re slightly insulated against food shortages thanks to the hunting and on the land culture which still exists up here \u2014 so long as the land cooperates. But as reported a few weeks ago in the Inuvik Drum, living on the land is likely going to look extremely different in 2050 than it does today.</p><p>Another aspect of climate change people need to realize is that as reality sets in and areas become simply too hot for human habitation, those humans are going to move to places they can survive, meaning heading towards the poles.</p><p>This will put massive pressure on our own supply chains and infrastructure, assuming the people who migrate here in desperation come to the region peacefully.</p><p>We\u2019re already at the point where floods and heat are killing people.</p><p>It just gets worse from here. We need to start taking climate change seriously.</p><p>Now.</p><p>Eric Bowling is a Black Press reporter writing for the Inuvik Drum in the Northwest Territories.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHLPRO-news20230804PPUA0003775523</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHLPRO2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VX-PW41-F0HF-846S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"605\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

As one of Brazil's top wildfire defense companies, Equilibrio aims to bring Mighty Fire Breaker's revolutionary fire inhibiting chemistry to wildfire defense across Brazil.</p><p>MFB-31-CitroTech is the only EPA fire retardant certified as a Safer Choice Product. This certification allows international and U.S. companies to streamline their vetting processes, and provides confidence for those who want more than the status quo.</p><p>Brazil has experienced unprecedented wildfires over the past decade. Equilibrio Director Alberto Jorge Laranjeiro said, \"Mighty Fire Breaker's product shows enormous promise to help us achieve our mission of protecting lives, homes, and wildlife.\"</p><p>Mighty Fire Breaker Advisory Board Member Dan Reese developed the Brazilian connection for this innovative wildfire defense solution, now expanding the products reach globally. As a past Deputy Chief of CAL FIRE's Tactical Air Operations program, Reese is an authority in wildland fire chemicals, and is sharing this knowledge with U.S., Canadian, and international groups. Reese makes it easy for companies to understand how CitroTech is an absolute game changer in the wildfire defense arena.</p><p>\"As countries experience extreme wildfire, the fear and concern is palpable. A safe, green, sustainable solution like MFB's CitroTech is an exciting, science based technology that can offer piece of mind to government agencies and the public.\" said Reese.</p><p>For more information, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mightyfirebreaker.com\">www.mightyfirebreaker.com</url></p><p>For technical product information: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Info@mightyfirebreaker.com\">Info@mightyfirebreaker.com</email></p><p>Contact Information</p><p>Twitter@GEVIOfficial</p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://generalenterpriseventures.com\">https://generalenterpriseventures.com</url>/</p><p>Information about Forward-Looking Statements</p><p>This document contains \"forward-looking statements\", which includes statements regarding expected financial performance and growth information relating to future events.

The situation is so dire that the Alberta government is already asking key industries to cut back on their water allowances.<br/><br/> The threat of wildfires, the evil twin of drought, is also looming. So much so that the official forest fire season was moved up to the middle of February. That's because in the middle of winter, Alberta wildland firefighters are already battling 57 fires across the province.</p><p><br/><br/> \"We had over 60 wildfires that were carry-over wildfires from the 2023 season (the worst on record), which is incredibly high compared to what we typically see,\" explained Alberta Wildfire information officer Melissa Story.<br/><br/> But despite the action and millions being spent to mitigate these anticipated disasters, the words \"climate change\" never cross the lips of United Conservative Party (UCP) government officials and don't appear in any of its media releases. And perhaps even more alarming, many of the news articles detailing government action to combat drought and wildfires in Alberta don't mention climate change either.<br/><br/> Instead, the warming effect of the El Nino weather system is cited as the cause. But as the scientists, who study this know, it's the combination of climate change and El Nino that is causing such hot, dry weather and the resultant drought and forest fires. Even without El Nino it was clear that global warming was already underway.<br/><br/> Either government officials don't believe climate change is happening at a quicker rate than originally anticipated or they want to cover up the connection between the high carbon emissions spewed by the fossil fuel industry in Alberta and dangerous global warming. Never mind that the link has been proven again and again.<br/><br/> It's a different story across the border in B.C. That province has also been dealing with the impacts of climate change; record-breaking wildfires, some of which have encroached on cities such as fast-growing Kelowna; floods that have caused havoc for farmers, homeowners and the province's highway system; and severe drought.<br/><br/> But NDP Premier David Eby is not in denial about what has caused these disasters even though oil and natural gas extraction and LNG projects are all important to B.C.'s economy.<br/><br/> \"British Columbia will be strong on climate, even if we're the only province in Canada standing strong on climate, because in British Columbia, we don't see another choice. Anyone who tells you that there's another choice is lying to you as a politician,\" he recently told the biennial Globe Forum which draws business leaders, policymakers and non-government organizations from far and wide to discuss sustainability issues.<br/><br/> So does that mean Alberta's UCP government is ignoring climate change because it would rather encourage the oil industry to keep pumping out oil no matter the consequences? <br/><br/> Or is it simply ideological; resistance to any attempts to control the market economy.<br/><br/> Likely both factors are at play, just like in Louisiana where the petroleum industry also has a strong foothold. Parts of that state are rapidly sinking due to rising sea levels brought about by climate change. But the governor seems oblivious to it all.<br/><br/> Instead, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry is considering eliminating the state's climate change task force in favour of creating a better \"business climate,\" which means pumping and refining as much oil as possible.<br/><br/> And just like Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who automatically opposes any regulations the federal government introduces to cut carbon emissions, Landry is fighting U.S. President Joe Biden's plans to transition away from fossil fuels.<br/><br/> It would be so much more helpful for Albertans who will have to deal with ravaged farm lands, water shortages and wildfires if their government would simply face reality and stop pretending that these are just temporary inconveniences. They aren't.<br/><br/> The sooner the government climate deniers admit that, the sooner we can take action to possibly avoid the worst of what is to come.<br/><br/> Gillian Steward is a Calgary writer and journalist, and former managing editor of the Calgary Herald.

That exceeds the previous record set in 1989 of 75,596 square kilometres, according to the National Forestry Database.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said he wasn't \"looking to break any records\" but acknowledged it was likely coming. \"Unfortunately the fire season this year started earlier and has been more widespread across the country than in recent memory,\" he said.</p><p>It took less than six months to surpass the previous record for an entire year. And in 1989, more than 11,000 different fires combined to create the total, with an average size of about seven square kilometres. This year, there have been less than 3,000 fires so far, but they have averaged about 26 square kilometres in size.</p><p>Currently there are 490 fires burning nationally, with 255 of them considered to be out of control.</p><p>In Quebec, where nearly a quarter of the fires are burning, heavy smoke grounded water bombers in the province's north Monday and caused widespread smog warnings farther south.</p><p>Nicolas Vigneault, a spokesman for the province's forest fire prevention agency, said the smoke had reduced visibility, making it impossible for some water bombers and helicopters to take off.</p><p>\"We do as (many) operations as we can in the field with the firefighters, and in the air with the planes and helicopters,\" he said. \"But our priority is the security of everybody, and the smoke is a challenge right now, and it's been a challenge over the last two or three days.\"</p><p>However, he said heavy rain and some wind is expected in the most affected parts of the province in the coming days, which should allow operations to resume \"almost normally.\"</p><p>While no towns are under immediate risk of burning, the fires have forced thousands of Quebecers from their homes. That includes the 2,000 residents of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, parts of Val-d'Or and Senneterre and some Indigenous communities.</p><p>In a Monday afternoon update, the fire prevention agency said the fire burning near Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon remained out of control, and had grown to more than 4,400 square kilometres.</p><p>\"Again yesterday, the lack of visibility for our aircraft had an impact on fire suppression operations\" at the Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon fire, the agency wrote on its Facebook page. \"We did some tests, but no plane or helicopter could complete a mission due to the dense smoke.\"</p><p>It said \"significant\" rain was expected in the northwest of the province beginning late Monday or Tuesday, but strong winds ahead of the wet weather could make fire conditions challenging.</p><p>The Cree Nation of Mistissini announced late Sunday that it was asking all remaining community members to evacuate the area due to a fire threatening nearby Highway 167.</p><p>\"The dryness index is 100, the highest that can be recorded, and the intensity of the fire is really high,\" read one of a series of posts on the community's Facebook page.</p><p>Authorities noted that the forest fire agency was unable to get images of the fire due to low visibility, which made it hard to track its progress. A plan was in the works to protect the community by widening firebreaks, bringing in water tankers to combat spot fires and putting sprinklers at the entrance to the community.</p><p>Meanwhile, heavy smoke forced the Cree community of Waswanipi to announce plans to evacuate another 50 residents, including seniors, pregnant women and infants under one year old.</p><p>In a video update late Sunday, Chief Irene Neeposh asked residents who remained in the community to keep their children inside, keep their doors and windows closed and wear a proper-fitting mask while outside.</p><p>\"We are strongly, I repeat strongly, advising that you do not let your children play outside,\" she said. \"The smoke being this dense is extremely toxic.\"</p><p>There was better news in three small communities near the Ontario border, where officials said the more than 300 residents of Val-Paradis, Beaucanton and Lac Pajegasque could go home after being forced to leave on Friday.</p><p>The Atikamekw of Opitciwan, about 600 kilometres north of Montreal, also announced that residents of the area who had been evacuated would be allowed to return on Tuesday.</p><p>Environment Canada issued smog warnings for much of the province, including Montreal and Quebec City, due to poor air quality caused by fine particles in the air. The department also issued special weather statements for many of those same cities, forecasting 20 to 40 millimetres of rain in some areas, with more than 50 mm possible in thunderstorms.</p><p>By late afternoon, the smog warnings had been lifted for the south of the province between Quebec City and Montreal, though they remained in place in the Gatineau region near Ottawa, the Abitibi region in the northwest and the Lac-St-Jean region north of Quebec City.</p><p>READ ALSO: Recent lightning strikes carpet northeast B.C., as active wildfire count climbs</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230627PAB4485636</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JT-TP71-F0HF-84GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

In Roraima State, in northern Brazil, the number of fires in February were more than <url normalizedValue=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152511/amazon-forest-fires-rage-in-roraima\">five times the average</url>, according to data from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, and blazes continued to burn through March.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"</emphasis>We are losing the Amazon rainforest. These changes in the climate right now provoked by El Ni\u00f1o\u00a0makes this forest fire season even worse than we are used to seeing in the forest,\" said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of Brazil's Climate Observatory.\u00a0</p><p>Wildfires in the normally humid, tropical rainforest have been supercharged by a disastrous combination of elevated temperatures, historic drought and deforestation.</p><p>Even as the year-old government of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has brought down the rate of deforestation in Brazil by more than 20 per cent, a hot dry 2023\u00a0stressed the trees within\u00a0the Amazon, which stretches into eight countries.</p><p>Analysis by Copernicus, a European atmospheric monitoring service, estimates that fires in Brazil released the highest amount of carbon dioxide for the month of February\u00a0in over two decades. Half of the 45.1 megatons of CO2 released, it reported, came from the fires in Roraima state.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">WATCH | Parts of Brazil's Amazon rainforest saw record wildfires in February:</emphasis>\u00a0</p><p>\"[In] Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, you also see very high fire activities. This is another kind of proof that the climate is playing a very important role in that,\" said Ane Alencar, science director for the Amazon Environmental Research Institute.</p><p>'Prone to be burned'\u00a0</p><p>The Amazon is one of the world's largest carbon sinks, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-the-amazon-so-important-for-climate-change1/\">capable of storing more than 150 billion metric tonnes of carbon</url>, equivalent to about 10 years of global greenhouse gas emissions. But with abnormally high temperatures, the majestic green canopy begins to suffer.</p><p>\"The first thing that the trees do, they shed their leaves and you have right there very good fuel material for the fire,\" Alencar told CBC News.\u00a0</p><p>\"At the same time that you open the canopy, you allow the exchange of dry air with moist air. So you make that microclimate condition internally in the forest more prone to be burned.\"</p><p>Back in September, as the wildfire season began to wane in North America, Brazil was experiencing the effects of a crippling drought, which began last March. People in\u00a0Manaus, one of the hubs of the BrazilianAmazon, were choking on smoke.\u00a0</p><p/><p>Alencar says she checked the levels of particulate matter in the air and compared it to the worst of the fires in Quebec, which sent smoke as far as New York last June, making international headlines with photos of red hazy air hanging over Manhattan.\u00a0</p><p>The levels were the same or worse in the Amazon, she said. Indigenous communities were breathing that level of smoke daily, but without the outcry observed in North America, according to Alencar.</p><p>\"This year, we have felt this huge change. The air and the humidity is very low and this has also led to problems with illnesses in families, especially in children,\" said Cesar Da Silva an Indigenous leader.\u00a0</p><p>Parts of the Amazon River basin withered, such that transport by boat was nearly inaccessible\u00a0and mounds of dead fish floated to the surface because of the abnormally warm water. In October, the Amazon's main tributary, Rio Negro, was the lowest it had been since annual records began in the early 1900s.</p><p/><p>Efforts to curb illegal deforestation</p><p>Even with gains made to protect the forest under President Lula da Silva, some parts are already 40 per cent deforested, according to Luciana Gatti, a greenhouse gas specialist and researcher with the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research.\u00a0</p><p>Efforts to curb illegal deforestation are still met with stiff resistance from powerful ranching interests in states still controlled by supporters of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro's party.\u00a0</p><p>\"We are no longer facing Bolsonaro's term, but the politics that try to undermine forest protection in Brazil is really alive, it's still operating in the country,\" said Astrini.</p><p>\"International pressure, international surveillance is absolutely important and makes a difference,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p/><p>Last week, France and Brazil announced an investment plan to raise over 1 billion euros to help protect the forest.\u00a0</p><p>International funds had dipped during Bolsonaro's presidency;\u00a0in 2019, Bolsonaro accused Macron and other G7 countries of treating Brazil like \"a colony.\"</p><p>\"After a four-year eclipse and a virtual freeze in political relations between our two countries during Bolsonaro's presidency, we are in the process of relaunching the bilateral relationship and the strategic partnership with Brazil,\" a French presidential adviser told Reuters on Friday.</p><p>Money can't cool the climate</p><p>Scientists forecast the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, which helped exacerbate the drought, will wane throughout the end of this year. But few are predicting what 2024 will bring, with high ocean temperatures still setting records.\u00a0</p><p>The parts of the Amazon above the equator are heading into a rainy season, but it has been delayed. Below the equator in Brazil, the rainforest is entering fall, when it normally gets drier and warmer, and\u00a0there are concerns about a lack of rainfall to feed the rivers and lakes.\u00a0</p><p/><p>\"We [are] arriving at a very dangerous limit for the Amazon, and not everybody is observing that we are very near this limit,\" said Gatti.</p><p>But the coming year is sending red flag warnings. Money can help with monitoring and efforts to curb deforestation, but it can't cool the climate, and 2024 could break temperature records again.\u00a0</p><p>\"We need to do something like [consider this] an emergency situation. We cannot wait,\" said Gatti.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewsworldamazonwildfiresbrazil17161712</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BPN-8WW1-F03F-K504-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"944\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

(VH) are the proud owners of the only commercially operated Bell 429 helicopter in Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cWe\u2019re happy we\u2019re able to use it and we want to use it more,\u201d said Brad Fandrich, the president of VH. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief (to have it) but there\u2019s apprehension because this is a business move. It\u2019s not just a toy, it\u2019s for work. And we\u2019re happy with how it worked out last summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The helicopter\u2019s arrival in Hope was the result of a nearly decade long dream that first started when Fandrich and his wife, Brittany Fandrich, visited Florida and attended a helicopter conference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While there, Fandrich saw a 429 for the first time and expressed interest in eventually owning one. However, he had no expectations that he could ever justify owning one as an operator.</p><p>\u201cI told (Brittany) that \u2018I think those are really neat helicopters.\u2019 But it was one of those things where we had no use for one,\u201d Fandrich said. \u201cBut it was something that, like every idea, it has to start somewhere. And then over the years, I watched how these 429s\u2019 were being utilized around the world.</p><p>\u201cI started looking at what these other operators are doing and thought we can figure this out in Canada. I was always watching out for 429s\u2019 and watching for opportunities within our customer base.</p><p>The Bell 429 is a light, twin-engine helicopter that is developed by Bell Helicopter and Korea Aerospace Industries. It is a multipurpose utility helicopter that was originally created to address the needs of the emergency medical services industry.</p><p>Additionally, the aircraft\u2019s modern and powerful twin-engine system allows it to still hover in the air if one of the engines stops working. This makes it invaluable for emergency situations and weather events.</p><p>In operation for over 30 years, VH is, according to their website, a \u201ccharter helicopter operator providing services in Western Canada, with bases in Hope, Merritt, and Kamloops.\u201d The company was founded in Hope by Fandrich\u2019s father, Fred Fandrich, and provides services to both the public and government, with specialization in supporting \u201cmountaintop and powerline construction, aerial survey, passenger transport, forest fire support, search and rescue, and specialty lift work.\u201d</p><p>This includes working with clients such as BC Wildfire Service, Trans Mountain, and Hope Search and Res-cue. Their work has also taken them out of B.C. and across Canada, to places as far away as the Arctic Circle.</p><p>Fandrich, who previously worked as a helicopter me-chanic and then a pilot, took over as the president of VH 10 years ago.</p><p>He said that, over the past decade, the need for a twin-engine helicopter became greater in Canada, mainly through the pipeline construction, search and rescue, air ambulances, and wildfire support.</p><p>The use of twin-engine helicopters also became crucial with regards to landing helicopters at hospital helipads; due to their proximity to busy public areas (such as schools, parks, and general city traffic), helicopters aren\u2019t allowed to land at many of the major hospitals in B.C. (like BC Children\u2019s General Hospital and the Royal Columbian Hospital) unless they have modern twin-engines.</p><p>For VH, Frandrich said that purchasing the helicopter became more justifiable as more opportunities to work with clients popped up. It also started looking more affordable as \u201csimpler\u201d versions of the helicopter started being available.</p><p>As such, when Fandrich got the opportunity to buy a used Bell 429 from Istanbul, T\u00fcrkiye, at half the cost, he knew he couldn\u2019t pass it up.</p><p>\u201cWe worked with an aircraft broker, that we bought a few aircrafts with before, and he put us on this one in (T\u00fcrkiye),\u201d Fandrich said. \u201cIt was doing air ambulance work in (T\u00fcrkiye). So, it was already configured almost exactly how we would have liked it. There were just a few things we had to do to it.\u201d</p><p>According to Fandrich it took them seven months \u2014 from late 2022 to early 2023 \u2014 to purchase it and then bring it back to Canada. As such, they were only able to fully operate it in the summer 2023.</p><p>Part of this, he said, had to do with cultural differences, international law, and how slow transactions can take in the aviation world.</p><p>The other part, he said, had to do with the logistics of actually transporting the helicopter from Istanbul to B.C. Because T\u00fcrkiye is neutral when it comes to the war between Russia and Ukraine, flights coming directly in and out of Russia can only pass through certain airports. Which means they can only travel with certain airlines. One of these airlines is Turkish Airlines which makes all its flights stop/pass through Istanbul Airport. Because of this, the airport is incredibly busy which would affect transporting the helicopter.</p><p>Fandrich was also informed that, if he chose to transport the helicopter via ship, his insurance companies would not insure it. This is due to it being high risk, for insurance companies, because of the amount of \u201cunfortunate losses\u201d that have happened to ships and their cargo.</p><p>After speaking with an ex-pert who specializes in shipping helicopters, Fandrich was given the option to dissemble the helicopter, bring its parts to Luxembourg, and it have air freighted, on a 747 Freighter, to Abbotsford.</p><p>\u201cIn Europe, there\u2019s not a lot of helicopter service centers. But there was one in Germany,\u201d Fandrich said. \u201cSo we decided to fly the helicopter from (T\u00fcrkiye) to Germany.\u201d</p><p>He was also recommend to, because of Turkey\u2019s relationships with other countries, to put war risk insurance on the helicopter while transporting it.</p><p>\u201cIf a neighbouring country saw a Turkish registered aircraft land inside its borders, they (insurance company) were concerned that it could be seized for a variety of reasons,\u201d Fandrich said. \u201cWe decided to Canadian register the helicopter there (in T\u00fcrkiye). Thankfully, through friends in the industry, we knew the person to give us that piece of paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Now with Canadian registration, Fandrich said he, along with the pilot and mechanic he brought with him, put the helicopter on a truck and drove it to Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye. From there, they flew the helicopter through seven countries before finally reaching Germany.</p><p>Once the helicopter reached Germany, it was taken apart and then brought to Luxembourg. From there, it was freighted by air to Abbotsford.</p><p>\u201cWe arrived in Abbotsford and put it back together and did a bunch of work on it.

This business alliance will augment MFB's growth and market penetration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SkyScout Ai Innovations Inc. has a vertically integrated technology platform which uses satellites and drones to detect hotspots and early inception fires, and it offers a new way of detecting and responding to wildfires. These new and better early fire elimination techniques are what MFB is excited to be a part of, because they increase firefighter safety for those on the frontlines, and they also increase firefighting efficacy.</p><p>The 2023 Canadian wildfire season was the worst in recorded history for that nation. According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center (CIFFC) more than 6,600 fires burned a total area of more than 45 million acres, which is over six times their 10 year average. Many in the U.S. watched and saw how those wildfires caused unhealthy air as far south as New York City, and the Canadian wildfire smoke created unhealthy air across the northern tier of the United States. News reports stated that over 70 million people were subjected to unhealthy air quality. Just last week, Science News said exposure to rising levels of wildfire smoke could lead to more than 10,000 additional deaths each year in the U.S. by the year 2050. This could make deaths due to wildfire smoke the costliest consequence of climate change for the country, accounting for nearly as much economic damage as all other climate-related impacts combined.</p><p>Canada is currently forecasting another challenging wildfire season for most of the country, and MFB is committed to supporting, on a technical level from coast to coast, with product demonstrations and product knowledge seminars.</p><p>On another front, there is ever-worsening news about the U.S. Fire Insurance Crisis that is now beginning to impact the Canadian markets. With the combined efforts of MFB and SkyScout Ai, there is the potential for a real, positive impact on the insurance crisis as well as on air quality. Accordingly, this business alliance between MFB and SkyScoutAi is something that both the U.S. Government and the Canadian Government should support.</p><p>The Canadian Property Owners will get the benefit of the MFB's Wildfire Defense Systems through SkyScoutAi's Contractor customers. MFB's WFD System adds the \"airbag approach\" with remote activation of CitroTech Sprinkler Systems. This type of WFD will reduce the risk of loss better than ever before. Furthermore, it is now supported by the AIA and the U.S. GreenBuild Council, and it is taught on the AEC Daily (CES) platform.</p><p>The fact that Mighty Fire Breaker's MFB-31-CitroTech is certified by the U.S. EPA Safer Choice Program should help expedite MFB's current effort to become qualified and listed in the CEPA, which is the Canadian Environmental Protection Act Registry. The CEPA provides for assessment of new and existing chemical substances. The CEPA program should support MFB's vision and efforts to reduce the risk from wildfires to humans and to the environment.</p><p>For additional information, photos, and footage from the event or to learn more about Mighty Fire Breaker's technology and mission, please contact:</p><p>For more information, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mightyfirebreaker.com\">www.mightyfirebreaker.com</url></p><p>For technical product information: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Info@mightyfirebreaker.com\">Info@mightyfirebreaker.com</email></p><p>Contact Information</p><p>Twitter: @GEVIOfficial</p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://generalenterpriseventures.com\">https://generalenterpriseventures.com</url>/</p><p>Forward Looking Statements:</p><p>This document contains \"forward-looking statements\", which includes statements regarding expected financial performance and growth information relating to future events.

Watershed Security Coalition, told CBC News that the limited precipitation in the province's mountains means reservoirs are not being replenished.</p><p>That could have devastating knock-on effects on rivers across B.C. - and everyone who depends on water for their livelihoods, such as agriculture,\u00a0and for essentials like firefighting efforts.</p><p>\"We are definitely concerned,\" Tull said. \"Because we're in a multi-year drought ... \u00a0it really raises alarm bells.</p><p>\"We start to get really concerned about what the spring, summer and fall will look like this year, given the results that we're seeing.\"</p><p>She said in the past year, farmers in some areas have had to cut off irrigation to their crops in some areas, and there has even been shortages of water for battling out-of-control wildfires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Early warning sign'</emphasis></p><p>Premier David Eby said the new data reinforces what is \"the most dramatic drought conditions that we've seen\" in B.C.</p><p>\"Knowing the farmers didn't have enough water to feed their cattle this summer - knowing the forest fire impacts we've seen - I'm really worried,\" Eby said at an unrelated press conference Thursday.</p><p>\"The weather that we're having is so unpredictable\u00a0and so extreme right now\u00a0that the economic impacts, and the human impacts, feel much more acute.</p><p>\"We're the early warning sign for the rest of Canada for what's coming with climate change.\"</p><p>Close to 100 wildfires continue to smoulder in the province, holdovers from last year's record-breaking fire season, the premier added.</p><p>The snowpack is especially sparse across the South Coast, the River Forecast Centre report found.\u00a0</p><p>Peter Marshall,\u00a0a\u00a0field hydrologist\u00a0with Metro Vancouver, said the last time researchers saw such a poor year was in 2015.

This business alliance will augment MFB's growth and market penetration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SkyScout Ai Innovations Inc. has a vertically integrated technology platform which uses satellites and drones to detect hotspots and early inception fires, and it offers a new way of detecting and responding to wildfires. These new and better early fire elimination techniques are what MFB is excited to be a part of, because they increase firefighter safety for those on the frontlines, and they also increase firefighting efficacy.</p><p>The 2023 Canadian wildfire season was the worst in recorded history for that nation. According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center (CIFFC) more than 6,600 fires burned a total area of more than 45 million acres, which is over six times their 10 year average. Many in the U.S. watched and saw how those wildfires caused unhealthy air as far south as New York City, and the Canadian wildfire smoke created unhealthy air across the northern tier of the United States. News reports stated that over 70 million people were subjected to unhealthy air quality. Just last week, Science News said exposure to rising levels of wildfire smoke could lead to more than 10,000 additional deaths each year in the U.S. by the year 2050. This could make deaths due to wildfire smoke the costliest consequence of climate change for the country, accounting for nearly as much economic damage as all other climate-related impacts combined.</p><p>Canada is currently forecasting another challenging wildfire season for most of the country, and MFB is committed to supporting, on a technical level from coast to coast, with product demonstrations and product knowledge seminars.</p><p>On another front, there is ever-worsening news about the U.S. Fire Insurance Crisis that is now beginning to impact the Canadian markets. With the combined efforts of MFB and SkyScout Ai, there is the potential for a real, positive impact on the insurance crisis as well as on air quality. Accordingly, this business alliance between MFB and SkyScoutAi is something that both the U.S. Government and the Canadian Government should support.</p><p>The Canadian Property Owners will get the benefit of the MFB's Wildfire Defense Systems through SkyScoutAi's Contractor customers. MFB's WFD System adds the \"airbag approach\" with remote activation of CitroTech Sprinkler Systems. This type of WFD will reduce the risk of loss better than ever before. Furthermore, it is now supported by the AIA and the U.S. GreenBuild Council, and it is taught on the AEC Daily (CES) platform.</p><p>The fact that Mighty Fire Breaker's MFB-31-CitroTech is certified by the U.S. EPA Safer Choice Program should help expedite MFB's current effort to become qualified and listed in the CEPA, which is the Canadian Environmental Protection Act Registry. The CEPA provides for assessment of new and existing chemical substances. The CEPA program should support MFB's vision and efforts to reduce the risk from wildfires to humans and to the environment.</p><p>For additional information, photos, and footage from the event or to learn more about Mighty Fire Breaker's technology and mission, please contact:</p><p>For more information, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://pr.report/qsSYcjg6\">www.mightyfirebreaker.com</url></p><p>For technical product information: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Info@mightyfirebreaker.com\">Info@mightyfirebreaker.com</email></p><p>Contact Information</p><p>Twitter: @GEVIOfficial</p><p>Website:\u200b <url normalizedValue=\"https://pr.report/Eh1cbrY6\">https://generalenterpriseventures.com/</url></p><p>Forward Looking Statements:</p><p>This document contains \"forward-looking statements\", which includes statements regarding expected financial performance and growth information relating to future events.

But climatologist David Phillips says it\u2019s almost as if this winter in Canada never happened.</p><p>\u201cI called it the lost season,\u201d said Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.</p><p>Canada shattered temperature records this winter, and it wasn\u2019t close, Phillips said, referring to national data going back to 1948.</p><p>While winter\u2019s end is typically marked by the equinox, climatologists look at what\u2019s known as meteorological winter, the three-month period from December to February. Over that period, Canada was 5.2 C warmer than average, said Phillips. That\u2019s 1.1 degrees warmer than the previous record set in 2009-2010.</p><p>There were bouts of extreme winter weather across Canada, from a January deep freeze on the Prairies to a massive snowfall in the Maritimes in February. But the warmer-than-normal and unusual weather was widely felt across the country.</p><p>This winter, Phillips said, \u201cwas put on hold \u2013 and not on ice.\u201d</p><p>Some people may have been grateful for a break on heating bills or for periodic balmy days, but Phillips says the record-breaking temperatures upended Canada\u2019s winter way of life. Winter festivals were cancelled, ski resorts faced closures, and flora and fauna emerged prematurely. Remote First Nations in Ontario and Manitoba that depend on ice roads issued states of emergency due to poor conditions.</p><p>Outdoor skating, often regarded as a picture-postcard image of Canada\u2019s winter life, suffered too. Ottawa\u2019s iconic Rideau Canal skateway was open for a few days this winter, after the previous year\u2019s unprecedented season-long closure.</p><p>Damon Matthews, a Concordia University climate scientist who has tracked climate change\u2019s impact on retreating rinks, cited Wayne Gretzky and Joni Mitchell as he noted the place of outdoor skating in Canada\u2019s imaginings of winter.</p><p>Mitchell\u2019s longing for a \u201criver I could skate away on,\u201d evoked in her 1971 song \u201cRiver,\u201d may be shared not just by those who decamped to California, but by people across Canada this year and in years to come, he said. Gretzky\u2019s origin story of learning to play on outdoor rinks may be a story denied to other aspiring hockey players in southern Ontario.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that\u2019s the case,\u201d he said.</p><p>Experts say the drivers of this winter\u2019s record-breaking warmth include El Ni\u00f1o and human-caused climate change. Other related factors include record-high global ocean temperatures and residual heat from earlier in 2023.</p><p>El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate phenomenon that typically comes around every two to seven years, was strong this year but not the strongest. The United Nation\u2019s World Meteorological Organization said its peak fell short of at least two other El Ni\u00f1o winters in 1997 and 2015.</p><p>\u201cEl Ni\u00f1o has contributed to these record temperatures, but heat-trapping greenhouse gases are unequivocally the main culprit,\u201d WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an update earlier this month, referring to a string of consecutive global monthly temperature records.</p><p>Climate change is expected to crank up temperatures in winter more than any other season in Canada, said Phillips, the Environment Canada climatologist. If the world continues to emit greenhouse gases on a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d scale until 2050, Phillips says his own community of Barrie, in central Ontario, could see winters as warm as this one on a regular basis around 2065.</p><p>Less snow on the ground for the spring melt means less water available to irri-gate farmlands and replenish reservoirs. As snow melts, it also helps to reduce the risk of wildfires.</p><p>Almost all of Western Canada, northern Ontario and parts of northern Quebec were under drought conditions as of the end of February, says a recent update from Environment Canada.

Alberta has been battling multiple severe fires since early May and there are still 63 fires burning, 18 of them out of control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported that as of Friday afternoon there were 324 fires burning across the country, and 167 are considered out of control. That includes the Tantallon fire in Halifax that has destroyed or damaged 151 homes so far.</p><p>That's a big jump from Thursday, when the agency reported 209 fires, with 87 out of control.</p><p>Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said Friday that cooler weather is expected in Western Canada and rain in Nova Scotia, which will help. But the severe fire warnings are likely to continue in most provinces for another four to five weeks at least.</p><p>\"The situation remains severe across the country,\" Blair said. \"We are hopeful that the improving weather conditions and that rain will assist in the firefighting efforts, but there's still a great deal of work that needs to be done.\"</p><p>More than 27,000 square kilometres of land has burned in Canada over the last two months, more than 10 times the average amount of land burned by fires over the last decade.</p><p>Thus far, more than 96 per cent of the burned land was in Western Canada and Northwest Territories, but last weekend the situation became more severe in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and now parts of Ontario and Quebec are also burning.</p><p>\"There are a number of very significant \u2014 over 100 wildfires \u2014 that have now popped up in Quebec and some of them are out of control and quite serious,\" said Blair.</p><p>The Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre database added 113 fires in Quebec since Thursday, and 76 of them are classified as being out of control.</p><p>The Canadian Armed Forces deployed several hundred troops to Alberta to help in May and is training more to help in Nova Scotia now, said Blair. The military and the Canadian Coast Guard is also helping with equipment, he said.</p><p>The number of fires, their size and severity, as well as the number of places affected are straining Canada's resources, so the Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre has requested help from international partners.</p><p>Since the season began, 443 firefighters and other workers from Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. have flown to Canada to help, mostly in Alberta. Some have gone to Northwest Territories and a small number so far have landed in Nova Scotia.</p><p>Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. are all sending more firefighters in the coming days, Blair said. Most are again heading to Alberta, but some will fly to Nova Scotia.</p><p>As well, six water bombers from Montana are expected to arrive in Nova Scotia to help on Friday and Saturday, after getting clearance to use the airstrip at Canadian Armed Forces Base Greenwood.</p><p>\"I would like to offer my deepest thanks to all of the firefighters, emergency management professionals, who have left their communities and in some cases, their country, to support our efforts here in Canada,\" he said. \"We are grateful for their work and their dedication.\"</p><p>The South African High Commission in Ottawa said Friday 200 firefighters and 15 managers would leave South Africa Saturday, and they are heading to Alberta for 35 days. Another 200 firefighters and 13 managers are set to follow on June 10.</p><p>South Africa's Environment Minister Barbara Creecy said it's the fifth time the two countries have shared firefighting personnel.</p><p>\"We are proud of the fact that South Africa is again able to assist Canadian firefighting teams in their battle to bring the wildfires under control,\" she said in a statement. \"The extensive experience and training of these firefighters will significantly enhance efforts to effectively suppress and manage the wildfires in Alberta.\"</p><p>South Africa's aid hasn't been without controversy in the past. In 2016, 300 firefighters flew to Fort McMurray to help with the major blaze that forced the evacuation of the city, but a month-long deployment lasted less than two weeks in a dispute over pay.</p><p>Foreign firefighters get stipends and additional pay when battling fires in foreign jurisdictions, and the South African firefighters complained their pay in Alberta was less than what Canadians were getting.</p><p>Blair said pay will be sorted out properly this time.</p><p>\"We will make sure that they are properly supported in the work that they're doing on our behalf,\" he said.</p><p>Mia Rabson, The Canadian Press</p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230602PAB4477826</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CG-J811-F0HF-84RS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

But climatologist David Phillips says it\u2019s almost as if this winter in Canada never happened.</p><p>\u201cI called it the lost season,\u201d said Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.</p><p>Canada shattered temperature records this winter, and it wasn\u2019t close, Phillips said, referring to national data going back to 1948.</p><p>While winter\u2019s end is typically marked by the equinox, climatologists look at what\u2019s known as meteorological winter, the three-month period from December to February. Over that period, Canada was 5.2 C warmer than average, said Phillips. That\u2019s 1.1 degrees warmer than the previous record set in 2009-2010.</p><p>There were bouts of extreme winter weather across Canada, from a January deep freeze on the Prairies to a massive snowfall in the Maritimes in February. But the warmer-than-normal and unusual weather was widely felt across the country.</p><p>This winter, Phillips said, \u201cwas put on hold \u2013and not on ice.\u201d</p><p>Some people may have been grateful for a break on heating bills or for periodic balmy days, but Phillips says the record-breaking temperatures upended Canada\u2019s winter way of life. Winter festivals were cancelled, ski resorts faced closures, and flora and fauna emerged prematurely. Remote First Nations in Ontario and Manitoba that depend on ice roads issued states of emergency due to poor condi-tions. Outdoor skating, often regarded as a picture-postcard image of Canada\u2019s winter life, suffered too. Ottawa\u2019s iconic Rideau Canal skateway was open for a few days this winter, after the previous year\u2019s unprecedented season-long closure.</p><p>Damon Matthews, a Concordia University climate scientist who has tracked climate change\u2019s impact on retreating rinks, cited Wayne Gretzky and Joni Mitchell as he noted the place of outdoor skating in Canada\u2019s imaginings of winter.</p><p>Mitchell\u2019s longing for a \u201criver I could skate away on,\u201d evoked in her 1971 song \u201cRiver,\u201d may be shared not just by those who decamped to California, but by people across Canada this year and in years to come, he said. Gretzky\u2019s origin story of learning to play on outdoor rinks may be a story denied to other aspiring hockey players in southern Ontario.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that\u2019s the case,\u201d he said.</p><p>Experts say the drivers of this winter\u2019s record-breaking warmth include El Ni\u00f1o and human-caused climate change. Other related factors include record-high global ocean temperatures and residual heat from earlier in 2023.</p><p>El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate phenomenon that typically comes around every two to seven years, was strong this year but not the strongest. The United Nation\u2019s World Meteorological Organization said its peak fell short of at least two other El Ni\u00f1o winters in 1997 and 2015.</p><p>\u201cEl Ni\u00f1o has contributed to these record temperatures, but heat-trapping greenhouse gases are unequivocally the main culprit,\u201d WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an update earlier this month, referring to a string of consecutive global monthly temperature records.</p><p>Climate change is expected to crank up temperatures in winter more than any other season in Canada, said Phillips, the Environment Canada climatologist. If the world continues to emit greenhouse gases on a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d scale until 2050, Phillips says his own community of Barrie, in central Ontario, could see winters as warm as this one on a regular basis around 2065.</p><p>Less snow on the ground for the spring melt means less water available to irrigate farmlands and replenish reservoirs. As snow melts, it also helps to reduce the risk of wildfires.</p><p>Almost all of Western Canada, northern Ontario and parts of north-ern Quebec were under drought conditions as of the end of February, says a recent update from Environment Canada. Parts of southern Alberta and northern British Columbia reported conditions typically seen once every 50 years.</p><p>\u201cThe drought season, the forest fire season \u2013these are all to come, but sometimes the seeds of those are sown in the winter,\u201d said Phillips.</p><p>Great Lakes ice cover, which helps shield the shoreline from erosion during winter storms, also hit historic lows in February. Erosion concerns extend to coastal areas around the Gulf of St. Lawrence, including Prince Edward Island, said Phillips.</p><p>But there is a fine line between being clear about climate change\u2019s consequences and despairing about a preventable outcome, said Matthews, the Concordia climate scientist.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get our act together and stop arguing about, as a country, whether this is even an issue or a priority,\u201d he said, adding that Canada is \u201cnot stepping up the way we need to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutdoor skating is a consequence of that, but at the same time, there are many, many worse things that will happen if we don\u2019t get on with things.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20240320PTEA0004269491</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BM0-1V31-JD2C-J1C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Alberta has been battling multiple severe fires since early May and there are still 63 fires burning, 18 of them out of control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported that as of Friday afternoon there were 324 fires burning across the country, and 167 are considered out of control. That includes the Tantallon fire in Halifax that has destroyed or damaged 151 homes so far.</p><p>That's a big jump from Thursday, when the agency reported 209 fires, with 87 out of control.</p><p>Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said Friday that cooler weather is expected in Western Canada and rain in Nova Scotia, which will help. But the severe fire warnings are likely to continue in most provinces for another four to five weeks at least.</p><p>\"The situation remains severe across the country,\" Blair said. \"We are hopeful that the improving weather conditions and that rain will assist in the firefighting efforts, but there's still a great deal of work that needs to be done.\"</p><p>More than 27,000 square kilometres of land has burned in Canada over the last two months, more than 10 times the average amount of land burned by fires over the last decade.</p><p>Thus far, more than 96 per cent of the burned land was in Western Canada and Northwest Territories, but last weekend the situation became more severe in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and now parts of Ontario and Quebec are also burning.</p><p>\"There are a number of very significant \u2014 over 100 wildfires \u2014 that have now popped up in Quebec and some of them are out of control and quite serious,\" said Blair.</p><p>The Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre database added 113 fires in Quebec since Thursday, and 76 of them are classified as being out of control.</p><p>The Canadian Armed Forces deployed several hundred troops to Alberta to help in May and is training more to help in Nova Scotia now, said Blair. The military and the Canadian Coast Guard is also helping with equipment, he said.</p><p>The number of fires, their size and severity, as well as the number of places affected are straining Canada's resources, so the Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre has requested help from international partners.</p><p>Since the season began, 443 firefighters and other workers from Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. have flown to Canada to help, mostly in Alberta. Some have gone to Northwest Territories and a small number so far have landed in Nova Scotia.</p><p>Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. are all sending more firefighters in the coming days, Blair said. Most are again heading to Alberta, but some will fly to Nova Scotia.</p><p>As well, six water bombers from Montana are expected to arrive in Nova Scotia to help on Friday and Saturday, after getting clearance to use the airstrip at Canadian Armed Forces Base Greenwood.</p><p>\"I would like to offer my deepest thanks to all of the firefighters, emergency management professionals, who have left their communities and in some cases, their country, to support our efforts here in Canada,\" he said. \"We are grateful for their work and their dedication.\"</p><p>The South African High Commission in Ottawa said Friday 200 firefighters and 15 managers would leave South Africa Saturday, and they are heading to Alberta for 35 days. Another 200 firefighters and 13 managers are set to follow on June 10.</p><p>South Africa's Environment Minister Barbara Creecy said it's the fifth time the two countries have shared firefighting personnel.</p><p>\u201cWe are proud of the fact that South Africa is again able to assist Canadian firefighting teams in their battle to bring the wildfires under control,\" she said in a statement. \"The extensive experience and training of these firefighters will significantly enhance efforts to effectively suppress and manage the wildfires in Alberta.\u201d</p><p>South Africa's aid hasn't been without controversy in the past. In 2016, 300 firefighters flew to Fort McMurray to help with the major blaze that forced the evacuation of the city, but a month-long deployment lasted less than two weeks in a dispute over pay.</p><p>Foreign firefighters get stipends and additional pay when battling fires in foreign jurisdictions, and the South African firefighters complained their pay in Alberta was less than what Canadians were getting.</p><p>Blair said pay will be sorted out properly this time.</p><p>\"We will make sure that they are properly supported in the work that they're doing on our behalf,\" he said.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 2, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-fd9550b571ab4a54a822d9a02131dd06</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CM-MKJ1-JBVR-31HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"795\"/><timeReceived>03:22 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 2, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

CTV's Annie Bergeron-Oliver with the latest from St. John's.</p><p>ANNIE BERGERON-OLIVER (Reporter): The power of the wind evident on a blustering day in St. John's, and that is what Europe hopes to harness as it seeks to move away from oil and gas.</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): Not only does this unwind people's dependence on Russia's weaponized energy exports, but it also fights climate change.</p><p>BERGERON-OLIVER: Europe has set a goal of importing 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030. The fuel is often produced by wind power, and is more expensive than hydrogen from fossil fuels. While that worries some companies about sustained demand, businesses and this province are already doing deals with Germany and the Netherlands.</p><p>KIERAN HANLEY (Econext CEO): We are energy rich, but we don't necessarily have a lot of customers for that energy. It is the opposite case in Europe.</p><p>BERGERON-OLIVER: Today Europe and Canada took that green trade relationship a step further, announcing a new Canada-EU hydrogen action plan, a green energy alliance, and Canada's official entrance into the more than $100 billion dollar Horizon Europe Research Group.</p><p>CHARLES MICHEL (European Council President): You have a very important role to play. We had today, this morning, a very fruitful discussion about the way we can cooperate.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: We just launched two months ago a product for air-to-air heat pumps in Europe.</p><p>BERGERON-OLIVER: But as Canada pitches itself and its businesses as a green friend to Europe, problems persist at home around the carbon tax. Opposition is growing after the government introduced a temporary carve out for home heating oil.</p><p>STEPHANE DION (Canadian Special Envoy to EU): If you don't put the price on the problem, we can't solve it.</p><p>BERGERON-OLIVER: And the EU's top leaders agree on its necessity, officially joining Canada's global carbon pricing challenge today.</p><p>URSULA VON DER LEYEN (European Commission President): Putting a price on emission drives investment in clean technologies up, and generates beside that also revenues.</p><p>BERGERON-OLIVER: After both regions experienced a devastating forest fire season last summer, Trudeau today announced that Canada will be building state-of-the-art water bombers in Alberta, and shipping them to Europe. But so far there is no timeline or monetary figure, Heather, attached to that promise.</p><p>BUTTS: All right, Annie, thanks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69R9-WDS1-DYX2-9004-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"435\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CTV Televisions, Inc.

Some didn\u2019t venture far this winter, which wasn\u2019t much of one according to every available metric. Still-smouldering zombie fires and reduced snow are already concerning land users as the wildfire season approaches.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Almost each month is breaking temperature records and there are signs that wildlife are struggling to adapt. Climate change is a clear and present danger for the Cree Nation, and it\u2019s responding with a new unit to navigate emerging climate threats. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just building the team,\u201d said Olivier K\u00f6lmel, CNG\u2019s climate change manager hired in September. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority issue for the Grand Chief since the start of her mandate. The focus is supporting communities on their initiatives, put in an action plan for the governments and work on a regional adaptation plan.\u201d </p><p>A key initiative for K\u00f6lmel\u2019s team is the Cree Regional Climate Forum to be held in Ouje-Bougoumou April 9-11, following a pilot forum held in 2018.  </p><p>\u201cThe workshops and discussions are all about empowering communities, defining climate leadership and adaptation planning,\u201d explained K\u00f6lmel. \u201cThe first day we\u2019ll have a panel on forest fires with federal and CNG representatives. That\u2019s top of mind for most folks.\u201d </p><p>Quebec\u2019s forest fire protection agency, SOPFEU, issued its earliest-ever first warning of the season at the beginning of March. Above-normal temperatures are expected to continue through the spring, creating dryer vegetation that can quickly spread a fire. SOPFEU is expanding its workforce and will be ready to hit the ground earlier than usual.   </p><p>Western Canada\u2019s wildfire season has already begun, with most of the 154 active fires holdovers from last year. Blazes simmering below the surface, sometimes called overwintering or zombie fires, are rare in Quebec but Cree land users are on the lookout.  </p><p>\u201cI saw on Facebook there was smoke coming out from under the snow in the Mistissini area,\u201d said Lee-Roy Blacksmith, the Cree Nation\u2019s regional fire marshal. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for land users notifying us if they\u2019re seeing smoke during the springtime while people do their Goose Break hunts.\u201d </p><p>Blacksmith recently addressed the Grand Council about concerns over diminished snow and swiftly thawing rivers and lakes. He works with SOPFEU and Indigenous Services Canada to ensure more community members are trained to fight forest fires and that they will have the same equipment as SOPFEU.  </p><p>While Cree people from five communities were trained during last summer\u2019s hectic fire season, 25 people from each of the four remaining communities will begin training in late May when melted lakes provide a reliable water source.  </p><p>\u201cOur main priority is to help SOPFEU and be the first responders when we start seeing fires around the communities instead of waiting for SOPFEU to come,\u201d Blacksmith told the Nation. \u201cWe\u2019ll get out there and try to maintain as much as we can.\u201d </p><p>As communities complete their reports summarizing local impacts from last year\u2019s fires, they\u2019re also preparing emergency measures plans. Evacuation lists need to be updated to ensure that emergency team members aren\u2019t required to leave due to medical issues or to care for children or grandchildren. </p><p>At the climate forum, Blacksmith will discuss progress on prevention measures and emerging initiatives. He said effectiveness substantially improved after a regional core group was established midway through last summer to facilitate communication and align responses between communities and external agencies.  </p><p>Over 100 participants representing all 11 Cree Nations are expected at the forum. Day one will take stock of the current situation, day two will look forward at adaptation planning and day three will focus on governance and climate leadership.   </p><p>The 2018 forum in Eastmain drew stakeholders from numerous entities from Cree, federal and provincial governments as well as researchers from McGill University and UQAT. Participants highlighted that climate change was disturbing hunting activities, impacting cultural transmissions to younger generations and impacting housing, water and food quality. </p><p>A new report emphasizes the leadership role of Indigenous communities in mitigation approaches. The \u201cIndigenous Resilience Report\u201d is the first comprehensive survey of climate change impacts from the perspective of First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis people.  </p><p>Arguing for a re-framing of the climate crisis as consumer society\u2019s disruption of the natural balance of life, Anishinaabe Elder Dave Courchene-baa states that \u201cit is because of how we have behaved as human beings that we have to feel the impact of what we have done to the Earth.\u201d  </p><p>Climate change is viewed as an interrelated crisis affecting Indigenous peoples, exacerbating other colonialism impacts like the infrastructure gap. The report\u2019s Indigenous authors contend that their peoples\u2019 deep connection with the land should be leveraged to assess environmental changes and develop holistic responses.   </p><p>Research shows that Canada is warming at twice the global average and the Arctic three times faster. Another report about Quebec\u2019s 2023 wildfire season calls for a comprehensive risk-management approach that includes new fire suppression strategies and industrial logging methods that support forest resilience. </p><p>Although the province\u2019s overall precipitation was near historic levels, Eeyou Istchee experienced an unusual deficit, while average temperatures were three-to-five degrees above normal. Suggesting that timber harvest rates may be too high to sustain a steady supply, the analysis proposes creating precautionary forest reserves. </p><p>The study stated that further global warming could mean up to a five-fold increase in the area burned each year by century\u2019s end. With over 250 bush cabins burned in Eeyou Istchee last summer, the Cree Nation is planning a public education campaign on safety measures. </p><p>\u201cThe majority of the fire chiefs and public safety officers took the fire smart program this fall,\u201d said Blacksmith. \u201cThere was too much flammable vegetation around the camps. We\u2019ll promote how to have fire-resistant camps before the summer season.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e6a048977b1c45de99b37a97cd4a9690</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BSC-H9P1-JBVR-312H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1027\"/><timeReceived>01:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 10, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

They know where it makes sense to build homes and that's why we're supporting them with giving them the funding and the tools they need to build more homes and to build the infrastructure needed to support homes of all types.\"</p><p>Calandra and Premier Doug Ford have repeated that sentiment often in recent days as fourplexes have become a flashpoint in Ontario politics and housing policy, with Ford rebuffing calls to automatically allow up to four units on a residential property anywhere in the province. </p><p>Municipalities can build them if they want, but the province won't force them, Ford has said. He has stood firm even as the federal government ties $5 billion in new funding for the provinces to implement a similar policy.</p><p>Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner said fourplexes are among the cheapest and fastest ways to increase housing supply, and the bill is notable for its absence of that measure and others he has urged.</p><p>\"(The housing crisis) is a raging forest fire that the government has brought a garden hose to try to deal with,\" he said.</p><p>Ontario's spring budget shows the pace of new home construction is picking up in the province, with 88,000 housing starts projected in 2024, but is still far off the levels needed to get to the government's target by 2031.</p><p>Calandra has previously indicated that Ontario needed to be building at least 125,000 homes this year, ramping up to at least 175,000 per year in the near future.</p><p>Calandra's new bill does seek to remove barriers to building additional housing like garden and laneway suites, such as restrictions on the number of bedrooms per lot. It would also exempt standardized housing designs from certain planning rules to speed up approvals, which the government says could allow Ontario to partner with British Columbia and the federal government on a catalogue of pre-approved designs.</p><p>Universities would be exempt from planning rules so they could save time on approvals and avoid barriers to building higher density student residences. </p><p>The \"use it or lose it\" provisions would allow municipalities to re-allocate water and wastewater servicing if a development sits inactive for a certain period of time. The government said seven municipalities have reported that 70,000 units have remained inactive for at least two years.</p><p>It would also eliminate a requirement to have a minimum amount of parking for developments near major transit stations, limit third-party appeals to the Ontario Land Tribunal, and allow municipalities to more quickly increase development charges that builders pay on market housing that doesn't qualify as affordable housing.</p><p>The changes on development charges reverse previous rules the government enacted that saw municipalities complain they would be out billions in revenue. This bill keeps intact cuts to development charges builders pay for affordable homes.</p><p>Municipalities have long urged the government to make them \"whole\" for the previous slate of changes to their development charge revenues, which they use to fund housing-enabling infrastructure such as water and sewer lines. Calandra said Wednesday that the changes in this bill combined with about $3 billion the government is making available for municipalities for such infrastructure will make them whole.</p><p>\"We have listened to our municipal partners and we're moving forward in a way that I think is much more co-operative,\" he said.</p><p>A statement from the Ontario Big City Mayors group, however, suggests they do not believe this makes them whole.</p><p>\"We continue to call on the province to sit down with municipalities for a municipal-fiscal review, which includes how they will address their commitment to keeping us whole,\" the mayors wrote, while adding that the bill contains several measures that will spur housing creation.</p><p>NDP Leader Marit Stiles said the legislation fails to present a real plan on housing since a large chunk of it is reversals.</p><p>\"The bill makes clear that this government doesn't want \u2013 or perhaps know how to \u2013 take seriously the urgency of this housing crisis,\" she said.</p><p>\"All told, this bill won't make it easier for you to find a home that you can afford or protect you from illegal eviction.\" </p><p>Environmental Defence said that some aspects of the bill, combined with other recent changes to land-use planning, would promote low-density sprawl.</p><p>\"Land speculators could demand at any time that farmland, wetlands and wildlife habitat be earmarked for sprawl development, with the new law letting them appeal any refusal,\" the advocacy group wrote in a statement.</p><p>The legislation covers a number of more minor regulatory changes, but also proposes to allow municipalities to provide incentives to certain businesses to help attract investment and enacts the government's reversal of dissolving Peel Region.</p><p>This bill would amend the law that would have broken up the upper-tier region to instead task the transition board initially responsible for overseeing that municipal divorce with considering how to make Peel Region more efficient. </p><p>The province has also launched a new process for how it receives and considers requests for Minister's Zoning Orders, which allow the province to fast-track development and bypass normal planning processes.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 10, 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e4296559e7a94158a580f960faab42b3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BSC-H9P1-JBVR-30TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"994\"/><timeReceived>04:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 10, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But climatologist David Phillips says it's almost as if this winter in Canada never happened.</p><p>\"I called it the lost season,\" said Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.</p><p>Canada shattered temperature records this winter, and it wasn't close, Phillips said, referring to national data going back to 1948.</p><p>While winter's end is typically marked by the equinox, climatologists look at what's known as meteorological winter, the three-month period from December to February. Over that period, Canada was 5.2 C warmer than average, said Phillips. That's 1.1 degrees warmer than the previous record set in 2009-2010.</p><p>There were bouts of extreme winter weather across Canada, from a January deep freeze on the Prairies to a massive snowfall in the Maritimes in February. But the warmer-than-normal and unusual weather was widely felt across the country.</p><p>This winter, Phillips said, \"was put on hold \u2013 and not on ice.\"</p><p>Some people may have been grateful for a break on heating bills or for periodic balmy days, but Phillips says the record-breaking temperatures upended Canada's winter way of life. Winter festivals were cancelled, ski resorts faced closures, and flora and fauna emerged prematurely. Remote First Nations in Ontario and Manitoba that depend on ice roads issued states of emergency due to poor conditions.</p><p>Outdoor skating, often regarded as a picture-postcard image of Canada's winter life, suffered too. Ottawa's iconic Rideau Canal skateway was open for a few days this winter, after the previous year's unprecedented season-long closure.</p><p>Damon Matthews, a Concordia University climate scientist who has tracked climate change's impact on retreating rinks, cited Wayne Gretzky and Joni Mitchell as he noted the place of outdoor skating in Canada's imaginings of winter.</p><p>Mitchell's longing for a \"river I could skate away on,\" evoked in her 1971 song \"River,\" may be shared not just by those who decamped to California, but by people across Canada this year and in years to come, he said. Gretzky's origin story of learning to play on outdoor rinks may be a story denied to other aspiring hockey players in southern Ontario.</p><p>\"It's a shame that's the case,\" he said.</p><p>Experts say the drivers of this winter's record-breaking warmth include El Ni\u00f1o and human-caused climate change. Other related factors include record-high global ocean temperatures and residual heat from earlier in 2023.</p><p>El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate phenomenon that typically comes around every two to seven years, was strong this year but not the strongest. The United Nation's World Meteorological Organization said its peak fell short of at least two other El Ni\u00f1o winters in 1997 and 2015.</p><p>\"El Ni\u00f1o has contributed to these record temperatures, but heat-trapping greenhouse gases are unequivocally the main culprit,\" WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an update earlier this month, referring to a string of consecutive global monthly temperature records.</p><p>Climate change is expected to crank up temperatures in winter more than any other season in Canada, said Phillips, the Environment Canada climatologist. If the world continues to emit greenhouse gases on a \"business as usual\" scale until 2050, Phillips says his own community of Barrie, in central Ontario, could see winters as warm as this one on a regular basis around 2065.</p><p>Less snow on the ground for the spring melt means less water available to irrigate farmlands and replenish reservoirs. As snow melts, it also helps to reduce the risk of wildfires.</p><p>Almost all of Western Canada, northern Ontario and parts of northern Quebec were under drought conditions as of the end of February, says a recent update from Environment Canada.

But climatologist David Phillips says it's almost as if this winter in Canada never happened. </p><p>\"I called it the lost season,\" said Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.</p><p>Canada shattered temperature records this winter, and it wasn't close, Phillips said, referring to national data going back to 1948.</p><p>While winter's end is typically marked by the equinox, climatologists look at what's known as meteorological winter, the three-month period from December to February. Over that period, Canada was 5.2 C warmer than average, said Phillips. That's 1.1 degrees warmer than the previous record set in 2009-2010.</p><p>There were bouts of extreme winter weather across Canada, from a January deep freeze on the Prairies to a massive snowfall in the Maritimes in February. But the warmer-than-normal and unusual weather was widely felt across the country. </p><p>This winter, Phillips said, \"was put on hold \u2013 and not on ice.\" </p><p>Some people may have been grateful for a break on heating bills or for periodic balmy days, but Phillips says the record-breaking temperatures upended Canada's winter way of life. Winter festivals were cancelled, ski resorts faced closures, and flora and fauna emerged prematurely. Remote First Nations in Ontario and Manitoba that depend on ice roads issued states of emergency due to poor conditions. </p><p>Outdoor skating, often regarded as a picture-postcard image of Canada's winter life, suffered too. Ottawa's iconic Rideau Canal skateway was open for a few days this winter, after the previous year's unprecedented season-long closure.</p><p>Damon Matthews, a Concordia University climate scientist who has tracked climate change's impact on retreating rinks, cited Wayne Gretzky and Joni Mitchell as he noted the place of outdoor skating in Canada's imaginings of winter. </p><p>Mitchell's longing for a \"river I could skate away on,\" evoked in her 1971 song \"River,\" may be shared not just by those who decamped to California, but by people across Canada this year and in years to come, he said. Gretzky's origin story of learning to play on outdoor rinks may be a story denied to other aspiring hockey players in southern Ontario. </p><p>\"It's a shame that's the case,\" he said. </p><p>Experts say the drivers of this winter's record-breaking warmth include El Ni\u00f1o and human-caused climate change. Other related factors include record-high global ocean temperatures and residual heat from earlier in 2023. </p><p>El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate phenomenon that typically comes around every two to seven years, was strong this year but not the strongest. The United Nation's World Meteorological Organization said its peak fell short of at least two other El Ni\u00f1o winters in 1997 and 2015. </p><p>\"El Ni\u00f1o has contributed to these record temperatures, but heat-trapping greenhouse gases are unequivocally the main culprit,\u201d WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an update earlier this month, referring to a string of consecutive global monthly temperature records. </p><p>Climate change is expected to crank up temperatures in winter more than any other season in Canada, said Phillips, the Environment Canada climatologist. If the world continues to emit greenhouse gases on a \"business as usual\" scale until 2050, Phillips says his own community of Barrie, in central Ontario, could see winters as warm as this one on a regular basis around 2065. </p><p>Less snow on the ground for the spring melt means less water available to irrigate farmlands and replenish reservoirs. As snow melts, it also helps to reduce the risk of wildfires. </p><p>Almost all of Western Canada, northern Ontario and parts of northern Quebec were under drought conditions as of the end of February, says a recent update from Environment Canada. Parts of southern Alberta and northern British Columbia reported conditions typically seen once every 50 years. </p><p>\"The drought season, the forest fire season \u2013 these are all to come, but sometimes the seeds of those are sown in the winter,\" said Phillips. </p><p>Great Lakes ice cover, which helps shield the shoreline from erosion during winter storms, also hit historic lows in February. Erosion concerns extend to coastal areas around the Gulf of St. Lawrence, including Prince Edward Island, said Phillips. </p><p>But there is a fine line between being clear about climate change's consequences and despairing about a preventable outcome, said Matthews, the Concordia climate scientist.</p><p>\"We need to get our act together and stop arguing about, as a country, whether this is even an issue or a priority,\" he said, adding that Canada is \"not stepping up the way we need to be.\" </p><p>\"Outdoor skating is a consequence of that, but at the same time, there are many, many worse things that will happen if we don't get on with things.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 19, 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-73031923fd0246b891afb6a7dae32826</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BKG-62G1-JBVR-31CT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><timeReceived>04:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 19, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This work will improve the quality of the environment, reduce risks to public health and safety, and help reduce environmental mining liabilities.</p><p>The various phases of work will employ between 20 and 50 people at a time and require local machinery and supplies. This will generate significant socio-economic benefits for the communities of Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou and Chibougamau. The work will also help Cree and James Bay companies gain experience and expertise.</p><p>La Grande-Rivi\u00e8re Airport rehabilitation</p><p>The Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec is investing $32,020,800 to rehabilitate airport pavements, upgrade the drainage system, and perform other related works at the La Grande-Rivi\u00e8re Airport.</p><p>The rehabilitation project will maintain the airport in good condition, meet Transport Canada safety standards and meet the growing demand for diverse goods from communities and businesses operating in Nunavik. This project is essential to ensure access and security throughout northern Qu\u00e9bec. La Grande-Rivi\u00e8re Airport is a crucial logistics base for transporting goods and people in the Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec region. In the context of the forest fires in the summer of 2023, the airport played a crucial role in evacuating people and deploying emergency crews.</p><p>Quotes:</p><p>\"The reclamation of Mine Principale and the rehabilitation of the La Grande-Rivi\u00e8re Airport are two announcements that local communities have long awaited. I am very proud to promote these two projects, which will significantly impact the regional economy and security. Our government and its partners are listening to the needs and concerns of the region's Cree and James Bay people.\"</p><p>Ma\u00eft\u00e9BlanchetteV\u00e9zina, Minister of Natural Resources and Forests and Minister Responsible for the Bas-Saint-Laurent Region and the Gasp\u00e9sie-\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine Region</p><p>\"The development of the Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec region brings together various government, industry and community partners around a shared vision of a northern territory that realizes its full potential for the benefit of its people. Therefore, we are getting closer to that vision by working together on projects that promote the region's economic vitality and the quality of life of its residents, such as the announced projects.\"</p><p>Jean Boulet, Minister of Labour and Minister Responsible for the Mauricie Region, the Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue Region and the Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec Region</p><p>\"The investment at La Grande-Rivi\u00e8re Airport will ensure the safety of users, improve the efficiency of cargo transportation in Nunavik, and contribute to the economic development of our region.\"</p><p>Denis Lamothe, Member for Ungava and Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Public Security</p><p>\"This announcement is in keeping with the spirit and desire for collaboration between the communities of Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou and Chibougamau. The reclamation of Mine Principale will enable the development of expertise within our companies that will generate future business opportunities. Finally, this project will significantly impact the quality of our community's environment. Qu\u00e9bec is the winner today in addressing environmental mining liabilities.\"</p><p>Manon Cyr, Mayor of Chibougamau</p><p>\"The community of Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou welcomes this announcement with great enthusiasm. As we mark this important milestone, we want to pay tribute to the Wapachee family, who played a crucial role in addressing the environmental and health concerns related to Mine Principale, located on their family trapline. Their legacy fuels optimism for this project, which promises economic revitalization through job creation and expansion of local businesses, as well as meaningful environmental improvements and strengthened community health. We are certain they would have been extremely proud of this achievement.\" </p><p>Gaston Cooper, Chief of the Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou Cree Nation</p><p>\"La Grande-Rivi\u00e8re Airport is a strategic transportation infrastructure for Qu\u00e9bec. Its location allows it to ensure a supply of goods and commodities for northern populations. It is the main interconnection link for the workers of Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's La Grande complex, a logistics base for forest fire protection for the SOPFEU and an essential economic driver for the area. We thank our government for this important contribution, which will allow this airport to benefit from the safest infrastructure possible.\"</p><p>AlainCoulombe, CEO and Director of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de d\u00e9veloppement de la Baie-James</p><p>Highlights:</p><p> Construction \u00c9conord Inc. is wholly owned by the Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou Cree Nation.

President Gabriel Boric has warned the toll could rise \"significantly.\"</p><p>The fires engulfed densely populated hilltop communities, mainly in Vina Del Mar - a popular tourism spot known for beaches and botanical gardens.</p><p>In one suburb alone, Villa Independencia, 19 people were killed and thousands of homes razed.</p><p>Here, families live crowded in homes built of light materials such as wood.</p><p>Flames tore through the narrow streets snaking through the hills, with cars exploding where they stood parked outside homes, according to survivors.</p><p>Authorities are investigating why residents did not flee, despite being urged to via messages sent to cellphones.</p><p>\"Alarms were raised, but the evacuation apparently did not work,\" said Horacio Gilabert, from the Global Climate Change Center of the Catholic University of Chile.</p><p>\u2013 What started the fires? \u2013</p><p>Boric said authorities were investigating \"the possibility that the fires were deliberate.\"</p><p>According to the National Forestry Corporation (Conaf), 99.7 percent of fires in the country are started intentionally or through recklessness.</p><p>In the current crisis, \"simultaneous outbreaks occurred, and that is totally abnormal,\" said the professor Castillo.</p><p>He said that the deliberate starting of fires was \"steadily increasing\" despite this drawing prison sentences of up to 20 years. Perpetrators are however rarely caught.</p><p>\u2013 Is climate change to blame? \u2013</p><p>The effects of the El Nino weather phenomenon have become more intense in this part of the world, due to global warming caused by human activity, scientists say.</p><p>El Nino raises the temperature of the Pacific Ocean, causing flooding in some areas, and droughts in others.</p><p>\"A change of just a few degrees in the Tropical Pacific can make the difference between a relatively mild forest fire season and a widespread catastrophe,\" climatologist Raul Cordero said in a study recently published by the Nature journal.</p><p>In the midst of a long drought, Chile experienced an unusual bout of rains last year which led to the growth of scrubland which serves as kindling during wildfires.</p><p>\u2013 How is Chile tackling the fires? \u2013</p><p>Authorities have deployed some 1,400 firefighters and 1,300 soldiers and volunteers to fight the blazes.</p><p>They are backed by 31 helicopters and planes equipped to carry water.</p><p>Boric, who has increased the budget to fight and prevent fires by 47 percent in his almost two years in office, declared a state of emergency.</p><p>A curfew has been imposed in parts of Valparaiso to free up roads for emergency vehicles.</p><p>However, the emergency services lack important capabilities, including equipment to fight fires at night.</p><p>\"As a result, the likelihood that all work done during the day will be lost at night is very high,\" Michel De L'Herbe, an expert in crisis management, told the radio station Cooperativa.</p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/what-to-know-about-chiles-voracious-wildfires/article\">What to know about Chile's voracious wildfires</url>  appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com\">Digital Journal</url> .</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/what-to-know-about-chiles-voracious-wildfires/article\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXDJ-DIJO100903170714706322725876100013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B8B-39S1-JCMN-Y0KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><timeReceived>3:26 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 5, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Global</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>clima</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>medioambiente</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>meteorologa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

That includes the 2,000 residents of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, parts of Val-d'Or and Senneterre, and some Indigenous communities.</p><p>The Cree Nation of Mistissini announced late Saturday that it was asking all remaining community members to evacuate the area due to a fire threatening nearby Route 167.</p><p>\"The dryness index is 100, the highest that can be recorded, and the intensity of the fire is really high,\" read one of a series of posts on the community's Facebook page.</p><p>Authorities noted that the forest fire agency was unable to get images of the fire due to low visibility, which made it hard to track its progress. A plan was in the works to protect the community by widening fire breaks, bringing in water tankers to combat spot fires, and putting sprinklers at the entrance to the community.</p><p>Meanwhile, heavy smoke forced the Cree community of Waswanipi to announce plans to evacuate another 50 residents including seniors, pregnant women and infants under one year old.</p><p>In a video update late Saturday, Chief Irene Neeposh asked residents who remained in the community to keep their children inside, keep their doors and windows closed, and to wear a proper-fitting mask while outside.</p><p>\"We are strongly, I repeat strongly, advising that you do not let your children play outside,\" she said. \"The smoke being this dense is extremely toxic.\"</p><p>There was better news in three small communities near the Ontario border, where officials said the more than 300 residents of Val-Paradis, Beaucanton and Lac Pajegasque could go home after being forced to leave on Friday.</p><p>The Atikamekw of Opitciwan, about 600 kilometres north of Montreal, also announced that residents of the area who had been evacuated would be allowed to return on Tuesday.</p><p>Environment Canada issued smog warnings for much of the province, including Montreal and Quebec City, due to poor air quality caused by fine particles in the air.</p><p>The department also issued special weather statements for many of those same cities, forecasting 20 to 40 millimetres of rain in some areas, with more than 50 mm possible in thunderstorms.</p><p>READ MORE: U.S. deploys high-tech Pentagon program to help Canada detect, suppress new wildfires</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230626PAB4485380</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JK-VDN1-JD2C-J4X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"541\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

As such, the Government of Canada is committed to providing information about climate change and its impact on everyday life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness Harjit S. Sajjan, withMinister of Energy and Natural Resources Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Minister responsible for Parks Canada Steven Guilbeault, andMinister of Indigenous Services and Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario Patty Hajdu,convened to share with Canadians the latest assessment of the 2024 wildfire season.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Latest projections for the 2024 seasonal wildland fire forecast indicate the wildfire risk in Canada is expected to remain high over the coming months, for much of the country, particularly in regions that continue to experience intense drought, including northwestern Alberta, northeastern British Columbia, and southern Northwest Territories.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For June, there is potential for above-normal wildfire activity across much of the country, from British Columbia to Labrador, and portions of Atlantic Canada. The forecast for July indicates a potential for above-average conditions to continue. The federal government will continue to monitor conditions closely. Further information is available through the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System.</p><p>Environment and Climate Change Canada's (ECCC) meteorologists continue to predict weather conditions for summer 2024 that could lead to greater wildfire risks. High-risk regions over British Columbia and Alberta have experienced close to normal temperature over the spring months. However, as we can expect with climate change, these regions have experienced drier than normal conditions during the same period. Drought conditions are expected to persist in high-risk regions in July, including the southern regions of the prairie and western provinces. ECCC is forecasting continued above-normal temperatures nationwide for the summer period. Such conditions exacerbate the risk and intensity of both natural and human-caused wildfires. </p><p>With this assessment and the ongoing wildfire risk, it is important to remember that everyone has a part in preparing for the potential impact of wildfires in our communities. The Government of Canada has taken steps to increase our preparedness, with a focus on the health, safety and security of Canadians, to ensure the necessary capacity is available to support provinces and territories and mobilize resources when they are needed for the 2024 wildfire season.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"The Government of Canada is committed to supporting Canadians and keeping them safe from extreme weather events brought on by climate change. We are working closely with provinces, territories, Indigenous communities, and our international allies to protect all Canadians from wildfires. We will continue to monitor the wildfire situation across Canada and we are prepared to provide assistance to provinces and territories should the need arise.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada, Minister of Emergency Preparedness and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada</p><p>\"Last year, Canada experienced its most destructive forest fire season in history. While favourable weather conditions have helped control some of the larger wildfires in western Canada this May, coming warmer weather is expected to bring challenges. The federal government has been working to prepare Canada for wildfires in 2024 by collaborating with partners across the country to build skills, support scientific research, and assist firefighters in preparing for and responding to not only the 2024 season, but also for a future where the impact of climate change on the severity of wildfires is becoming increasingly apparent.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources</p><p>\"The safety and well-being of all Canadians is the number one priority as we face what could become another difficult wildfire season. We have the backs of Canadians in communities across the country to help them better prepare against the impacts of wildfire and other forms of extreme weather. Just last week, we announced a new half-billion dollar program for municipalities to invest in planning and infrastructure to adapt to climate change and improved the air quality alert system to better inform Canadians of the risk of wildfire smoke.\"</p><p>  The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Minister responsible for Parks Canada</p><p>\"Everyone in Canada deserves to feel safe, but First Nations are disproportionally at risk of wildfires. This is already a difficult summer for many communities but we will be by their side before, during and after wildfires. And we will do it in a way that respects their self-determination and supports their leadership.\"</p><p>  The Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Indigenous Services and Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario</p><p>Quick facts</p><p> To access the latest weather, forecast and alert information Canadians can download the WeatherCAN application and get notifications wherever they are in Canada.The Government of Canada's Wildfires 2024 web page includes information about programs, policies and initiatives to keep Canadians informed about the wildfire situation and to support provincial and territorial efforts to combat wildfires.In Canada, emergencies are managed first at the local level: hospitals, fire departments, police and municipalities.

The fire had stopped spreading up into the trees, and was instead smouldering close to the ground, he said.</p><p>Crews hoped to have the fires under control later on Monday or some time on Tuesday, Theriault told reporters, adding: \"But this will be a long, drawn-out firefight for everybody.\"</p><p>New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs said it was \"a very extreme situation,\" adding that an \"unprecedented\" number of fires \u2014 about 15 \u2014 had started on Sunday alone.</p><p>Theriault said crews got a call on Sunday at about 1:30 p.m. about an all-terrain vehicle fire in Chamcook. When they arrived, they found the ATV ablaze and the flames spreading into the woods. Propelled by winds and parched conditions, the fire quickly leapt \"from hilltop to hilltop to hilltop,\" he said.</p><p>\"The fire travelled too fast to be controlled, and we ended up with the situation we're in now with a major forest fire on our hands in Chamcook and Bocabec,\" Theriault said. He estimated the fire covered more than two square kilometres as of Monday morning.</p><p>Saint Andrews, N.B., Mayor Brad Henderson said earlier Monday that officials had evacuated about 400 homes, but Theriault said that figure was closer to 300. The fire chief said evacuees wouldn't be able to return to their homes on Monday night, but he was hopeful they'd go home some time on Tuesday.</p><p>In the meantime, the arena in Saint Andrews was open as an emergency centre for those who needed food, shelter or somewhere to charge their phones.</p><p>The fire destroyed one home, but Theriault said the people who lived there were safe. There were other homes surrounded by flames, but crews were able to protect them, he said.</p><p>Firefighters from New Brunswick were sent to help other jurisdictions battle blazes, including Nova Scotia, where a fire in suburban Halifax forced more than 14,000 people to flee their homes. Higgs said they had all returned to the province, as had the firefighting aircraft sent to help outside New Brunswick.</p><p>There were 12 fires burning across the province on Monday, according to the government's latest fire activity report.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 29, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-d8d9e16147f84732a249801b4758270a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68BS-RT41-DY9S-T2RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><timeReceived>04:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 29, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
