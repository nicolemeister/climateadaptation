Her princess will be Valerie Braaten.</p><p>Miss Wilgosh, sponsored by Newby Construction, was also chosen from among her fellow contestants as Miss Congeniality, at the annual May Queen pageant.</p><p>The five contestants seeking the Miss Clearwater banner included Valerie Braaten, Miss Stedmans; Miss Raft River Riders, Ashley Sjodin, Miss Clearwater Lions, Laura Shipley; Miss OORP, Connie Arneson as well as Miss Wilgosh.</p><p>The new queen and her princess were crowned by retiring royalty, queen Dee Dee Null and her princess Donna Cooper.</p><p>30 YEARS AGO:</p><p>About 30 boaters attended a meeting to discuss boat use on Clearwater and Azure Lakes in Wells Gray Park met with BC Parks staff at the Infocentre in Clearwater.</p><p>Even if they were not all totally pleased with the outcome of the meeting, most appeared happy that Parks is making an effort to get their input.</p><p>Major topics were camping fees for those staying overnight at the campsites along the two lakes, canoe-only campsites and how to lessen congestion at the boat launch at the south end of Clearwater Lake.</p><p>Boaters staying overnight along the lakes will now pay $5 per vessel per night, explained Parks' Brian Carruthers.</p><p>25 YEARS AGO:</p><p>It was worthy of prime time TV.</p><p>As the two RCMP officers waved at the oncoming car to stop for an alcohol check, the driver hit the gas and dodged past, speeding along the shoulder of the gravel road.</p><p>We all piled into the police vehicles and gave chase down Candle Creek Road headed for Highway 5, red light flashing.</p><p>Looking for an out, the fleeing driver made a sharp turn onto a dirt road, the open front passenger side door of the car open and swinging wildly.</p><p>The desperate move proved just that, desperate, as the suspect vehicle was forced to a halt in the yard of a private residence approximately one-half kilometre later. Sgt. Henry, in the lead vehicle, leaped out of the unmarked police cruiser, collared the suspect driver, threw him over the trunk of his car and cuffed him while police service dog Brig, riding in the second RCMP vehicle, barked wildly and two of the suspect vehicle passengers screamed that the third needed medical attention.</p><p>20 YEARS AGO:</p><p>Licenses and the rest of the forest sector have to recognize that First Nations have an underlying ownership title to the land.</p><p>That was the message brought by North Thompson Indian Band chief Nathan Matthew to about 30 local foresters at a breakfast meeting in Clearwater.</p><p>\"That's the hardest part for people to accept,\" said Matthew. \"Most can agree on the soft stuff, but when it gets to ownership of the land it gets difficult. It's a legal issue.</p><p>\"The companies want more power, and First Nations are seen as an impediment to that. This has led to First Nations being pushed out the door.\"</p><p>Possibly First Nations should share in stumpage and other resource revenue collected from their traditional territory, he felt.</p><p>15 YEARS AGO:</p><p>RCMP officer and father of five, Chris Newel, is riding in the Cops for Kids Charitable Foundation in September. He says he's looking forward to the challenging 1,000 kilometre, nine-day ride.</p><p>Newel first became interested in the ride when he saw the Cops for Cancer riders in the fall. However, due to location, he just couldn't get onboard. So this year, Newel is able to ride for Cops for Kids and raise some much-needed funds.</p><p>\"I was a little hesitant at first because it's a huge challenge,\" he said. \"It's not something you can just do on a whim.\"</p><p>Newel needs to have $1,500 in pledges before he can rise, but he's aiming for a total of $3,000 by September.</p><p>10 YEARS AGO:</p><p>Black Press publisher Al Kirkwood said he's more than a little proud of how his papers fared at the recent Canadian Community Newspapers Assocation and B.C. and Yukon Community Newspaper Association's awards held during the Ink and Beyond conference, at the River Rock Resort in Richmond on April 30 and May 1.</p><p>Kirkwood, commented that it takes outstanding staff to mold all facets of a newspaper into an award-winning publication. And that's why the staff at both papers, especially The Times, are celebrating their recent triumphs.</p><p>The North Thompson Times took first place honours at the CNA Awards for Best All-Round Newspaper circulation up to 1249, and Best Editorial Page circulation up to 1249.</p><p>5 YEARS AGO:</p><p>Clearwater resident Tom Grimm and his son, Brue, recently returned home after being evacuated from Fort McMurray.</p><p>\"Compared to Fort Mac, 2003 was just a campfire,\" according to the elder Grimm.</p><p>Tom was comparing the forest fire that forced the evacuation last week of that northern Alberta town with the fire of 13 years ago that destroyed Louis Creek and forced the evacuation of much of the lower North Thompson Valley.</p><p>Grimm, a heavy equipment operator, had experience fighting both.</p><p>The fire behaviour at Fort McMurray was much more extreme, he said, and the damage to homes and property far more extensive.</p><p>\"I was on top of a hill they call Super Test in Fort Mac,\" he recalled. \"I looked toward town and it looked as if three or four volcanoes were going off.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsroom@clearwatertimes.com\">newsroom@clearwatertimes.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 Clearwater Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLETME-news20210515PNT4158035</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLETME2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62P0-BH91-F0HF-852F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438212</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"930\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Both commanders died in battle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 1844, Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormons, and his brother Hyrum were lynched by a mob in Carthage, Ill., resulting in part from the community's moral outrage at Smith's authorization of polygamous Mormon marriages.</p><p>In 1847, the New York-Boston telegraph was completed.</p><p>In 1860, the inaugural Queen's Plate was run near Toronto and was won by \"Don Juan.\" The Queen's Plate is the oldest uninterrupted stakes race in North America.</p><p>In 1880, author and lecturer Helen Keller -- who was blind, deaf and mute from the age of two -- was born in Alabama.</p><p>In 1896, Canada's first public film screening took place at the Paris Theatre in Montreal.</p><p>In 1957, more than 500 people were killed when Hurricane Audrey slammed through coastal Louisiana and Texas.</p><p>In 1967, the first ATM -- automatic teller machine -- was installed at a branch of Barclays PLC in a north London suburb.</p><p>In 1972, one of the most sensational player signings in hockey history took place.

The truck was hauling 38,000 litres of gasoline in one tank and 15,000 litres of diesel in the rear tank.</p><p>When crews arrived, they made an attempt to fight the blaze, but as the fire grew with intensity, and with the lack of water supply and inability to sustain an attack, Blackpool Fire Rescue ordered an emergency pull back.</p><p>\"It was unsafe for our crews to remain,\" Chief Mike Savage told The Times.</p><p>Crews retreated 800 metres from the scene. A family home nearby was evacuated, and given sprinkler protection, while three other families in homes near the 800-metre mark were told to shelter in place. Highway 24 was closed to traffic in both directions.</p><p>About 10 minutes after the team was told to retreat, the gasoline tanker blew.</p><p>As anyone who has used gasoline to light a campfire knows, it's not the gasoline itself that ignites the flame \u2014 it's the vapours. The 38,000 litres of gasoline were emitting vapours that are three to four time heavier than air with the ability to travel long distances along the ground.</p><p>The flames from the brakes mixed with the fumes from the gasoline tank, causing an explosion and what's known as a flash.</p><p>\"That flash can basically burn everybody around it,\" said Savage. \"That's why we pulled our crews back because it was getting to that point where it was unsafe, and within 10 minutes of the pull back, she blew. It was 100 feet in the air, huge fireball.\"</p><p>When they were certain the fire wouldn't do anything more than just burn, they opened the highway to single-lane traffic, with a pilot vehicle to ensure there was no risk to responders and also to prevent travellers from slowing down to look or to stop.</p><p>While the highway was closed, however, sirens from an ambulance could be heard travelling towards the scene. While an ambulance is on stand-by for any structural or serious fire, this particular ambulance was travelling from 100 Mile House to Royal Inland Hospital in Kamloops with an emergency patient transfer. Crews were able to get them through the scene safely.</p><p>Savage reminds those watching any emergency scene from afar to not speculate what may be happening. Rumours such as an emergency responder needing medical attention or an ambulance can unnecessarily worry family members, sending panic throughout the community.</p><p>After the blaze had been roaring for most of the day, emergency responders were able to get local drone footage of the truck. This allowed them to see they had an opening for an attack.</p><p>\"The drone footage showed that we had an opening for a tactical advantage to make a second attempt,\" said Savage. \"Based on that on-site intel, we were able to move crews in and hit the fire with a large monitor with foam at distance, cooling the rear tanker trailer and skipping foam into the open flame with the last of the small amount of product.\"</p><p>They extinguished the fire and made it safe enough to move in with hand lines and ground crews and save the rear tanker.</p><p>With the fire out, it's up to the company to dispatch a hazmat team to pump out the diesel, assess the wreckage and take the truck away. They were to do that today (June 14), according to Savage.</p><p>Seventeen firefighters, with two engines, two tender trucks and a bush truck, along with members of the RCMP and BC Ambulance were on scene. The Fire Commissioner's Office and local governments also were notified and BC Wildfire brought in, in the event one or both of the tankers blew and sparked a forest fire. Fortunately, there was minimal wind, allowing the flames and smoke to rise upwards.</p><p>Despite the uncertainty of those on the outside, all emergency crews and the driver of the truck were safe when fire crews officially packed up and left the scene at about 9:00 p.m.</p><p>Savage said that while it was a bit stressful at the start when the fire was unpredictable, the call to bring crews back was good as the blaze did exactly what they had feared.</p><p>\"If the risk isn't reasonable for what you're going to benefit, then get your people out,\" he said. \"That's what we work by. That's our golden rule.\"</p><p>EARLIER:</p><p>Sunday, June 13, 4:13 p.m.: Highway 24 has been opened to single-lane traffic each way, and vehicles are being piloted through the area.</p><p>Emergency crews are still on scene and the fire is not yet under control. Dark smoke can be seen billowing from the hills in Little Fort and along Highway 5.</p><p>The driver of the semi is safe, confirmed Const. Lockwood.</p><p>Video taken by Joey Onley shows thick smoke billowing into the sky, along with sirens in the background. While there is mention of an ambulance in the video, it has not been confirmed that an ambulance arrived at the scene, or if there were any injuries to emergency crews.</p><p>12:30 p.m.: A fuel tanker truck on fire has closed Highway 24 near Little Fort, B.C., according to the RCMP.</p><p>Both the Little Fort and Blackpool fire departments are responding to a fire on Highway 24 and the runaway lane near Cartwright Road, about five kilometres west of Little Fort. The driver of the fuel tanker pulled into the runaway lane after the wheels caught fire. The truck is carrying 53,000 litres of fuel.</p><p>Fire crews have determined the fire is too dangerous at this time to fight the blaze, so they are on scene and monitoring the situation.</p><p>The highway is closed in both directions, confirmed Const. Lockwood of the Clearwater RCMP detachment. No detour is available. Crews are asking travellers to avoid the area and plan alternative routes.</p><p>The residents of a nearby house have been evacuated and a shelter-in-place has been enacted by the RCMP for others in the area. Emergency BC has been contacted, and a shelter established, in case an evacuation is needed.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsroom@clearwatertimes.com\">newsroom@clearwatertimes.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 Clearwater Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLETME-news20210617PNT4171028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLETME2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62Y1-CWG1-F0HF-825B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438212</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1055\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

The program aims to help reduce the current decline being experienced across Beach's Western Flank oil fields and extend plateau production from Western Flank gas fields.</p><p>The planned program comprises the drilling of seven wells, including three oil wells and four gas wells. Oil exploration is then planned subject to finalization of drilling targets.</p><p>As reported by Beach, the first well in its drilling program spudded early in their FY22.</p><p>Chu Chua Copper-Gold Project.</p><p>The Company was able to access the Chu Chua property during early July 2021 just prior to the extreme forest fire risk in Central British Columbia in order to conduct a site visit and work as part of the proposed update to the NI43-101 Technical Report.

Accordingly, this prevents the Company from commenting on operating plans going forward.</p><p>As always, the Company recommends that shareholders and potential investors access material information relevant to the Company as released independently by Beach and Santos Ltd in order to keep current during exploration, development and production of all the licenses subject to the Company's GOR.</p><p>The Company currently has 105,579,874 common shares issued and outstanding and approximately $5.2 million in the treasury (comprised of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments), and no debt.</p><p>Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the accuracy or adequacy of this news release.</p><p>Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information</p><p>This news release is intended to provide readers with a reasonable basis for assessing the future performance of the Company.

Experts emphasized the integration of cutting-edge technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), as a critical factor in T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s rising prominence in global wildfire resilience.  Tiago Oliveira, chairperson of the Portuguese Agency for Integrated Rural Fire Management, highlighted the multifaceted challenges climate change poses to forests worldwide. He underscored that warming trends are prolonging fire seasons and increasing the number of days with severe fire conditions.  Oliveira also stressed the indispensable role of local communities living near forests. \u201cWhen people living adjacent to forest areas derive income from these lands, they are more invested in protecting them,\u201d he said. Warning about extreme fire scenarios, Oliveira noted, \u201cWhen difficult conditions triggered by climate change occur, very intense fires begin, making firefighting extremely challenging because water can become ineffective.\u201d  Regarding T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s operational capabilities, Oliveira stated: \u201cT\u00fcrkiye has a high-level capacity in fire detection and intervention. The country has brought together all necessary components to reduce fire incidents and minimize economic losses.\u201d He further highlighted the importance of regional cooperation, saying, \u201cT\u00fcrkiye should enhance cross-border collaboration by sharing firefighting resources with neighboring countries and adopting international standards.\u201d  Johann Georg Goldammer, director of the Global Fire Monitoring Center at Freiburg University, elaborated on the global context. \u201cDeclining village populations mean agricultural lands are less managed, leading to increased flammable material accumulation in forests,\u201d Goldammer said. He explained, \u201cHistorically, these lands were intensively managed through harvesting, active farming, animal husbandry and grazing.\u201d  Goldammer praised T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s investments in advanced firefighting technologies. \u201cT\u00fcrkiye employs highly developed technologies in fire management,\u201d he said. Yet, he emphasized that \u201cfire prevention remains critical, as large amounts of flammable materials exist in forests and surrounding areas.\u201d  On land use, Goldammer concluded, \u201cProper use of soil and land resources can significantly reduce the flammability of forested areas.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58085588442</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H44-PBW3-RVVM-F1B2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Daily Sabah</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"11\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>November 3, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Turkey</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Western Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

The truck was hauling 38,000 litres of gasoline in one tank and 15,000 litres of diesel in the rear tank.</p><p>When crews arrived, they made an attempt to fight the blaze, but as the fire grew with intensity, and with the lack of water supply and inability to sustain an attack, Blackpool Fire Rescue ordered an emergency pull back.</p><p>\"It was unsafe for our crews to remain,\" Chief Mike Savage told The Times.</p><p>Crews retreated 800 metres from the scene. A family home nearby was evacuated, and given sprinkler protection, while three other families in homes near the 800-metre mark were told to shelter in place. Highway 24 was closed to traffic in both directions.</p><p>About 10 minutes after the team was told to retreat, the gasoline tanker blew.</p><p>As anyone who has used gasoline to light a campfire knows, it's not the gasoline itself that ignites the flame \u2014 it's the vapours. The 38,000 litres of gasoline were emitting vapours that are three to four time heavier than air with the ability to travel long distances along the ground.</p><p>The flames from the brakes mixed with the fumes from the gasoline tank, causing an explosion and what's known as a flash.</p><p>\"That flash can basically burn everybody around it,\" said Savage. \"That's why we pulled our crews back because it was getting to that point where it was unsafe, and within 10 minutes of the pull back, she blew. It was 100 feet in the air, huge fireball.\"</p><p>When they were certain the fire wouldn't do anything more than just burn, they opened the highway to single-lane traffic, with a pilot vehicle to ensure there was no risk to responders and also to prevent travellers from slowing down to look or to stop.</p><p>While the highway was closed, however, sirens from an ambulance could be heard travelling towards the scene. While an ambulance is on stand-by for any structural or serious fire, this particular ambulance was travelling from 100 Mile House to Royal Inland Hospital in Kamloops with an emergency patient transfer. Crews were able to get them through the scene safely.</p><p>Savage reminds those watching any emergency scene from afar to not speculate what may be happening. Rumours such as an emergency responder needing medical attention or an ambulance can unnecessarily worry family members, sending panic throughout the community.</p><p>After the blaze had been roaring for most of the day, emergency responders were able to get local drone footage of the truck. This allowed them to see they had an opening for an attack.</p><p>\"The drone footage showed that we had an opening for a tactical advantage to make a second attempt,\" said Savage. \"Based on that on-site intel, we were able to move crews in and hit the fire with a large monitor with foam at distance, cooling the rear tanker trailer and skipping foam into the open flame with the last of the small amount of product.\"</p><p>They extinguished the fire and made it safe enough to move in with hand lines and ground crews and save the rear tanker.</p><p>With the fire out, it's up to the company to dispatch a hazmat team to pump out the diesel, assess the wreckage and take the truck away. They were to do that today (June 14), according to Savage.</p><p>Seventeen firefighters, with two engines, two tender trucks and a bush truck, along with members of the RCMP and BC Ambulance were on scene. The Fire Commissioner's Office and local governments also were notified and BC Wildfire brought in, in the event one or both of the tankers blew and sparked a forest fire. Fortunately, there was minimal wind, allowing the flames and smoke to rise upwards.</p><p>Despite the uncertainty of those on the outside, all emergency crews and the driver of the truck were safe when fire crews officially packed up and left the scene at about 9:00 p.m.</p><p>Savage said that while it was a bit stressful at the start when the fire was unpredictable, the call to bring crews back was good as the blaze did exactly what they had feared.</p><p>\"If the risk isn't reasonable for what you're going to benefit, then get your people out,\" he said. \"That's what we work by. That's our golden rule.\"</p><p>EARLIER:</p><p>Sunday, June 13, 4:13 p.m.: Highway 24 has been opened to single-lane traffic each way, and vehicles are being piloted through the area.</p><p>Emergency crews are still on scene and the fire is not yet under control. Dark smoke can be seen billowing from the hills in Little Fort and along Highway 5.</p><p>The driver of the semi is safe, confirmed Const. Lockwood.</p><p>Video taken by Joey Onley shows thick smoke billowing into the sky, along with sirens in the background. While there is mention of an ambulance in the video, it has not been confirmed that an ambulance arrived at the scene, or if there were any injuries to emergency crews.</p><p>12:30 p.m.: A fuel tanker truck on fire has closed Highway 24 near Little Fort, B.C., according to the RCMP.</p><p>Both the Little Fort and Blackpool fire departments are responding to a fire on Highway 24 and the runaway lane near Cartwright Road, about five kilometres west of Little Fort. The driver of the fuel tanker pulled into the runaway lane after the wheels caught fire. The truck is carrying 53,000 litres of fuel.</p><p>Fire crews have determined the fire is too dangerous at this time to fight the blaze, so they are on scene and monitoring the situation.</p><p>The highway is closed in both directions, confirmed Const. Lockwood of the Clearwater RCMP detachment. No detour is available. Crews are asking travellers to avoid the area and plan alternative routes.</p><p>The residents of a nearby house have been evacuated and a shelter-in-place has been enacted by the RCMP for others in the area. Emergency BC has been contacted, and a shelter established, in case an evacuation is needed.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsroom@clearwatertimes.com\">newsroom@clearwatertimes.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 Clearwater Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLETME-news20210614PNT4171028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLETME2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62XG-5DK1-F0HF-801H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438212</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1055\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Firefighters already battling the blaze in steep, rugged terrain with scorching heat faced more hurdles when hundreds of lightning strikes and winds up to 15 mph (24 kph) pushed the flames uphill.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We set up a containment line at the top of the hills so the fire doesn't spill over to the other side and cause it to spread, but it was obviously difficult given the erratic wind and some other conditions,\" said fire spokesman Jake Miller.</p><p>The Lake Fire was just 12% contained Sunday and has burned nearly 28 square miles (72 square kilometres) of brush and trees. Fire officials said 33 buildings had been destroyed, including at least a dozen homes.</p><p>Temperatures reached more than 110 degrees (43 Celsius) and a pyrocumulus created erratic fire behaviour, fire spokesman Tom Ewald said.</p><p>Thunderstorm and excessive heat were also a concern for firefighters battling a blaze that blackened almost 4 square miles (10 square kilometres) in the foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. The fire, believed to be started Thursday by a homeless man, is only 3% contained.</p><p>Many areas of the state saw triple-digit temperatures through the weekend and the combination of prolonged heat and smoke from wildfires sent ozone pollution to levels not seen in a decade in some areas. Air quality may reach unhealthy to very unhealthy levels in several regions of Southern California on Sunday and Monday afternoons, the South Coast Air Quality Management District said.</p><p>In Northern California, moisture from an offshore tropical storm fueled a thunderstorm that brought nonstop lightning strikes early Sunday, some of which ignited small fires and knocked out power across the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Wind gusts reached 75 mph (121 kph), according to the National Weather Service, which said another round of lightning may develop early Monday.</p><p>\"This is probably the most widespread and violent summer thunderstorm event in memory for Bay Area, &amp; it's also one of the hottest nights in years,\" tweeted Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p>Unsettling weather triggered an unusual warning by the weather service of a fire-induced tornado at an out-of-control forest fire that broke out north of Lake Tahoe on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>A massive fire cloud known as a pyrocumulonimbus formed over the fire, which started east of the town of Loyalton, about 40 miles (64 kilometres) west of Reno, Nevada. When high winds collided with the fire and whipped it into the air, a spectacular tornado-shaped spiral of flames was formed.</p><p>The fire has burned at least 45 square miles (117 square kilometres) and triggered evacuation orders for sparsely populated communities along State Route 395 by the California-Nevada border, said Tahoe National Forest spokesman Joe Flannery.</p><p>Firefighters aided by water-dropping helicopters and air tankers faced \"extreme fire behaviour,\" he said, and worked through the night to extinguish spot fires and protect threatened structures.</p><p>At one point, the fast-moving fire jumped a highway and came dangerously close to a fire truck. A fire crew from Truckee tweeted a video of firefighters dragging hoses as they ran alongside a moving truck that was dodging the flames.</p><p>Ryan Peel said firefighters created some defensive space around his slot machine distribution warehouse in Chilcoot, but he was worried the erratic winds could still put his business in the line of fire.</p><p>\"Yesterday was extremely emotional, as we were at the mercy of the wind and the unpredictability of the fire,\" Peel told The Associated Press. \"I was stressed and terrified at the idea of losing everything I've spent my life working for.\"</p><p>With zero containment and strong winds in the forecast, he said, \"we are not out of the woods yet.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press reporter Haleluya Hadero contributed to this report from Atlanta.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-3b4b774ca68c231cddddb521efa62a60</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M4-DJ41-JBVR-32R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><timeReceived>09:49 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(TSXV GNG ) (OTC Pink: GGTHF) (FSE: GGZ) <br/>Golden Goliath Resources Ltd. has been drilling on the Kwai gold property since July and has now completed holes K21-25 to K21-35. K21-25 to K21-28 tested the area around the anomalous gold value that was returned earlier in drill hole K21-21 on the south side of Beauregard Lake. K21-29 to K21-34 tested IP anomalies on the Pakwash fault east of Beauregard Lake. The final hole in the program, K21-35, tested a mag and structural anomaly with weak IP in an area northwest of Beauregard Lake that is now interpreted to be directly up ice of the high gold in till values returned in early 2020. </p><p><br/>Hole K21-35, which was just completed on October 1, cut multiple zones of brick red potassic alteration associated with brecciation, silicification, hematite and up to 15% disseminated sulfides. This hole was located off the main trend of the Pakwash fault targeting a crosscutting northwest trending magnetic anomaly associated with a weak IP anomaly. Recent geological fieldwork has established a 040 degree ice direction, which is much steeper than previously understood. This places K21-035 directly up ice of the strong gold in till results found on the West Grid. This alteration is very similar to a style of mineralization seen in the Red Lake region, in particular in the Spring Pole deposit area in the north end of the Uchi belt. <br/>There are a number of untested weak IP anomalies beneath conductive overburden that are now potential targets and a large area of the northern part of the property has yet to be surveyed by IP. The original Kwai gold showing is in this area of unexplored terrain. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d3f195df84ab0be2_002full.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d3f195df84ab0be2_002full.jpg</url><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d3f195df84ab0be2_003full.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d3f195df84ab0be2_003full.jpg</url><br/>Figure 1: Red Lake District Properties including the Kwai and SLF properties of Golden Goliath<br/>To view an enhanced version of Figure 1, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d3f195df84ab0be2_003full.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d3f195df84ab0be2_003full.jpg</url>[1] <br/>In July four holes were drilled to follow up on an anomalous gold value of 864 ppb over 1 m in hole K21-21 and these were K21-25 to K21-28, all of which intersected a shear-fault zone on the south side of Beauregard Lake in a feature parallel to and south of the Pakwash Fault. Although no further gold values were encountered in these four holes, a 400-500m long section of the structure with associated IP anomalies has yet to be drill tested. <br/>The area east of Beauregard Lake was tested by holes K21-29 to K21-34 on lines 28E, 30E, 32E, 34E, 39E and 41E. Three other potential gold settings were encountered. Silicified sediments similar to those that occur on the Great Bear Dixie property to the north lie along a basalt contact, and wide albite alteration zones occur in holes 31 and 32. In addition a shear zone in basalt was found in hole K21-34 with disseminated pyrite and lenses of quartz. Assays are pending on these holes. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d3f195df84ab0be2_004full.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d3f195df84ab0be2_004full.jpg</url><br/> Figure2: Kwai Property showing completed drill hole locations <br/>To view an enhanced version of Figure 2, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d3f195df84ab0be2_004full.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d3f195df84ab0be2_004full.jpg</url>[2] <br/>The drill was then moved to an area north of the West Grid on line 6E where hole K21-35 intersected the very interesting zone of potassic alteration, silicification and hematite. A pause in the program will now take place to give time for assays to catch up prior to expanding the coverage of the Kwai project. <br/>Golden Goliath CEO Paul Sorbara PGeo comments:  <br/>\"This drilling project, in such a great area of prospective geology, continues to excite our team as we explore along the Pakwash fault boundary edge of the Uchi Subprovince. We have confidence in the potential of the Kwai property given the number of favourable environments we have identified and, given the recent LP Fault deep drilling success at Great Bear, the fact that all of our drill holes are shallow. Our improved understanding of the geology, ice history, and models of mineralization are focusing our search. I would also like to thank Niigaani drilling, and the Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, and Forestry for ensuring our program could be completed through what was a very difficult forest fire season in the area.\" <br/>QAQC <br/>All the gold values reported in this round of drilling were obtained by fire assaying 30 gm samples. Blank and standards were inserted into the sample stream alternating at 25m intervals. <br/>This news release has been reviewed by R.S.

Darby Morin, 25, from Big River First Nation in northern Saskatchewan, a soldier serving with the U.S. army, was killed when his vehicle rolled over while he was serving in Afghanistan.</p><p>In 2011, federal NDP Leader Jack Layton died after a battle with cancer, just months after leading his party to an unprecedented 103 seats in the May 2 federal election. He was 61. His death came a month after he appeared at a news conference, looking frail and gaunt, to announce he was suffering from a new, unspecified cancer and would temporarily step down as head of the official Opposition. Layton's death touched off an extraordinary outpouring of national grief. People set up makeshift memorials at his Toronto home and constituency office and thousands filed by to pay their respects after Layton's flag-draped coffin was carried into Parliament on Aug. 24 and lay in state for two days.

We do.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What grew here? Can we plant the same species today? Why would we?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The word Toronto is a French derivative of the Huron word \"Tkaranto.\" According to our city's official history - on the City of Toronto website - the meaning of the word is\"where there are trees in water.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The word Etobicoke, according to the Etobicoke Historical Society, was borrowed from the Mississauga First Nations people. The original word was \"wah-do-be-kang,\" which means \"Place where the alders grow.\"</p><p>The hardwood forest that once dominated Southern Ontario included some wonderful, native tree species that lend themselves well to the current landscape.</p><p>If the forest in 1534 were a bag of Licorice Allsorts, the sugar maple would be the licorice - they were the dominant species. They did not grow the tallest (that job was left to the White Pine, the official tree of Ontario) or live the longest (White pine again, and perhaps native oak).</p><p>Today, a sugar maple (Acer saccharum) creates a canopy of cool shade when it is given adequate space. We recommend at least a 10 metres (30 feet) of room for the top of the tree to grow. It matures at about 20 to 30 metres high (60 to 80 ft.) and will live for up to 180 years.</p><p>The native white oak (Quercus alba) and red oak (Quercus rubra) are named for the colour of their wood. They, too, were a dominant species in our boreal forests of what is now the GTA.</p><p>And they still make impressive specimens, growing up to 36 metres (100 feet) tall and thriving for up to as many as 350 years. The oldest tree in Toronto, a red oak, lives on Coral Gables Dr., in north Etobicoke. At 250 years old it is judged by experts to be in excellent health. Given some TLC, it has the potential to live another 150 years. Currently, there is a campaign to save this tree; more on that in a future column.</p><p>The serviceberry (Amelanchier) tree sometimes grows as a tall shrub. They produce a lovely, simple white flower in early spring, followed by edible red berries in July. The berries make great muffins or preserves.</p><p>Or you can do as Mark does, which is nothing, and let the cedar waxwings arrive in a flock and pick the berries while they entertain you. Serviceberry will grow to about 10 metres (30 feet). It tolerates moderate shade and lends itself to pruning. Which is pretty forgiving for a native species tree that, for countless generations, was never pruned.</p><p>Alders (Alnus) are native to Ontario: the green alder (Alnus viridis) - also called mountain alder - and the speckled alder (Alnus incana)</p><p>We think everyone in Etobicoke who can should grow at least one. Best known in horticultural circles for the unique production of nitrogen bacterium, alders are referred to broadly as a \"pioneer species\" since they improve the soil as they grow. For this reason, they dominate new forests after a forest fire.</p><p>Tolerant of water and drought, alders mature at about 18 metres (59 feet). When you shop for an alder, make sure you are not planting a European species as some are invasive. Alders are in the birch family and therefore not long lived, though they will produce a great landscape specimen for 50 to 60 years.</p><p>The native birch (Betula) is a special species. Not only does the white bark stand out all year long, it grows fast and tolerates both drought and moisture. Like all fast-growing trees, it has a useful life of 40 or 50 years. Note that the bronze birch borer, which devastated so many urban birch trees in the 1970s and '80s, favours the European species. Avoid these insects' devastating effects by planting a native birch.</p><p>When we focus on the successful forest that grew nearly 500 years ago, we find that many of the species still thrive here. With some help from us, they still can.</p><p>Mark and Ben Cullen are expert gardeners and contributors for</p><p>the Star.

As the coronavirus ravaged the U.S., the then-vice president praised the administration\u2019s response. And after a violent mob threatened his life during an attack on the U.S. Capitol, Pence rejected entreaties to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.</p><p>But after years of being a subservient sidekick, Pence is beginning to distance himself from Trump as he takes increasingly overt steps toward a White House bid of his own.</p><p>Last month, Pence called out Trump by name, saying his former boss was \u201cwrong\u201d to insist that he had the power to unilaterally overturn the results of the 2020 election \u2014 a power vice presidents do not possess. In a separate speech before top Republican donors, Pence urged the GOP to move on from Trump's 2020 grievances and declared \u201cthere is no room in this party for apologists\" for Vladimir Putin after Trump praised the Russian leader's maneuvering as \u201cgenius\" before his brutal invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>The moves show how Pence, a former congressman and Indiana governor, is working to craft a political identity independent of his former boss. The strategy carries substantial risk in a party still dominated by Trump and his lie that the 2020 election was stolen. But if Pence successfully navigates this moment, it could offer a model for Republicans to benefit from their work with Trump without being tied to his most toxic behavior, which has consistently hurt the party with crucial suburban voters who often determine elections. </p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the role of vice president, there\u2019s certain opportunities that affords and certainly certain constraints,\u201d Marc Short, who served as Pence\u2019s chief of staff at the White House, said of Pence's recent moves. \u201cYou sort of assume a different identity for those four years because your job is to support the president and what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Chinese airliner crashes with 132 aboard in country's south</p><p>BEIJING (AP) \u2014 A China Eastern Boeing 737-800 with 132 people on board crashed in a remote mountainous area of southern China on Monday, officials said, setting off a forest fire visible from space in the country\u2019s worst air disaster in nearly a decade.</p><p>More than 12 hours after communication was lost with the plane, there was still no word of survivors.</p><p>The Civil Aviation Administration of China said in a statement that the crash occurred near the city of Wuzhou in the Guangxi region. The flight was traveling from Kunming in the southwestern province of Yunnan to the industrial center of Guangzhou along the east coast, it added.</p><p>China Eastern flight 5735 had been traveling 455 knots (523 mph, 842 kph) at around 30,000 feet when it entered a steep dive around 2:20 p.m. local time, according to data from flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com. The plane stopped transmitting data 96 seconds later.</p><p>Local villagers were first to arrive at the forested area where the plane went down and sparked a blaze big enough to be seen on NASA satellite images. Hundreds of rescue workers were swiftly dispatched from Guangxi and neighboring Guangdong province.</p><p>___</p><p>Alaska Rep. Don Young to lie in state at US Capitol</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Rep. Don Young, the longest-serving Republican in House history, will lie in state in the U.S. Capitol on March 29, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Monday.</p><p>Young's office announced the congressman's death in a statement Friday night. He was 88.</p><p>Young, who was first elected to the House in 1973, was known for his brusque style and for bringing federal investment to the state. He was elected in 2020 to serve his 25th term as Alaska\u2019s only member. </p><p>Pelosi's office said a formal ceremony will be held with the Young family, which will be open to invited guests. Following the memorial service, there will be viewing open to members of Congress. Lying in state is an honor traditionally bestowed upon American political and military leaders. Young will lie in state in National Statuary Hall. </p><p>Pelosi had said after Young's passing that he was an \u201cinstitution\" in Congress. </p><p>___</p><p>Ukrainian refugees speak of bombs, half-empty cities, hunger</p><p>MEDYKA, Poland (AP) \u2014 Yulia Bondarieva spent 10 days in a basement as Russian planes flew over and bombs were falling on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. Having reached safety in Poland, Bondarieva's only wish now is for her twin sister in the besieged city of Mariupol to get out, too. </p><p>\u201cThey have been in the basement since Feb. 24, they have not been out at all,\u201d Bondarieva said. \u201cThey are running out of food and water.\u201d</p><p>Bondarieva managed to speak to her sister on the phone recently. The fear of what will happen to her in the encircled and bombed-out city that is going through some of the worst fighting in the war has been overwhelming. </p><p>\u201cShe does not know how to leave the city,\u201d the 24-year-old said after arriving in the Polish border town of Medyka. </p><p>Mariupol authorities have said only about 10% of the city\u2019s population of 430,000 has managed to flee over the past week.

Our fully-funded Phase 2 drill program is currently underway and our initial target will be the South Zone where we plan to test additional interpreted structural trends near surface where there are gaps in the current drill pattern. Additional holes targeting the Main Zone are planned but drilling the near-surface mineralization at the South Zone is our initial Phase 2 target.

Geo., and a Director of Satori, states \"The Phase One drill confirmed our model that the Main Zone continued uninterrupted to depth with grades that are consistent with historical drilling, ranging between 5 to 10 g/t. The highest single assay result returned in the Phase One program was 24.24 g/t Au over 1.15m in TLMZ21-01. We successfully extended the Main Zone over 200 metres down plunge across an interpreted 200 metre strike length. Our Phase 2 program at the South Zone will test gaps in the historical drill pattern along interpreted trends identified in the historical data, a similar approach to what was interpreted along the Main Zone. The initial drill holes are planned within 300 metres of surface.\"</p><p>Figure 1.0 - Main Zone Longitudinal View</p><p>SAMPLING, QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL</p><p>All diamond drill holes are NQ diameter (47.6 mm). Drill core is delivered to a secure logging facility at site where it is photographed, logged for geotechnical and geological data and marked up for splitting. Most samples are collected on 1.0 metre intervals, honouring litho-structural contacts with a minimum sample length of 0.3 metres and a maximum sample length of 1.5 metres. All logging, sampling and splitting is performed under the supervision of the P.Geo. managing the drill program. After logging and sample mark up, the core is split with one half of the core sent for analysis and the remaining half stored at site for future reference. Certified Reference Materials and Blanks are inserted into the sample stream at a rate of one blank and one certified standard for every twenty samples.</p><p>Samples are shipped in sealed containers to TSL Laboratories in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan for analyses. All samples are analyzed for gold using a 30 gram lead collection fire assay fusion with an atomic adsorption finish. In addition, samples are assayed using a 36 element multi-acid ICP-ES analysis method. Samples corresponding with any observed visible gold during logging are flagged for Metallic Screen analysis, as are any samples assaying greater than 5.0 g/t Au. All Quality Control results, including the laboratory's own control samples, are evaluated before public release.</p><p>Wes Hanson P.Geo., Director of Satori, is the qualified person who has reviewed and approved the contents of this press release.</p><p>ABOUT SATORI RESOURCES INC.

We do.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What grew here? Can we plant the same species today? Why would we?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The word Toronto is a French derivative of the Huron word \"Tkaranto.\" According to our city's official history - on the City of Toronto website - the meaning of the word is \"where there are trees in water.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The word Etobicoke was borrowed from the Mississauga First Nations people. The original word was \"wah-do-be-kang,\" which means \"Place where the alders grow.\"</p><p>.</p><p>The hardwood forest that once dominated Southern Ontario included some wonderful, native tree species that lend themselves well to the current landscape.</p><p>If the forest in 1534 were a bag of Licorice Allsorts, the sugar maple would be the licorice - they were the dominant species. They did not grow the tallest (that job was left to the White Pine, the official tree of Ontario) or live the longest (White pine again, and perhaps native oak).</p><p>Today, a sugar maple (Acer saccharum) creates a canopy of cool shade when it is given adequate space. We recommend at least a 10 metres (30 feet) of room for the top of the tree to grow. It matures at about 20 to 30 metres high (60 to 80 ft.) and will live for up to 180 years.</p><p>The native white oak (Quercus alba) and red oak (Quercus rubra) are named for the colour of their wood. They, too, were a dominant species in our boreal forests of what is now the GTA.</p><p>And they still make impressive specimens, growing up to 36 metres (100 ft.) tall and thriving for up to as many as 350 years. The oldest tree in Toronto, a red oak, lives on Coral Gables Dr., in north Etobicoke. At 250 years old it is judged by experts to be in excellent health. Given some TLC, it has the potential to live another 150 years. Currently, there is a campaign to save this tree; more on that in a future column.</p><p>The serviceberry (Amelanchier) tree sometimes grows as a tall shrub. They produce a lovely, simple white flower in early spring, followed by edible red berries in July. The berries make great muffins or preserves.</p><p>Or you can do as Mark does, which is nothing, and let the cedar waxwings arrive in a flock and pick the berries while they entertain you. Serviceberry will grow to about 10 metres (30 ft.). It tolerates moderate shade and lends itself to pruning. Which is pretty forgiving for a native species tree that, for countless generations, was never pruned.</p><p>Alders (Alnus) are native to Ontario: the green alder (Alnus viridis) - also called mountain alder - and the speckled alder (Alnus incana)</p><p>We think everyone in Etobicoke who can should grow at least one. Best known in horticultural circles for the unique production of nitrogen bacterium, alders are referred to broadly as a \"pioneer species\" since they improve the soil as they grow. For this reason, they dominate new forests after a forest fire.</p><p>Tolerant of water and drought, alders mature at about 18 metres. When you shop for an alder, make sure you are not planting a European species as some are invasive. Alders are in the birch family and therefore not long lived, though they will produce a great landscape specimen for 50 to 60 years.</p><p>The native birch (Betula) is a special species. Not only does the white bark stand out all year long, it grows fast and tolerates both drought and moisture. Like all fast-growing trees, it has a useful life of 40 or 50 years. Note that the bronze birch borer, which devastated so many urban birch trees in the 1970s and '80s, favours the European species. Avoid these insects' devastating effects by planting a native birch.</p><p>When we focus on the successful forest that grew nearly 500 years ago, we find that many of the species still thrive here. With some help from us, they still can.</p><p>Mark and Ben Cullen are expert gardeners and contributors for the Star.

Vixen consists of three sub-projects totaling 10,614 hectares (26,227 acres), Vixen North, Vixen South and Vixen West, located within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt approximately 60 kilometres (37 miles) east of Red Lake, Ontario.  </p><p><br/>Vixen North Exploration Permit <br/>In the fall of 2020, ALX completed a high-resolution helicopter-borne magnetic and VLF-EM survey totaling 475.7 line-kilometres to over a known 3,000 metre-long high magnetic trend and other important structural trends present at Vixen North. Drill targets were subsequently defined by the integration of the airborne survey results with the geochemical results of site visits carried out in 2019 and 2020 (see ALX news release dated October 29, 2020[1]), which led to the filing of an exploration permit application for Vixen North.  <br/>In late June 2021, following a positive engagement with local First Nations, ALX received an exploration permit from the Ontario Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines (the \"Permit\"). The Permit allows for diamond drilling at up to ten locations at Vixen North totaling approximately 1,000 metres (3,280 feet), and is effective until June 28, 2024. The drilling program is designed to be helicopter-supported with a start date to be determined, due to the continuing forest fire emergency and the resulting moratorium on exploration activities in the Red Lake Mining District. <br/>Vixen South Claims Acquisition <br/>In early May 2021, ALX executed an option-to-purchase agreement with arm's-length vendors (the \"Vendors\") to purchase a 100% interest in a group of claims west of Grace Lake, consisting of nineteen claim units and a single patented claim (the \"Claims\", see ALX news release dated May 12, 2021[2]). The Claims comprise approximately 384 hectares (949 acres) and are located along the northern edge of the Vixen South claim block.  <br/>ALX carried out due diligence on the Claims, which included a site visit in late June 2021 before forest fires effectively closed off access to the Vixen South area. In August 2021, ALX decided to exercise its right to purchase a 100% interest in the Claims in exchange for a total of $40,000 cash and 500,000 common shares of ALX. The Claims remain subject to a 2.5% net smelter returns royalty (\"NSR\") in favour of the Vendors, which can be purchased in its entirety by ALX for $2.5 million. This transaction is subject to the acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange. <br/>Click here for maps and photos of the Vixen Gold Project[3] <br/>National Instrument 43-101 Disclosure  <br/>The technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Jody Dahrouge, P.Geo., a Director of ALX, who is a Qualified Person in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101.  <br/>About ALX<br/>ALX is based in Vancouver, BC, Canada and its common shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol \"AL\", on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol \"6LLN\" and in the United States OTC market under the symbol \"ALXEF\".

Forward-looking statements in this news release include references to ALX's exploration projects, prospective for minerals, and the Company's plans to undertake exploration activities at its projects. It is important to note that the Company's actual business outcomes and exploration results could differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include that ALX may not be able to fully finance exploration at its projects, including drilling; our initial findings at its projects may prove to be unworthy of further expenditure; commodity prices may not support exploration expenditures at its projects; and economic, competitive, governmental, public health, environmental and technological factors may affect the Company's operations, markets, products and share price. Even if we explore and develop our projects, and even if gold or other metals or minerals are discovered in quantity, the project may not be commercially viable.

(\"First Mining\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to report that, further to the Company's news release on July 5, 2021, the forest fire currently active near the Company's Springpole Gold Project (\"Springpole\" or the \"Project\") has now been classified as \"Under Control\" by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (\"MNRF\"). Through the efforts of the MNRF firefighters and the First Mining team, the fire did not cause any damage to the infrastructure or equipment at Springpole. Since July 21, 2021, the MNRF has had an Emergency Area Order in place covering a large region of northwest Ontario which restricts or prohibits certain mineral exploration activities deemed to be a fire risk and which has limited First Mining's ability to continue drill programs and other work outside of the Springpole camp. First Mining anticipates resuming this work once the Emergency Area Order has been lifted.</p><p>First Mining's staff and consultants have remobilized to Springpole over the past week and are continuing limited work related to environmental data collection, geological logging and sampling work, as well as maintenance work on drills and equipment on site, whilst remaining in full compliance with the MNRF Emergency Area Order regarding restricted or prohibited activities.</p><p>First Mining expects to receive more guidance from the MNRF on timing to resume field work in the coming weeks and anticipates some delays to the current work programs. First Mining will provide an update on the progress of technical and environmental work at Springpole, along with further details related to regional exploration plans, once it is able to resume field work at Springpole.</p><p>About First Mining Gold Corp.</p><p>First Mining is a Canadian gold developer focused on the development and permitting of the Springpole Gold Project in northwestern Ontario. Springpole is one of the largest undeveloped gold projects in Canada. The results of a positive Pre-Feasibility Study for the Springpole Gold Project were announced by First Mining in January 2021, and permitting activities are on-going with submission of an Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") for the project targeted for 2021. The Company also holds a large equity position in Treasury Metals Inc. who are advancing the Goliath Gold Complex toward construction. First Mining's portfolio of gold projects in eastern Canada also includes the Pickle Crow (being advanced in partnership with Auteco Minerals Ltd.), Hope Brook (being advanced in partnership with Big Ridge Gold Corp.), Cameron, Duparquet, Duquesne, and Pitt gold projects.</p><p>First Mining was established in 2015 by Mr. Keith Neumeyer, founding President and CEO of First Majestic Silver Corp.</p><p>ON BEHALF OF FIRST MINING GOLD CORP.</p><p>Daniel W.

These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this news release.

All forward-looking statements are based on First Mining's or its consultants' current beliefs as well as various assumptions made by them and information currently available to them. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Forward-looking statements reflect the beliefs, opinions and projections on the date the statements are made and are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by the respective parties, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties and contingencies. Such factors include, without limitation the Company's business, operations and financial condition potentially being materially adversely affected by the outbreak of epidemics, pandemics or other health crises, such as COVID-19, and by reactions by government and private actors to such outbreaks; risks to employee health and safety as a result of the outbreak of epidemics, pandemics or other health crises, such as COVID-19, that may result in a slowdown or temporary suspension of operations at some or all of the Company's mineral properties as well as its head office; fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, silver, base metals or certain other commodities; fluctuations in the currency markets (such as the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar); changes in national and local government, legislation, taxation, controls, regulations and political or economic developments; risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining (including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins and flooding); the presence of laws and regulations that may impose restrictions on mining; employee relations; relationships with and claims by local communities, indigenous populations and other stakeholders; availability and increasing costs associated with mining inputs and labour; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; title to properties; and the additional risks described in the Company's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities under the Company's SEDAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>, and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 40-F filed with the SEC on EDGAR.</p><p>First Mining cautions that the foregoing list of factors that may affect future results is not exhaustive. When relying on our forward-looking statements to make decisions with respect to First Mining, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. First Mining does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by the Company or on our behalf, except as required by law.

Smoke taint refers to the undesirable ashy, smoky aroma of wines produced from grapes exposed to wildfire smoke while ripening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">British Columbia has already surpassed the 10-year average for number of forest fires and total hectares burned. Many of these fires are near the Okanagan Valley, an important Canadian wine-producing region. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As wildfires continue to edge closer to towns and agricultural areas, grape producers and wine makers in the Okanagan must once again deal with this increasingly frequent threat.</p><p>As an analytical chemist, I have been studying how wildfire smoke leaves a chemical signature in grapes, and researching ways in which we can prevent smoke taint from affecting wine produced in areas subject to these forest fires.</p><p>Smoke taint: A stealthy threat</p><p>Many may have noticed how the aroma of wood smoke, say from a camp fire, permeates clothing or hair, or how smoking a salmon imparts a delightful aroma to the meat. Smoke does not taint wines in the same way. </p><p>Wine grapes readily absorb the compounds responsible for smoky aromas, but once inside the grape, they are almost immediately transformed by enzymes into forms that cannot be perceived by smell or taste. The problem is, the yeasts used for wine fermentation are able to regenerate the original smoky aromas. </p><p>Smoke poses a massive threat to B.C.\u2019s wine industry. Most tainted wines smell bad and are unsellable. What\u2019s worse is that these horrid odours usually remain undetected until after wineries have invested money and effort to harvest and ferment tonnes of grapes that may smell perfectly fine. </p><p>The economic impact of smoke taint is hard to pin down exactly, but it may be severe. For example, the Australian wine industry has recorded losses of up to 300 million Australian dollars (the equivalent of C$276 million) due to bushfire smoke. In B.C., while some smoke-tainted wines may be sold as novelty items, the vast majority of it is simply undrinkable and must be thrown away. </p><p>The chemistry of smoke taint</p><p>The aroma of smoke is due in large part to a class of compounds known as volatile phenols. Volatile phenols readily evaporate at reasonably low temperatures, meaning they can be easily smelled. Some volatile phenols are so pungent, they can be detected by smell at concentrations in the low part-per-billion range, which is roughly equivalent to mixing a teaspoon into an Olympic-sized swimming pool. </p><p>When volatile phenols enter either ripening grapes or their leaves, they are almost immediately detoxified through a process is generally known as glycosylation, where volatile phenols are chemically linked to simple carbohydrate molecules like glucose. </p><p>The volatile phenolic-glycosides produced in this process are not volatile, and lack an aroma. Some evidence shows that they are metabolized by bacteria in people\u2019s mouths, contributing to the perception of smoke taint up the back of the throat or mouth that steadily begins to intensify after a second or third sip of wine. </p><p>But the really big problem occurs when the yeast used to ferment the grapes break down the volatile phenolic-glycosides. This regenerates smoky aromas in grapes that smelled perfectly fine. Interestingly, grapevine smoke exposure does not always lead to a tainted wine. Sometimes desirable levels of volatile phenols are leached into wines aged in oak barrels. My colleagues and I have used sensitive analytical instruments to unravel these chemical mysteries. </p><p>Can smoke taint be detected before grapes are harvested?</p><p>Since 2015, students in my laboratory at the University of British Columbia\u2019s Okanagan campus, in Kelowna, have been spearheading Canadian research on smoke taint. </p><p>Prior to this, the bulk of the research on smoke taint had been performed by Australian researchers. While Australia, like B.C., faces frequent wildfires, we reasoned that the differences in fuel sources, which would influence the types of specific volatile phenols present in smoke, and grape growing conditions would mean that chemical evidence of smoke taint in wine grapes would be unique for each region. </p><p>We devised a method to carefully simulate the effects a forest fire on B.C. vineyards, using ponderosa pine needles, bark and local soil organic matter as our fuel source.</p><p>We reasoned that by boiling grape juice in hydrochloric acid and chemically mimicking the yeast-induced transformations of volatile phenolic-glycosides that occur during wine-making, we would be able to rapidly predict the concentration levels of volatile phenols after fermentation.</p><p>Our research showed that smoke-derived volatile phenols enter grapes and are transformed into non-volatile forms in under one hour. We know that these smoke-derived volatile phenols are actually transformed by grapes since they are detectable only after fermentation or boiling in acid. But, interestingly, they are not detectable solely as glycosides. </p><p>Identifying how grapes chemically trap volatile phenols will help winemakers devise methods to remove them from grape juice or wine. This identification is also important because yeasts are able to release the free, smelly  volatile phenols from these still unidentified forms. </p><p>An ounce of prevention</p><p>While efforts to identify how grapes chemically alter volatile phenols are ongoing, we have begun to use our tools and methods to focus on preventing smoke taint directly in the vineyard. </p><p>A preliminary screening of three approved agricultural sprays revealed one product, intended for use on cherries, significantly reduced concentrations of volatile phenols in smoke-exposed grapes at harvest. But, after a follow-up study at three Okanagan vineyards failed to replicate these effects, our search continues.</p><p>We have discovered, however, that red table grapes, available year-round in Canadian grocery stores, mimic the transformations of volatile phenols observed in on-the-vine wine grapes. This discovery means that we will be able to perform initial screens of dozens of variables and products in the lab, unconstrained by the Canadian grape-growing season. </p><p>In the meantime, Okanagan vineyards and wineries have to carefully evaluate their crops, monitoring for volatile phenols, sugar-coated or otherwise.</p><p>___</p><p>Wesley Zandberg receives funding from the Natural Sciences and Engingeering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), the BC Wine Grape Council (BCWGC), the Canadian Glycomics Network, (Collaborative Team Grant) and The University of British Columbia (in the form of an Eminence Fund Grant).

Power was cut to 2000 homes.</p><p>The storm also continued to batter other parts of Europe. Falled trees blocked roads and train tracks in southern Germany and Austria.</p><p>The Austrian city of Salzburg near the German border was hit by the storm Tuesday. Public broadcaster ORF reported that more than 400 firefighters worked for hours to remove downed trees from crushed cars and roads. They also had to remove a huge metal roof that was blown off a building. No one was injured, ORF reported.</p><p>German railroad operator Deutsche Bahn, which had shut down all long-distance trains on Monday, said most of its service resumed Tuesday with the exception of some trains in southern regions that were still being battered by gusty winds. Schools across Germany reopened.</p><p>Deaths due to the fierce storm were reported in Poland, Sweden, Britain, Slovenia, Germany and the Czech Republic. On Tuesday, Polish officials reported a third storm-related death in the country, saying a relative of two people killed Monday when the roof of the ski rental building collapsed also died.</p><p>In northern Bavaria, where a gust of over 160 kph (100 mph) was recorded, the storm produced a record amount of electricity being fed into the German grid from wind turbines, equivalent to almost 44 nuclear power plants.</p><p>The German Weather Service said strong winds would keep blasting much of the country on Tuesday but the brunt of the storm had moved to the southeast. In northeastern Germany, a new storm was expected to reach the Baltic coast. The German Weather Service also forecast heavy rains for most of the country as well as for France and Belgium.</p><p>In England and Scotland, the Met Office national weather agency still had 85 flood warnings in force as torrential rains caused numerous rivers to overflow their banks.</p><p>Further north, in Norway, water from the North Sea overflowed harbours and entered houses along the country's southern coast, causing damage but no victims. Local airline Wideroe cancelled 21 departures because low pressure over northern Norway meant its small planes couldn't fly, the Norwegian news agency NTB reported. The low pressure was affecting the altitude gauges on the planes with no possibility to adjust for the low pressure.</p><p>In the Czech Republic, more than 40,000 households remained without electricity Tuesday morning, down from some 300,000 on Monday afternoon. Around 20 train routes were still blocked because of fallen trees on the track. Only one flight from Amsterdam was cancelled Tuesday, Prague's international airport said.</p><p>___</p><p>John Leicester in Paris; Vanessa Gera in Warsaw, Poland; Karl Janicek in Prague; and Jan M.

When they get washed out or (there's) a forest fire or fuel spill, they get shut down,\" he said, adding grocery stores rely on frequent deliveries from the south.</p><p>Yukon's agriculture director, Matt Ball, said the territory of 36,000 people is a small market, but demand for local food outstrips supply and the pandemic prompted people to think about food security.</p><p>\"We hardly saw a disruption in our supply out here of national products. But nonetheless, that reinforced the message that we should really be looking locally,\" he said in an interview.</p><p>Strengthening food security in Yukon is a multi-layered task, said Gray, from developing backyard gardens to larger commercial operations with enough local processing and inspection capacity.</p><p>The large grocery chains in Yukon have well-established supply agreements and inspection protocols that make it difficult for smaller producers to get their products onto those shelves, he said.</p><p>Yukon's first territorially inspected poultry processing facility opened this summer and Gray said an additional red meat abattoir spurred him to scale up his own pork operation in recent years.</p><p>\"It was just one piece of infrastructure that was introduced to suddenly change the game,\" Gray said. </p><p>Just outside Whitehorse, Bart Bounds said it was unusually challenging to get seeds for his certified organic vegetable farm as more people tried gardening this spring.</p><p>Bounds said he would like to see local seed banks, breeding programs for livestock and a certified organic grain producer in the territory. While food may be produced locally, he said, many common seeds, animal feeds, fertilizers and pesticides are imported.</p><p>Gray is also the CEO of North Star Agriculture, a company that helps Yukoners build and manage their own farms, from feasibility studies to implementing new technologies.</p><p>For example, he said, North Star has worked on a vertical hydroponic farm operation that's heated with geothermal energy, which means vegetables can be grown year round.</p><p>Energy supply can make or break an agriculture endeavour in the territory, where the growing season is limited and subject to increasingly erratic weather patterns, Gray noted.</p><p>North Star is also working with the Na-Cho Nyak Dun First Nation to develop a 130-hectare farm about an hour outside Dawson City and 80 kilometres from the nation located in Mayo.</p><p>Elected chief Simon Mervyn said the nation has around 600 members, about 100 of whom live near the farm, and they supported the purchase with a community resolution last year.</p><p>The effects of climate change on food that comes from both Yukon and abroad were top of mind, said Mervyn, noting warmer temperatures are driving moose and other game farther north.</p><p>Their property already has an abattoir, stables, cultivated fields, wells and a greenhouse, and Mervyn's said his goal is to share and collaborate with other First Nations in the territory.</p><p>\"We're hoping that together we can really create an industry that would be self-sustaining and maybe marketable as years go by.\"</p><p>At the same time, Mervyn said the farm is an opportunity to blend food security and sustainability with land-based healing and education for community members.</p><p>\"It's going to take a lot of planning. It's going to take good infrastructure. But, you know, it's just indicative of what we have to do together, collectively, as Indian people in Yukon.\"</p><p>As Yukon's local food business develops, Gray said there's potential to start exporting food products to Alaska or southern Canada, as trucks often leave the territory empty.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 26, 2020.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-1e1c7b14ff41446a994a330fa2682d04</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FF-2FF1-JBVR-341G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><timeReceived>04:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 26, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The colours of the bike represent the colours of the BC Cancer Agency, and the statue is a testament to the feat of strength that is the Ride to Conquer Cancer.</p><p>It's title is simply: I Conquered It!</p><p>Last year, on Aug. 25, more than 2,100 Ride to Conquer Cancer cyclists from across the province rode into Hope - a journey consisting of approximately 200 km of cycling over the course of two days, beginning in Cloverdale with an overnight in Chilliwack. It marked the first time that the journey finished in Hope. While it was destined to finish in Hope for the first time in 2018, the forest fire on Highway #7 forced changes to the route.</p><p>While the ride may be new to Hope, it has a long history of supporting cancer research and cancer patients alike.</p><p>Each year, money raised from the Ride to Conquer Cancer goes to the BC Cancer Foundation with an incredible $9.1 million was raised in 2019 alone.</p><p>In Hope in 2019, riders were greeted at the finish by an impressive chainsaw carving depicting a jubilant cyclist with bike held in the air. The statue has now been moved into its permanent location. An unveiling was held on Wednesday afternoon in the rain.</p><p>The statue, which stands at approximately 15 feet and is located at the Hope Recreation Centre, was commissioned by a long-time supporter of the BC Cancer Foundation, William McCarthy. He was at the unveiling with his son John, and explained that their family hopes the carving brings awareness to the fact that \"cancer is everyone's fight.\"</p><p>It was carved by renowned professional chainsaw carver, Ryan Cook of Vancouver. Cook carves full time and competes internationally, including at the biennial Hope Chainsaw Carving Competition. McCarthy, an avid collector of chainsaw carvings and frequent visitor to Hope, said he called Cook with his vision, and the rest came together. The statue is officially sponsored by his family, McCarthy Properties.</p><p>The unveiling was a timely one, as it is just days before World Cancer Day on Feb. 4. The unveiling included Mayor Peter Robb, the senior director of the Ride to Conquer Cancer from the BC Cancer Foundation, Lindsay Carswell, Shannon Jones, executive director of AdvantageHOPE, and several local Ride to Conquer Cancer participants.</p><p>As the rain poured down, Carswell noted that the statue will be there in all of Hope's weather, and that in itself is a symbol of the feat that riders go through on the tour and in training, and that cancer patients go through in their own journeys.</p><p>Its plaque states: Whenever you find yourself doubting how far you can go, just remember how far you have come.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Do you have something to add to this story, or something else we should report on?

Twenty-two people \u2014 including a pregnant woman \u2014 were killed in the 13 hours of shootings and house burnings that began in Portapique, N.S., and carried on in several other communities the next morning. Over the past year, a provincial court judge has been gradually releasing portions of witness statements used by police to obtain search warrants, with the latest disclosure on Wednesday evening. In one of the court documents released, Ontario lawyer Kevin Von Bargen told police he was a friend of Gabriel Wortman\u2019s and that shortly after the pandemic started in Nova Scotia, the killer became \u201cconvinced that the world economy was going to collapse.\u201d The documents refer to an email Wortman sent Von Bargen on March 18, exactly one month before he began his rampage. As described by police in a document to obtain a warrant, the killer told Von Bargen he was \u201cgetting a bunch of ammunition because when the government stops handing out money people will be desperate and will start to steal, rob and pilfer from people.\u201d Wortman told his friend \u201cit was going to be worse than the depression because there was no way to stop the sickness (COVID-19) and it was like a forest fire,\u201d the document says. </p><p>In a summary of a March 19 email to an unnamed person, the gunman is quoted as writing, \u201cThank God we are well armed.\u201d Wortman\u2019s spouse, Lisa Banfield, even told police that the killer had bought up large quantities of rice and other food. She said he was \u201cparanoid\u201d that the federal government was going to seize people\u2019s money in exchange for shares of some sort. As previous releases of witness statements have revealed, during the weeks before the mass killing, the murderer turned his investments into cash and purchased over $800 worth of gasoline and propane. After the killings, police would find $705,000 wrapped in tin foil packages inside an ammunition can at one of the gunman\u2019s Portapique properties, the documents say. Some were noticing the killer\u2019s behaviour in those final weeks, the court records suggest. After the killer pulled up at a Brinks Canada office in Halifax on March 20, 2020 to pick up $475,000 in cash \u2014 driving one of the Ford Taurus vehicles he\u2019d purchased from the federal government \u2014 a Brinks employee noted it looked like a police car and found it odd that the reflective tape was still on the vehicle. In addition, a person whose name is blanked out told police on April 19 last year that the killer \u201cordered large amounts of ammunition within the past month and picked it up at (name redacted).\u201d Police have charged Ban-field, her brother James Banfield and her brother-in-law Brian Brewster with unlawfully supplying ammunition to the killer in the month before the mass shooting. All three are pleading not guilty, and police have said they \u201chad no prior knowledge\u201d of Wortman\u2019s intentions. Not all of Wortman\u2019s shifts in behaviour appear to have been driven by the pandemic, according to witness statements to police. For example, Von Bargen said in the year before the shooting, \u201c(the gunman) switched from being obsessed with vintage Honda motorcycles to police cars and was buying the cars off a (federal) government surplus website.\u201d The killer would carry out his shootings while disguised as an RCMP officer and driving a replica patrol car. The court documents contain records of the killer\u2019s PayPal purchases of gear he would use to create a replica RCMP vehicle, extending back to March 22, 2019. Websites bookmarked on the killer\u2019s computer included information about some of the police car components he was buying and \u201c11 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Cop Cars.\u201d During the summer of 2019, Wortman described to Banfield how he had attached a bumper ram onto the police car he\u2019d bought from the federal government surplus store. Meanwhile, the killer\u2019s interest in guns, particularly his two semi-automatic rifles, was evident. Previous releases have indicated Wortman acquired the rifles illegally, one from a person he knew in Houlton, Maine, and the other through the estate of a deceased friend in Fredericton. The newly released documents say his computer bookmarks include sites with information about the Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic rifle and the Colt C7 semi-automatic rifle. In addition, there is a note saying that on June 24, 2019, Wortman attended the non-restricted firearms course and completed it. However, police have stated that the killer didn\u2019t actually possess any licence to own firearms. When Wortman was killed by police on the morning of April 19 at a gas station in Enfield, N.S., he still had a large supply of ammunition on hand \u2014 as he possibly prepared to carry on to Halifax. According to statements by police firearms investigators, his Glock .40 calibre, semi-automatic pistol, with a laser pointer sighting grip, was on the front seat and it was loaded with an over-capacity magazine. To his immediate right there was a cardboard box with ammunition and a metal can containing more loaded ammunition magazines. Two rifles were lying in the back seat, including the Colt semi-automatic, with three loaded, over-capacity magazines, each with up to 30 rounds. The second semi-automatic rifle, the Ruger Mini 14, also had an over-capacity magazine designed to hold 40 rounds of .223 calibre bullets, and there were three more magazines ready to load \u2014 two of them over-capacity ones that could hold 40 rounds. There was also a Ruger P89, semi-automatic pistol, with an empty magazine in it and one round in the chamber, and he had the Smith and Wesson firearm belonging to RCMP Const.

As described by police in a document to obtain a warrant, the killer told Von Bargen he was \"getting a bunch of ammunition because when the government stops handing out money people will be desperate and will start to steal, rob and pilfer from people.\"</p><p>Wortman told his friend \"it was going to be worse than the depression because there was no way to stop the sickness (COVID-19) and it was like a forest fire,\" the document says. In a summary of a March 19 email to an unnamed person, the gunman is quoted as writing, \"Thank God we are well armed.\"</p><p>Wortman's spouse, Lisa Banfield, even told police that the killer had bought up large quantities of rice and other food. She said he was \"paranoid\" that the federal government was going to seize people's money in exchange for shares of some sort.</p><p>As previous releases of witness statements have revealed, during the weeks before the mass killing, the murderer turned his investments into cash and purchased over $800 worth of gasoline and propane. After the killings, police would find $705,000 wrapped in tin foil packages inside an ammunition can at one of the gunman's Portapique properties, the documents say.</p><p>Some were noticing the killer's behaviour in those final weeks, the court records suggest. </p><p>After the killer pulled up at a Brinks Canada office in Halifax on March 20, 2020 to pick up $475,000 in cash \u2014 driving one of the Ford Taurus vehicles he'd purchased from the federal government \u2014 a Brinks employee noted it looked like a police car and found it odd that the reflective tape was still on the vehicle.</p><p>In addition, a person whose name is blanked out told police on April 19 last year that the killer \"ordered large amounts of ammunition within the past month and picked it up at (name redacted).\"</p><p>Police have charged Banfield, her brother James Banfield and her brother-in-law Brian Brewster with unlawfully supplying ammunition to the killer in the month before the mass shooting. All three are pleading not guilty, and police have said they \"had no prior knowledge\" of Wortman's intentions.</p><p>Not all of Wortman's shifts in behaviour appear to have been driven by the pandemic, according to witness statements to police.</p><p>For example, Von Bargen said in the year before the shooting, \"(the gunman) switched from being obsessed with vintage Honda motorcycles to police cars and was buying the cars off a (federal) government surplus website.\"</p><p>The killer would carry out his shootings while disguised as an RCMP officer and driving a replica patrol car.</p><p>The court documents contain records of the killer's PayPal purchases of gear he would use to create a replica RCMP vehicle, extending back to March 22, 2019. Websites bookmarked on the killer's computer included information about some of the police car components he was buying and \"11 Things You Didn't Know About Cop Cars.\" </p><p>During the summer of 2019, Wortman described to Banfield how he had attached a bumper ram onto the police car he'd bought from the federal government surplus store.</p><p>Meanwhile, the killer's interest in guns, particularly his two semi-automatic rifles, was evident. Previous releases have indicated Wortman acquired the rifles illegally, one from a person he knew in Houlton, Maine, and the other through the estate of a deceased friend in Fredericton.</p><p>The newly released documents say his computer bookmarks include sites with information about the Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic rifle and the Colt C7 semi-automatic rifle.</p><p>In addition, there is a note saying that on June 24, 2019, Wortman attended the non-restricted firearms course and completed it. However, police have stated that the killer didn't actually possess any licence to own firearms.</p><p>When Wortman was killed by police on the morning of April 19 at a gas station in Enfield, N.S., he still had a large supply of ammunition on hand \u2014 as he possibly prepared to carry on to Halifax.</p><p>According to statements by police firearms investigators, his Glock .40 calibre, semi-automatic pistol, with a laser pointer sighting grip, was on the front seat and it was loaded with an over-capacity magazine.</p><p>To his immediate right there was a cardboard box with ammunition and a metal can containing more loaded ammunition magazines.</p><p>Two rifles were lying in the back seat, including the Colt semi-automatic, with three loaded, over-capacity magazines, each with up to 30 rounds. </p><p>The second semi-automatic rifle, the Ruger Mini 14, also had an over-capacity magazine designed to hold 40 rounds of .223 calibre bullets, and there were three more magazines ready to load \u2014 two of them over-capacity ones that could hold 40 rounds.</p><p>There was also a Ruger P89, semi-automatic pistol, with an empty magazine in it and one round in the chamber, and he had the Smith and Wesson firearm belonging to RCMP Const. Heidi Stevenson, whom he had killed that morning, with 13 rounds in its chamber.</p><p>In describing her spouse's attitude in the final weeks before the massacre, Banfield told police, \"It was like he was preparing for the end of the world.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 20, 2021.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-cb69d0dab2ae4ef8830082b4a1876b0a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62R6-FC41-DY9S-T37F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1007\"/><timeReceived>02:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 20, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The restrictive laws of the time prevented a Chinese man from staking a claim on land that had not been previously worked. He could only get a mining licence, which cost him $15 a year compared to $5 a year for a white prospector, for areas that had been picked over and abandoned by white miners.</p><p>But the Chinese prospectors were disciplined and persistent.</p><p>The Government Agent at Quesnel Forks, William Stephenson, wrote of them: \"As a class, they are industrious, sober and economical. They are not lazy, drunken, extravagant or turbulent; they do not violate the laws, but they will evade them in every possible way.\"</p><p>The Chinese worked hard to glean every last bit of gold from their claims, using their knowledge to develop new techniques which proved to be much more efficient than those used by the whites who had gone before them.</p><p>The \"Celestials\" as they were called, invented panning machines to separate gold from mud, hand dredges to scrape the river bottom and rockers to concentrate gold-bearing paydirt in areas where water was unavailable.</p><p>One interesting method they perfected was the use of an ordinary potato to produce pellets from very fine gold sediment. A few drops of mercury were added to the pan to bind with the gold. Then, a potato was hollowed out and the mercury-gold mix was poured into the cavity.</p><p>The two halves of the potato were then wired together and it was thrown into a fire.</p><p>After a few hours, the mercury had burned off, leaving a small pellet of gold which was typically about 95 per cent pure.</p><p>Unfortunately, the names of most of these Chinese miners have been lost to history.</p><p>They were not allowed to vote, and they were excluded from registering births, deaths and marriages, so records are very sparse.</p><p>Their story was never properly recorded, and those who knew about it and could pass it along are now long gone.</p><p>For many of the men who toiled daily along the rivers and streams and in the mines hoping for that one big strike, literally nothing is known about them except that they were Chinese.</p><p>READ MORE: Quesnel Forks, a true relic of the gold rush</p><p>For a couple of years after the whites had moved on, the Chinese did quite well at reworking the abandoned claims.</p><p>However, these diggings too began to peter out, and these men started to prospect further and further afield.</p><p>As the story goes, two Chinese goldseekers crossed the North Fork and went north into the hills past Kangaroo Gulch near the base of Kangaroo Mountain.</p><p>Not much is known about these men \u2014 their names have been forgotten.</p><p>What is known is that they both came from the Canton area in China, and that one was several years older than the other. They may have been brothers, relatives, or in-laws.</p><p>About 10 days after they had left Quesnel Forks, they returned, each laden with leather pokes full of gold.</p><p>This gold was in the form of large course flakes, quite unlike the gold found in the area immediately around Quesnel Forks.</p><p>According to the Chinese who would later speak about this story, the diggings were approximately 10 miles due north of Quesnel Forks.</p><p>They were high in the hills and there was no water available, so the two men used a dry rocker to concentrate the gold.</p><p>The area they were working was likely once a high, ancient river channel which contained coarse gold that had not been worn down by water.</p><p>The men worked this claim for four seasons, from 1864 through to 1867.</p><p>By that time, they were very rich men, and they decided to return to China with their fortune.</p><p>They arrived back in Canton carrying several heavy suitcases of gold, and there they lived like royalty.</p><p>They lived a life of luxury and spent money freely. The older man died a very happy man sometime around 1869, and the younger man continued on enjoying the fortune.</p><p>READ MORE: The Prior House at Little Lake</p><p>But the money didn't last, especially when gambling was involved, and by 1870, it became evident to him that he was running out of funds.</p><p>He was not too concerned, since he knew where to find more gold, so in 1871 he made the return trip across the Pacific and back to the Cariboo.</p><p>What he hadn't planned on was that in 1869, a devastating forest fire had swept through the whole countryside around Quesnel Forks, reducing everything to ash.</p><p>Eighteen prospectors lost their lives in this wildfire.</p><p>All the landmarks the two men had used to guide themselves to the workings, including some marked trees, were gone.</p><p>The whole landscape had changed, and the area looked completely different.</p><p>The man looked for his mine for the rest of his life, but he never found it again.</p><p>The Chinese residents of Quesnel Forks were convinced that the diggings existed.</p><p>They had seen the gold, they knew the two men, and the details all added up. So, the legend began growing.</p><p>After the owner died in poverty in Quesnel Forks around 1880, men began searching for the site, hoping to strike it rich, themselves.</p><p>For more than 70 years, from the mid 1880s until the 1950s when the last permanent residents (all Chinese) of Quesnel Forks died or moved on, people searched every year for that lost Chinese mine.</p><p>No one ever found it again. It's still out there, somewhere.</p><p>For this column I obtained the information from the old CBC TV program, \"Gold Trails and Ghost Towns,\" with Bill Barlee.</p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Quesnel Cariboo Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20210410PQC4141657</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62DH-C571-JD2C-J125-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"947\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Of particular interest from the work in BC were a number of promising mineralized boulders located on Romios' NorthEast claim block and a broad zone of porphyry-copper style alteration uncovered on the Trek South claims. All assays are pending. </p><p><br/>Romios' claims in the Golden Triangle of NW British Columbia cover a number of porphyry copper-gold, shear zone gold, and VMS base metal prospects concentrated near the giant Galore Creek Cu-Au porphyry deposits, owned by a Newmont-Teck JV, or along the partially constructed roadway to those deposits. Work on the Trek South porphyry Cu-Au target outlined an area of continuous strong epidote/propylitic alteration and an overlapping network of pyrite-quartz veinlets at least 1 km across with similarly altered outcrops occurring up to 2 km apart. Skarn-type veins of garnet-epidote-actinolite+/- pyrite are well developed at several locations within this broad alteration zone and minor chalcopyrite and secondary copper staining are scattered throughout the area within the epidote and skarn veins as well as local quartz veins. Much of this newly discovered \"South Zone\" alteration is on ground only recently exposed by the melting of a glacier and adjacent snowfields. Various geophysical and geochemical survey methods are now under consideration for this exciting target. The partially drilled off Trek \"North Zone\" is located ~3.5 km NNE of this new discovery and is one of the few appreciable porphyry Cu-Au zones in the area not owned by the Newmont-Teck JV. The  &gt;5 km long, NE-trending Trek Fault zone extends from the North to the South Zone area and is flanked by a number of historic prospects that have returned numerous high-grade assays in the past, e.g. 5.3% Cu and 8.77g/t Au over 3.6 metres at the Gully zone. Romios personnel re-sampled and mapped one such zone in 2021, the TOE Zone, and may revise its geological model significantly if the pending assays confirm the field observations. <br/>Romios' NorthEast claim block is located immediately north of the road route to Galore Creek and  &lt;2 km from the proposed Galore Creek mill site. The claims were staked by Romios in 2005 to cover the potential source area of mineralized boulders discovered by previous workers in a glacial valley. The central claims are underlain by the highly prospective Lower to Middle Jurassic Hazelton Group metasediments and volcanics in contact with older Stuhini and Stikine Assemblage volcanics and metasediments. Many important ore deposits in the Golden Triangle are located near the base of the Hazelton Group including the high-grade, argillite-hosted Eskay Creek-Au-Ag deposit, Brucejack Au mine and Red Chris Cu-Au mine. The rapid melting of the glacier overlying the edge of the Hazelton Group rocks has now exposed a broad area of pyritic argillites/shales and Romios' crew discovered a number of large mineralized boulders nearby, some with  &gt;90% massive sulphide (pyrite with minor chalcopyrite) and others with thick veins of pyrite in shale. Assays are pending.  <br/>A number of large quartz veins +/- sulphides up to 1 m wide were found in outcrop on some of the Company's other claim blocks in the area, locally forming impressive stockworks or regularly spaced sets. Assays from these veins are also pending. <br/>Lundmark-Akow Lake Property, NW Ontario: Following a number of delays due to the industry-wide shortage of diamond drillers and the severe forest fire situation in NW Ontario that prevented any field work for several weeks, Romios' geological team and a drill crew are on site and drilling is in process. A series of drill holes is planned to test three VMS horizons, intersected with one hole each in 2019, that returned assays up to 1.26% Cu and 2.4 g/t Au over 3.25 m. Detailed analysis of the geophysical (EM) responses over the VMS zones has since outlined stronger portions of these 300 - 500 m long conductors, as well as a number of even stronger conductors along strike that are yet to be drilled. A high-grade gold-quartz vein intersected in 2019, just 300 m from a VMS Zone, assayed 8.64 g/t Au over 4.75 m, believed to be the most significant gold intercept in the North Caribou Lake greenstone belt outside of the Musselwhite mine property. Several large \"Red Lake style, epithermal-looking\" calcite veins up to 7 m wide, with sporadic gold values up to 3 g/t Au over 1 m, were found near the gold-quartz vein and their presence suggests that the gold-bearing fluids were part of a deep-seated, potentially widespread system. An airborne VLF-Mag survey undertaken in 2020 by Terraquest on Romios' behalf outlined a series of cross-cutting geophysical trends that may well reflect the controlling structures for the local gold mineralization and these are now high-priority targets for the current drill program as well.  <br/>The technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by John Biczok, P.

If a provincial emergency was not declared during those events, it would not have changed the response in any way.\"</p><p>Approximately 2,500 people trained in wildfire response, including contractors and those out of province, as well as 148 aircraft are currently deployed in B.C. In addition, the Canadian Armed Forces were on the ground in Kamloops on July 14, ready to provide airlift evacuations and ground-based resources, as well as personnel, supplies and equipment, according to a post to the CAF Facebook page.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com\">www.facebook.com</url></p><p>Furthermore, EMBC noted a state of emergency is not required to provide assistance, access funding or secure additional resources, including from the federal government, and one will be called on the advice of EMBC and BCWS.</p><p>\"A provincial state of emergency will be enacted if, and when, it's required,\" EMBC said in the statement. \"In the meantime, we continue to support and listen to the concerns of local governments and actively monitor the situation.\"</p><p>In addition, a statement released July 15 from Mike Farnworth, minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, doesn't mention a state of emergency, but said he wants \"to ensure British Columbians that we are deploying all necessary and available personnel and equipment to respond to wildfires across the province.\"</p><p>The federal government and the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre also are providing assistance and resources, including personnel and aircraft, he said.</p><p>On July 6, Farnworth told reporters the province would not be declaring a state of emergency, noting \"all necessary and requested resources\" had already been deployed to the affected areas, after viewing the devastation in Lytton. He also noted the government is waiting for the call from wildfire personnel on the ground.</p><p>But what they're hearing right now, said Milobar, is the wildfire service acknowledging that they're tapped and stretched out.</p><p>\"If anyone believes the wildfire service would turn down extra resources, they're kidding themselves,\" he said, adding the province hasn't been clear about how to provide relief to firefighters on the front lines. \"You cannot expect people to work in this type of heat day in and day out for three straight months, it's just not practical.\"</p><p>As of July 15, there are 27 wildfires of note in B.C., eight of which are in the Kamloops Fire Centre and another nine in the Cariboo Fire Centre.

He and the BC Liberal caucus have been pushing for a state of emergency for weeks.</p><p>Similar requests have been made by Cariboo-Chilcotin MLA Lorne Doerkson and Prince George-Valemount MLA Shirley Bond.</p><p>Former Green Party candidate Thomas Martin, a forestry professional and ex-firefighter, also expressed support for the move on Twitter.</p><p>\"I am one of those experienced fireline personnel sitting on the sidelines,\" he said in a tweet. \"As are many other experienced personnel. It might come across as politics, but calls from politicians like @shirleybond for a SoE make sense.\"</p><p>Martin also noted a fire near Clearwater had been commanded by local industry resources for roughly 10 days due to a lack of resources.</p><p>As is @BlackwellMerlin - Mayor of Clearwater and former forestry worker.

The town of Lytton had moments to evacuate after a wildfire ripped through on June 30.</p><p>\"We don't know what it's going to take for the Premier to acknowledge what is going on,\" Milobar said. \"He cannot sit in a smoke-free area of Victoria in his home and look out the window and assume that that's what the rest of the province looks like.\"</p><p>How stubborn can @jjhorgan be?

If a provincial emergency was not declared during those events, it would not have changed the response in any way.\"</p><p>Approximately 2,500 people trained in wildfire response, including contractors and those out of province, as well as 148 aircraft are currently deployed in B.C. In addition, the Canadian Armed Forces were on the ground in Kamloops on July 14, ready to provide airlift evacuations and ground-based resources, as well as personnel, supplies and equipment, according to a post to the CAF Facebook page.</p><p>Furthermore, EMBC noted a state of emergency is not required to provide assistance, access funding or secure additional resources, including from the federal government, and one will be called on the advice of EMBC and BCWS.</p><p>\"A provincial state of emergency will be enacted if, and when, it's required,\" EMBC said in the statement. \"In the meantime, we continue to support and listen to the concerns of local governments and actively monitor the situation.\"</p><p>In addition, a statement released July 15 from Mike Farnworth, minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, doesn't mention a state of emergency, but said he wants \"to ensure British Columbians that we are deploying all necessary and available personnel and equipment to respond to wildfires across the province.\"</p><p>The federal government and the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre also are providing assistance and resources, including personnel and aircraft, he said.</p><p>On July 6, Farnworth told reporters the province would not be declaring a state of emergency, noting \"all necessary and requested resources\" had already been deployed to the affected areas, after viewing the devastation in Lytton. He also noted the government is waiting for the call from wildfire personnel on the ground.</p><p>But what they're hearing right now, said Milobar, is the wildfire service acknowledging that they're tapped and stretched out.</p><p>\"If anyone believes the wildfire service would turn down extra resources, they're kidding themselves,\" he said, adding the province hasn't been clear about how to provide relief to firefighters on the front lines. \"You cannot expect people to work in this type of heat day in and day out for three straight months, it's just not practical.\"</p><p>As of July 15, there are 27 wildfires of note in B.C., eight of which are in the Kamloops Fire Centre and another nine in the Cariboo Fire Centre. There are 308 active fires in the province and 22 of them have been reported in the last two days, according to the BCWS dashboard.</p><p>- updated from a previous version to add recent vote information at TNRD meeting and to add response from EMBC</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsroom@clearwatertimes.com\">newsroom@clearwatertimes.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 Clearwater Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLETME-news20210715PNT4185373</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLETME2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6350-M6K1-F0HF-852C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438212</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1238\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

(\"Romios Gold\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to report that it has completed an initial month-long program of field work on the Company's extensive claims in the Golden Triangle and that the crew has now mobilised to NW Ontario and has commenced diamond drilling on the Lundmark-Akow Lake gold and base metal prospects. Of particular interest from the work in BC were a number of promising mineralized boulders located on Romios' NorthEast claim block and a broad zone of porphyry-copper style alteration uncovered on the Trek South claims. All assays are pending.</p><p>Romios' claims in the Golden Triangle of NW British Columbia cover a number of porphyry copper-gold, shear zone gold, and VMS base metal prospects concentrated near the giant Galore Creek Cu-Au porphyry deposits, owned by a Newmont-Teck JV, or along the partially constructed roadway to those deposits. Work on the Trek South porphyry Cu-Au target outlined an area of continuous strong epidote/propylitic alteration and an overlapping network of pyrite-quartz veinlets at least 1 km across with similarly altered outcrops occurring up to 2 km apart. Skarn-type veins of garnet-epidote-actinolite+/- pyrite are well developed at several locations within this broad alteration zone and minor chalcopyrite and secondary copper staining are scattered throughout the area within the epidote and skarn veins as well as local quartz veins. Much of this newly discovered \"South Zone\" alteration is on ground only recently exposed by the melting of a glacier and adjacent snowfields. Various geophysical and geochemical survey methods are now under consideration for this exciting target. The partially drilled off Trek \"North Zone\" is located ~3.5 km NNE of this new discovery and is one of the few appreciable porphyry Cu-Au zones in the area not owned by the Newmont-Teck JV. The )5 km long, NE-trending Trek Fault zone extends from the North to the South Zone area and is flanked by a number of historic prospects that have returned numerous high-grade assays in the past, e.g. 5.3% Cu and 8.77g/t Au over 3.6 metres at the Gully zone. Romios personnel re-sampled and mapped one such zone in 2021, the TOE Zone, and may revise its geological model significantly if the pending assays confirm the field observations.</p><p>Romios' NorthEast claim block is located immediately north of the road route to Galore Creek and (2 km from the proposed Galore Creek mill site. The claims were staked by Romios in 2005 to cover the potential source area of mineralized boulders discovered by previous workers in a glacial valley. The central claims are underlain by the highly prospective Lower to Middle Jurassic Hazelton Group metasediments and volcanics in contact with older Stuhini and Stikine Assemblage volcanics and metasediments. Many important ore deposits in the Golden Triangle are located near the base of the Hazelton Group including the high-grade, argillite-hosted Eskay Creek-Au-Ag deposit, Brucejack Au mine and Red Chris Cu-Au mine. The rapid melting of the glacier overlying the edge of the Hazelton Group rocks has now exposed a broad area of pyritic argillites/shales and Romios' crew discovered a number of large mineralized boulders nearby, some with )90% massive sulphide (pyrite with minor chalcopyrite) and others with thick veins of pyrite in shale. Assays are pending.</p><p>A number of large quartz veins +/- sulphides up to 1 m wide were found in outcrop on some of the Company's other claim blocks in the area, locally forming impressive stockworks or regularly spaced sets. Assays from these veins are also pending.</p><p>Lundmark-Akow Lake Property, NW Ontario: Following a number of delays due to the industry-wide shortage of diamond drillers and the severe forest fire situation in NW Ontario that prevented any field work for several weeks, Romios' geological team and a drill crew are on site and drilling is in process. A series of drill holes is planned to test three VMS horizons, intersected with one hole each in 2019, that returned assays up to 1.26% Cu and 2.4 g/t Au over 3.25 m. Detailed analysis of the geophysical (EM) responses over the VMS zones has since outlined stronger portions of these 300 - 500 m long conductors, as well as a number of even stronger conductors along strike that are yet to be drilled. A high-grade gold-quartz vein intersected in 2019, just 300 m from a VMS Zone, assayed 8.64 g/t Au over 4.75 m, believed to be the most significant gold intercept in the North Caribou Lake greenstone belt outside of the Musselwhite mine property. Several large \"Red Lake style, epithermal-looking\" calcite veins up to 7 m wide, with sporadic gold values up to 3 g/t Au over 1 m, were found near the gold-quartz vein and their presence suggests that the gold-bearing fluids were part of a deep-seated, potentially widespread system. An airborne VLF-Mag survey undertaken in 2020 by Terraquest on Romios' behalf outlined a series of cross-cutting geophysical trends that may well reflect the controlling structures for the local gold mineralization and these are now high-priority targets for the current drill program as well.</p><p>The technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by John Biczok, P.

A lot of that comes simply from making ourselves more visible,\" said Ryeland.</p><p>The organization sold 1,143 passes in 2019, well over its 2018 sales of 952. Ryeland said low sales in 2018 was due to the Parry Sound 33 forest fire.</p><p>\"Which, as all of you know, didn't effect Parry Sound or park to park, but a lot of people in Toronto thought that the whole place was on fire and stopped coming. And I know that some businesses, including my brother's ... had a major hit simply because people thought the whole place was on fire,\" he said. \"Clearly when people come to Parry Sound to use our trails both in summer and winter, it contributes economically to the area. In particular at a minimum, people are coming and buying gas and food and buying goods and services and obviously hotels in a lot of cases as well and that contributes a great deal to the area.\"</p><p>Calling 2019 the year of the bridges, Ryeland said he as well as Searle and other volunteers managed to work on a number of the trail's bridges. .</p><p>\"We have 14 bridges across our trails and like anything, where you have a bridge, if any one of our bridges go down, it has a pronounced impact on the ridership on the trail period. In general most of them cross rivers, some big and some small and it's very difficult to go around them,\" he said.</p><p>Four bridges needed to be re-decked in 2019 as well as another four this year, while one bridge has remained closed since May 2019, \"because simply, it's unsafe.

A lot of that comes simply from making ourselves more visible,\" said Ryeland.</p><p>The organization sold 1,143 passes in 2019, well over its 2018 sales of 952. Ryeland said low sales in 2018 was due to the Parry Sound 33 forest fire.</p><p>\"Which, as all of you know, didn't effect Parry Sound or park to park, but a lot of people in Toronto thought that the whole place was on fire and stopped coming. And I know that some businesses, including my brother's ... had a major hit simply because people thought the whole place was on fire,\" he said. \"Clearly when people come to Parry Sound to use our trails both in summer and winter, it contributes economically to the area. In particular at a minimum, people are coming and buying gas and food and buying goods and services and obviously hotels in a lot of cases as well and that contributes a great deal to the area.\"</p><p>Calling 2019 the year of the bridges, Ryeland said he as well as Searle and other volunteers managed to work on a number of the trail's bridges.</p><p>\"We have 14 bridges across our trails and like anything, where you have a bridge, if any one of our bridges go down, it has a pronounced impact on the ridership on the trail period. In general most of them cross rivers, some big and some small and it's very difficult to go around them,\" he said.</p><p>Four bridges needed to be re-decked in 2019 as well as another four this year, while one bridge has remained closed since May 2019, \"because simply, it's unsafe. It's been there for more than 100 years. It was an original train bridge ... it's old and it's rotted and it needs to be replaced in its entirety ... that's a very costly expense,\" he said.</p><p>Ryeland estimates the replacement of the bridge would cost in the neighbourhood of $200,000. The organization is working with the Ontario Snowmobile Federation to help with temporary repairs and hope for a full replacement in 2021.</p><p>Council may consider Park to Park Trail's request during its budget deliberations later this year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2020011356861743</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y08-C9S1-F103-3489-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"483\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The restrictive laws of the time prevented a Chinese man from staking a claim on land that had not been previously worked. He could only get a mining licence, which cost him $15 a year compared to $5 a year for a white prospector, for areas that had been picked over and abandoned by white miners.</p><p>But the Chinese prospectors were disciplined and persistent.</p><p>The Government Agent at Quesnel Forks, William Stephenson, wrote of them:\u201cAs a class, they are industrious, sober and economical. They are not lazy, drunken, extravagant or turbulent; they do not violate the laws, but they will evade them in every possible way.\u201d</p><p>The Chinese worked hard to glean every last bit of gold from their claims, using their knowledge to develop new techniques which proved to be much more efficient than those used by the whites who had gone before them.</p><p>The \u201cCelestials\u201d as they were called, invented panning machines to separate gold from mud, hand dredges to scrape the river bottom and rockers to concentrate gold-bearing paydirt in areas where water was unavailable.</p><p>One interesting method they perfected was the use of an ordinary potato to produce pellets from very fine gold sediment. A few drops of mercury were added to the pan to bind with the gold. Then, a potato was hollowed out and the mercury-gold mix was poured into the cavity.</p><p>The two halves of the potato were then wired together and it was thrown into a fire.</p><p>After a few hours, the mercury had burned off, leaving a small pellet of gold which was typically about 95 per cent pure.</p><p>Unfortunately, the names of most of these Chinese miners have been lost to history.</p><p>They were not allowed to vote, and they were excluded from registering births, deaths and marriages, so records are very sparse.</p><p>Their story was never properly recorded, and those who knew about it and could pass it along are now long gone.</p><p>For many of the men who toiled daily along the rivers and streams and in the mines hoping for that one big strike, literally nothing is known about them except that they were Chinese.</p><p>For a couple of years after the whites had moved on, the Chinese did quite well at re-working the abandoned claims.</p><p>However, these diggings too began to peter out, and these men started to prospect further and further afield.</p><p>As the story goes, two Chinese goldseekers crossed the North Fork and went north into the hills past Kangaroo Gulch near the base of Kangaroo Mountain.</p><p>Not much is known about these men \u2014 their names have been forgotten.</p><p>What is known is that they both came from the Canton area in China, and that one was several years older than the other. They may have been brothers, relatives, or in-laws.</p><p>About 10 days after they had left Quesnel Forks, they returned, each laden with leather pokes full of gold.</p><p>This gold was in the form of large course flakes, quite unlike the gold found in the area immediately around Quesnel Forks.</p><p>According to the Chinese who would later speak about this story, the diggings were approximately 10 miles due north of Quesnel Forks.</p><p>They were high in the hills and there was no water available, so the two men used a dry rocker to concentrate the gold.</p><p>The area they were working was likely once a high, ancient river channel which contained coarse gold that had not been worn down by water.</p><p>The men worked this claim for four seasons, from 1864 through to 1867.</p><p>By that time, they were very rich men, and they decided to return to China with their fortune.</p><p>They arrived back in Canton carrying several heavy suitcases of gold, and there they lived like royalty.</p><p>They lived a life of luxury and spent money freely. The older man died a very happy man sometime around 1869, and the younger man continued on enjoying the fortune.</p><p>But the money didn\u2019t last, especially when gambling was involved, and by 1870, it became evident to him that he was running out of funds.</p><p>He was not too concerned, since he knew where to find more gold, so in 1871 he made the return trip across the Pacific and back to the Cariboo.</p><p>What he hadn\u2019t planned on was that in 1869, a devastating forest fire had swept through the whole countryside around Quesnel Forks, reducing everything to ash.</p><p>Eighteen prospectors lost their lives in this wildfire.</p><p>All the landmarks the two men had used to guide themselves to the workings, including some marked trees, were gone.</p><p>The whole landscape had changed, and the area looked completely different.</p><p>The man looked for his mine for the rest of his life, but he never found it again.</p><p>The Chinese residents of Quesnel Forks were convinced that the diggings existed.</p><p>They had seen the gold, they knew the two men, and the details all added up. So, the legend began growing.</p><p>After the owner died in poverty in Quesnel Forks around 1880, men began searching for the site, hoping to strike it rich, themselves.</p><p>For more than 70 years, from the mid 1880s until the 1950s when the last permanent residents (all Chinese) of Quesnel Forks died or moved on, people searched every year for that lost Chinese mine.</p><p>No one ever found it again. It\u2019s still out there, somewhere.</p><p>For this column I obtained the information from the old CBC TV program, \u201cGold Trails and Ghost Towns,\u201d with Bill Barlee.</p><p>Special to the Tribune</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-news20210401PTDA0001740242</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62CT-8RD1-JD2C-J41B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"921\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

But in a split second Friday, the festive gathering in northern Israel turned into one of the country\u2019s worst-ever tragedies, with at least 45 people crushed to death and dozens injured in a stampede.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The disaster prompted a national outpouring of grief as devastated families rushed to identify their dead relatives and bury them ahead of the Jewish Sabbath. There was also anger toward authorities over an accident that experts had long feared, further clouding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s hopes of remaining in office.</p><p>Netanyahu, who briefly visited Mount Meron at midday, offered his condolences. \u201cIn these moments our people unite and that is what we are doing at this moment as well,\u201d he said.</p><p>He announced Sunday would be a day of national mourning and said he had joined the masses of people who donated blood for the victims. Israel's President Reuven Rivlin lit 45 candles in honour of the dead. Messages of condolences poured in from around the world.</p><p>President Joe Biden said he was heartbroken and had called Netanyahu to offer support. \u201cThe people of the United States and Israel are bound together by our families, our faiths, and our histories, and we will stand with our friends,\u201d he said.</p><p>The stampede erupted around 1 a.m. as people began to leave and thronged a narrow, tunnel-like passage. According to witnesses, people began to fall on a slippery ramp, causing others to trip and sparking panic.</p><p>Avigdor Hayut, who survived the stampede, described slipping on the ramp and getting trapped in the crowd with his two sons, ages 10 and 13.</p><p>\u201cMy son screamed, \u2018I\u2019m dying,\u2019\u201d he told Israel\u2019s public TV station Kan. A policeman tried to pull him and his younger son out of the crowd but couldn't move them.</p><p>\u201cThe policeman threw up and started crying, and I understood what he was looking at, what I couldn\u2019t see,\u201d said Hayut, 36, who suffered a broken ankle and ribs. \u201cI thought this was the end.\u201d He said he began to pray and \u201csimply waited.\u201d</p><p>Hours later, in hospital with Shmuel, his 10-year-old, they learned that his other son, Yedidya, had died.</p><p>Lag BaOmer is very popular with Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox community. The main event takes place each year at Mount Meron. Tens of thousands, mostly ultra-Orthodox, celebrate to honour Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, a 2nd-century sage and mystic who is believed to be buried there. This year, authorities said some 100,000 people attended.</p><p>The crowds light bonfires, dance and have large festive meals as part of the celebrations. Across the country, even in secular areas, smaller groups gather in parks and forests for barbecues and bonfires.</p><p>Video footage from the scene of the disaster showed large numbers of people, most of them black-clad ultra-Orthodox men, squeezed in the tunnel. Witnesses complained that police barricades had prevented people from exiting properly.</p><p>\u201cThe officers who were there couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d said Velvel Brevda, a rabbi who witnessed the stampede. He blamed the government for the deaths of \u201cbeautiful holy Jews that were killed here for no reason whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>At least 45 people were killed, according to the Israeli Health Ministry, with four people remaining in critical condition and dozens more hospitalized.</p><p>Bodies were later taken to Israel\u2019s central forensic institute for identification, where distraught families waited to identify their loved ones. Israel\u2019s Army Radio said some 40 people remained unaccounted for.</p><p>By Friday night, 32 victims had been identified. Israeli media earlier published a partial list of the victims, including a 9-year-old boy, a pair of brothers, 12 and 14, and a father of 11 children. An unknown number of American citizens, two Canadians and an Argentinian were also among the dead.</p><p>In a race against time, a number of funerals were held before sundown Friday, the start of the Jewish Sabbath when burials do not take place. The death toll at Mount Meron exceeded the 44 people killed in a 2010 forest fire, previously believed to be Israel's deadliest civilian tragedy.</p><p>The Justice Ministry said the police were launching a probe into possible criminal misconduct by officers.</p><p>Experts have long warned that the Mount Meron celebrations were ripe for disaster due to the crowded conditions, large fires and hot weather. In a 2008 report, the state comptroller, a watchdog government office, warned conditions at the site, including escape routes, \u201cendanger the public.\u201d</p><p>Last year, the celebrations were greatly scaled back due to coronavirus restrictions. But this year\u2019s event marked the first religious gathering to be held legally since Israel lifted most restrictions in the wake of its successful vaccination program.</p><p>According to Health Ministry guidelines, public gatherings continue to be limited to no more than 500 people. But Israeli media said that Netanyahu assured ultra-Orthodox leaders that the celebrations would take place, despite objections from public health officials. Netanyahu\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The deadly stampede was bound to have political reverberations at a time of great uncertainty following an inconclusive March election, the fourth in two years.</p><p>Netanyahu has so far been unsuccessful in forming a governing coalition. His time to do so runs out on Tuesday. If he fails, his political rivals will get a chance to try to cobble together an alliance.</p><p>Netanyahu has long relied on powerful ultra-Orthodox parties as allies and will need their support if he wants to keep faint hopes alive of staying in power.</p><p>During Friday\u2019s visit to Mount Meron, Netanyahu was jeered by dozens of religious protesters. If such sentiments spread, it could further hurt Netanyahu\u2019s prospects.</p><p>The stampede also threatened to deepen a broad public backlash against the ultra-Orthodox.</p><p>Netanyahu came under heavy criticism over the past year for allowing ultra-Orthodox communities to flout safety guidelines by opening schools and synagogues and holding mass funerals. The ultra-Orthodox communities were among the country\u2019s hardest hit by COVID-19.</p><p>Gideon Rahat, a political scientist at the Hebrew University and fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, said the coming days would see a battle over \u201cframing\u201d of the event. Netanyahu will call for national healing and unity, while his opponents will say he is unfit to remain in office and its time for change.</p><p>\u201cThere is a battle on the framing, who is to blame, not to blame,\u201d he said. \u201cAlready we see the signs of it.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press photographer Ariel Schalit contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-9c9d028bb510fd81951d6bcc777418b7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62JR-0FF1-DY9S-T3S1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1114\"/><timeReceived>01:03 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 30, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

'Gangnam Style' or the first 'Hunger Games' movie?\" Thunberg asks her audience on Swedish radio station P1.</p><p>\"Those things all happened about seven or eight years ago. That's the amount of time we're talking about.\"</p><p>Her months-long journey from Sweden to America's West Coast and back - by train, sailboat and an electric car loaned by Arnold Schwarzenegger - highlighted the impact that global warming is already having, from melting glaciers to fiercer forest fire seasons, Thunberg said.</p><p>It also opened her eyes to economic and social disparities affecting in particular Indigenous, Black and minority communities, voices she has sought to amplify in the climate debate.</p><p>\"The climate and sustainability crisis is not a fair crisis,\" Thunberg says. \"The ones who'll be hit hardest from its consequences are often the ones who have done the least to cause the problem in the first place. \"</p><p>Her frustration extends to journalists who want to know about \"the real Greta\" but interrupt her when she talks about the science of climate change.</p><p>\"People want something simple and concrete, and they want me to be naive, angry, childish and emotional,\" Thunberg says. \"That is the story that sells and creates the most clicks.\"</p><p>Thunberg blasts governments and businesses that use what she calls \"creative accounting\" to makes their emissions look lower than they are and apply the word \"green\" to industries that are not.</p><p>\"The emperors are naked. Every single one,\" she says. \"It turns out our whole society is just one big nudist party.\"</p><p>Some critics have accused Thunberg of being a doom-monger. But she insists that her message is one of hope, not despair.</p><p>\"There are signs of change, of awakening,\" she says. \"Just take the 'Me Too' movement, 'Black Lives Matter' or the school strike movement (for climate action) for instance,\" she says, adding that the world has passed a \"social tipping point\" where it becomes impossible to look away.</p><p>The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic may provide a necessary wake-up call, she suggests.</p><p>\"The corona tragedy of course has no long term positive effects on the climate, apart from one thing only: namely the insight into how you should perceive and treat an emergency.

General Assembly last fall, Greta Thunberg found herself constantly interrupted by world leaders, including U.N. chief Antonio Guterres and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had formed a queue to speak to her and take selfies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, waits in line but doesn't quite make it before it's time for the event to start,\" Thunberg recalls.</p><p>Such surreal memories for a teenager form the opening to a 75-minute monologue broadcast on Swedish public radio Saturday that soon shifts to the serious matter of climate change that's at the heart of Thunberg's work.</p><p>The 17-year-old has become a global figurehead of the youth climate movement since she started her one-woman protests outside the Swedish parliament in 2018.</p><p>Thunberg's blunt words to presidents and prime ministers, peppered with scientific facts about the need to urgently cut greenhouse gas emissions, have won her praise and awards, but also the occasionalpushback and even death threats.</p><p>To Thunberg's disappointment, her message doesn't seem to be getting through even to those leaders who applaud her work.</p><p>The message is certainly stark: Thunberg cites a U.N. report that estimates the world can only keep emitting the current amount of carbon dioxide for the next seven-and-a-half years. Any longer and it becomes impossible to meet the Paris climate accord's ambitious goal of keeping global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) this century.</p><p>Most governments refuse to accept the idea that the world has only a fixed \"carbon budget\" left, because it implies that a sudden shift away from fossil fuel will need to happen in just a few years.</p><p>\"Do you remember the London Olympics? 'Gangnam Style' or the first 'Hunger Games' movie?\" Thunberg asks her audience on Swedish radio station P1. \"Those things all happened about seven or eight years ago. That's the amount of time we're talking about.\"</p><p>Her months-long journey from Sweden to America's West Coast and back - by train, sailboat and an electric car loaned by Arnold Schwarzenegger - highlighted the impact that global warming is already having, from melting glaciers to fiercer forest fire seasons, Thunberg said.</p><p>It also opened her eyes to economic and social disparities affecting in particular Indigenous, Black and minority communities, voices she has sought to amplify in the climate debate.</p><p>\"The climate and sustainability crisis is not a fair crisis,\" Thunberg says. \"The ones who'll be hit hardest from its consequences are often the ones who have done the least to cause the problem in the first place. \"</p><p>Her frustration extends to journalists who want to know about \"the real Greta\" but interrupt her when she talks about the science of climate change.</p><p>\"People want something simple and concrete, and they want me to be naive, angry, childish, and emotional,\" Thunberg says. \"That is the story that sells and creates the most clicks.\"</p><p>Thunberg blasts governments and businesses that use what she calls \"creative accounting\" to makes their emissions look lower than they are and apply the word \"green\" to industries that are not.</p><p>\"The emperors are naked. Every single one,\" she says. \"It turns out our whole society is just one big nudist party.\"</p><p>Some critics have accused Thunberg of being a doom-monger. But she insists that her message is one of hope, not despair.</p><p>\"There are signs of change, of awakening,\" she says. \"Just take the 'Me Too' movement, 'Black Lives Matter' or the school strike movement (for climate action) for instance,\" she says, adding that the world has passed a \"social tipping point\" where it becomes impossible to look away.</p><p>The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic may provide a necessary wake-up call, she suggests.</p><p>\"The corona tragedy of course has no long term positive effects on the climate, apart from one thing only: namely the insight into how you should perceive and treat an emergency. Because during the corona crisis we suddenly act with necessary force.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-70319fb6a8105960c6f0392650ac1e78</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605S-4D71-DY9S-T262-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"674\"/><timeReceived>02:46 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 20, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Cheslatta Carrier Nation, which is located on the southside of Burns Lake, brainstormed over ideas to combat these wildfires and come up with an initial emergency response &amp; - the result of which is eight wildfire equipment trailers and one industrial trailer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"In case there is an accidental spark, or a power line falls, and a fire starts, or even during the wildfire season, then we want the community to have some initial response available with them, before the fire services or forest service arrive on the scene,\" said Mike Robertson, Senior Policy Advisor for Cheslatta Carrier Nation.</p><p>The trailers are basically 12 feet long, enclosed cargo trailers that are equipped with 275 gallon water tank, two volume pumps, 800 feet 1 1 and a half inch fire hose, 250 feet three fourth inch fire hose, nozzles, fittings, tools, first aid kit, spare parts and other necessary equipment and gears for the initial fire response. These trailers will be unmanned and each individual would be expected to use the equipment if need, using their own skills.</p><p>Cheslatta Carrier Nation held a demonstration for its staff and people on June 2 where people from the Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations (FLNRO) were present to show how to use the equipment inside the trailer. \"We are putting on workshops and there will also be an instructional video online to show people how to use the equipment,\" said Robertson.</p><p>The trailers were made possible by a donation from Rio Tinto, who operate the Nechako Reservoir, in a Cheslatta territory. They contributed $98,000 to help with this wildfire preparedness project, to purchase and supply the community response units.</p><p>RELATED: Rio Tinto donates $120, 000 to support in response to the wildfire emergencies</p><p>\"The safety of our employees and the communities we work in is a top priority for Rio Tinto BC Works. We are pleased of the work the Cheslatta Carrier Nation is doing to prevent the spread of wildfires with its Community Response Units,\" said Affonso Bizon, the general manager for Rio Tinto BC Works. During the 2018 wildfires, Rio Tinto supplied face masks for residents who stayed behind to save their animals and livelihoods. They also provided food for the evacuees and the fire fighters and contributed $100, 000 to the Burns Lake Community Foundation to support not-for-profit and community fire response initiatives. However, when Cheslatta Carrier Nation approached them with the idea of mobile response units, Rio Tinto decided to be a part of this project with the coordination from the Regional District of Bulkley Nechako, the B.C. Forest Fire Services and Cheslatta Carrier Nation.</p><p>\"We negotiated getting the trailers with Rio Tinto just because of the fire incidents we have had before. And we all witnessed and experienced it so we really wanted something that is an immediate response to fire,\" said Cheslatta Chief Corrina Leween, adding that the idea is to put the trailers in spots that are especially volatile during the fire season. \"We thought it would be a good idea to spread the trailers around and if there was a small fire, an immediate response to that fire could save an entire forest. The year before, small lightening strikes ended up being a catastrophe in wildfires. So we are just hoping this will help.\"</p><p>The trailers or community wildfire response units, will be located at Takysie Lake, Grassy Plains, Cheslatta Road, Ootsa Lake, Uncha Lake, Southbank, Colleymount and Tchesinkut Lake.</p><p>\"These units will provide an additional level of protection to the local population, and it is our hope that by working proactively together, we will never see a scenario like the 2018 wildfires again,\" added Bizon. The units are a first such initiative for the region and Robertson hopes that this will serve as a model for other remote, semi-rural or rural communities.</p><p>ALSO READ: Cheslata Carrier Nation receives 30 greenhouses from Rio Tinto</p><p>Priyanka KetkarMultimedia journalist @PriyankaKetkar</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:priyanka.ketkar@ldnews.netLike\">priyanka.ketkar@ldnews.netLike</email> us on Facebook and follows us on Twitter.</p><p>Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

But case numbers are rising in the province\u2019s Northern and Interior health regions, and Vancouver Island is also continuing to see new cases. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ten of the 694 new cases in B.C. were in the Island Health region, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said at Thursday\u2019s COVID-19 briefing. There were also 12 new deaths due to the virus, all in the Lower Mainland. </p><p>There are now 9,103 active COVID-19 cases across the province, including the 277 active cases in Island Health, with 12 people in hospital and four in critical care. </p><p>Henry acknowledged that some regions of the province were struggling to contain numbers they had not experienced before. </p><p>\u201cMany of our communities around this province are affected right now, many of whom went through the first wave and the first number of months of this pandemic without having cases, without having it touch close to home,\u201d Henry said. </p><p>But the doctor urged people to continue to follow pandemic protocols to protect the elderly, as well as strained and tired health-care workers. </p><p>\u201cWe need to do our bit everywhere, to make sure that we support and protect them, too.\u201d </p><p>Island Health announced Wednesday that two hospitals \u2014 Saanich Peninsula Hospital and West Coast General Hospital in Port Alberni \u2014 are dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks. </p><p>Two First Nations communities in the Island Health region remain under lockdown while dealing with outbreaks: the Ehattesaht Chinehkint First Nation community near Zeballos and the Klahoose Nation on Cortes Island. </p><p>However, the battle to flatten the curve on Vancouver Island can still be won if people continue to follow pandemic protocols, said Daniel Coombs, an expert in the modelling of infectious disease. </p><p>Until recently, the Vancouver Island region saw a handful of daily cases, but since November, new cases of the virus have largely run in the double digits. </p><p>\u201cIf Vancouver Island wants to maintain its really impressive record with the virus, it remains critical that people remain vigilant and follow the public health guidance that we're getting,\u201d said Coombs, a mathematics professor at the University of British Columbia. </p><p>At the moment, the COVID-19 situation on Vancouver Island is akin to the potential for wildfire in dry summer conditions, he said. </p><p>\u201cThe forest fire analogy is a good one,\u201d Coombs said. </p><p>The virus won\u2019t have fuel to spread if people continue to avoid crossing back and forth to the mainland except for essential travel and don't indulge in any social gatherings outside their households. </p><p>\u201cIf physical distancing, mask protocols and other measures are maintained on Vancouver Island, it prevents those sparks (of COVID-19) from growing and getting out of control,\u201d he said. </p><p>Over the past two weeks, the Central Vancouver Island health service delivery area recorded 118 COVID-19 cases, followed by 66 cases in the South Island and 37 in the North Island area, data released Thursday showed. </p><p>Island Health currently has exposure notices for eight schools in the region, including six in Port Alberni, one in Victoria and one on Salt Spring Island. </p><p>As well, an outbreak at Veterans Memorial Lodge long-term care home in Victoria was announced over the weekend, and the lockdown of the Tsawaayuss-Rainbow Gardens facility in Port Alberni remains in effect. </p><p>The greatest areas of concern for outbreaks are in long-term care homes and multigenerational households where the elderly people are most at risk from the virus, Coombs said. </p><p>As well, smaller rural communities on the surrounding islands or spread across Vancouver Island are more vulnerable due to the lack of medical resources and the difficulty of accessing rapid testing, he added. </p><p>Henry also expressed the need for individuals to make the right choices to protect groups most at risk. </p><p>\u201cWe know that our long-term care homes in particular are most vulnerable. It's the biggest challenge that we are facing,\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cI recognize that this sacrifice is one that all of us are taking, and the vast majority of people around B.C. have taken this to heart.\u201d </p><p>Though the daily COVID-19 case numbers on Vancouver Island are still fluctuating up and down, overall, the numbers appear to be flattening, Coombs said. </p><p>But keeping it that way will depend on people adhering to physical distancing, Coombs said. </p><p>This will be necessary for some time into the future, despite hopes vaccines are around the corner. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing a lot about vaccination at the moment,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cBut if we haven't actually deployed the vaccine fully in our communities in B.C., there\u2019s a risk that people are going to loosen up too quickly or too early. </p><p>\u201cYet, I can definitely foresee some restrictions lasting into the summer, or maybe even longer.\u201d </p><p>Rochelle Baker / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada's National Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-7616eb5621c04ef09e03e56aa7244b12</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61FK-DT41-JBVR-31VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"857\"/><timeReceived>08:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 4, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(TSXV: LME) (OTCPINK: LMEFF)(\"LAURION\" or the \"Corporation\")is pleased to announcenew drill hole assay results of the ongoing 2021 drilling program focussing on the strike continuity between the A-Zone and McLeod mineralized areas on the Ishkoday Property, located 220 km northeast of Thunder Bay. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights of current drill hole results include:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> 0.77 g/t Au, 4.31 g/t Ag, 0.83% Zn over 20m on hole LBX21-045 between 145 and 165m. 0.71 g/t Au, 13.29 g/t Ag, 0.17% Cu and 2.22% Zn over 13.5m on hole LBX21-046 between 138.5 and 152 m (See Figure 1).</p><p>The current assay results, combined with new geological understanding, confirms the presence of volcanogenic mineralization (A-Zone type) over the whole strike length between the McLeod Zone and A-Zone. The strike length across the mineralized zones is approximately 1.4 km, with a confirmed depth up to 150 m from the surface. </p><p>A soil survey completed north of the Sturgeon River, 1.5 km north of the McLeod Zone highlighted several copper anomalies, confirming the potential for additional volcanogenic mineralization North of the current area of focus. </p><p>Diamond Drilling Results:</p><p>Drilling resumed on August 19, 2021, following the lifting of the forest fire restrictions in the region. In-fill drilling focussed on linking the A-Zone and the McLeod Zone mineralized horizons. A total of 11 drill holes were completed to date, and LAURION is pleased to issue results of the first two drill holes, LBX21-045 and 046.</p><p>Mineralization occurs in a series of intermediate to felsic volcanic units cut by dioritic dykes. The majority of the mineralization is located in pervasive pyrite-sphalerite-quartz-carbonate stockworks and veins, with some massive sulphide horizons. A two (2) metre long semi-massive sulphide interval was intersected in hole LBX21-046 and is composed of sphalerite-pyrite-chalcopyrite-galena (see Figure 1). Brecciated quartz, magnetite banding with strong sericite-chlorite and silica alteration is also observed within the same intersection. The hole was stopped in a mineralized quartz vein (last 3.5 metres) due to technical issues on the hole. The completed results for the mineralized zones can be found in Table 1 below. </p><p>Table 1: Selected Best Results from Diamond Drilling Connecting the Mineralized Zone Between McLeod Zone and A-Zone:</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"9\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hole ID</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">From (m)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">To (m)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Length (m)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Au g/t</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Ag g/t</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">Cu %</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">Pb %</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">Zn %</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">LBX21-046</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">138.50</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">152.00</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">13.50</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.71</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">13.29</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.17</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">0.27</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">2.22</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">including</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">149.00</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">151.00</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2.00</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">2.90</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">61.83</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.92</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">0.91</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">10.78</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">LBX21-045</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">145.00</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">165.00</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">20.00</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.77</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">4.31</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.04</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">0.03</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">0.83</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">LBX21-040</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">41.00</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">46.50</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">5.50</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.38</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">5.72</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.11</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">0.03</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">0.60</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">LBX21-041</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">37.00</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">41.00</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">4.00</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.95</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">2.26</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">LBX21-042</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">200.00</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">204.00</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">4.00</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.38</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">14.29</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.13</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">0.32</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">3.12</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">LBX21-043</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">46.00</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">53.30</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">10.30</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.49</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">10.27</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.06</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">0.06</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">0.80</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">LBX21-044</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">98.00</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">107.00</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">9.00</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.47</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">1.66</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.02</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">0.01</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">0.71</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Note: At this time the true width of the mineralized interval is unknown.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Since the discovery of the McLeod Zone, there has been very little exploration conducted in the swamp area between both showings (McLeod and A-Zone) and recent advances showed that the A-Zone mineralization is similar to the McLeod Zone.

A total of 5 historic drill holes were completed on the River Showing and yielded good results (DDH 88-22 with 10.37m @ 0.20 g/t Au 13.62 g/t Ag and 1.22% Cu). </p><p>Previous grab samples also yielded copper results grading over 1.8% Cu. Two magnetic high anomalies are also present on the northern portion of the project, which are interpreted to represent possible extensions of the A-Zone system. </p><p>A soil sampling survey was conducted to cover the eastern part of the property up to 1km north of the Namewaminikan river, which is located 700m north of the A-Zone. A total of 859 samples were taken from the B-horizon in available soils. All samples were dried, sieved and assayed onsite using a portable XRF to detect any anomalies in base metals. Copper returned anomalous results ranging from 25ppm up to 191ppm for 48 samples. Indications from soil sampling, grab sampling and historical drilling, indicate a potential extension of mineralization over that area and requires further prospecting and possible trenching (See Figure 2). </p><p>QAQC</p><p>All core samples have been assayed by ALS Laboratories in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Samples are processed by 4-acid digestion and analyzed by fire assay on 50 g pulps and ICP-AES (Inductively-Coupled-Plasma   Atomic-Element-Spectroscopy). Over limit analyses are reprocessed with gravimetric finish. A total of 5% blanks and 5% standard are inserted randomly within all samples. 5% of the best assays results pulps will be sent for re-assays. A total of 8.7% blanks and 9.5% standard were randomly inserted during the pXRF analyse of the soil sampling. 2.8% we re-analyzed. All QAQC were verified, and no contamination or bias have been observed. </p><p>Qualified Person </p><p>The technical information in this news release has been prepared in accordance with Canadian regulatory requirements and has been reviewed and approved by Jean Philippe Paiement, P.Geo., MSc., a consultant to LAURION, and a \"qualified person\" within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101.</p><p>About LAURION</p><p>The Corporation is a junior mineral exploration and development company listed on the TSXV under the symbol LME and on the OTCPINK under the symbol LMEFF. LAURION now has 238,069,240 outstanding shares of which approximately 79% are owned and controlled by Insiders who are eligible investors under the \"Friends and Family\" categories. </p><p>LAURION's emphasis is on the development of its flagship project, the 100% owned mid-stage 47 km2 Ishkoday Project, and its gold-silver and gold-rich polymetallic mineralization with a significant upside potential. The mineralization on Ishkoday is open at depth beyond the current core-drilling limit of -200 m from surface, based on the historical mining to a -685 m depth, in the past producing Sturgeon River Mine. The Brenbar Property, acquired in 2020, is contiguous with the Ishkoday Property and hosts the historic Brenbar Mine. LAURION believes the mineralization to be a direct extension of mineralization from the Ishkoday Property.</p><p>Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information</p><p>This press release contains forward-looking statements, which reflect the Corporation's current expectations regarding future events, including with respect to LAURION's business, operations and condition, and management's objectives, strategies, beliefs and intentions.

It did to an ankylosaur about 110 million years ago, as evidenced by amazingly complete fossils of what was certainly the tank-like dinosaur's last meal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's pretty exciting,\" said Caleb Brown, a curator at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology and co-author of a paper published Tuesday on what is one of probably only three fossilized dinosaur stomachs discovered.</p><p>\"We can start recontructing the life histories and ecologies of these animals.\"</p><p>The dining dinosaur was first unearthed in 2011 in a northern Alberta Suncor oilsands mine, where many excavators have learned to look for fossils as they dig. When this one turned up, a crew from the Tyrrell followed shortly afterward.</p><p>It was an amazingly well-preserved ankylosaur from the early Cretaceous period. Low but large - the species could reach eight metres long and weigh eight tonnes - the fossil took two weeks to remove.</p><p>It then took 5 1/2 years for technician Mark Mitchell to clean and prepare it, which is why the species now bears the Latin name markmitchelli. The restored specimen, complete with body armour and outer skin, was remarkable enough for a 2017 National Geographic magazine feature.  </p><p>But for paleontologists, the fun was just starting. They began looking at a fossilized structure that co-author Jim Basinger of the University of Saskatchewan described as looking like a \"squashed basketball.\"</p><p>It was in the right place for a stomach and it held gastroliths, small stones dinosaurs used to help digest their food, much as some birds do today.</p><p>\"There's a great mess of them and they're quite distinctive,\" said Basinger.</p><p>The scientists eventually compiled 16 pieces of evidence that the squashed basketball was, in fact, a stomach.  </p><p>\"It's unquestionable,\" Basinger said.</p><p>There are only two other fossilized stomachs in the world that scientists are this sure about. Neither opens doors to the past the way this one does.</p><p>About 80 per cent of this last meal was a particular species of ferns. The fossils are so well preserved their spores identify them.</p><p>There are bits of other plants and twigs so immaculate that their growth rings are being used to estimate weather at the time. And there is charcoal from burned woody material.</p><p>Brown points out ferns aren't that nutritious. A beast this size would need digestion capable of getting the most from them.</p><p>That means this dinosaur may have fermented its food, much like many animals today.</p><p>\"All big herbivores today use some form of fermentation,\" Brown said. \"For this animal, it was almost certainly fermenting those ferns.\"</p><p>Which raises other interesting questions: How much fermented fern does it take to move an eight-tonne lizard? How much energy might it need? Where might that much fodder be found?</p><p>The charcoal provides a clue.

But case numbers are rising in the province's Northern and Interior health regions, and Vancouver Island is also continuing to see new cases.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ten of the 694 new cases in B.C. were in the Island Health region, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said at Thursday's COVID-19 briefing. There were also 12 new deaths due to the virus, all in the Lower Mainland.</p><p>There are now 9,103 active COVID-19 cases across the province, including the 277 active cases in Island Health, with 12 people in hospital and four in critical care.</p><p>Henry acknowledged that some regions of the province were struggling to contain numbers they had not experienced before.</p><p>\"Many of our communities around this province are affected right now, many of whom went through the first wave and the first number of months of this pandemic without having cases, without having it touch close to home,\" Henry said.</p><p>But the doctor urged people to continue to follow pandemic protocols to protect the elderly, as well as strained and tired health-care workers.</p><p>\"We need to do our bit everywhere, to make sure that we support and protect them, too.\"</p><p>Island Health announced Wednesday that two hospitals - Saanich Peninsula Hospital and West Coast General Hospital in Port Alberni - are dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks.</p><p>Two First Nations communities in the Island Health region remain under lockdown while dealing with outbreaks: the Ehattesaht Chinehkint First Nation community near Zeballos and the Klahoose Nation on Cortes Island.</p><p>However, the battle to flatten the curve on Vancouver Island can still be won if people continue to follow pandemic protocols, said Daniel Coombs, an expert in the modelling of infectious disease.</p><p>Until recently, the Vancouver Island region saw a handful of daily cases, but since November, new cases of the virus have largely run in the double digits.</p><p>\"If Vancouver Island wants to maintain its really impressive record with the virus, it remains critical that people remain vigilant and follow the public health guidance that we're getting,\" said Coombs, a mathematics professor at the University of British Columbia.</p><p>At the moment, the COVID-19 situation on Vancouver Island is akin to the potential for wildfire in dry summer conditions, he said.</p><p>\"The forest fire analogy is a good one,\" Coombs said.</p><p>The virus won't have fuel to spread if people continue to avoid crossing back and forth to the mainland except for essential travel and don't indulge in any social gatherings outside their households.</p><p>\"If physical distancing, mask protocols and other measures are maintained on Vancouver Island, it prevents those sparks (of COVID-19) from growing and getting out of control,\" he said.</p><p>Over the past two weeks, the Central Vancouver Island health service delivery area recorded 118 COVID-19 cases, followed by 66 cases in the South Island and 37 in the North Island area, data released Thursday showed.</p><p>Island Health currently has exposure notices for eight schools in the region, including six in Port Alberni, one in Victoria and one on Salt Spring Island.</p><p>As well, an outbreak at Veterans Memorial Lodge long-term care home in Victoria was announced over the weekend, and the lockdown of the Tsawaayuss-Rainbow Gardens facility in Port Alberni remains in effect.</p><p>The greatest areas of concern for outbreaks are in long-term care homes and multigenerational households where the elderly people are most at risk from the virus, Coombs said.</p><p>As well, smaller rural communities on the surrounding islands or spread across Vancouver Island are more vulnerable due to the lack of medical resources and the difficulty of accessing rapid testing, he added.</p><p>Henry also expressed the need for individuals to make the right choices to protect groups most at risk.</p><p>\"We know that our long-term care homes in particular are most vulnerable. It's the biggest challenge that we are facing,\" she said.</p><p>\"I recognize that this sacrifice is one that all of us are taking, and the vast majority of people around B.C. have taken this to heart.\"</p><p>Though the daily COVID-19 case numbers on Vancouver Island are still fluctuating up and down, overall, the numbers appear to be flattening, Coombs said.</p><p>But keeping it that way will depend on people adhering to physical distancing, Coombs said.</p><p>This will be necessary for some time into the future, despite hopes vaccines are around the corner.</p><p>\"We've been hearing a lot about vaccination at the moment,\" he said.</p><p>\"But if we haven't actually deployed the vaccine fully in our communities in B.C., there's a risk that people are going to loosen up too quickly or too early.</p><p>\"Yet, I can definitely foresee some restrictions lasting into the summer, or maybe even longer.\"</p><p>Rochelle Baker / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada's National Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020120459584550</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61FH-PF31-JDH1-C1T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

Also, its close proximity to other houses and wooded areas in times of extreme heat can be potentially disastrous.</p><p>Fortunately an off-duty firefighter spotted the blaze and was able to assist the Trail crew in identifying the location, attacking it, and suppressing it quickly and successfully.</p><p>\"One of our members was going home from work, and saw the smoke and was able to call back to the station and give them really good detail, and he actually got back to the station in time so we had a four-man response,\" said Derby.</p><p>\"The nice part is the guys just drove straight in, so it worked out really well and we were able to stretch a line and hold it and we had good support from all our members in Trail and Warfield.\"</p><p>Anyone with information on the suspicious fires is asked to contact the Trail RCMP.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sports@trailtimes.caLike\">sports@trailtimes.caLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-4033598</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60J1-B4H1-JDH1-C0G0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"677\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Abbotsford News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D4JV</classCode><className>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000112</classCode><className>ARRESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(\"KLM-V\") - Expands Vidette Gold Project in BC and Reports Exploration - Results</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kermode Resources Ltd. (\"Kermode\" or the \"Company\") reports results from the recent field programs at the Vidette Lake gold project (\"Vidette\") in British Columbia, advises it has expanded the Vidette land package, and provides notice it has satisfied the 2021 work requirements at Vidette.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Increases to Land Position</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During 2021, additional mineral claims were acquired for strategic reasons. The new claims staked and purchased bring the contiguous land package to an area of 4,394.15ha (44 sq.km.). All new claims are within the boundary of the original Area of Mutual Agreement as per the contract with Kermode.</p><p>The new claims (named X East and Yard West respectively) connect the original claim blocks X and Yard, and cover a copper trend (identified in soil sampling from 1973 with values up to 680ppm Cu). This trend appears to be oriented to the northwest towards the copper anomalies at X East. This trend is obscured by a cap of Miocene-aged basalt which mutes the geochemical and structural continuation of this trend; however, a high gravity zone identified through regional airborne data generated by Geoscience BC can be seen continuing under the cap rock as per the exploration concept that originally motivated field work at the project. The new X East and Yard West cover this target area.</p><p>The Amy Claims were purchased in May 2021(40.54ha). These claims were worked historically as part of the wider gold mining efforts in the Vidette area, and small adits were sunk to chase gold-hosting quartz-carbonate veins. The Amy purchase included assay results of samples collected by the previous owner in 2021, which were anomalous in copper and gold. Neither Kermode nor the vendor were involved in this program, so we had no oversight over the quality assurance procedures and will not report the results in detail.</p><p>Figure 1: Map of claim blocks constituting the project.</p><p>After acquiring the Amy claims, Kermode added two additional claims that host the \"Vid 27\" mineral showing, which historically has reported an assay of 4.8 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold, 8.9 g/t silver and 0.35% copper from quartz- carbonate veins. The new claims staked and purchased at Amy provide opportunity for Kermode to explore for high-grade gold at surface.</p><p>All of the historical work and conclusions described above were carried out by arm's length third parties. Kermode has no information about the mining or assay methods used, or whether the work was carried out under the supervision of a Qualified Person as that term is defined in NI43-101. These historical records should not be relied upon without further work being carried out at and around Eastgate under the supervision of a Qualified Person.</p><p>2020 Rock Sampling Results</p><p>Kermode reports highlight of results from the 2020 field work previously included in the technical report from March 15, 2021, titled \"TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE VIDETTE LAKE PROJECT: THE X AND YARD CLAIM GROUPS\" by James Gregory Davison, MSc, PGeo (BC) as follows.</p><p>Figure 2: From the X claim, sample #108058 was collected at</p><p>Figure 3: From the Yard claim, sample #108056 collected at</p><p>As in the Technical Report, James Gregory Davison describes the location of this sample as follows, \"... sampling of metavolcanic or gabbroic rocks was conducted further east on the Yard property where outcrops were very limited by overburden cover and primarily comprised of subcrop or frost-heave material.\"</p><p>2021 Exploration Results</p><p>In May 2021, 95 soil samples were collected from the Amy and Yard targets and returned from 28.2ppm to 474ppm copper and then from trace to 120 parts per billion gold. This anomaly was consistent over 770 meters and aligned with the compiled historical data through the Vidette area, creating a corridor with a total length of 4.7 kilometers before the trend is obscured by a cap of Miocene basalts. A ground magnetic survey was completed over the Yard-Amy soil grids and showed correlation between magnetic highs and the elevated copper-in-soil levels.</p><p>Figure 4: Detailed view of 2021 geophysical and geochemical results.</p><p>Further work in 2021 was limited due to the Sparks Lake Forest Fire that placed the entire valley under an evacuation order. A site visit in October 2021 has shown that around 75% of the forest on the property has burned away, with access still limited due to municipal and logging crews on site fixing roads and powerlines. The company plans to conduct further soil, geophysical and geological survey work in 2022.</p><p>Andy Randell, project vendor and consulting geologist, said the following. \"These results, although limited by the fires, are in-line with our predictions of the geological model and further establish the southern extent of a trend that runs for 17 kilometers from Yard area to the X claim block, where it outcrops again. The copper anomaly appears to form a backbone with auriferous quartz veins radiating off at low angles like ribs in a herringbone pattern, which is based on the concept of a Reidel shear. This regional geological concept provides a framework to estimate vectors for mineralization as we work towards a discovery at Vidette. We plan to spend more time on the site following up on areas where we know of quartz showings that we have not yet sampled.\"</p><p>Kermode CEO Peter Bell says, \"Andy and his team do high-quality exploration work. I am grateful to be working with them on this exploration project and am hungry to do more work with them. On behalf of Kermode shareholders, I say thank you to Andy for agreeing to a reduced field work budget this year.\"</p><p>The Vidette Project</p><p>The target development and hypothesis for renewed exploration in the area was tied to a recent 'QUEST' airborne gravity survey which showed a correlation between ridges of \"gravity highs\" and the occurrence of low-sulphidation vein systems within the Spences Bridge Gold Belt. This methodology has been applied to the Yard and X properties.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>The technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Mr. Andy Randell, P.
