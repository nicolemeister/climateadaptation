A massive<br/>forest fire has been licking at its edges for more than a week. And<br/>officials fears high winds would whip up the flames today turning<br/>the community of 15,000 into a fire storm. But the winds never came<br/>and the town is safe for now. Salmon Arm sits in the midst of the<br/>Rocky Mountains east of Kamloops. CTV's Jed Kahane is there.</p><p>JED KAHANE [Reporter]: In the hills above Salmon Arm, there are<br/>so many fires burning it's impossible to fight them all on the<br/>ground. The bulk of the attack is coming from the air, more than a<br/>dozen helicopters and water bombers trying frantically to stop the<br/>flames from spreading. As dawn broke, the forecast held out little<br/>hope for anything but disaster. It called for winds gusting up to<br/>80 kilometres an hour, enough to push the fire right through the<br/>town.</p><p>KEN TEBO [Salmon Arm Fire Chief]: It's just about virtually<br/>impossible to stop by anybody.</p><p>KAHANE: That's why emergency officials ordered half the<br/>population to pack up and leave. Six thousand people headed for<br/>safety in nearby towns.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN [1]: We took our clothes and some food and,<br/>you know, things that are irreplaceable and we just left everything<br/>else in Salmon Arm.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN [1]: I just don't want all my stuff to be<br/>burned.</p><p>KAHANE: Others crammed into this trailer park, mapping the course<br/>of the fire and worrying about their homes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN [2]: Just scary thinking about it. You know we<br/>moved up here in February and just bought this home. You know and<br/>we might not have a home.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN [2]: All you can do is just pray that the<br/>winds won't appear and the fire will go the other way.</p><p>KAHANE: By midday their prayers were answered. The strong winds<br/>never came.</p><p>MITZI BUSHNELL [BC Fire Service]: It's definitely good news.<br/>They're downscaling the closed frontal system coming in with the<br/>really strong winds. It doesn't sound to be quite so bad now.</p><p>KAHANE: Yet despite the break in the weather, the fight to save<br/>Salmon Arm is far from over. It hasn't rained here in nearly three<br/>weeks and the hot dry weather is expected to continue. Everyone<br/>here knows if the winds pick up the town will be in danger once<br/>again. That's why some people defied the evacuation order and<br/>stayed behind to protect their homes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN [3]: We've been twelve hours a day putting out<br/>fires on the edges of the fields.</p><p>KAHANE: And there is still danger. That's why the evacuation<br/>order is being maintained and could last for days.</p><p>SGT DON BINDON [RCMP]: Fires before which didn't appear to be<br/>particularly threatening as last week showed in fact can turn on us<br/>very quickly.</p><p>KAHANE: In case that happens, the armed forces are now setting up<br/>camp. The rest of the town is still on alert, ready to pack up on<br/>a moment's notice. And they'll stay that way as long as the town is<br/>threatened.

''It was very smoky for firefighters to look and establish the fire perimeter.''</p><p>Seventy firefighters were on the ground along with 12 pieces of heavy equipment, several water bombers, three helicopters and help from volunteer firefighters.</p><p>Officials also closed Highway 55 as of early Monday afternoon, with traffic being re-routed through the old Canwood highway.</p><p>Provincial firefighters were also battling a blaze located in the Fort a la Corne provincial forest, about 60 kilometres east of Prince Albert.</p><p>Krayetski said the fire started around 4 p.m. Sunday, and spread to cover 200 hectares of forest land.</p><p>She said the fire also came close to the Shore Gold exploration site, but a fire break was put around the main camp as fire crews fought off the blaze.</p><p>Joe Dickson, manager of investor relations for Shore Gold, said the company was watching the fire's progress with cautious optimism, adding that the camp is not currently in use.</p><p>''From what we understand and the information the ministry has given us, the fire is north of us,'' he said.</p><p>Provincial fire commissioner Duane McKay said one of the large issues being dealt with is the amount of smoke produced by the fires, especially the one near Canwood.</p><p>McKay said health officials are helping them to pass information out to those who are living in the area of the fires about the effects of inhaling the smoke.</p><p>The total number of forest fires the province has dealt with this year stands at 248, up 60 fires over this time last year. Fire conditions in the Prince Albert area are currently listed as moderate, an upgrade over the recent spate of extremely dry conditions.</p><p>By Monday, most of the people who had been evacuated from their rural homes near Canwood were allowed to return to their homes.</p><p>No one has been hurt but there has been property damage.</p><p>Tanya Almen lost three buildings on her property but her house was not among them.</p><p>''It's depressing but it hasn't hit home yet,'' she said.

She believes in poetry and the power of one person and one instrument, accompanying herself with a remarkable lyrical fingerpicking guitar style.</p><p>Her performances capture audiences with grace and intimacy, whether the setting is a living room, a festival stage, or the bar car of a passenger train. Caspi loves the landscapes of her travels, and while weaving them into her songs, she has also been portraying them on canvases, painting one-of-a-kind works of art inspired by the rich scenery she sees on tour.</p><p>She's been on the road throughout Canada and the U.S. for the past year and a half promoting her latest album, Forest Fire, which is a collection of songs about burning things down and building them up again.</p><p>When the words get heavy, they are held up to the light of love and gratitude. Caspi strives to be unafraid, to embolden quieted voices, to tell the truth above all else.</p><p>Caspi has played at the Blue Skies Music Festival, the Ottawa Grassroots Festival, the Shelter Valley Folk Festival, the Kingsville Folk Music Festival and the Summerfolk Festival in Ontario, ArtsWells in British Columbia, and the Deep Roots Music Festival and Harmony Bazaar Festival in Nova Scotia, as well as concert series including the Circle of Friends Coffeehouse in Franklin, MA, Six String Concerts in Columbus, OH, the me&amp;amp;thee coffeehouse in Marblehead, MA, and John Platt's On Your Radar in NYC.</p><p>She has performed in Chilliwack in the past at Tractorgrease, but this is her first time playing the Acoustic Emporium series.</p><p>The show is Saturday, Feb. 9 at Acoustic Emporium (45892 Wellington Ave.) at 7 p.m. Admission: $15.

Lawmaker Facing 2 Decades in Prison Says She\u2019s Been Treated Worse Than Jan. 6 Rioters Attorneys for U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver say felony charges against her are part of a politically motivated effort by the Trump administration to punish her for overseeing immigration enforcement. In a series of court filings submitted late Friday, McIver\u2019s legal team called the charges unconstitutional and accused federal prosecutors of trying to silence congressional oversight of immigration policy. Her attorneys asked the court to dismiss the case or allow discovery and a hearing to investigate the government\u2019s motives. McIver was indicted on three counts related to a May 9 oversight visit to Delaney Hall, a privately operated immigration detention center in Newark under contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The charges include three counts of assaulting, resisting and obstructing federal officers. The indictment, issued June 10, accuses the congresswoman of striking and pushing federal agents during a chaotic encounter at Delaney Hall. If convicted, McIver could face up to 17 years in federal prison. McIver and fellow Democratic lawmakers Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez were conducting a legally authorized congressional inspection when ICE agents attempted to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, according to the filings. McIver\u2019s legal team says the situation escalated only after ICE and Department of Homeland Security agents entered a crowd of civilians to detain Baraka, triggering a scuffle. They argue McIver was performing her constitutional duties and reacted defensively in a chaotic scene instigated by federal agents. No officers were injured. In one motion, McIver\u2019s attorneys asked the court to dismiss the charges, citing legislative immunity under the Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate Clause.            \u2014 Hat tip: LP [Return to headlines]   New GPS Data Reveals Exactly Who Showed Up at White House Protests Dark-money-funded leftist NGOs were at it again this weekend, attempting to stage a color-revolution-style regime change in Washington, D.C., right outside the White House.

Delulu, tradwife, broligarcy, and lewk, have all been added because experts believe the words will not be just a fad, but will have linguistic staying power. Skibidi is also there amongst them.

Leaders from France, Germany, the UK, Italy, and Finland, along with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and NATO secretary general Mark Rutte, will come with the intention of showing support for the Ukrainian president in the face of the demands that Moscow placed on the table in Alaska last week. The only one arriving with a distinct profile is Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, who in recent days has positioned herself as a bridge between Brussels and the White House, rather than a mere extra in a process in which Europe does not set the pace. The trip leaves a bitter taste. Many of the leaders presenting themselves today in Washington are the same ones who for three years insisted on prolonging the war machine without measuring its human or financial cost. Now, upon landing in the United States, they only have two options, both unfavorable for their image. If they join a path towards peace, they will do so belatedly and in evident contradiction with their previous speeches. If they instead press Trump to keep military funding, it will show only stubbornness and a delusional refusal to face the fact that this strategy has already failed.            \u2014 Hat tip: Reader from Chicago [Return to headlines]   Belgium: Brussels Murder Rate Soars to Second-Highest in EU As Brussels grapples with a surge in violent crime, new figures place the Belgian capital among the most dangerous regions in the European Union.

Only one member survived, and that was because he was moving the unit's truck at the time, authorities said.</p><p>The deaths plunged the town into mourning, and Arizona's governor called it \"as dark a day I can remember\" and ordered flags at half-mast.</p><p>The lightning-sparked fire - which had exploded to about 35 square kilometres by Monday morning - destroyed about 50 homes and threatened 250 others in and around Yarnell, a town of 700 people in the mountains about 135 kilometres northwest of Phoenix, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Department said.</p><p>Residents huddled in shelters and restaurants, watching their homes burn as flames lit up the night in the forest above the town.</p><p>It was unclear exactly how the firefighters became trapped. Southwest incident team leader Clay Templin said the crew and its commanders were following safety protocols, and it appears the fire's erratic nature overwhelmed them.</p><p>Brian Klimowski, meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service's Flagstaff office, said there was a sudden increase and shift in wind around the time of the tragedy. It's not known how powerful the winds were, but they were enough to cause the fire to grow from 200 acres to about 2,000 in a few hours.</p><p>The United States has 110 Hotshot crews, according to the U.S. Forest Service website. They typically have about 20 members each. As a last-resort effort at survival, members are trained to dig into the ground and cover themselves with a one-man, bag-like shelter made of fire-resistant material, Fraijo said.</p><p>\"It's an extreme measure that's taken under the absolute worst conditions,\" Fraijo said.</p><p>The flames apparently enveloped the shelters. Autopsies were scheduled to determine how the firefighters died.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2013070224811786</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58T6-K811-JDV5-F3CG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"380\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

We've got a number of homesteads that are in the park.''</p><p>Fire officials have repeatedly defended their decision to let the fire in Tweedsmuir Park, about 320 kilometres northwest of Vancouver, burn.</p><p>It broke out in June on a steep area that was too dangerous for firefighters on the ground the access. A waterbomber assault on the early stages of the blaze was also ineffective because of the fire's location.</p><p>B.C. Forests Minister Mike de Jong said Friday he understands the concerns of aboriginals.</p><p>\"Of course they're upset,'' he said. \"If things that are of importance to someone are lost, you would expect them to be upset.''</p><p>Officials will conduct a review of how the fire was handled but de Jong said the fire situation in Tweedsmuir Park was a long time coming.</p><p>The park is Ground Zero for the pine beetle infestation that has damaged large tracts of B.C. forest.</p><p>De Jong said for 10 years, the infestation has been killing off trees, leaving tinder-dry dead trees perfect for forest fire fuel.</p><p>When the infestation first broke out, the then-NDP government originally contracted a forestry company to log the damaged trees. But the contract was eventually cancelled, leaving the beetles to spread and resulting in a strongly-worded court judgment against the province.</p><p>The beetle damage, the difficulties fighting the fire in the steep terrain of the park, and half a century of efforts to stamp out forest fires has meant there's a lot of fuel on the forest floor, de Jong said.</p><p>\"We have to address that,'' he said. \"But we're not going to change the fuel load issue overnight and things like prescribed burns are part of the recipe for addressing it.</p><p>\"But again, you have to make a choice. Do we have some smoke in the spring or the fall or a hell of a lot more smoke in August when it's more dangerous.</p><p>\"I know what I prefer.''</p><p>A report into the devastating fire season last year recommended the province do controlled burns and possibly some selective logging of provincial parks in an effort to reduce the dead wood and other forest debris. However, such actions are strongly opposed by environmental groups.</p><p>The Tweedsmuir Park fire, now known as the Lonesome Lake fire, exploded last week when winds whipped it up and it has continued to grow steadily all week. By Friday, it was estimated to be about 160 square kilometres in size, up from 140 square kilometres the day before.</p><p>There are about 100 residences on Charlotte Lake, all but 12 of them summer homes. Sixty people have been evacuated but have been allowed back periodically to check on their properties and to pack out more belongings.</p><p>\"It's a very difficult fire,'' said Jim Price, the superintendent of the forest protection branch of the Ministry of Forests.</p><p>\"Our crews are working very hard on the fire and they're working with the communities in the area on keeping them informed on what we're doing out there.''</p><p>At times, the fire has been classified a Rank 6, the worst of its kind.</p><p>Rank 6 fires are characterized by \"what we call flame lanes 400 feet above the trees themselves,'' said Price.</p><p>\"Sometimes it creates its own weather. Sometimes it will take large chunks of trees, throwing them in the air hundreds of feet, maybe even thousands of feet.</p><p>\"It's a very devastating and energy-packed situation that we're aware of and when that happens, like I say, you have to make sure that all of our crews are safe.''</p><p>Another 1,300 people in the Nimpo Lake area of the Interior have also remained on alert from the 23-square-kilometre Klinaklini Valley fire, which has remained stable in size all week.</p><p>\"It's mostly challenging because of the weather we've had lately,'' said Price. \"It's been very dry and windy and the forecast for this long weekend is for continued warm, dry weather.''</p><p>De Jong said 2004 is shaping up to be even worse than last year in terms of the number of fires and the cost of fighting them.</p><p>There are 369 fires burning in the province compared with 196 at this time last year.</p><p>Fighting them has cost $80 million so far, compared with $34 spent by the same time last year.</p><p>However, last year, August fires in the Okanagan and the Interior destroyed more than 300 homes and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes in Kelowna and Barriere.</p><p>Three aerial tanker pilots were killed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20040730CPCPG4496</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2004</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4D07-T6V0-01G6-9365-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"889\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2004 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>July 30, 2004 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

After accounting for one million tonnes of carbon offsets from forest management projects, net emissions were calculated at 64.5 million tonnes for the year.</p><p>The environment ministry reports that emissions were reduced in oil and gas extraction, road transport, electricity and heat production. Sectors with increases included manufacturing, off-road transport, residential and agriculture.</p><p>B.C.'s strong economy and increasing population work against reductions in greenhouse gas intensity, with 251 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent produced for every million dollars of gross domestic product in 2017. That's a reduction of 2.5 per cent in intensity, showing improved efficiency.</p><p>Evironment Minister George Heyman said the government's CleanBC measures, requiring less carbon-intensive fuels and increasing building efficiency and electric vehicle use, were not in place to influence the 2017 data.</p><p>That was the year that the NDP government replaced the former B.C. Liberal government, which had gone five years without increasing the province's carbon tax, which could also have improved B.C.'s results, Heyman said.</p><p>RELATED: B.C. carbon tax increases to $40 per tonne for 2019</p><p>RELATED: B.C. carbon tax revenues go toward home upgrades</p><p>The official B.C. total does not include the effect of a record year for area burned by wildfires in 2017.

Mining operations have been halted and the main power supply to the minesite has been lost as due to power lines being destroyed by the fires. G indicated to us that it does not expect any material damage to occur to the minesite itself as it is located in a relatively deforested area, giving local crews to the ability to better contain any fire that moves into closer proximity (currently fires are 30km away). We also note the minesite's above surface facilities are largely contained in concrete and non-flammable materials. Additionally, fire crews may perform controlled fires to provide a further buffer zone and fire crews are safeguarding the plant and other important facilities. Goldcorp has maintained a skeleton staff at Musselwhite to monitor essential operations and coordinate with local fire crews. G will provide additional clarity on expected production impacts next week.\"</p><p>Power to the site and lack of personnel the main issue currently. \"Based on our conversation with G, we expect a two to four week production impact as power lines are repaired and employees are gradually returned to the minesite. We estimate four weeks of down time would result in approximately 23kozs of gold production being deferred, and will cause a $0.04/sh reduction to our $3.59/sh 2011FY operating cashflows (OCF). As G currently trades at 15x 2011 price to operating cashflow (P/OCF) we anticipate ~$0.60/sh impact will result. A four week deferral would have minimal impact to our NAV as Musselwhite represents 4% of our DCF for Goldcorp. We were forecasting 273kozs of gold at Musselwhite in 2011.\"</p><p>This is not a Meadowbank event: \"We expect there may be fears that this fire could have similar impacts to that of Agnico-Eagle's (AEM.TO) March 10th, 2011 fire at its Meadowbank mine. However, we point out the fact that AEM's fire started internally in the kitchen facilities while this fire is from an external source whose impacts can be mitigated with advance warning.\"</p><p>GET LIVE BRIEFS IN REALTIME: This report is delayed.

There are quite a few points that Jim and I agree on, although I think he was a little too hard on BC Wildfire Service.</p><p>There is one major point, however, where we differ diametrically.</p><p>READ MORE: Former faller says wildfire response mismanaged</p><p>READ MORE: Wildfire preparation and response inadequate</p><p>READ MORE: 2017 was driest summer ever recorded in Kamloops</p><p>DO MORE: Petition for a referendum on carbon fee-and-dividend for Canada</p><p>That is in his final paragraph where he wrote, \"If the true figures were published, I think you'd have to admit that this catastrophic fire season is not about global warming. It's about mismanagement.\"</p><p>No, Jim, this year's fire season was all about global warming.</p><p>This part of B.C. is about 1.1\u00baC warmer now than it was 100 years ago.</p><p>That's the B.C. Ministry of Environment's estimate . Talk with old-timers about how we don't get the -40\u00baC winters like we used to and they will agree.</p><p>Warmer temperatures mean more extreme fire behavior. If you don't believe that, then I have a bridge that I would like to sell you.</p><p>This is important.</p><p>If last summer's extreme fire season was just the result of mismanagement, then if we could just return to the good old days when local loggers took the lead on fighting forest fires, then all would be well.</p><p>On the other hand, if climate change was the major factor, then in coming years we can expect to see more of the same and even worse.</p><p>The Future Forests Strategy done for the Kamloops Timber Area a few years ago predicted that, with climate change, there will be bunch grass and sagebrush extending to north of Clearwater Lake by 2080.</p><p>In other words, all the trees we see today on the floor of the North Thompson Valley will be gone - or at least highly stressed.</p><p>Where will they go? The most likely scenario will be fire.</p><p>Last week's Fire Prevention Week supplement briefly mentioned the Peshtigo Fire , the most devastating forest forest fire in American history.</p><p>On Oct. 8, 1871, it roared through northeast Wisconsin, burning 16 towns, killing 1,200 to 2,500 people (estimates only, because so many records were lost), and destroying about 500,000 ha of forest.</p><p>The town of Peshtigo was burned to the ground within one hour. The firestorm created such strong winds that rail cars and homes were thrown into the air.</p><p>We don't hear about the Peshtigo Fire because, 400 km to the south, the Great Chicago Fire began the same day, killing 300 and destroying nine sq. km of the city.</p><p>Also that same day, the towns of Holland, Manistee and Port Huron, Michigan burned.</p><p>The following day, Oct. 9, fire swept through the downtown area of Urbana, Illinois, about 230 km south of Chicago.</p><p>That complex of fires was an extreme event and we haven't had anything like if for over 100 years.</p><p>Let's say that it was a one in 200 year event when it happened.</p><p>What is the probability that something similar will happen now? One in 100 years? One in 50?</p><p>If we accept that climate change is real, then we also need to accept that the probability of such extreme events has increased and will continue to increase.</p><p>In other words, we ain't seen nothing yet.</p><p>As people who live in a forested area, we should be concerned.</p><p>What kind of emergency response system will we need to cope?</p><p>Lamberton is correct in that we need to get away from this over-reliance on centralized systems.</p><p>If a forest fire can destroy a town in an hour, then we can't rely on Victoria to provide help in time.</p><p>Steve Murray and the volunteer fire crew that formed spontaneously in Upper Clearwater last summer have the right idea, although I think even they are a little daunted as they realize the challenge they face.</p><p>The fact is, every town in Canada should have its own well-organized and properly funded civil defense organization. Climate change will bring us not just increased forest fires, but also flooding, windstorms and other calamities.</p><p>A million dollars spent on forest fuel reduction around communities is all very well, but in 20 years most of the effect will be gone. A million dollars spent on sprinkler systems, pumps and ongoing training on how to use them will still be of value 20 years later.</p><p>We also need to get away from this over-reliance on evacuating people everywhere.</p><p>Last summer, over 45,000 people were evacuated due to wildfires in B.C.</p><p>Although the host communities were overwhelmingly welcoming, experience elsewhere has shown that that welcome quickly wears off if the evacuees keep coming back or stay too long.</p><p>There is also the problem that the host communities can be ordered evacuated themselves.</p><p>Last summer, many people were evacuated to Prince George. That city, however, is rated as having a greater risk of wildfire damage than was Fort McMurray.</p><p>It would be far better if conditions were created that would allow the residents of communities, small and large, to stay in those communities.</p><p>That would mean creating refuges in schools, hospitals and so on where the residents could take shelter.</p><p>When you consider that such refuges might need to be able to withstand hurricane-force winds in a firestorm, it becomes apparent that the task is not trivial.</p><p>Nevertheless, it would be better to be in a building that was half-prepared than to be caught by a forest fire out on the highway while trying to evacuate.</p><p>Surviving human-caused climate change requires that we think differently. Learning new ways to deal with potentially catastrophic forest fires would be a good place for us to start.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLETME-3450222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLETME2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PP3-5JK1-F105-6369-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438212</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"961\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Clearwater Times (N.

Approximately 270 students discovered more about logging, wood products and safety, aging and forest art, wildfire and forest health. There was a free lunch provided by Kalesnikoff Lumber and a scavenger hunt too.</p><p>First established in the 1920s as Forest Fire Prevention Week, the awareness campaign has grown to include the many layers of forest management and is now known as National Forest Week, which is co-ordinated nationally by the Canadian Institute of Forestry and in B.C. by the National Forest Week BC Coalition, a group of volunteers from the Association of BC Forest Professionals.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-3672655</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDP-XWY1-F103-327S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"335\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nelson Star</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 4, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp;

The Southern Lake forest is a very old, very mature forest and we're very concerned about that risk creating an interface fire,\" he told reporters on April 2. \"That's exactly why we chose Operation Nanook to go right in that place.\"</p><p>Streicker, whose riding includes Southern Lakes, said he has received a report that pinpoints sensitive areas where fires could start. A capital plan would be based off the research. He said the findings could eventually be released.</p><p>The idea would be to gradually turn a coniferous forest into a more deciduous one, Streicker said. The work would be ongoing.</p><p>\"The fire risk is very different across those two.\"</p><p>The issue came up during question period, with Yukon Party MLA Brad Cathers asking what strategies the Liberals are working with to curb future fires, including targeted harvesting of coniferous trees and increasing farmland, which can provide a firebreak.</p><p>Streicker said he's been working with Ministers Ranj Pillai and Richard Mostyn to figure out how to lessen fuel loads and turn it into biomass.</p><p>\"We are doing many things. We are rebuilding the Whitehorse air tanker base starting this year. We have lined up Operation Nanook with the Canadian military to happen this spring so that we can work with our firefighters as part of that exercise. There is a range of things that we're doing.\"</p><p>In response to Cathers' question about farmland, Pillai, minister of energy, mines and resources, told the legislative assembly about an agricultural policy update.</p><p>\"It has been about 10 years since we have had a renewal in our agricultural policy work. Our team is going back out for discussions with the Yukon Agricultural Association, Growers of Organic Food Yukon and others. There is a language that we are looking to ground-truth, and this is really about what happens with agricultural lands, and therefore, that will define how we develop in our near future,\" he said.</p><p>Contact Julien Gignac at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:julien.gignac@yukon-news.com\">julien.gignac@yukon-news.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-3779584</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVK-G1K1-F103-31JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"377\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Yukon News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST000DSFN</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000183</classCode><className>BIOMASS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N926130GQ</classCode><className>ENERGY DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST00095A9</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST000DSFN</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000183</classCode><className>BIOMASS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000697</classCode><className>FARMERS &amp; RANCHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N926130GQ</classCode><className>ENERGY DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000049</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST00095A9</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX356</classCode><className>WHITEHORSE, YT, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS178</classCode><className>YUKON TERRITORY, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

''If the assessment comes back where there is a concern, then we'll have to have a meeting right away to tell people what we're going to do as a government.''</p><p>At a community meeting attended by about 40 residents Tuesday, some said forest charred by the blaze is no longer soaking up rain and the run-off is clogging ditches, damaging driveways and running into wells.</p><p>Adrian Fuller, district manager with the Environment Department's monitoring and compliance division, said inspectors will examine the extent of erosion and siltation. He said the initial survey would also determine whether the wells in question are drilled or dug.</p><p>Fuller said water sources from drilled wells are usually deeper while,those in dug wells are closer to the ground, which could pose a risk.</p><p>''But if wells are properly constructed, there shouldn't be any problem with any siltation issues or overland flow ... because they are all supposed to be designed to prevent any siltation from getting into the well,'' said Fuller.</p><p>He added the assessment should be completed by the end of next week, at which time officials will have a better idea if additional action is needed.</p><p>Dooks, who represents the area in the legislature, said he would distribute a questionnaire to determine the extent of problems faced by homeowners before taking the findings to the government about possible assistance.</p><p>''We want the survey completed first ... and at that time, if it warrants attention by government, I'll be calling on my colleagues to bring some support there,'' he said.</p><p>The fire destroyed more 1,900 hectares and forced the evacuation of about 5,000 people.</p><p>Only two homes were lost in the blaze.</p><p>The bill for fighting the fire is estimated to be as high as $800,000.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20080827CPCPA0987</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4T9T-TDN0-TX4V-K1CG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"370\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"08\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>August 27, 2008 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The four firefighters from Golden are highly skilled in wildfire and sprinkler protection, and worked to keep homes in the area safe. They took along Engine 5 for their protection duties.</p><p>Sending firefighters to protect homes in areas affected by wildfire is something Golden Fire Rescue deputy Chief Mike Pecora says they do every year.</p><p>\"Whenever the province calls, we go,\" he said. \"We have the proper truck, and we have the properly qualified crew.\"</p><p>Although the team of four left Golden, the municipality still had adequate firefighters and resources on hand in case of emergency. The fire hall has the most firefighters it has seen in a long time working for Golden Fire Rescue, leaving 21 qualified firefighters to help at home.</p><p>\"Normally we would only send one or two guys. We have the biggest crew we've ever had,\" Pecora said, adding that if needed, he could make a call and the truck would return home in the same day.</p><p>The Eagle Bluff fire is located approximately 10 kilometres southeast of Okanagan Falls, and is 2,632 hectrares in size. It was discovered on Sunday, August 4.</p><p>Previous evacuation orders have been rescinded, and the four firefighters have returned home to Golden.</p><p>There are currently 160 firefighters working on the blaze, alongside 14 helicopters, and 19 heavy equipment. During the day, 145 firefighters fight the fire, and 47 work overnight. An incident management team is also in place.</p><p>The structure protection teams are no longer stationed through communities as the risk has decreased in those areas, and the fire continues to burn away from communities.</p><p>Golden Fire Rescue is constantly working on certifiying and qualifying its members. Recently, BC Wildfire Service trained seven new members, qualifying them to fight wildfires for the province.</p><p>Golden has its own structure protection unit, which would be used to protect homes and buildings from a wildfire. The unit is for use in the municipality, Area A, and Revelstoke.</p><p>\"That actually stays here unless the province calls,\" Pecora said.</p><p>Last year, firefighters LaRoy and Perry joined two Invermere firefighters at the Meachen Creek fire near Kimberley.

Some are insured and some aren't, but all want to know where they can go for help in rebuilding.</p><p>\"We lost our homes because of the neglect of Alberta Forestry,'' said Mary Giselbrecht, whose four-year-old home was reduced to a basement full of twisted metal and charred rubble.</p><p>\"Is Klein going to pay for us to eat out all the time? The wear and tear on our vehicles? Our phone bills? Mental anguish and whatever else?''</p><p>Her neighbour Barb Romaniuk, now living with her son after her home was burned out, agrees.</p><p>\"If we were there with a vehicle and a water truck we could have saved it.

But Monday's windy weather took matters out of their hands.</p><p>\"There wasn't man or beast that could have stopped that fire that night.''</p><p>Back in Edmonton, Klein said some kind of relief will be considered.</p><p>\"Certain criteria apply to the declaration of a disaster, and we will have to look at that and make that declaration,'' he said.</p><p>\"Then we have to decide the extent of the damage and the extent to which we are able to compensate.''</p><p>Some provincial money is available under the state of emergency declared by the local municipal district, said disaster services official Greg Gramiak.</p><p>The money is available to temporarily house those left homeless by the fire. It may also be used to help the residents rebuild.</p><p>\"That possibility is there.''</p><p>Dennis Quintilio, fire behaviour specialist for the Alberta government, said the Chisholm losses were only the second time in 60 years that the Alberta Forest Service has been unable to save homes threatened by a forest fire.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-200105300252</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:46YX-VM60-01G6-83KB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>May 30, 2001 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>ALBERTA FOREST SERVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096UW</classCode><className>HOMEOWNERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DFTB</classCode><className>STATES OF EMERGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Fire chief Darby Allen said there have been no reports of serious injuries.</p><p>---</p><p>PM TRUDEAU SET TO NAME DATE FOR 'THREE AMIGOS' SUMMIT</p><p>Federal sources say Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will formalize the date for the so-called Three Amigos summit at a press conference on Thursday. The summit, which draws together the leaders of Canada, the United States and Mexico, is expected to take place in Ottawa towards the end of June. U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to address Parliament right after the summit.</p><p>---</p><p>MOUNTIE REACHES SETTLEMENT IN HARASSMENT CASE</p><p>A British Columbia Mountie whose sexual harassment lawsuit against the RCMP prompted similar cases across the country has reached an out-of court settlement with the force. Cpl. Catherine Galliford, 49, said she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after going on sick leave in 2006 and was mentally prepared to face a court battle next year before being blindsided by the settlement.</p><p>---</p><p>KELLY ELLARD DENIED DAY PAROLE</p><p>A young woman serving a life sentence for second-degree murder has for the first time taken responsibility for the death of a 14-year-old Vancouver Island girl almost two decades ago, but Kelly Ellard's confession wasn't enough to earn her day parole. In delivering the board's decision, a member commended her for accepting more responsibility but noted her admission did not match the facts of her conviction.</p><p>---</p><p>MANITOBA PREMIER APPOINTS 12 MEMBER CABINET</p><p>Progressive Conservative Brian Pallister was sworn in as Manitoba premier Tuesday and fulfilled an election promise to appoint a smaller cabinet. The new premier appointed eight men and four women - a mixture of veterans and rookies - to his inner circle. He pledged to work hard after the April 19 election that saw the Tories oust a NDP government that had been in power for 17 years.</p><p>---</p><p>ONTARIO JAILS TO GET FULL-BODY SCANNERS</p><p>Ontario says it will use advanced technology to crack down on smuggling of contraband into its 26 adult jails and detention centres, becoming the first province in Canada to install full-body scanners at all of its facilities. The scanners will be installed over two years at a cost of $9.5 million, including maintenance over 10 years. The move follows a six-month pilot project at the Toronto South Detention Centre.</p><p>---</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-49ab3a880e4c45c18fd90c7cec06cba7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JP6-2TX1-DY9S-T37C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"449\"/><timeReceived>04:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 4, 2016 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(CP) - Fatigued firefighters and stressed-out residents resigned themselves Saturday to a long campaign as a forest fire that as plagued this Okanagan city for 11 days expanded overnight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fanned by high winds amid low humidity and temperatures in the mid-30s, the fire swelled east of the city, growing by 500 hectares to 5,500 hectares.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The new front forced crews to retreat hastily, officials said.</p><p>The B.C. Forest Service took some solace, though, from fire crews' success in holding back flames on the north and south fronts of the fire, which has raced through pine and spruce trees and tinder-dry underbrush.</p><p>Firefighters, coping with blisters on their feet and energy-sapping dehydration, maintained their strongest front on the west side closest to the city, where they have constructed fire guards.</p><p>Their efforts are being applauded by area residents in a simple touching gesture - yellow ribbons tied to car aerials.</p><p>On the north and south fronts, about 2,300 residents were on 10-minute evacuation alert, while crews began to rebuild fire guards lost to earlier advances of the fire.</p><p>Forest service officials estimate total firefighting costs exceed $3 million and are mounting by about $200,000 a day.</p><p>\"Our goal is to corral it,'' forest resource officer Dennis Gaudry said.</p><p>\"We're making gains, slowly but surely. It's going to be a long time. We need a weather change.''</p><p>Residents are hungry for any word on the fire's progress so they can clear out quickly if necessary.</p><p>\"We keep going outside to have a look, listen to the radio 24 hours a day and take turns sleeping because we don't know when it's coming,'' said Ron Gust, a carpenter who has lived with his wife and 17-year-old daughter in nearby Naramata for five years.</p><p>He and other worried homeowners arrive in a steady stream to a mobile home that fire officials have set up as a local information centre in this fruit-growing and packing community.</p><p>\"It's pretty scary,'' said Linda Smart, a community youth and family worker. \"It's more wearing mentally than anything.''</p><p>At least 18 homes have been destroyed since the fire began July 20. Police continued to investigate their suspicion that the fire was deliberately set.</p><p>A total of 393 fires amid 30,000 hectares were burning in the province Saturday.</p><p>In Washington state, firefighters battling stubborn wildfires turned their attention Saturday to a new, explosive blaze that destroyed several canyon homes and crept to within a few kilometres of Leavenworth.</p><p>The Rat Creek blaze started Friday afternoon in the Icicle Creek canyon south of here, about 50 kilometres from a huge fire that threatened homes near the lakeside resort town of Chelan.</p><p>On Friday night, the Rat Creek fire destroyed 14 buildings along the five-kilometre canyon just south of Leavenworth, the Chelan County sheriff's office said. The homes had been evacuated, and no one was injured.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199407300107</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1994</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:470N-T7Y0-01G6-84DC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"480\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1994 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"1994\"><dateText>July 30, 1994 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLFX</classCode><className>PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DBAT</classCode><className>MOBILE HOMES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

James Johnston of the Lethbridge detatchment.</p><p>Samantha Grant, a spokeswoman for STARS air ambulance, said an 80-year-old woman was flown from the Fort Macleod hospital to Calgary with second-and-third-degree burns.</p><p>All 350 residents of Granum and another 250 people from the surrounding area were sent to neighboring Claresholm as a grass fire burned close to the town, about 130 kilometres south of Calgary.</p><p>However, most were allowed to return home later in the evening after the danger had passed.</p><p>Claresholm Mayor Ernie Patterson said not all residents of the region were as lucky: \"There are some families who have lost their homes. It's just been a calamity.''</p><p>Stan Byers and his wife Clara saw their place outside the village burn to the ground.</p><p>\"I just don't know what we are going to do. Other people get to go home now, but where do we go? Nowhere,'' said a shocked Stan Byers. \"I just stood there looking for that ray of hope the fire would pass by the house.''</p><p>Patterson said firefighting efforts and a lucky shift in the wind stopped the blaze right on the edge of Granum.</p><p>\"We've had no snow,'' Patterson said of local conditions. \"The forest fire hazard is extremely high.''</p><p>The blaze, which fire officials said had burned 100 square kilometres of land, also forced the closure of Highway 2 and prompted women and children to flee the Keho Hutterite colony.</p><p>It was a sad scene at the Claresholm high school, where about 60 evacuees awaited the chance to return to Granum. Many hugged and cried as they consoled each other.</p><p>\"I'm holding out hope, that's all I can do,'' said long-time Granum resident Ray Raine, who took his dog Bernie with him as he fled his home.</p><p>Eileen Cooper of Barons, a town just east of Granum, said the fire was an eerie sight.</p><p>\"While the sun was out we could see what seemed like a mixture of billowing sand and smoke. At one time the sun was rust-red,'' she said.</p><p>One of the fires at Hinton, 300 kilometres west of Edmonton, was believed to have started Saturday night when an electrical pole toppled over and was fuelled by winds of up to 80 kilometres an hour.</p><p>Rocky Notnes saw his two-storey log home burn to the ground, along with a garage and several cars.</p><p>\"We just woke up because the house was filling with smoke,'' he said. \"We went outside and saw the fire. The wind was so strong we knew it could come this way, and then as we were speaking, there was just fire literally dropping from the sky.</p><p>\"We headed straight down to the river in the moonlight. It's a miracle that no one was killed.'' Firefighter Perry Hayward said the winds were unbelievably strong.</p><p>\"It was really jumping all over the place. It was bad enough that some residents of Hinton were told to be ready to evacuate at any time if the wind shifted.''</p><p>Most veteran firefighters said they had never worked on a forest fire this late in the year.</p><p>\"I was supposed to be decorating the Christmas tree and then going ice-fishing,'' said Dave Lind of Lac La Biche. \"But it looks like I won't be back for maybe a week or so. We need the winds to calm down before we get this one under control.''</p><p>Evert Smith of Alberta's Land and Forest Service said one of the two fires covered 500 hectares north of the community. The second blaze, about 1,500 hectares in size, blazed about 30 kilometres south of the town.</p><p>Six water tankers, four helicopters and eight ground crews were fighting the fires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199712150008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4706-DYT0-01G6-8395-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"678\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>December 15, 1997 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CEBQ</classCode><className>BURN INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N921100JQ</classCode><className>MAYORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DQD2</classCode><className>AIR MEDICAL TRANSPORT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>N621910CC</classCode><className>AMBULANCE &amp; RESCUE SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STLL000CPD2</classCode><className>LIVESTOCK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DQD2</classCode><className>AIR MEDICAL TRANSPORT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>N621910CC</classCode><className>AMBULANCE &amp; RESCUE SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX429</classCode><className>CALGARY, AB, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They reported that the forest blaze was moving at 'astonishing speed.'<br/> It has since then blazed through an area of over 2,000 hectares and is the worst fire on the island since 1999.<br/><br/> According to security forces in Mallorca, the blaze is still not under control.<br/> Temperatures of around 40 degrees Celsius in the shade combined with high winds are making the fire move faster and it is very difficult to contain. <br/> Apparently there has been virtually no rain in the area for at least two months, making conditions very dry.<br/> 300 firefighters[3] together with fire fighting planes and helicopters have been deployed to douse the flames.<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.euronews.com/2013/07/28/mallorca-hundreds-evacuated-as-forest-fire-rages-out-of-control/\">http://www.euronews.com/2013/07/28/mallorca-hundreds-evacuated-as-forest-fire-rages-out-of-control/</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.majorcadailybulletin.com\">http://www.majorcadailybulletin.com</url>/ [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/07/26/actualidad/1374843030_613572.html\">http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/07/26/actualidad/1374843030_613572.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031375052827679514583</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:590V-9BR1-F03R-N1Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"236\"/><timeReceived>11:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>July 28, 2013 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Rotorcraft</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDI1Rjc4RTRCNEEyNEFEMjlCMTVGODg5OTg3NTZFQzE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkEyRTREQTdBRjkzNDE5OTk4ODAzMEY5MDkzRjlGRTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp; REEFS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000A2MD</classCode><className>BALEARIC ISLANDS, SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Ontario community gains strength and cripples local telecom services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alvin Fiddler, Grand Chief of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents 49 First Nation communities across northern Ontario, said a forest fire burning near the eastern edge of the fly-in community has grown in the past 24 hours.</p><p>He said it has damaged the broadband communications line running through the area, knocking out all phone and internet service.</p><p>Ontario's Ministry of the Solicitor General is working with the Royal Canadian Airforce to fly Pikangikum residents to nearby communities.</p><p>Fiddler said he was hoping at least 1,200 people would be airlifted from the community on Friday.</p><p>However, at the end of the day the military said in a release that 580 people had been evacuated aboard three Hercules aircraft during six flights to surrounding communities including Sioux Lookout and Kapuskasing.</p><p>The release said the military would continue to provide aircraft for further evacuations as needed.</p><p>Fiddler said favourable wind conditions had given residents a respite from heavy smoke on Friday and opened a crucial window for evacuation.</p><p>He noted the list of vulnerable residents includes the elderly, those with respiratory conditions, young children, and anyone else whose presence is required to support them.</p><p>The community, which is 500 kilometres northwest of Thunder Bay, Ont., planned to evacuate roughly 1,600 of its nearly 2,300 residents, Fiddler said.</p><p>However, Solicitor General spokesman Brent Ross said he couldn't confirm the number of potential evacuees, citing the \"fluidity of the situation.\" </p><p>Sioux Lookout is acting as a \"hub airport,\" Ross said in a statement.</p><p>\"Smaller fixed wing aircraft operated by private carriers on behalf of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry will then be used to take the evacuees from Sioux Lookout to Cochrane, which is acting as a host community.\"</p><p>The Ministry of Natural Resources said four waterbombers and 14 ground crews were working to battle the blaze, estimated at around 3,000 hectares.</p><p>Environment Canada has issued a special air quality statement for the Pikangikum area, warning residents could experience symptoms such as coughing, headaches or shortness of breath.</p><p>\"Children, seniors and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk,\" the agency said, adding the northerly winds should help improve conditions in Pikangikum but blow smoke towards communities further south.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Knopf)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This novel about two Dartmouth College students on a canoe trip gone badly awry is partly an ode to the Northern wilderness, partly a survival how-to, and mostly a thriller - suspenseful and gut-wrenching.</p><p>Best friends Wynn and Jack take a late-summer trip to Canada, paddling down a river that winds through lakes and over rapids on its way to Hudson Bay. Like the river, author Peter Heller's plot often takes its time, digressing to describe how the boys fillet a fish or make camp, or what the Northern Lights look like. But don't get lulled: There's action around the bend.</p><p>The two friends, both country boys, are experts in the woods and on the water, where they are self-proclaimed \"minimalists\" - no phones, no frills. They also share \"a literary way of looking at the world,\" and frequently see it through the lenses of Edgar Allan Poe, Virgil, James Dickey and more.</p><p>Their leisurely trip turns into a harrowing dash toward safety when both nature and other people turn violent. Nature dishes up a massive forest fire that bears down on them. The boys smell and hear the blaze long before they see it - the fleeing animals, the drifting smoke, the popping and hissing of trees.</p><p>Meanwhile, human mysteries lurk: Wynn and Jack hear a man and woman arguing on the bank as their canoe glides by in the fog; when they return to warn the couple about the fire, they find nobody there. Later, a man turns up at their camp downriver, alone. Where is the woman?</p><p>Heller, author of previous novels including \"The Dog Stars\" and \"Celine,\" dives deep into the details of wilderness camping - so deep that sometimes you just want to jump ahead and find out what happens. Likewise with his acute and poetic observations of nature. But he is setting the scene and establishing two likable and memorable characters in Wynn and Jack. Each brings a different perspective to the violence and tragedy they encounter.</p><p>River travel has often been a metaphor for writers. At one point early on, as the boys approach some rapids, Heller writes that \"every river story they had ever read was just beneath the surface of their imaginations and must have fired them with extra energy and braced them, too, because at least half of those stories did not have happy endings.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-132c5e055cd84185854f7a2d0b9063a4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W47-V7S1-JBVR-31G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"382\"/><timeReceived>03:37 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 28, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That meant people had to flee 100 kilometres north to Lynn Lake.</p><p>It's a scenario that has been played out several times over the years, with each town helping the other when fire threatens.</p><p>Last summer, a massive fire forced 850 residents of Lynn Lake to seek shelter in Leaf Rapids and Thompson.</p><p>In 1989, more than 1,000 residents from Leaf Rapids bunked with Lynn Lake families when fires forced them to flee their homes.</p><p>Sheldon Lambe, his pregnant wife Margie and 2 1/2-year-old daughter Jessica got one of the last hotel rooms available Sunday night in Lynn Lake.</p><p>\"It's been a pretty harrowing night,'' Lambe said. His wife is already a few days overdue, he added.</p><p>\"We packed whatever we could squeeze in the car, right down to my daughter's Barney.''</p><p>A lightning strike may have started the fire Saturday amid unseasonably hot, dry conditions, according to Epp. However, Bon said forestry officials suspect it was man-made.</p><p>\"The fire started (Saturday) on about 25 hectares or so,'' he said. \"Unfortunately, it got away on the ground crew.''</p><p>By Sunday, the blaze was out of control and had spread over 2,000 hectares. Water bombers that were scheduled to be put away for the winter and routine maintenance were hurried into service.</p><p>People in Leaf Rapids, a town surrounded by dense woods on the banks of the Churchill River, were warned earlier Sunday on the local cable television channel to be prepared to leave.</p><p>\"It looked like thunderclouds,'' Lambe said of the thick smoke enveloping the town.</p><p>There were long lineups at gas pumps as people rushed to gas stations to fill up their vehicles for the hour-long drive north to Lynn Lake.</p><p>When winds started to shift, Epp - who is also the town's emergency co-ordinator - ordered residents to evacuate.</p><p>Lambe, who works at the Hudson Bay Mining Company's Ruttan Mine, said officials closed the mine before the evacuation notice was given.</p><p>And when it came, Lambe's family was ready. Besides clothes, they also packed their wedding videos and pictures - \"things that if they're lost, they're gone forever,'' Lambe said.</p><p>\"I just bought a new house, I'm hoping they can contain it.''</p><p>Volunteers went door-to-door alerting people to leave town and fire trucks cruised the streets blaring the same message.</p><p>Evacuees booked ahead for rooms at Lynn Lake's two hotels. Others were to be put up at the Friendship Centre, the town's high school gym and at private residences, said the centre's Merasty.</p><p>And she was ready for them. \"We'll probably have a good time.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199409190025</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1994</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:470S-H9S0-01G6-81Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"552\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1994 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"1994\"><dateText>September 19, 1994 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>HUDSON BAY MINING &amp; SMELTING CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DPS0</classCode><className>ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES &amp; WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001366</classCode><className>PREGNANCY &amp; CHILDBIRTH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0008X7V</classCode><className>MINES &amp; MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>N447000CC</classCode><className>GAS STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N210000CC</classCode><className>MINING &amp; EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N515120CC</classCode><className>TELEVISION INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX056</classCode><className>WINNIPEG, MB, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS169</classCode><className>MANITOBA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
