JOHN'S, N.L. - A wildfire threatening a town in central Labrador grew suddenly to a raging blaze that advanced two kilometres in about 45 minutes before officials ordered everyone to evacuate Wednesday night, authorities have revealed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">About 750 residents and workers fled Churchill Falls, many driving white-knuckled through a sky-splitting lightning storm toward Happy Valley-Goose Bay, N.L., about three hours away. As of Thursday afternoon, the flames were about six kilometres away from the town, kept at bay by favourable wind conditions and a river, fire officials told reporters.</p><p>\"The risk is if it jumps the river, and the biggest driver of whether it'll jump the river or not is the wind patterns,\" Premier Andrew Furey said during a news conference in St. John's. \"Right now, there's a favourable wind pattern, but we live in Newfoundland and Labrador, winds change all the time.\"</p><p>Blair Adams, with the province's Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture Department, concurred. \"The rain helped us out this morning, but it was relatively short-lived, and we're certainly concerned about the rest of the day.\"</p><p>An emergency order to evacuate Churchill Falls was texted and emailed to residents at about 7:30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, asking them to pack up and leave within 45 minutes. The town is home to about 700 people, most of whom work at the local hydroelectric generating station, which supplies power to Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador.</p><p>Robert Dawe was among those who fled, and he said cars and trucks were bumper to bumper along the remote, two-lane Trans-Labrador Highway as people made their way east to Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Lightning cracked the sky as the vehicles left behind a spiralling cloud of smoke and drove toward torrential rains falling in Happy Valley-Goose Bay.</p><p>\"I wasn't surprised because I know the fire was close,\" Dawe said about the call to evacuate. \"But the wind was blowing it closer to town and it flared up. It was under control, but it got worse really fast.\"</p><p>On Wednesday evening, the province's wildfire dashboard showed the blaze encompassed about seven square kilometres. As of Thursday afternoon, it had more than doubled in size, to 16 square kilometres, officials said.</p><p>Four water bombers, a number of helicopters and 40 fire fighters were all working to douse the flames. Furey said he asked for help from other provinces through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. In the meantime, with all of the province's firefighting resources working in Labrador, he announced a ban on all outdoor fires across the island of Newfoundland and throughout the southern and central region of Labrador.</p><p>\"I know the weather is warm, I know it's nice, I know it's graduation weekend for many,\" Furey said. \"But please, please do not light any fires across the province right now. We just can't risk it.\"</p><p>Jennifer Williams, chief executive of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, said a small crew was still on site at the generating station and production levels were normal. There are plans in place to evacuate those workers if needed, she added.</p><p>Perry Trimper, the Liberal member of the provincial legislature for the region, said earlier Thursday that more than 500 evacuees had checked in with officials in Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Some were given beds at the YMCA, but most had friends and family they were staying with, he said in an interview.</p><p>He said teams of volunteers loaded mattresses into the YMCA on Wednesday night for people fleeing Churchill Falls. Businesses stayed open late to feed them, and residents from all over the community showed up at the YMCA to help out.</p><p>And it all happened in the midst of a raging thunder and rainstorm, he said.</p><p>\"I'll use the word 'apocalyptic,'\" Trimper said. \"It was a storm none of us have ever witnessed before. And to see people coming from their vehicles in this amazing storm, trying to find a place to stay, it was quite an experience.\"</p><p>There were seven active wildfires in Labrador on Thursday. Four, in the central region, were burning out of control. The remaining three, in the western region, were listed on the provincial wildfire dashboard as \"being held,\" which means they were no longer spreading.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 20, 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-cacfc488b16c42138138a7a5b8330826</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C9H-F4G1-DY9S-T0MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"711\"/><timeReceived>02:47 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 20, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(\"Signature\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide an update on its 2024 drill program and provide assay results for the first three diamond drill holes. Drilling so far has been highlighted by a larger halo of near surface mineralization that had previously not been tested for as indicated by LM 24-02 which returned 1.84 grams per tonne gold (\"g/t Au\") over 12 metres (\"m\") and LM 24-03 which returned 1.23 g/t Au over 28 m. The Company has completed 12 of the planned 14 holes and anticipates completing the remainder in early November. With the 2024 drilling program nearing its completion the Company remains on track to deliver its initial NI 43-101 resource in early Spring 2025. The resource estimate is being undertaken by the independent geologic consulting firm of Watts, Griffis and McQuat Limited (WGM).</p><p>As previously announced, the Company's 2024 drill program consists of 14 DDH's for a total of approximately 4,650 metres of drilling. The drilling program was carefully designed to improve our knowledge of the Lingman Lake gold deposit, fill identified data gaps and test new targets identified in our updated geologic model completed earlier this year. The drill program includes continuous core assaying for the entire length of each hole, thereby providing total lithological gold distribution, giving us a much more complete data package about the mineralization contained in and outside the mineralized zones. All new drilling information and assays will be incorporated into the geological modelling to expand and build the Lingman Lake deposit. We look forward to these results informing the resource modelling exercise currently underway.</p><p>We are making very good progress on our 2024 work programs. It is exciting to see the new data coming in to continue building our knowledge of the Lingman Lake Project. With drilling nearly finished and the completion of the logging and assaying we remain well on track to deliver our goal of tabling our maiden NI 43-101 resource in the Spring of 2025. This will be a significant step in demonstrating the potential of the Lingman Lake gold deposit. The merging of the zones and the associated encouraging assays suggest a larger envelope of mineralization around the North Zone than what was previously tested, as historical work was mainly focused on high grade sections of the deposit. We look forward to the implications of this new understanding once fully complied in the spring.\"</p><p>- J. Dan Denbow, CFA - President, CEO and Director</p><p>The largest concentration of historical drilling has been conducted east of a diabase dyke and has identified four zones of mineralization beginning with the 11650 Zone on the southern edge moving north to the South Zone, Central Zone and North Zone. The North and South Zones have been the most consistent with respect to mineralization running proximal to the Quartz-Feldspar- Porphyry (QFP) intrusion contact. It is still undetermined if the 11650 Zone is an independent zone or a splay of the South Zone as it begins to converge into the South Zone east from the diabase dyke.</p><p>Figure 1 is the surface view of the 2024 drill program east of the diabase dike (yellow drill traces) relative to the historical drilling beginning in 1987 up to 2021. Signature's interpretation of the gold zones in the red shading and the QFP body in the yellow shading. Based on the observations from the drill core and the assay results, the gold zones are highlighted on the drill traces in colored rectangles including the newly observed Leopard Zone as well as grade disks representing the assayed results.</p><p>Figure 1. Drilling East of Diabase Dike <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8296/228579_fc\">https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8296/228579_fc</url></p><p>As a result of the Spring mapping program and on-going GIS data and drill compilation, the QFP has been interpreted to be an intrusion that bifurcates going from east to west forming a north and south arm. The intervening area between the two arms displays a more fragmented dyke array resulting in a more complex distribution of gold relative to the Central Zone.</p><p>As the QFP narrows going eastward, the North, South and Central zones converge in the vicinity of DDH LM24-03. This convergence is important in that, as the zones merge, they form a wider mineralized area. This is reflected in DDH LM24-03 where the hole intersected the three zones from 46.0 metres to 111.0 metres with only three metres between the South and Central Zone and the Central and North Zone. We will gain more insight into this trend as we get results from the additional five holes that have been completed east of the diabase dyke where there has been lower drill density to date. The final six holes of the program are on the west side of the diabase dyke. Two are testing the possible extension of the South Zone and the other four in the area of Shoe Lake where there is also lower density of drilling. These are targeting the west extension of the West Zone.</p><p>LM 24-01 and LM 24-02</p><p>Historically, drill holes have been collared south of and drilled north to crosscut the strike of the east-west zones nearly perpendicular. The first two holes of the 2024 program, LM 24-01 and LM 24-02, were designed with an oblique orientation drilling from the southwest to the northeast through the area with the highest drilling density, and near the original 1940s underground workings, as recommended by WGM.</p><p>LM24-01 is the longest hole of our drilling program with a total length of 460 metres at a dip of -50 degrees and an azimuth of 035 degrees. The hole intersected all four zones. In addition, it was designed to test for mineralization north of a unit of glomeroporphyry (leopard rock - LR). In the past, the LR was used as the footwall to the North Zone and drilling was terminated within a few metres into it. The North Zone is in the mafic volcanics that are sandwiched between the northern edge of the QFP and the LR package, which appears to be coincident with higher grade mineralization. The length of LM 24-01 was also designed to test for mineralization north and well into the LR and intersected a narrow quartz vein-silicified shear with gold mineralization, as can be seen in Table 1: Assay Results.</p><p>LM 24-02 was drilled to a total length of 347 metres at a dip of -45 degrees and an azimuth of 035 degrees. The hole intersected mineralization in the Central and North Zones, as can be seen in Table 1. It was not expected to cross the South Zone as it was collared north of the South Zone.</p><p>LM 24-03</p><p>The third DDH of the program, LM 24-03, was focused on confirmation of past drilling, using hole 88-64 as a twin hole in order provide higher confidence to the 1980s drill results for the resource model. Due to the forest fire in 2021, which swept through the outer margins of the camp, core racks housing the historical and 2018 drilling were destroyed. Therefore, this hole was critical to establish a relationship between the 1988 results and current results. The hole was drilled to a total length of 152 metres and sampled for its entire length with one metre sample lengths, while 88-64 was originally selectively sampled. A complete comparison of the results of the twinning of this hole is pending, and although some of the assay results from 88-64 are higher, in general, grades and lithology mimic each other.</p><p>There are several completed holes with results pending that will be providing additional data on the theory of convergence of the main zones to the east.</p><p>Table 1: Assay Results //st LINGMAN LAKE PROJECT Observed Zone From m To m Width Au result DRILL HOLE LM24-01 11650 ZONE AVG 40 43 3m AVG 0.90 g/t Includes 40 41 Grading 2.14 g/t SOUTH ZONE AVG 106 109 3m AVG 2.66 g/t Includes 106 107 Grading 5.71 g/t CENTRAL ZONE AVG 234 241 7 m AVG 1.35 g/t Includes 235 236 Grading 2.77 g/t</p><p>237 238 Grading 4.01 g/t NORTH ZONE AVG 320 326 6 m AVG 3.06 g/t Includes 321 322 Grading 7.23 g/t</p><p>322 323 Grading 9.90 g/t LEOPARD ZONE AVG 421 423 2 m AVG 2.68 g/t Includes 422 423 Grading 4.73 gpt DRILL HOLE LM24-02 CENTRAL ZONE ZONE AVG 13 23 12 m AVG 1.84g/t Includes 14 15 Grading 3.54 g/t</p><p>15 16 Grading 2.29 g/t</p><p>21 22 Grading 5.23 g/t</p><p>22 23 Grading 6.77 g/t NORTH ZONE AVG 137 143 7 m AVG 0.24 g/t LEOPARD ZONE AVG 200 204 4 m AVG 0.30 g/t DRILL HOLE LM24-03 SOUTH ZONE AVG 48 52 4 m AVG 0.27 g/t CENTRAL ZONE AVG 58 79 21 m AVG 0.49 g/t Includes 68 69 Grading 1.50 g/t</p><p>71 72 Grading 1.40 g/t</p><p>73 74 Grading 1.48 g/t</p><p>77 78 Grading 2.10 g/t NORTH ZONE AVG 83 111 28 m AVG 1.23 g/t Includes 87 88 Grading 1.02 g/t</p><p>88 89 Grading 1.68 g/t</p><p>89 90 Grading 1.40 g/t</p><p>92 93 Grading 4.80 g/t</p><p>93 94 Grading 4.47 g/t</p><p>94 95 Grading 5.99 g/t</p><p>99 100 Grading 1.24 g/t</p><p>104 105 Grading 1.10 g/t</p><p>105 106 Grading 2.12 g/t</p><p>108 109 Grading 3.26 g/t</p><p>109 110 Grading 2.04 g/t</p><p>Notes to Table:</p><p>Reported widths are drill intercepts (core lengths).</p><p>Computer modelling of the zones for true widths is pending.</p><p>LM24-01 was drilled at azimuth 035 degrees, dip -50 degrees.</p><p>LM24-02 was drilled at azimuth 035 degrees, dip -45 degrees.</p><p>LM24-03 was drilled at azimuth 360 degrees, dip -45 degrees</p><p>NORTH ZONE strikes at 093 degrees.</p><p>CENTRAL ZONE strikes at 087 degrees.</p><p>SOUTH ZONE strikes at 082 degrees</p><p>All zones dip steeply south 70-80 degrees.</p><p>Option Grant</p><p>The Board of Directors has granted a combined total of 2,750,000 incentive stock options to the Board, Management and Advisors of the Company.

During the past three decades, the average number of forest fires has been about 1,000 fires annually, with an average burnt area of 0.5 ha per fire.</p><p>Longtime wildfire ecologist Robert Gray has been telling us for some time we need to make some changes to our forest practices including more thinning and prescribed burns at low fire intensity.</p><p>Some people in the forest industry are also promoting some changes to our harvesting practices.</p><p>Ian Kerr, owner of West Kootenays, B.C.-based AcreShakerr Contracting, thinks it is important to incentivize pre-commercial thinning, first and second pass thinning, and good stewardship.</p><p>An article in Canadian Forest Industry by Ellen Cools describes how Keer has been transitioning to smaller harvesting equipment that causes less damage during his commercial thinning operations.</p><p>His purchase of a F4 Dion forwarder from Michel Dion, based in St. Augustin-de-Martins, Quebec has allowed him to change everything in terms of not having to build any block roads or trails, or construct landings, and being able to have very dense tree retention without any residual damage.</p><p>\"The forwarder on rubber tracks, very small \u2013 six feet wide, 28 feet long \u2013 can haul either cord wood or short logs (16- to 18-foot ) which meet cut-to-length requirements for local sawmills. The forwarder is so small it can move between trees easily. The F4 Dion has a rubber track with an iron cleat, similar to a snowcat, but smoother, with only one point of contact for traction. As a result, it's very light on the ground and does not squash the root maps in the forest.\"</p><p>Locally Ken Day has also been promoting changing our forest practices as described in a CBC article about a fire that started in the Alex Fraser Research Forest on the afternoon of July 7, 2017.</p><p>More forest thinning is needed which involves removing trees and other vegetation that is dead or slow-growing to make room for new trees and to remove wildfire fuel from the area.</p><p>He goes on to compare us with traditional European forestry practices. They often thin their forests twice when the forest is 15 years old or three times at age 30.</p><p>Sometimes, they even thin forests once more at age 60 and then, when the forest is 80 years old, harvest it. Each of those thinnings puts some fibre into the market as a means of improving the quality of the final harvest and recovering fibre in the interim while the stand is growing.</p><p>READ MORE: FOREST INK: Managing biodiversity in the P.G.

With support from FedEx, International Medical Corps (IMC) created the Principles of Psychological First Aid (PPFA) training to equip first responders with the skills to compassionately support affected individuals and families. Yvonne Groenhout, an ICU nurse and IMC first responder, is one of 5,000 global medical professionals trained on PPFA. The PPFA training enabled Yvonne and so many others to spot people struggling in the aftermath of an emergency and provide them with the support they need to recover and stay healthy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Restoring access to care after tornado destroys clinic</p><p>After a tornado ravaged the Delta Health Center in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, Heart to Heart International (HHI) stepped in to help. With support from FedEx, HHI deployed a disaster team, mobile medical units, and a portable clinic to ensure medical care continuity. The clinic staff, now equipped with secure facilities, aided storm victims and reached elderly patients in remote areas.</p><p>This has given us such an advantage as we work to continue to improve our disaster response efforts.</p><p>Maddy Langemach</p><p>Disaster Response Specialist</p><p>for Heart to Heart International</p><p>Helping to fund the Grassroots Revolution in Canada</p><p>With support from FedEx, GlobalMedic delivered 50+ tons of aid across Canada as part of its Grassroots Revolution - a suite of programs that address chronic emergencies. The deliveries included food, medical supplies, and hygiene items for Hurricane Fiona victims in Atlantic Canada, support for domestic Emergency Food and Hygiene Hub programs, and fire skid units for British Columbia's forest fire relief. FedEx Canadian volunteers chipped in to help, assembling food kits for survivors across the region.</p><p>No-cost trainings bolster disaster management capabilities within at-risk communities</p><p>Team Rubicon aids communities worldwide in disaster preparedness. FedEx helps fund expert exercises, led by FEMA-trained practitioners, to stress-test plans, identify deficiencies, and bolster response capabilities. From simulations to nuclear disaster drills, Team Rubicon empowers communities of all sizes to face any calamity.</p><p>I get to help train communities to better respond, and FedEx helps get us there before that worst day happens.</p><p>Greg Ramoni</p><p>Exercise &amp; Field Leadership Manager,</p><p>Team Rubicon</p><p>A long-term collaboration to deliver aid in Chile</p><p>FedEx delivered 40 tons of aid across Chile in 2023 in partnership with Desaf\u00edo Levantemos Chile. Together we supported rehabilitation projects in fire and f lood-hit areas including rebuilding the Rural Medical Station in Santa Juana. With a network spanning 400 Chilean cities, FedEx has signed on to facilitate charitable transportation for Desaf\u00edo Levantemos Chile on a regular basis.</p><p>FedEx has been one of our strongest logistical allies in dozens of emergencies since 2012. They help us to be more efficient and faster in the transportation \" of donations, reaching more families and entrepreneurs who need to get back on their feet.</p><p>Ignacio Serrano</p><p>Executive Director of Desaf\u00edo</p><p>Levantemos Chile</p><p>All hands on deck to support Turkey after the earthquake</p><p>On February 6, 2023, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey near the Syrian border, followed by aftershocks up to 7.5 magnitude. Tragically, over 50,000 people died, with significant damage to infrastructure including destruction of many homes, businesses, hospitals, and utilities. Nine million individuals were directly affected and three million were displaced.</p><p>FedEx is committed to helping the many communities impacted by the earthquakes during this incredibly difficult time. We are inspired by the heroic work of first responders and humanitarian organizations and grateful to use our global network to donate flights, logistics support, and aid to advance recovery, rebuilding, and relief in the region.</p><p>Raj Subramaniam</p><p>FedEx President and CEO</p><p>FedEx receives OTHERS Award</p><p>FedEx received the OTHERS Award from The Salvation Army, recognizing our commitment to humanitarian efforts worldwide. Named after William Booth's succinct telegram urging service to others, the award highlights the FedEx donation of 22 mobile feeding units to Salvation Army locations globally. This gesture reflects our company's ongoing dedication to disaster relief and aiding communities in need.</p><p>Within hours of the earthquake in Turkey, FedEx began our multidimensional response:</p><p>Donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to aid recovery efforts in Turkey and Syrian communities</p><p>Delivered critical humanitarian supplies from Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen International Airport to Malatya, Turkey, on behalf of the Istanbul Governorship and local municipality</p><p>Flew five consecutive flights from February 17 to 21, which delivered approximately 230 metric tons of relief supplies including tents, blankets, baby items, household supplies, and hygiene kits</p><p>Provided shipping support for Canadian disaster-relief organization GlobalMedic, including the delivery of AquaResponse3 Water Purification Units</p><p>With the help of FedEx, Water Mission shipped five of its Living Water Treatment Systems to Turkey to provide emergency safe water access to those impacted by the devastating earthquakes</p><p>Worked with World Central Kitchen to ship a deployable kitchen unit, kitchen supplies, and operations kits from Madrid, Spain, and Capitol Heights, Maryland, U.S., to Adana, Turkey</p><p>FedEx Cares team members in Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, and Slovenia collected items for the local Red Cross/Red Crescent societies and donated approximately 885 kilos of supplies including new warm clothes and shoes, blankets, hygienic materials, and family tents</p><p>Read more</p><p>Click here to learn about FedEx Cares, our global community engagement program.</p><p><br/>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from FedEx Corporation on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: FedEx Corporation<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/fedex-corporation\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/fedex-corporation</url><br/>Email: info@3blmedia.com </p><p>SOURCE: FedEx Corporation</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/889746/fedex-supports-readiness-response-and-recovery-for-communities-affected-by-disasters-and-other-crises\">press release</url> on accesswire.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FSCWRE-438169631</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCWRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CH4-4VG1-JDJN-624N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411383</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1046\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 ACCESS Newswire Inc.

About 14 millimetres of rain have fallen since Wednesday.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead, crews used helicopters to deal with a fire that has substantially been downgraded because of a favourable change in the weather.\u00a0</p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey said earlier that the Churchill Falls fire has been downgraded to Level 1, a significant drop from the Level 5 and Level 6 categories from earlier this week, when managers fully evacuated the Upper Churchill hydroelectric power plant.\u00a0</p><p>About 750 people were ordered on June 19\u00a0to flee Churchill Falls, a company town that exists to keep Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro's generating station running.</p><p>On Tuesday, the fire had jumped the Churchill River - which had been acting as a natural barrier keeping the flames from reaching the town\u00a0- and prompted an order for the final workers to leave.\u00a0</p><p>While the fire has forced workers off site, the plant is still operating with reduced function. It is being monitored remotely, while\u00a0some limited operations can be done from other locations.\u00a0</p><p>On Wednesday night, Furey posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Wednesday's weather had a positive impact in efforts to fight the fire and it was now a Level 1 fire.</p><p>\"Crews continue monitoring the situation, as [N.L. Hydro] works to protect the power supply and support employees through this difficult time,\" he wrote.</p><p>Thursday marked the third day in a row that water bombers could not do their work properly.\u00a0</p><p/><p>On Tuesday, flames were too intense for water bombers to continue their attacks on the blaze.\u00a0On Wednesday, smoky conditions kept water bombers on the ground.\u00a0</p><p>Lawlor said Thursday morning the fire was three to four kilometres from Churchill Falls.</p><p>When crews left the area Wednesday night, he said, there were only smouldering ground fires and no open flames.</p><p>\"[It] should be a very good day for our people on the ground in Churchill Falls,\" Lawlor told CBC News on Thursday morning.</p><p>Thursday's plan to attack the fire will include helicopters, water bombers and ground crews, he said.</p><p>Photos released by the Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture show swaths of land burned and charred from the fire that swept over it.\u00a0</p><p>Cooler and wetter weather ahead</p><p>Environment Canada meteorologist Rodney Barney said temperatures in the area Thursday should be cooler and damp, adding that the breakfast-time temperature was around 5 C. The wind is anticipated to blow lightly in a northeast direction, blowing smoke away from the community.</p><p>The rainfall that dropped in the preceding day was also good news, he said.\u00a0\"That, combined with the cooler temperatures, higher relative humidity ... all would be in favour of suppressing any activity, certainly, as we go forward,\" Barney told CBC News.</p><p>In the next few days, the weather is expected to be cooler and damper. Next week, however, the forecast calls for a return of warmer and drier temperatures, Barney said.</p><p>Lawlor\u00a0is also optimistic about the weather heading into the weekend.\u00a0</p><p>\"Given the current forecast, it will really help us,\" Lawlor\u00a0said.</p><p>Lawlor deferred questions Thursday about the power plant's status to N.L. Hydro\u00a0but said he believed it was still operational. On Wednesday, some essential workers were on site but they were commuting from Happy Valley-Goose Bay,\u00a0290 kilometres away, and he couldn't say when they could return permanently.</p><p/><p>According to<url normalizedValue=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/df3fede0d65b47fba974e442f91989d2\"> Newfoundland and Labrador's wildfire dashboard</url>, there were\u00a010 fires burning in Labrador on Thursday afternoon - up one from Wednesday\u00a0morning's count. The new fire, which started Tuesday at Grand Lake, is listed as under control.</p><p>The two fires threatening Churchill Falls\u00a0continue to burn, with the\u00a0Mount Hyde Lake fire - the one most concerning to the town -\u00a0still listed as out of control. A fire near Twin Falls\u00a0is being held.</p><p>As of Wednesday afternoon, Furey said, fires had not reached the town's perimeter.\u00a0</p><p>The fire has also affected\u00a0power supply to customers. Parts of Labrador West were without power Tuesday after dropped water tripped power lines at Churchill Falls.</p><p>Power has now been restored to all customers in Labrador City and Wabush, the twin mining towns in western Labrador. Electricity for\u00a0Labrador City has been coming from Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, but the town will move back to its regular supply.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Download our </emphasis></emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/newsapp/\">free CBC News app</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> to sign up for push alerts for CBC Newfoundland and Labrador. </emphasis></emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador\">Click here to visit our landing page</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanewfoundlandlabradorchurchillfallsfirejune2717248140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CBT-0JW1-F03F-K41J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"796\"/><timeReceived>9:35 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Lauffer recently sent an Open Letter to Smith, who also represents her as the MPP for Parry Sound-Muskoka, criticizing his comments in early June that forest fires are nothing new and there is nothing unusual about the current forest fire season. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In her letter, Lauffer says there are \u201cmore forest fires than ever, they are stronger, longer, out of control and much more serious\u201d and she wanted Smith to acknowledge that \u201cthe fires we are experiencing right now are so severe because of the climate change crisis.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Nugget talked to both Lauffer and Smith. </p><p>Smith immediately said \u201cclimate change is real and is happening.\" But he also said even though the number of forest fires and the hectares they have burned are \u201cslightly above average\u201d this year, he added this past spring has not been \u201can unprecedented year\u201d for forest fires in Ontario. </p><p>Smith says the impact climate change has on forest fires has to be examined over the long term and not the short term because \u201cthere is a huge amount of variability in forest fires in Ontario from one year to the next.\" </p><p>As an example, Smith said last year was a light forest fire season with the number well below the 10-year average. Smith says Ontario experienced a dry spring this year with only a light amount of precipitation and that \u201cled to the ability for more forest fires to start primarily through lightning strikes and some human caused.\" </p><p>During the interview with the Nugget, Smith again emphasized the need to look at the impact of climate change on forest fires over a longer span. </p><p>He said we should \u201cnot take data from (only) one point in time\u201d and conclude there is a \u201cdirect causal relationship\u201d between this year's forest fires and climate change and then further add this is an unprecedented season, which he again said it is not. </p><p>Although Smith acknowledges climate change is real, \u201cclimate change itself is not going to start a forest fire,\" he said. </p><p>He says forest fires are caused naturally by a high number of lightning strikes and by people who are careless with a campfire or cigarette butt or even a spark coming off an ATV's brake pad being driven in the woods. </p><p>\u201cClimate change may over the long term have some impacts on the number or severity of forest fires, but I leave that to the scientists to determine over the long term with lots of data on how that plays out,\u201d he said. </p><p>Smith said there are always going to be thunderstorms that contain lightning and given that much of Ontario has boreal forests, when \u201clightning strikes at the wrong place, we're going to have a fire.\" </p><p>\u201cWe're never going to eliminate forest fires in Ontario,\" the minister said. \u201cThey are an annual occurrence and part of nature.\" </p><p>Smith encourages the public to visit the MNRF website to learn more about forest fires and read how the public can become 'fire smart' to help mitigate the number of forest fires. </p><p>Smith also took a shot at other groups and people who claim the MNRF has cut its forest firefighting budget. He finds this \u201cextremely aggravating\u201d and not accurate. Smith said while there is a set budget, the MNRF will spend whatever it takes in any season to fight forest fires. </p><p>He said when a heavy firefighting season is followed by a light season and not as much money gets spent, some purposely distort the data and say the ministry spent less money and therefore cut the budget. </p><p>\u201cThis is just not true and I think it's an intentional distortion,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is if we need to spend $100 million, $200 million or $250 million on a season fighting forest fires, we're going to spend that much money\u201d. </p><p>When speaking to the Nugget, Christine Lauffer agreed with the MNRF minister that there are both light and heavy forest fire seasons. But she added over time, the number of light forest fire seasons is shrinking. Lauffer said the data indicates forest fires are starting earlier almost every year. </p><p>\u201cThey burn longer, are often out of control for weeks and they come more frequently,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have higher temperatures, drier air, more hot wind and these are all signs of the climate crisis.\" </p><p>Lauffer said while climate change itself is not the cause for forest fires, \u201cit creates the circumstances for the wildfires to be more furious.\" </p><p>On the point that people should not draw conclusions by looking at forest fire seasons as annual stand-alone events, Lauffer agreed with Smith but added data shows for the most part each year forest fires are worsening. </p><p>\u201cSo the overall curve is rising,\u201d Lauffer said. </p><p>She also said the global temperature has risen about 1.5 C and while \u201cthat sounds ridiculously low, that has huge impacts.\" </p><p>Lauffer said she's relieved for those years when there are fewer forest fires thanks to positive weather patterns but repeated the claim that the forest fire curve is rising. She said reversing this trend involves things like ending our reliance on fossil fuels and spending research and development money on alternative energy sources like wind and solar power. </p><p>Lauffer said people now employed in the oil and gas sector can be retrained and \u201cno one needs to be left behind.\" She added if Smith agrees that climate change is real, then he should act on it now. </p><p>Smith said the Ontario government has been taking action on climate change. He said earlier this year the Ford government passed legislation that allows for the capture of industrial carbon dioxide emissions, then compressing them into a liquid and finally burying them deep underground, which prevents them from being released into the atmosphere. </p><p>As of July 24, the MNRF website indicates the number of Ontario forest fires this year is above the 10-year average. While the 10-year average to date is 423 forest fires, Ontario has seen 459 forest fires so far this season compared to 150 forest fires during 2022 for the same period. </p><p>Also since 2000, Ontario has had an average of 948 forest fires a year that burned about 60,390 hectares a year. The year with the most forest fires was 2006, when 2,300 forest fires were recorded, while the slowest season was 2022 with 268 forest fires. During 2021 there were 1,197 forest fires across Ontario, which burned a record number of hectares at 793,325, since 2000. </p><p>Rocco Frangione is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of the North Bay Nugget.

Conditions are expected to improve Wednesday afternoon. </p><p><br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007. <br/><br/> Air quality due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour.<br/><br/> For more details, please consult canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html.<br/><br/> Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.<br/><br/> People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.<br/><br/> Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.<br/><br/> Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.<br/><br/> If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.<br/><br/> If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.<br/><br/> Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.<br/><br/> Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.<br/><br/> If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit Wellness Together Canada.<br/><br/> Visit airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.<br/><br/> Please continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br/><br/> For up-to-date short- and long-term weather forecasts, visit our weather page.<br/><br/> Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for the Town of Parry Sound - Rosseau - Killbear Park; and here for Bayfield Inlet - Dunchurch. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023081668772942</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YM-HP81-JDV5-F04H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"645\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Wildfire experts said during an update for B.C. on Wednesday that a cool and wet spring in parts of the province aided in suppressing fire activity, despite the large blazes near Fort Nelson that forced 4,700 people to evacuate in May.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BC Wildfire Service lead forecaster Matt MacDonald said fires across the province have burned about 300,000 hectares so far this year, a \u201cnot insignificant\u201d amount but still encouraging when compared with last year.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really \u2026 been confined to that northeast corner down through much of the Prince George Fire Centre and then some fires in the Cariboo, which were earlier on in the season,\u201d MacDonald said.</p><p>\u201cIf we compare to where we were at (at this time) last year in 2023, we were already approaching the million-hectare mark,\u201d he said of area burned by wildfire.</p><p>MacDonald said temperatures were near normal in May for much of the province, helping to slow snow melt and suppressing holdover fires from re-emerging after smouldering over the winter.</p><p>Some alpine areas were also able to add snow cover, he said.</p><p>But forecasts call for warmer than normal temperatures across much of the B.C. Interior in late June into July.</p><p>\u201cGiven those\u2026conditions, it\u2019s quite likely that we will in fact see large fires in much of the province, but particularly that northeast down through the central Interior,\u201d Mac-Donald said. \u201cSo, please remain prepared. Continue to be vigilant.\u201d</p><p>On Wednesday, the BC Wildfire Service reported more than 100 active wildfires, with 10 classified as out-of-control and six started in the last 24 hours.</p><p>Among the new wildfires are multiple blazes within Kalamalka Lake Park south of Vernon, B.C. , where the wildfire service and local firefighters were able to hold the fires. The wildfire service website said those fires were human caused.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre agreed with B.C. \u2019s assessment on Wednesday, saying this year\u2019s wildfire season has been less dire so far than 2023.</p><p>But it said the expected hot weather beginning this month means conditions are ripe for an above-average fire season across most of Canada.</p><p>The forecast said the risk of fires in June is extreme or very high in southern and northeastern B.C. , northern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan and a small pocket of northern Manitoba, as well as most of Northwest Territories.</p><p>As of this week, more than 1,480 fires have burned about 5,200 square kilometres across the country, with almost twothirds of the burned area located in British Columbia.</p><p>B.C. Minister of Emergency Management Bowinn Ma warned residents to remain vigilant, as extreme drought conditions persist in northeastern B.C. while snowpacks across the province are at 57 per cent of normal levels.</p><p>Ma reminded people to make sure they have wildfire insurance and have completed emergency planning in case of an evacuation order on short notice.</p><p>She said the province also learned from the evacuation process in Kelowna last year, where emergency reception centres \u201csaw long lines \u2026 creating confusion and frustration\u201d for people seeking support services.</p><p>To that end, the province has introduced several new measures to help wildfire evacuees cope with leaving their homes this summer.</p><p>Ma said they include an option for evacuees to receive a $200 daily accommodation allowance through an e-transfer, giving people more flexibility on where to stay if they have been forced out.</p><p>\u201cWhile evacuees will still have the option of being directly referred to available lodging, this new e-transfer alternative option will allow people who are evacuated to make their own decisions on accommodation, whether that\u2019s to stay with family or friends, or find a hotel on their own, or stay at a campground,\u201d she said.</p><p>The improvements will also include enhanced online options for self-service pathways to receive support, Ma said.</p><p>\u201cWith these enhanced support options and pathways for assistance, British Columbians can be sure that if they are evacuated and need assistance, they\u2019ll receive the support that they need.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20240614PTEA0004436240</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C89-GMX1-F0HF-815V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Among those were major wildfires in British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's a look at the most urgent situations in Western Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Northern B.C. sees rain and cooler temperatures, bringing 'excellent' conditionsAs British Columbia continued to grapple with two wildfires of note - fires that are especially visible or threatening to public safety - the area received rain, cooler temperatures and more humidity, making for \"excellent\" fire fighting conditions, BC Wildfire Service announced Thursday.</p><p>The Parker Lake wildfire remained 2.5 kilometres southwest of Fort Nelson, with minimal growth, while the Patry Creek wildfire remained 25 kilometres north, the service announced.</p><p>The rain created favourable conditions for the next several days, but was not enough to break the long-term drought.</p><p>Encroaching B.C. fires lead to evacuation of more than 4,700 peopleTwo out-of-control wildfires in Northern B.C. prompted an evacuation order for the town of Fort Nelson, which has a population of 4,700. (About a dozen people have decided to stay back in order to help fire fighting efforts.)</p><p>Across the province, there were 123 active wildfires burning; 38 were declared in the last seven days and 16 were declared in the last 24 hours. Ten active wildfires were considered out of control, six were being held and 107 were under control.</p><p>In total, there were eight evacuation orders and five evacuation alerts. Evacuation orders were in place for the broader Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation, as well as the Doig River First Nation, Peace River Regional District, and Lytton First Nation.</p><p>The province has 401 firefighting personnel, two incident management teams, 60 aviation resources, 17 pieces of heavy equipment and 57 resources of structure protection.</p><p>Rain helps contain Fort McMurray fire, where 6,600 have evacuated</p><p>An out-of-control wildfire in the Alberta oilsands hub of Fort McMurray did not grow on Thursday thanks to cool, damp weather and hard-working crews.

(About a dozen people have decided to stay back in order to help fire fighting efforts.)</p><p>Across the province, there were 123 active wildfires burning; 38 were declared in the last seven days and 16 were declared in the last 24 hours. Ten active wildfires were considered out of control, six were being held and 107 were under control.</p><p>In total, there were eight evacuation orders and five evacuation alerts. Evacuation orders were in place for the broader Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation, as well as the Doig River First Nation, Peace River Regional District, and Lytton First Nation.</p><p>The province has 401 firefighting personnel, two incident management teams, 60 aviation resources, 17 pieces of heavy equipment and 57 resources of structure protection.</p><p>Rain helps contain Fort McMurray fire, where 6,600 have evacuated</p><p>An out-of-control wildfire in the Alberta oilsands hub of Fort McMurray did not grow on Thursday thanks to cool, damp weather and hard-working crews.

It forced more than 230,000 people from their homes - including the entire city of Yellowknife - and created unprecedented smoke conditions across much of the country and into the United States.<br/><br/> Eight firefighters died battling the blazes and Canada expects to spend more than $750 million in disaster assistance alone. That does not include the billions of dollars spent fighting the fires in the first place.<br/><br/> A briefing document forecasting the fire risk for this spring shows conditions are already ripe for an early and above-normal fire risk from Quebec all the way to British Columbia in both April and May.<br/><br/> The forecast is based on having had a warmer-than-normal winter with minimal snow and widespread drought, particularly in the Prairies. There is also a high probability for above-normal temperatures in April, May and June. Western Canada, eastern Ontario and western Quebec are currently facing the highest risk.<br/><br/> The briefing includes a caveat that forecasting precipitation levels is not very reliable so the warnings are based on current conditions, and could change if more rain falls this spring than is currently expected.<br/><br/> The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre lists 65 fires already burning, mainly in B.C., Alberta and the Northwest Territories. More than half are fires that started in 2023, smouldered underground throughout the winter and have since re-emerged. Most of the fires currently burning are under control.<br/><br/> Human activity is typically the main fire risk factor in the spring, said Michael Norton, the director general of the Northern Forestry Centre at Natural Resources Canada.<br/><br/> Preventing fires from starting in the first place is critical, and in the spring most fires are human-caused, including through careless burning, campfires, fireworks, and the heat from off-road vehicles igniting grass or other debris on the ground. <br/><br/> Lightning becomes a primary source of wildfires during the summer.<br/><br/> About 70 per cent of the fires between January and May 2023 were started by humans, compared with fewer than 20 per cent of the fires that started in June, July and August.<br/><br/> The low level of snow in most of Canada is among the key reasons for the higher risks this spring.<br/><br/> The Canadian Press<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2024041171167051</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BSC-KN11-JDV5-F0HX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"467\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

at the Manitoba Legislature on Thursday, while\u00a0Jamie Moses, Manitoba's\u00a0minister of natural resources, announced the province would be matching\u00a0that figure for a total of $38.4 million.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The funding [spread out over four years] will go towards\u00a0enhancing firefighting equipment, ensuring we have the right staff through active training, investing in prevention and mitigation capacity, as well as modernizing our information technology systems,\" Moses said.</p><p>This works out to $9.6 million a year in new funding for fighting wildfires, with $4.8 million a year coming from each of the two levels of government.</p><p>The province has budgeted $51.4 million this fiscal year for its wildfire service and wildfire suppression.</p><p>He added he\u00a0is thinking about the hundreds of evacuees and the crews on the front lines \"during this very difficult time for Cranberry Portage and surrounding residents.\"</p><p>\"This is an early kickoff to our 2024 wildfire season, earlier than anticipated,\" he said.</p><p>While provinces and territories have the prime responsibility for fighting wildfires, \"the federal government has recognized that additional firefighting resources will most certainly be required moving forward,\" Sajjan\u00a0said, blaming the changing environment for an increase in frequency and intensity of wildfires.</p><p>\"Our first priority is to protect the lives and livelihoods of Canadians and increasingly, this starts with accepting the scientific reality of climate change and taking thoughtful and impactful action to address it,\" he said.</p><p>\"We live in a new reality today.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATCH | Emergency crews wade through forest fire

this year's provincial budget\u00a0-\u00a0half of what the Progressive Conservatives budgeted the year before\u00a0- but Kinew said he\u00a0will make sure\u00a0\"every resource goes out the door\" to put out the fires and help evacuees.</p><p>Approximately 580 people have been evacuated due to the fire, but that number might increase as conditions change, the province said in its <url

square kilometres, and has not moved any closer to Cranberry Portage\u00a0since Saturday, when a rapid advancement forced the sudden evacuation.</p><p>At this time, there is no estimated return date for evacuated residents, although\u00a0Earl Simmons, director of the Manitoba Wildfire Service, told CBC Manitoba on Wednesday morning that \"hopefully by the weekend we can perhaps get the folks back into Cranberry Portage.\"</p><p>Another fire, about\u00a02,785 hectares in size, is burning about 2\u00bd km\u00a0from the community of Wanless, north of The Pas.</p><p>Wanless and Cranberry Portage are only 40 kilometres apart, so the combined fires are creating a lot of smoke in the area, the province said.</p><p>\"Area residents are advised to take precautions to protect against harmful smoke inhalation including limiting outdoor activity, staying indoors with windows and doors closed, setting air conditioning units in homes and vehicles to recirculate to avoid drawing smoke indoors, and drinking plenty of water,\" the provincial fire bulletin states.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The fire consumed more than 33,000 hectares before it was classified as being held.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While fires are not uncommon in Canada's Rocky Mountains, studies suggest the number and size of fires has significantly decreased over the last century, including in Jasper National Park, largely due to suppression.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We conclude fire suppression has altered the fire regime and reduced resilience of the mountain\u00a0forests in Jasper National Park,\" Raphael Chavardes and Lori Daniels wrote in a 2016 research paper.<br/><br/> The paper was part of Chavardes's master's degree at the University of British Columbia and Daniels was his supervisor.</p><p/><p>Chavardes studied the forest 12 kilometres north of the Jasper townsite. He now works for the Canadian Forest Service as a fire risk and resilience research scientist.</p><p>By detecting fire scars on the cross-section of trees that were more than 400 years old, Chavardes determined\u00a0there had been no fires in his study area for 100 years.\u00a0</p><p>However, Chavardes said, prior to Jasper becoming protected in 1907 by the federal government, the forest burned about every 40 to 60 years, on average.</p><p>\"There's a rich history of fire in the park,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>Fire suppression, exclusion</p><p>Fire records for the park show there were large fires in the valley around what is now the townsite in 1758, 1847 and 1889, and a smaller one in 1905, according to a 1979 study by Gerald Tande, a researcher at the University of Alberta.</p><p>After that it was relatively fire-free for decades.</p><p>The Chetamon wildfire, about 15 km north of the townsite, burned about 6,000 ha. in 2022 and severed power to the community for several days. It had been the largest fire in the area in decades until this year's massive blaze.\u00a0</p><p>More than 100 years\u00a0after the building of the townsite, the park is a\u00a0top tourism destination that brings\u00a0millions of people to the area.\u00a0</p><p>The lack of fires for more than a century was likely due to fire exclusion and suppression by Parks Canada, said Chavardes.<br/><br/> \"It was to protect timber and stop fires from burning,\" he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Look at how the forest near the Jasper townsite changed over the last 100 years:</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>Indigenous people used fire for thousands of years to maintain areas for hunting and grow medicine.<br/><br/> In the early 1900s, Jasper was home to a number of M\u00e9tis families, including the Moberlys.<br/><br/> The Moberlys used fire to make travelling easier for hunting, clear brush and provide good grass habitat for their stock to feed on, according to an interview with a Moberly descendent by University of Alberta staff in 1980.</p><p>The family was evicted from the area when Jasper became a park.\u00a0</p><p>Soon after, fire and game wardens were hired and instructed to <url normalizedValue=\"https://parks.canada.ca/nature/science/conservation/feu-fire/histoire-history\">put out all wildfires.</url></p><p>With hoses, fire trucks and sprinklers, stopping wildfire became easier.</p><p>Efforts to suppress fires in forested areas have been ongoing since before the Second World War, said Mark Boyce, a professor of ecology at the University of Alberta.</p><p>\"We didn't really have the technology to do it very well before that,\" Boyce said.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"http://parkscanadahistory.com/series/rl/R61-16-3-2E.pdf\">1995 article in Park's Canada Research Links magazine</url>\u00a0notes that\u00a0after 1945, \"in response to a dramatic increase in the number of visitors to Canadian national parks, Parks Canada embarked on a \"protection\" stage of management ... [and] the job of park management was seen as protecting parks from threats such as poaching, trampling, and fire.\"</p><p>With fewer fires, vegetation began to change.</p><p>In 1915, large areas of the park consisted of patchy vegetation, with grasslands, juvenile trees, open forest and more deciduous trees.</p><p>Eighty years later, half the grasslands were gone, replaced by homogeneous thick forest, according to a 2002 study by Jeanine Rhemtulla, a forestry professor at UBC.</p><p>The changes can be seen in historic photographs.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://mountainlegacy.ca/\">Mountain Legacy Project</url> has photographed Jasper's changing forests, by retaking original images that were captured more than 100 years ago from key locations throughout the park.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Look at how the view from the summit of Roche Bonhomme toward\u00a0the Jasper townsite has changed in the past 100 years:</emphasis></p><p>The photos show a progression from grasslands and open forests to thick closed woods, splashed red due to numerous trees killed by pine beetles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Without fire, dead trees and branches can build up on the forest floor, providing more fuel for larger, hotter blazes.</p><p>\"We set up a situation that is explosive,\" Boyce said.\u00a0</p><p>While the dead wood can be removed and the forest thinned, that alone may not be the best option, he said.</p><p>\"These forests are naturally maintained by fire,\" said Boyce.\u00a0</p><p>Wildfires create a patchy landscape, where clumps of trees can vary in age, depending on whether they burned or not, creating different kinds of habitats, which benefits wildlife, Boyce said.\u00a0</p><p>Without fire, trees continue to grow and persist, eventually creating what Chavardes refers to as ladder fuels. That's where fire on the forest floor can climb into the canopy of the trees, creating an even more powerful and severe blaze.<br/><br/> Additionally, many of the trees in the Jasper forest were dead due to pine beetle.\u00a0</p><p>Couple that with high winds, hot temperatures, no rain and low humidity, and it can lead to very favourable fire conditions, said Chavardes.</p><p/><p>In the weeks leading up to the Jasper wildfire, the area was in the middle of a heat wave, with most days soaring into the 30s with no rain. On July 21, the day before the fire started, it reached 38 C.</p><p>Overall, he is not surprised at how large and powerful the fire got that destroyed a significant portion of the Jasper townsite last month.</p><p>Given the history of fire in the park, July's wildfire could have been predicted, he said.</p><p>In a 2018 interview, two B.C. researchers said Jasper was due for a catastrophic forest fire.</p><p>\"It's a matter of when, not if,\" Emile Begin told CBC's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Radio Active</emphasis>.</p><p>Bringing fire back\u00a0</p><p>In recent years, Parks Canada has committed to restoring fire to the landscape, sometimes using prescribed burns.</p><p><br/><br/> This year alone, Parks Canada planned\u00a0four <url normalizedValue=\"http://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ab/jasper/visit/feu-alert-fire/restoration\">burns</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ab/jasper/visit/feu-alert-fire/restoration\">\u00a0in Jasper National Park</url>, including one near the town.\u00a0</p><p>Since 1994, Parks Canada has conducted 45 prescribed fires in Jasper, burning a total area of 4,600 hectares, Ron Hallman, CEO of Parks Canada, said in an interview on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Edmonton AM</emphasis>.</p><p>As well, another 1,700 hectares of forest in the park has been mechanically removed, Hallman said.</p><p>Going forward, if Parks Canada determines there are still fire hazards around what remains of town, more of the forest could be removed, he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Life from fire</emphasis></p><p>Regardless, suppressing fires over the past century has caused a significant decline in ecosystem health and species diversity, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://parks.canada.ca/nature/science/especes-species/feu-fire\">Parks Canada</url>.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>That's because fires can increase biodiversity as some species rely on it to reproduce, like Lodgepole pine as its cones are sealed with a waxy coating.\u00a0</p><p>As they heat up from fire, the cones pop open \"like popcorn,\" said Chavardes.\u00a0</p><p>The species can then abundantly regenerate with young saplings.<br/><br/> \"Areas can be burned on purpose to stimulate regrowth, but also reduce the intensity of future fires,\" said Boyce.\u00a0</p><p/><p>Burned forest is also much less likely to burn for the next five decades,because of a lack of available fuel such as dead branches and trees, Boyce said.</p><p>Boyce predicts that by this time next year, areas of the burned forest in Jasper will be a lush green, with lots of new vegetation, providing highly nutritious food for many different animals, like bear and moose.</p><p>\"Fires create a lot of variation,\" said Boyce.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's really attractive to wildlife.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadaedmontonjasperusedtoburnoftenwhydidthatchangewhenitbecameanationalpark17295938</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CTC-J4P1-F03F-K030-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1300\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

As we roll into another likely record summer, local fire services are preparing to do the same \u2013 but they\u2019re not feeling too hot under the collar just yet, they assure. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cWe\u2019re all very aware that we\u2019re forecasted to have a really hot, dry summer,\u201d said recently appointed District of North Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services chief Mike Danks. \u201cDue to climate change we\u2019re seeing significant changes in weather with drier, hotter conditions, which is always concerning, but we do a ton of preparation with our equipment and our staff to ensure that everyone always has a very high level of training to respond to those incidents.\u201d </p><p>North Shore fire departments have been particularly adept at responding to wildfires, with the few that have occurred in North and West Vancouver being mitigated \u201cvery quickly,\u201d said Danks. </p><p>\u201cI really think that\u2019s due to the preparedness of crews to respond to incidents of that nature, and our very engaged community that is always on high alert for those.\u201d </p><p>In April, both West Vancouver Fire &amp; Rescue and the District of North Vancouver Fire &amp; Rescue Services took part in a multi-agency exercise designed to prepare both teams for a potentially record-breaking fire season. </p><p>Dubbed Operation Jubilee, the event simulated a forest fire breakout at the boat-access-only Camp Jubilee. Emergency crews and supplies were deployed as the two fire teams collaborated with North Shore Emergency Management, Royal Canadian Marine Search and Rescue, BC Wildfire Service and Metro Vancouver Watershed Protection for a swift and efficient clean up. </p><p>\u201cFor all the agencies to get together and to exercise going through the process of responding to an incident like that, it makes it muscle memory to understand how crews are going to be deployed, how the equipment will be packaged,\u201d said Danks. </p><p>\u201cThe community can then see what that response looks like, and can understand why we make the decisions we do under those circumstances.\u201d </p><p>Jeremy Duncan, Deputy Fire Chief at the District of West Vancouver, said response teams are well prepared across the North Shore \u2013 \u201cthere has been years of work from all three departments to be ready, prepared, trained and to get the right equipment\u201d \u2013 but the preparedness is less effective if the local community doesn\u2019t collaborate. </p><p>Much of the onus in preventing such fires is on the public, he said. </p><p>\u201cWeather is causing the risk factor of the burn, but it\u2019s not starting the fire. We don\u2019t have a lot of lighting in the coastal regions. If a wildfire starts, it\u2019s usually human caused,\u201d said Duncan. \u201cIf everybody just increases their awareness and realizes that the new normal must be making safer choices, especially around the likes of development and landscaping, then that will make a huge difference. We all play a part.\u201d </p><p>Both District of North Vancouver and West Vancouver offers free wildfire home hazard assessments, where a wildfire mitigation specialist will inspect a home to determine how fire smart it is, before providing recommendations on what can be done to reduce the chance of it being affected by an external blaze. </p><p>There are also small precautions a homeowner can take to increase a property\u2019s chance of survival, said Danks, from opting for a non combustible roof to managing the vegetation that surrounds the property. Clearing shrubbery in a 10-metre radius can increase the home\u2019s chance of survival by 90 per cent. </p><p>There are the lapses in common sense that are equally as detrimental, like not discarding cigarette butts safely, using machinery in dry forested areas, or leaving campfires unattended. Wider education around the risks of such everyday activities is paramount, said Duncan. </p><p>\u201cThe fire department can do their best to be prepared to respond to these incidents, and we offer services to ensure that we\u2019re working with our community to reduce the chance of wildfire, but the onus is also on the residents in the community to ensure that we\u2019re working together to reduce the risks,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cThe community is also our eyes and ears, so if you do see a wildfire, please make sure that you notify emergency services as quickly as possible.\u201d </p><p>Mina Kerr-Lazenby is the North Shore News\u2019 Indigenous and civic affairs reporter.

Barbed wire keeps out intruders. A private security company now guards the entrance 24 hours a day, after protesters set fire to construction machinery in February. <br/>'It's the worst location possible to build the camp,' Yiorgos Dinos, head of the firemen union in the region, tells AFP. <br/>'Should a fire start there, it will burn down half the island.' <br/>According to local community leaders, Greece's propensity for forest fires and a troubling history of blazes at other camps makes the new facility \u2014 on the edge of a dense pine forest in the middle of nowhere \u2014 a potential hazard of major proportions. <br/>'We have so many examples of what can happen to a forest in case of fire in adverse weather conditions,' says Christos Tsivgoulis, head of Komi, one of six communities that oppose the project. <br/>'Nothing can save you.' <br/>High temperatures and strong winds cause wildfires every summer in Greece, especially on islands where the rugged landscape presents an added impediment to firefighters. <br/>Scientists say climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of the fires in recent years.  <br/>Greece's and indeed Europe's largest migrant camp of Moria, also on Lesbos, was entirely gutted by fire in 2020. <br/>- 'Completely unsuitable' - <br/>At the time, Moria housed more than 10,000 people. Most of them were sleeping under makeshift shelter outdoors. <br/>Last month, a communal tent for 150 people burned down at Moria's temporary replacement of Mavrovouni, which currently houses around 1,100 people. <br/>On Tuesday, two 18-year-old Afghan asylum seekers were sentenced to four years on appeal for starting the Moria fire. Four other Afghans were handed 10-year sentences last June. <br/>Michael Bakas, a member of Greece's Greens party, says 'dozens' of fires broke out around Moria in previous summers despite the presence of a dedicated fire response team. <br/>Tsivgoulis, the local community representative, says the densely forested landscape around the new camp at Plati is more dangerous than Moria. <br/>'Moria was surrounded by an olive grove, olive trees don't burn easily, imagine what can happen in a pine forest,' Tsivgoulis said. <br/>'In the summer months, locals are not allowed to enter at night because of the risk of fire. So how does the (migration) ministry ensure that there will be no accidents when hundreds will be coming and going' to build the camp, he wonders. <br/>'This is a completely unsuitable location to build an entire community,' adds Antonis Komlos, head of the community of Pighi. <br/>'With one spark, whole villages and crops could be lost,' he said. <br/>- 'Far from our children' - <br/>There are also fears that the remote location, accessible via a rural road, 15 kilometres (nine miles) from the closest village as the bird flies and 30 kilometres from the island's main town of Mytilene, will be hard to evacuate in an emergency. <br/>With a capacity of 3,000, Plati is to be the largest of five new camps for which the European Union has allocated $296 million combined for Lesbos and four other Greek islands in the Aegean where migrants arrive from neighbouring Turkey. <br/>The new camps come with barbed-wire fencing, surveillance cameras, X-ray scanners and magnetic gates that are closed at night. <br/>Mytilene mayor Stratis Kytelis has called the camp a 'starting point' for the island to 'leave the migration issue behind for good \u2014 far from the city of Mytilene, our children and our daily lives.' <br/>Yet disagreements over the location have delayed the project for months, with various alternative locations examined and rejected. <br/>This week, Kytelis said Plati was 'the only solution to restore serenity to the island.' <br/>In a statement to AFP, he insisted authorities are taking 'all (necessary) fire precautions'. <br/>The camp was originally supposed to have been completed last September. <br/>An injunction against the project will be discussed later in June. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fforest-fire-fears-over-new-greek-migrant-camp%2Farticle&amp;linkname=Forest%20fire%20fears%20over%20new%20Greek%20migrant%20camphttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fforest-fire-fears-over-new-greek-migrant-camp%2Farticle&amp;linkname=Forest%20fire%20fears%20over%20new%20Greek%20migrant%20camphttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fforest-fire-fears-over-new-greek-migrant-camp%2Farticle&amp;linkname=Forest%20fire%20fears%20over%20new%20Greek%20migrant%20camphttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fforest-fire-fears-over-new-greek-migrant-camp%2Farticle&amp;linkname=Forest%20fire%20fears%20over%20new%20Greek%20migrant%20camphttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fforest-fire-fears-over-new-greek-migrant-camp%2Farticle&amp;title=Forest%20fire%20fears%20over%20new%20Greek%20migrant%20camp\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fforest-fire-fears-over-new-greek-migrant-camp%2Farticle&amp;linkname=Forest%20fire%20fears%20over%20new%20Greek%20migrant%20camphttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fforest-fire-fears-over-new-greek-migrant-camp%2Farticle&amp;linkname=Forest%20fire%20fears%20over%20new%20Greek%20migrant%20camphttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fforest-fire-fears-over-new-greek-migrant-camp%2Farticle&amp;linkname=Forest%20fire%20fears%20over%20new%20Greek%20migrant%20camphttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fforest-fire-fears-over-new-greek-migrant-camp%2Farticle&amp;linkname=Forest%20fire%20fears%20over%20new%20Greek%20migrant%20camphttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fforest-fire-fears-over-new-greek-migrant-camp%2Farticle&amp;title=Forest%20fire%20fears%20over%20new%20Greek%20migrant%20camp</url><br/>The post Forest fire fears over new Greek migrant camp[1] appeared first on Digital Journal[2]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/forest-fire-fears-over-new-greek-migrant-camp/article\">https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/forest-fire-fears-over-new-greek-migrant-camp/article</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com\">https://www.digitaljournal.com</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Interior in late June into July. </p><p>\"Given those \u2026 conditions, it's quite likely that we will in fact see large fires in much of the province, but particularly that northeast down through the central Interior,\" MacDonald said. \"So, please remain prepared. Continue to be vigilant.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, the BC Wildfire Service reported more than 100 active wildfires, with 10 classified as out-of-control and six started in the last 24 hours.</p><p>Among the new wildfires are multiple blazes within Kalamalka Lake Park south of Vernon, B.C., where the wildfire service and local firefighters were able to hold the fires. The wildfire service website said those fires were human caused. </p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre agreed with B.C.'s assessment on Wednesday, saying this year's wildfire season has been less dire so far than 2023.</p><p>But it said the expected hot weather beginning this month means conditions are ripe for an above-average fire season across most of Canada.</p><p>The forecast said the risk of fires in June is extreme or very high in southern and northeastern B.C., northern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan and a small pocket of northern Manitoba, as well as most of Northwest Territories.</p><p>As of this week, more than 1,480 fires have burned about 5,200 square kilometres across the country, with almost two-thirds of the burned area located in British Columbia.</p><p>B.C. Minister of Emergency Management Bowinn Ma warned residents to remain vigilant, as extreme drought conditions persist in northeastern B.C. while snowpacks across the province are at 57 per cent of normal levels.</p><p>Ma reminded people to make sure they have wildfire insurance and have completed emergency planning in case of an evacuation order on short notice.</p><p>She said the province also learned from the evacuation process in Kelowna last year, where emergency reception centres \"saw long lines \u2026 creating confusion and frustration\" for people seeking support services.</p><p>To that end, the province has introduced several new measures to help wildfire evacuees cope with leaving their homes this summer.</p><p>Ma said they include an option for evacuees to receive a $200 daily accommodation allowance through an e-transfer, giving people more flexibility on where to stay if they have been forced out.</p><p>\"While evacuees will still have the option of being directly referred to available lodging, this new e-transfer alternative option will allow people who are evacuated to make their own decisions on accommodation, whether that's to stay with family or friends, or find a hotel on their own, or stay at a campground,\" she said.</p><p>The improvements will also include enhanced online options for self-service pathways to receive support, Ma said.</p><p>\"With these enhanced support options and pathways for assistance, British Columbians can be sure that if they are evacuated and need assistance, they'll receive the support that they need.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 12, 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-bc4cf19002564b2f87def98a6595a3fb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C7T-NHN1-DY9S-T3N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"718\"/><timeReceived>07:38 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 12, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(AP) \u2014 A high school athlete who along with 15 other young people took Montana to court over climate change testified Tuesday that increased smoke from forest fires makes it difficult for him to compete and that a doctor prescribed an inhaler to help his breathing problems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mica Kantor, now 15, said he has been worried about climate change since as a 4-year-old he dictated a letter to Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., because he was too young to write it himself. He said it's increasingly difficult to run or go on hikes with his family, and that the warmer conditions have shortened snowboarding seasons.</p><p>Mica testified on day two of a first-of-its-kind trial in which the 16 young Montana residents are arguing the state is violating their constitutional rights by failing to keep the environment clean. They're asking a judge to declare unconstitutional a state law that prevents agencies from considering the effect of greenhouse gasses when they issue permits for fossil fuel development.</p><p>State officials have sought to downplay Montana\u2019s contributions to global warming as the trial is being closely watched for possible legal precedents.</p><p>Attorneys for the plaintiffs showed the court photos of Mica participating in protests against climate change at school, the local courthouse and the state\u2019s largest public utility. He said his efforts were meant \u201cto get people to think about climate change, which is the first step to acting,\" </p><p>He said worrying about climate change can make it hard for him to fall asleep at night and he hopes the state will move in a direction that gives him hope for the future.</p><p>He shared a poem about being quarantined in the basement of his house when the rest of his family had COVID-19 and it was too smoky to play outside. In his writing, he wondered why nobody was listening and whether they cared.</p><p>The state declined to cross examine Mica or Badge Busse, 15; and did not ask questions of the three young plaintiffs who testified Monday.</p><p>Badge testified Tuesday that climate change can restrict his outdoor activities, including hunting, fishing and downhill skiing. There was a time, he said, when a forest fire near his house forced his family to prepare to evacuate, calling it \u201cone of the most terrifying experiences of my life.\u201d</p><p>His mother gathered baby books and he had to gather some of his treasured belongings and prepare to leave the only home he'd ever known. Fortunately, he said, they did not have to leave.</p><p>Pediatrician Lori Byron, of Crow Agency, testified about the physical and mental health effects of climate change on children and noted several of the plaintiffs have asthma or other breathing issues. Several plaintiffs have said the heat and smoke can make them depressed and anxious.</p><p>Byron said children feel more effects from high temperatures, fires, smoke and severe weather events because their bodies and brains are still developing and they breathe more quickly than adults. Children who are athletes are more competitive and more likely to keep participating, even if it's unhealthy to due to smoke or heat.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, Cathy Whitlock, a retired professor from Montana State University, testified about the impact of climate change.</p><p>Whitlock, a climate scientist, said if fossil fuel burning continues at its current pace, the number of days with temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) will increase along with the number of \u201cfire weather days,\u201d where hot, dry, windy days make it easier for fires to start and burn aggressively. The number of days where wildfire smoke will make the air unhealthy to breathe will also increase by 2050, she said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the number of days where the temperature falls below freezing will continue to decrease.</p><p>Precipitation has been increasing in the spring and fall, Whitlock said, with spring rains sometimes falling on snow and causing it to melt quickly, leading to flooding like what happened in Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding area last year. Reducing the burning of fossil fuels as quickly as possible is needed to help avoid abrupt transitions between the seasons, Whitlock said.</p><p>For example, a \u201cflash drought\u201d in 2017 led to a record fire season in Montana, where about 7,000 square miles (18,210 square kilometers) of land burned, smoke lingered for weeks in a western Montana valley, and crop losses totaled $2.6 billion, she said.</p><p>There are some positives to the changing climate, Whitlock said, such as a longer growing season and the ability to grow new crops like cantaloupe, which aren't typically grown in northwestern Montana. But, she said, the negatives far outweigh the positives with extreme weather events and increasing drought.</p><p>Thane Johnson, an attorney for the state, asked Whitlock if Montana completely stopping its greenhouse gas emissions would have a significant effect on the global climate. </p><p>\u201cEvery ton of CO2 put in the atmosphere contributes to global warming,\u201d Whitlock said several times during her testimony.

Like urban firefighters, forest firefighters are at a higher risk of cancer, heart disease and heart injuries, and post-traumatic stress disorder. While certain diagnoses for urban firefighters are presumed to be work related, forest firefighters didn't have automatic recognition for WSIB.</p><p>\"For years, forest firefighters have fought to be recognized and included in legislation which recognizes our sacrifice,\" said OPSEU/SEFPO Local 703 Vice-President, Noah Freedman. \"Without the relentless determination of forest fire workers from across the province of Ontario, we would not be receiving this news today. The fight is not over and there is still work to do to. But for all those who have sacrificed their health and their lives, and those who continue to, we can at least celebrate the promise of change. Now it's up to this government to implement this change immediately.\"</p><p>Experienced forest firefighters are leaving Ontario's wildland firefighting program for higher paying jobs elsewhere. The insultingly low wage the Ontario government offers doesn't reflect the high-risk nature of this job. Forest firefighters spend 16-hour days, week after week isolated from loved ones, inhaling carcinogenic emissions to keep Ontario residents and communities safe.</p><p>The Ford government is patting themselves on the back for high recruitment numbers and their one-time retention bonus of $5000 that only goes to some forest firefighters. But as forest firefighters have been saying for years now, we need experienced workers to lead crews. In the past, crews had a combined experience of 100 years; now they have a combined experience of five years. Safety is developed through situational awareness   you learn the job by doing the job. But turnover is high because people are not adequately compensated for the dangerous nature of the job. This puts workers who choose to return at higher risk. It's unacceptable.</p><p>Forest firefighters have been calling for reclassification   among other solutions to the retention crisis   for years. They've met with Minister Smith to raise their concerns, but this government has failed to take action. Ontario was down 50 crews last year and the effects of that were felt all over the province with runaway fires and smoke blanketing our cities. The Ford government needs to act quickly before their inaction proves fatal.</p><p>\"The WSIB coverage change is an important step to recognizing the dangerous work that forest firefighters do. But to ensure people of Ontario are not also unnecessarily exposed to smoke this coming summer, we urgently need to address the retention crisis in AFFES by increasing wages,\" added Hornick. \"This government's own findings indicate that this year's wildfire season is shaping up to be more dangerous than last year's record-breaking season and yet the Ford government refuses to reclassify workers to address the crisis. They would rather gamble with our safety than pay forest firefighters a fair wage that reflects the risks they take.\"</p><p>SOURCE  Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU/SEFPO)</p><p> View original content to download multimedia: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/April2024/29/c6696.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/April2024/29/c6696.html</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNW-20240429C6696</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BX8-SG01-JC8H-P08J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"552\"/><timeReceived>6:50 PM Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CNW Group</copyright><publicationName>Canada NewsWire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 29, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It is a bit of savings for us as far as expense goes.\" </p><p>He said the usage of the airport by privately owned planes has grown about 30 per cent since the pandemic years, while the air ambulance traffic has remained consistent. </p><p>\"We have seen a huge increase in fuel sales for a couple of reasons.\" </p><p>One is the increase in private usage of the airport. Another is due to the fact that last summer the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) was fighting forest fires in the region. He added that having the MNRF using the airport for fuelling \"really helps our communities, having the airport used in case of any forest fires getting close to us,\" he said. </p><p>He continued that discussions have been taking place with the MNRF about the availability of the airport in the forest fire season ahead. </p><p>\"Hopefully we will see them use our airport,\" he said. </p><p>When Rockin' On Canada Day takes place June 29 and 30, it is hoped that the Hercules (military aircraft) will be available to do a fly-by over the airport, Laferriere added.  </p><p>The airport receives funding from area member municipalities through the Airport Authority. </p><p>He thanked area municipalities \"that continue to see the value and support the airport year after year. We're really dependent on their support and really looking forward to continue to provide service to our communities.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-c6b55dd02d8f491aa976c5dc4e1e9afa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BKX-47F1-DY9S-T11T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"402\"/><timeReceived>10:11 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 20, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In many cases, residents in affected areas had only a short time to evacuate. And 2024 promises to be another intense wildfire year. Wildfires are a real and present danger, especially if you live in a heavily forested area. However, there are steps you can take to help protect your family, your home or your business.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Information about the current forest fire danger, forest fire activity and fire restrictions across the province can be found on the Government of Alberta's Wildfire webpage. Residents can also access the Government of Alberta's Wildfire Status Dashboard for real-time information on active fires, current fire danger across the province, and restricted fire zones in effect.</p><p>\"IBC is urging Albertans to stay alert and follow the advice of local authorities when it comes to fire bans,\" added de Pruis. \"In the event that you are evacuated, make sure you plan as you could be out of your home for more than one or two days. Last year, many individuals and families were displaced for several days or longer.\"</p><p>All standard homeowner's and tenant's insurance policies cover damage caused by wildfire. Most policies also cover additional living expenses, such as for hotels or other accommodation, if you are evacuated. During major weather events or wildfires, insurance companies may initiate temporary limitations on the sale of new policies in areas under imminent threat. Therefore, ensure you have the right coverage well in advance of a potential severe weather event or wildfire.</p><p>Albertans with general questions about their home, business or car insurance policies are encouraged to contact IBC's Consumer Information Centre at 1-844-2ask-IBC (1-844-227-5422) or visit ibc.ca.</p><p>Protect your home before and during wildfire season with these 10 tips from IBC</p><p>Ways to be prepared year-round:</p><p>1.  Install and regularly maintain smoke and CO alarms in your home. Remove dust from your alarms, replace batteries when the clocks change in spring and fall, test alarms regularly and replace them at least every 10 years.2.  Create an emergency preparedness plan and a disaster safety kit for your family. Develop a fire evacuation plan, practise it and stick to it in an emergency. Also, prepare a basic kit of food, water and other necessities in case of evacuation3.  Keep your insurance policy number and insurance company claims department phone number with you. If your home is damaged or you are evacuated, you will be able to contact your insurer more easily to start the claims process. Review and understand what coverage you have, and how your policy will respond if a wildfire affects you.</p><p>Actions you can take now, particularly if you live near a forest or wooded area:</p><p>4.  Prepare your home. Check that your home's roof and exterior walls and the undersides of balconies are treated with flame-resistant materials.5.  Properly store flammable materials. Store gasoline, solvents or other materials that may ignite, at least 10 metres away from your home. 6.  Remove dry leaves and debris. Keep leaves, other dry materials and potentially flammable garbage away from the exterior of the house, especially if you have wood or vinyl siding. 7.  Manage space around your home.Remove combustible material such as shrubs, trees and woodpiles within 10 metres of your home.8.Read these valuable resourcesfrom FireSmart Canada for in-depth information about wildfire resilience and steps you can take to minimize wildfire risk</p><p>How to reduce your risk when wildfire season is in full swing:</p><p>9.  Stay informed about the weather. Be sure to monitor local and provincial information sources for fire bans and warnings.10. Pay attention to fire danger ratings. Take note of and obey fire bans and restrictions to know the likelihood of, and prevent, wildfire igniting in your region. Check your local government's website for more information.</p><p>As reported by IBCearlier this year, severe weather in 2023 caused over $3.1 billion in insured damage across Canada.Between 2020 to 2023, extreme weather in Alberta resulted in $3.6 billion in insured losses. IBC is continuing to engage with the federal and provincial governments on ways to improve the climate resilience of communities across the country. Insured losses related to severe weather in Canada now routinely exceed $2 billion annually. By comparison, between 2001 and 2010, Canadian insurers averaged $675 million a year in losses related to severe weather.</p><p> About Insurance Bureau of Canada</p><p>Established in 1964, Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) is the national industry association representing Canada's private home, auto and business insurers.

[Explosion] Treasuring the war-torn remnants of Palestinian art and culture. We'll see why one artist no longer paints in colour. But first, so many Canadians are grieving what's been lost in Jasper.</p><p><br/><br/>DEANA HAINES (VANCOUVER ISLAND RESIDENT):<br/>Everybody has your back because you are a national treasure.<br/><br/>IAN HANOMANSING (CBC-TV):<br/>The lasting memories of great old times. But let's start with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith. She toured the devastated town today to see exactly what those flames took away. Premier Smith, thank you very much for joining us.<br/><br/>DANIELLE SMITH (PREMIER OF ALBERTA):<br/>Yeah, my pleasure.<br/><br/>IAN HANOMANSING (CBC-TV):<br/>Tell me what your first impressions were as you drove into Jasper today.<br/><br/>DANIELLE SMITH (PREMIER OF ALBERTA):<br/>Well, you go, the way we drove in, there wasn't much damage and so it was encouraging to see that there is still a lot of the town standing and we know, know from having driven around a bit that there's key infrastructure that is there, 70% of town, although there may be smoke damage is, is going to be the basis from which to build. And then we went into the areas where there was a lot of fire damage, and, and that was really hard. There are some blocks where one or two homes are gone, there's some communities that are, where every home is gone. And so it's going to be hard as people look at the images, have the, the memories that they're processing and think about what it means for them to return, what they're going to return to, what kind of life they're going to have as they rebuild. There's, there's an awful lot of work to do.<br/><br/>IAN HANOMANSING (CBC-TV):<br/>So first and foremost, it's the loss from people whose homes are gone, no question. I want to talk a bit about iconic Jasper because for a lot of Canadians and people beyond our borders, it's what they think about. The big hotels, you know, the, the landmarks. How did they fare?<br/><br/>DANIELLE SMITH (PREMIER OF ALBERTA):<br/>I, I think people saw a couple of the, the historic hotels that had been on that, that main strip since I believe the '50s and '60s. I think people saw that with some of the images that were already circulating them engulfed in flames. And that's going to be hard for people to see 'cause those, those would be those, those images that you're, you, you recall when you come into town. I was pleased to hear that Jasper Park Lodge, that most of their structures have remained standing. They've had some damage and they're preparing already to, to open again. But there, people will find that there are, there's, there's a lot remaining that they will know and love. We wanted to make sure that there were a few things, like, the hospital looks great, the schools look great. The, we know that water and wastewater is, is still intact, and those are important for getting people back. School starts in a month's time. People need to know that they've got healthcare close to home and so, I, I think that when people come in there's going to be areas, of course, where it's just going to be a devastating gut punch and then others that will give them some hope that they'll be able to see recovery and the town getting back to normal.<br/><br/>IAN HANOMANSING (CBC-TV):<br/>These kinds of things can be life-changing for people, fortunately, lives were not lost, but certainly lives have been changed. What about for you as, as you see all that, is there anything in terms of your role as premier, in terms of policy that, that you're thinking, you know what, I, I need to change moving forward?<br/><br/>DANIELLE SMITH (PREMIER OF ALBERTA):<br/>Well, I can see, I mean I went through the floods as the MLA for the area back in, in 2013. I was on the air covering the Fort McMurray fires, prior to that I'd visited the Slave Lake fire site, and so I've, I've seen what has happened in the immediate aftermath, but I've also seen what happens 10 years on and how communities can, can really recover. It takes some time, there's some things that we've had to talk about. How do you remove all the debris, how do you deal with some of the toxic waste that's there, how do you make sure enough material comes in to start the reconstruction? And so all of us are already beginning to think of what do we do to make sure that we can accelerate that and be able to, to rebuild because these, these kinds of instances where you see so many structures get destroyed at once, it can be really difficult to get started, but every one of us is committed to making sure that we can get that started quickly.<br/><br/>IAN HANOMANSING (CBC-TV):<br/>You know, some people are saying, what about cuts to firefighting, what about dealing with pine beetle, dead wood? Anything do you think is going to change?<br/><br/>DANIELLE SMITH (PREMIER OF ALBERTA):<br/>I would say we, we changed last year because we, we realized that there was a lot of investment that we needed to make. So, my minister of forestry and parks, he advocated for a 50% increase to his budget, so we now have the highest forest fire budget that we've ever had. We also made sure to put a high, higher contingency away because last year we had 1.5 billion and we used it all, so this year we increased it to 2 billion.<br/><br/>IAN HANOMANSING (CBC-TV):<br/>Literally 10 seconds left.

An Oliver Paipoonge bulletin said this week that day burning was banned within that municipality as of Tuesday until further notice. \"The official fire season does not start until April 1, however, due to current weather conditions and resulting fire hazard, we are looking at (an) early start of the 2024 fire season,\" fire Chief Sean Horan said in the bulletin. </p><p>Under the order, burning is banned two hours before sunset and two hours after sunrise, the bulletin said. According to Environment Canada, the Thunder Bay area was to receive some rain late Friday and into this morning, but it wasn't expected to be \"a big dump,\" said Toronto-based meteorologist Trudy Kidd. Kidd said the low-pressure system bringing the moisture appeared to be coming from the Arctic, \"so it won't be bringing a lot of precipitation.\" Conmee fire Chief Robb Day said his municipality is also looking at similar burn restrictions \"very soon.\" \"It's looking like we are about to have a dry start to a potentially very dry and high-risk fire season,\" Day said. \"This risk . . . can be reduced exponentially by restrictions on daytime burning.\" Neebing acting fire chief Roger Van Ballegooie said that while Oliver Paipoonge's partial burn ban is \"understandable,\" Neebing isn't going to follow suit just yet. \"We will continue to watch spring melt and any further precipitation as we approach the April 1 burn permit season,\" Van Ballegooie said. Last summer's wildfire season in the province, which particularly impacted Northwestern Ontario, was one of the worst on record. A regional spokesman for Ontario's Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services agency said there is no current plans to impose any provincial restricted fire zones. \"As we are still a few weeks away from the point where provincial legislation will begin to regulate open burning, municipal fire teams who may be concerned about local fire danger conditions can enact their own measures to regulate the public's use of fire in this period,\" said Dryden-based agency spokesman Chris Marchand. On the plus side, Kidd said the forecast for next week is calling for temperatures in the Thunder Bay district to be slightly cooler than normal. The normal day-time high for the city at this time of year is 1 C.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-5f30977ec3f540a1b6c23281c15e307b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BK2-7BT1-DY9S-T0TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"405\"/><timeReceived>12:55 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 16, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX060</classCode><className>TORONTO, ON, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009WRP</classCode><className>ARCTIC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

And so we make that investment,\" said Worobey, a Canadian who is a professor and department head of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona. </p><p>But with the biological version of a forest fire, \"where these viruses can spread like wildfire through animals and people - we're still basically just flying blind,\" said Worobey. And the result, he said, is now \"a raging conflagration that is already spread across most of the United States.\"</p><p>Across the world this year, disease experts like Worobey are focused on the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu. The H5N1 virus, which has long been singled out for its potential as a threat to humans, may never develop into a global pandemic on the scale of COVID - but, the experts say, governments have so far been too slow to respond to a very real risk.</p><p>And even if the next globe-sweeping pathogen is not bird flu, they say, a key lesson of COVID is that the best time to fight a forest fire is before it takes off.</p><p>Bird flu in the U.S.The H5N1 virus wasn't detected in dairy cattle in the U.S. until March of this year, about four months after Worobey estimates it was first passed from a bird to a single dairy cow, and then spread through the herds.</p><p>It took another month for the United States Department of Agriculture to release samples of the virus, which Worobey and his team used to piece together the molecular clock that could tell them the date of that first transmission.</p><p>Since the initial discovery, bird flu has since been confirmed in 49 herds in nine states. </p><p>The response has been far slower than with COVID, said Worobey. \"There was a full genome sequence in COVID within about a day of people realizing in Wuhan that there was probably a new viral epidemic.\"</p><p>Canada, like the U.S., has been slow to react, said Worobey.</p><p>The government announced a month after bird flu was detected in U.S. cows that it would require dairy cattle imported from the U.S. to test negative for the flu.

And so we make that investment,\" said Worobey, a Canadian who is a professor and department head of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona. </p><p>But with the biological version of a forest fire, \"where these viruses can spread like wildfire through animals and people - we're still basically just flying blind,\" said Worobey. And the result, he said, is now \"a raging conflagration that is already spread across most of the United States.\"</p><p>Across the world this year, disease experts like Worobey are focused on the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu. The H5N1 virus, which has long been singled out for its potential as a threat to humans, may never develop into a global pandemic on the scale of COVID - but, the experts say, governments have so far been too slow to respond to a very real risk.</p><p>And even if the next globe-sweeping pathogen is not bird flu, they say, a key lesson of COVID is that the best time to fight a forest fire is before it takes off.</p><p>Bird flu in the U.S.The H5N1 virus wasn't detected in dairy cattle in the U.S. until March of this year, about four months after Worobey estimates it was first passed from a bird to a single dairy cow, and then spread through the herds.</p><p>It took another month for the United States Department of Agriculture to release samples of the virus, which Worobey and his team used to piece together the molecular clock that could tell them the date of that first transmission.</p><p>Since the initial discovery, bird flu has since been confirmed in 49 herds in nine states. </p><p>The response has been far slower than with COVID, said Worobey. \"There was a full genome sequence in COVID within about a day of people realizing in Wuhan that there was probably a new viral epidemic.\"</p><p>Canada, like the U.S., has been slow to react, said Worobey.</p><p>The government announced a month after bird flu was detected in U.S. cows that it would require dairy cattle imported from the U.S. to test negative for the flu. Around the same time, it said it would begin conducting tests of retail milk for viral fragments. (The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced this week that 142 samples of retail milk tested negative for fragments of bird flu.)</p><p>\"Canada is certainly no better in terms of preparing in advance for the certainty that there's going to be outbreaks in animals that could then have pandemic potential,\" Worobey said.</p><p>In an email, Health Canada said that \"based on current scientific evidence, the risk of avian influenza infection to the general public remains low.\"</p><p>For now, there is no suggestion that bird flu is being spread in cattle by respiratory droplets - an important distinction when identifying its potential for pandemic transmission.</p><p>Instead, scientists believe that the virus, which is found in greater concentrations in a cow's udder, is being spread through animals coming in contact with the virus in milking equipment.</p><p>The virus causes mastitis, inflammation of the udder, which affects milk production; the milk of infected cows appears curdled and is thrown out. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in early May that tests confirmed that pasteurization is effective at killing any live virus.</p><p>There is a risk, however low, that bird flu can spread to farm workers who touch infected animals, as it did in April in Texas, where a worker's eye became inflamed due to the virus.</p><p>The CDC recommended last week that state health departments in the U.S. work with their agriculture counterparts to make personal protective equipment (PPE) available to workers on dairy farms, poultry farms and in slaughterhouses.</p><p>A number of infectious disease experts are also calling for the development of more specific vaccines for birds, animals and humans.</p><p>Scaling up production of human vaccines against the new H5N1 variants \"seems imperative,\" a group of researchers wrote in a paper that ran in the April edition of the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, \"primarily to protect high-risk individuals such as farm workers against infection, but also for stockpiling, and secondly to increase preparedness should the virus evolve to sustained human-to-human transmission.\"</p><p>A new variant of a well-known threatBird flu is not new. </p><p>In the late '90s, an outbreak in Hong Kong in chickens jumped into humans, infecting 18 people and causing six deaths. In the following years, there have been other small outbreaks with similarly high mortality rates.</p><p>In the last couple of years, however, the virus has spread to affect more wild birds than ever before.</p><p>It has continued to jump from wild birds to domestic poultry, where it can cause severe disease and death. Millions of chickens and turkeys have been culled to stop the spread of the virus.</p><p>And for the first time, the current subvariant of H5N1 has shown a propensity to jump to mammals \"and in some cases likely transmit mammal to mammal,\" Worobey said - \"We've seen that in mink. We saw that in sea lions.\"</p><p>But \"we've never seen it in something like cattle, which are terrestrial mammals that we have very, very close interactions with, every day, directly and indirectly through their product,\" said Worobey.</p><p>As of last summer, the virus had affected at least 26 species, according to a statement by the World Health Organization. At the time of the statement, WHO recommended that given the unprecedented spread of the avian influenza virus among birds and mammals, and the potential risk to humans, that countries enhance biosecurity measures on farms, rapidly detect and report animal outbreaks and strengthen influenza surveillance in animals and humans.</p><p>Currently, the U.S. has a limited stockpile of H5N1 vaccines that target earlier strains of the virus and were made using traditional egg-based vaccine manufacturing.</p><p>Work has already started on mRNA vaccines - first used in COVID - against bird flu at the University of Pennsylvania by Dr. Drew Weissman, a physician and immunologist, who won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work on mRNA vaccine research with Katalin Karik\u00f3, an adjunct professor of neurosurgery, also at Penn.</p><p>The vaccines can take as little as a month to create, said Weissman, compared to nine months for more traditional vaccines. The University of Pennsylvania has been developing mRNA vaccine technology for use in animals for at least seven years and inoculation of cows was expected to begin this week. The work being done is in the research phase and there is no vaccine approved for animals by the United States Department of Agriculture.</p><p>Weissman said the goal was eventually to develop an mRNA vaccine against bird flu for humans.</p><p>\"Certainly for cows, and farm workers who work with the cows, I think they need to be immunized,\" said Weissman.</p><p>But developing a vaccine takes money.</p><p>Weissman said it costs $1.5 million just to make a vaccine and another $700,000 U.S. to do a toxicity study to understand elements such as potential adverse effects and safe dosages. That work has to be submitted to the FDA before clinical trials can start.</p><p>Canada has two H5N1 pandemic vaccines - authorized before mRNA technology came into use - but they are currently not available.</p><p>The vaccine production process in this country is triggered by the World Health Organization.</p><p>WHO would have to make a pandemic influenza declaration, or a recommendation that influenza vaccine manufacturers switch from seasonal to pandemic influenza vaccine, before production would start, said Health Canada in an email.</p><p>The government has agreements in place with several vaccine manufacturers - domestic and international - to ensure timely access to pandemic influenza vaccines for the entire Canadian population, according to the email, and has proactively met with GSK, the manufacturer that would make the vaccine, as well as other manufacturers, to discuss preparedness activities. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2024051971541485</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C2J-9401-JDV5-F1X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1411\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Meanwhile, over 200 firefighters and two helicopters from Ontario<url normalizedValue=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/10644578/ontario-send-alberta-firefighters-forest\">headed to Alberta</url> to lend a hand. But, why do these kinds of exchanges happen and how are they co-ordinated?</p><p>The answer to these questions provides some fascinating insights into both the dynamics of Canadian wildfires and the nuances of global disaster relief efforts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: The 2024 Jasper Fire is a grim reminder of the urgency of adopting a Canadian national wildfire strategy</emphasis></p><h>Uneven cycles</h><p>Wildfire managers in Canada face a significant problem. In some years, a province will experience massive wildfire activity, while in other years, very little will burn. In a year like 2023, B.C. burned an area more than five times the size of Prince Edward Island - while in 2011, it burned less than three times the equivalent size of the city of Charlottetown.</p><p>This creates a \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://keep.lib.asu.edu/items/156402\">peak load problem</url>.\"  Fire management agencies need to be able to manage the worst of years, but also risk being the target of criticism for being overstaffed or too expensive during quieter ones. Yet, staff need to be hired and trained, equipment needs to be purchased, and aircraft must be procured before the season even begins.</p><p>To solve the peak load problem, Canadian fire management relies on a system of mutual aid. </p><p>Fire agencies across Canada staff at a roughly appropriate level to the requirements of their 'average' fire season and if a province experiences lower-than-average fire loads then they are able to lend personnel and equipment to those that may be experiencing higher than average fire activity. This exchange is typically co-ordinated through a small but essential group of experts within the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ciffc.net/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC)</url> who co-ordinate potential exchanges between <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/mobilization-stats/member-agencies\">its members</url>.</p><p>An exchange begins with the agency in need making a request. This request is transmitted to CIFFC, which looks for availability among the other members. For example, if Alberta needs a waterbombing aircraft that Ontario is willing to share, or if Nova Scotia requires incident management personnel that the Yukon can make available then the CIFFC can help facilitate such efforts.</p><p>These exchanges are governed by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/about-0\">Canadian Interagency Mutual Aid Resources Sharing (MARS) agreement</url> which addresses the legal issues, procedures and costs involved in these collaborative efforts. In making a request, the receiving agency agrees to repay the costs of these resources, and in offering to fulfill an order, the sending agency agrees to provide staff and equipment that are up to the standards of the MARS agreement.</p><h>Collaborative efforts</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://keep.lib.asu.edu/items/156402\">CIFFC's role in fighting fires in Canada is absolutely crucial</url>. Not only does it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/sites/default/files/2024-03/CIFFC_2023CanadaReport_FINAL.pdf\">move thousands of personnel and pieces of equipment per season</url>, but it also helps to ensure firefighting infrastructure is in good working order outside of the fire season. </p><p>How do you ensure every hose in the country can connect to every pump, so that it can all be exchanged? How do you ensure that incident management teams will be able to slip into their role seamlessly and work well with counterparts across the country? CIFFC brings member agencies together year-round to negotiate these painstaking details so that pumps from Ontario coming off an airplane in Alberta can immediately be plugged into hoses from Manitoba by firefighters from Saskatchewan.</p><p>When Canadian resources are fully exhausted the provinces can also turn to CIFFC to broker international requests. This is done in much the same way: a request is made, CIFFC seeks available resources from international partners and the requesting agency repays the costs. </p><p>Some patterns may emerge, such as a tendency to only bring incident managers from expensive destinations like Australia, while bringing more firefighters from closer locales like the United States and Mexico. Moreover, these international exchanges haven't been without controversy, with recurring <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/south-african-firefighters-in-pay-dispute-leave-fort-mcmurray-1.3631385\">disputes around the relative wages</url> paid to international partners being a common theme. </p><p>It is impossible to overstate the degree to which Canada depends on mutual aid - both from within Canada and from around the world - to manage a country increasingly ravaged by wildfires. Fire managers routinely talk about the \"Spirit of the MARS,\" or the shared commitment in Canada to manage our fires together, and this collaborative spirit is in many ways our greatest asset in the fight against wildfires. </p><p>That being said, the mutual aid system is also not without challenges that must be addressed.</p><p>One challenge is climate change. As the wildfire seasons lengthen, it will become more and more difficult to draw resources from the southern hemisphere. As fires drag into Australian autumns and emerge earlier in Canadian springs, it will become more difficult to rely other countries during their traditional quiet periods. Additionally, as the fire load rises across the whole country and whole season, it becomes harder to find resources in quiet times elsewhere within the country.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: As wildfires become more frequent and intense, how will persistent smoke exposure affect long-term health?</emphasis></p><p>These pressures mean that it's critical every member agency continues to increase their capacity as their fire load increases, rather than relying only on other provinces to backfill. The variability of the \"peak load\" problem will continue, but as the wildfire season grows, Canada's provinces and territories will need to be prepared not just for their own needs but to be on hand to help their fellow Canadians as well.</p><h>Unexpected benefits</h><p>Canada depends on mutual aid to manage its fire. Moreover, mutual aid brings <url normalizedValue=\"https://appliedecologistsblog.com/2021/03/17/wildfires-are-we-ready-for-the-future/\">all sorts of other benefits</url>.</p><p>Mutual aid in firefighting efforts build trusted relationships and professional exchanges as firefighters collaborate across the country. The very practical exchange of learning, knowledge, and experience beyond what a firefighter could ever hope to acquire working within their province alone is itself a huge asset to Canadian firefighting efforts. </p><p>Confronting the challenge of a future in flames requires investing in the \"Spirit of the MARS,\" and continuing to lean on mutual aid rather than attempting to go it alone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Eric Kennedy receives funding from Natural Resources Canada, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONCAN-235576</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONCAN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CK4-S6K1-JB75-91S6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463597</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1125\"/><timeReceived>9:46 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - Canada</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7729\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 26, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

And the result, he said, is now \"a raging conflagration that is already spread across most of the United States.\"</p><p>Across the world this year, disease experts like Worobey are focused on the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu. The H5N1 virus, which has long been singled out for its potential as a threat to humans, may never develop into a global pandemic on the scale of COVID - but, the experts say, governments have so far been too slow to respond to a very real risk.</p><p>And even if the next globe-sweeping pathogen is not bird flu, they say, a key lesson of COVID is that the best time to fight a forest fire is before it takes off.</p><p>Bird flu in the U.S.The H5N1 virus wasn't detected in dairy cattle in the U.S. until March of this year, about four months after Worobey estimates it was first passed from a bird to a single dairy cow, and then spread through the herds.</p><p>It took another month for the United States Department of Agriculture to release samples of the virus, which Worobey and his team used to piece together the molecular clock that could tell them the date of that first transmission.</p><p>Since the initial discovery, bird flu has since been confirmed in 49 herds in nine states. </p><p>The response has been far slower than with COVID, said Worobey. \"There was a full genome sequence in COVID within about a day of people realizing in Wuhan that there was probably a new viral epidemic.\"</p><p>Canada, like the U.S., has been slow to react, said Worobey.</p><p>The government announced a month after bird flu was detected in U.S. cows that it would require dairy cattle imported from the U.S. to test negative for the flu. Around the same time, it said it would begin conducting tests of retail milk for viral fragments. (The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced this week that 142 samples of retail milk tested negative for fragments of bird flu.)</p><p>\"Canada is certainly no better in terms of preparing in advance for the certainty that there's going to be outbreaks in animals that could then have pandemic potential,\" Worobey said.</p><p>In an email, Health Canada said that \"based on current scientific evidence, the risk of avian influenza infection to the general public remains low.\"</p><p>For now, there is no suggestion that bird flu is being spread in cattle by respiratory droplets - an important distinction when identifying its potential for pandemic transmission.</p><p>Instead, scientists believe that the virus, which is found in greater concentrations in a cow's udder, is being spread through animals coming in contact with the virus in milking equipment.</p><p>The virus causes mastitis, inflammation of the udder, which affects milk production; the milk of infected cows appears curdled and is thrown out. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in early May that tests confirmed that pasteurization is effective at killing any live virus.</p><p>There is a risk, however low, that bird flu can spread to farm workers who touch infected animals, as it did in April in Texas, where a worker's eye became inflamed due to the virus.</p><p>The CDC recommended last week that state health departments in the U.S. work with their agriculture counterparts to make personal protective equipment (PPE) available to workers on dairy farms, poultry farms and in slaughterhouses.</p><p>A number of infectious disease experts are also calling for the development of more specific vaccines for birds, animals and humans.</p><p>Scaling up production of human vaccines against the new H5N1 variants \"seems imperative,\" a group of researchers wrote in a paper that ran in the April edition of the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, \"primarily to protect high-risk individuals such as farm workers against infection, but also for stockpiling, and secondly to increase preparedness should the virus evolve to sustained human-to-human transmission.\"</p><p>A new variant of a well-known threatBird flu is not new. </p><p>In the late '90s, an outbreak in Hong Kong in chickens jumped into humans, infecting 18 people and causing six deaths. In the following years, there have been other small outbreaks with similarly high mortality rates.</p><p>In the last couple of years, however, the virus has spread to affect more wild birds than ever before.</p><p>It has continued to jump from wild birds to domestic poultry, where it can cause severe disease and death. Millions of chickens and turkeys have been culled to stop the spread of the virus.</p><p>And for the first time, the current subvariant of H5N1 has shown a propensity to jump to mammals \"and in some cases likely transmit mammal to mammal,\" Worobey said - \"We've seen that in mink. We saw that in sea lions.\"</p><p>But \"we've never seen it in something like cattle, which are terrestrial mammals that we have very, very close interactions with, every day, directly and indirectly through their product,\" said Worobey.</p><p>As of last summer, the virus had affected at least 26 species, according to a statement by the World Health Organization.

And so we make that investment,\" said Worobey, a Canadian who is a professor and department head of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona. </p><p>But with the biological version of a forest fire, \"where these viruses can spread like wildfire through animals and people - we're still basically just flying blind,\" said Worobey. And the result, he said, is now \"a raging conflagration that is already spread across most of the United States.\"</p><p>Across the world this year, disease experts like Worobey are focused on the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu. The H5N1 virus, which has long been singled out for its potential as a threat to humans, may never develop into a global pandemic on the scale of COVID - but, the experts say, governments have so far been too slow to respond to a very real risk.</p><p>And even if the next globe-sweeping pathogen is not bird flu, they say, a key lesson of COVID is that the best time to fight a forest fire is before it takes off.</p><p>Bird flu in the U.S.The H5N1 virus wasn't detected in dairy cattle in the U.S. until March of this year, about four months after Worobey estimates it was first passed from a bird to a single dairy cow, and then spread through the herds.</p><p>It took another month for the United States Department of Agriculture to release samples of the virus, which Worobey and his team used to piece together the molecular clock that could tell them the date of that first transmission.</p><p>Since the initial discovery, bird flu has since been confirmed in 49 herds in nine states. </p><p>The response has been far slower than with COVID, said Worobey. \"There was a full genome sequence in COVID within about a day of people realizing in Wuhan that there was probably a new viral epidemic.\"</p><p>Canada, like the U.S., has been slow to react, said Worobey.</p><p>The government announced a month after bird flu was detected in U.S. cows that it would require dairy cattle imported from the U.S. to test negative for the flu. Around the same time, it said it would begin conducting tests of retail milk for viral fragments. (The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced this week that 142 samples of retail milk tested negative for fragments of bird flu.)</p><p>\"Canada is certainly no better in terms of preparing in advance for the certainty that there's going to be outbreaks in animals that could then have pandemic potential,\" Worobey said.</p><p>In an email, Health Canada said that \"based on current scientific evidence, the risk of avian influenza infection to the general public remains low.\"</p><p>For now, there is no suggestion that bird flu is being spread in cattle by respiratory droplets - an important distinction when identifying its potential for pandemic transmission.</p><p>Instead, scientists believe that the virus, which is found in greater concentrations in a cow's udder, is being spread through animals coming in contact with the virus in milking equipment.</p><p>The virus causes mastitis, inflammation of the udder, which affects milk production; the milk of infected cows appears curdled and is thrown out.
