Many contestants from all over Canada came to compete for a pageant title, and Hailey was successful in winning a coveted crown and a prestigious title.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Initially, Hailey was interested in competing for the title of Miss WorldCanada, but in an interview last month with ANNews, she shared that after arriving at the pageant she found that she was more drawn to running for Miss Earth Canada \u00a0\u2013 and she ended up winning the title.</p><p>Miss Earth is one of the Big Four international beauty pageants alongside Miss Universe, Miss World and Miss International. Miss Earth, in comparison to these other pageants, advocates for environmental awareness and conservation. It has partnered with organizations such as the United Nations and Plan International.</p><p>Countries from all over the world will be sending a contestant to represent them at the Miss Earth 2025 pageant that will be happening in the Philippines. The pageant dates are yet to be announced, but Hailey told ANNews the pageant would most likely happen in November 2025.</p><p>Hailey is currently a student at the University of Alberta with a planned graduation date of April 2026. \u201cSo I have to manage my classes while I\u2019m going to the Philippines, because I\u2019ll be in the Philippines for just over a month. Maybe a month and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I won Miss Earth Canada, I was really excited because I knew it was an opportunity to represent Indigenous people, because Indigenous people have a unique perspective and relationship with the land,\u201d Hailey said.</p><p>Some activities Hailey has been doing as Miss Earth Canada 2025 are tree planting and removing wire fences. She also has been trying to promote traditional Indigenous teachings and speaking up about overconsumption.</p><p>\u201cOne of the main things I want to do is really promote the message of traditional teachings in the best way I can. Of course, I can\u2019t say everything because it\u2019s tradition. But, the things I can say [I want to promote], like taking only what we need and not overconsuming the resources. I really want to spread those messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople tend to overconsume and they\u2019re just focused on buying the next best thing. But, for me with my perspective \u2014 especially being really involved in a traditional way of life \u2014 it doesn\u2019t always have to be the newest or best thing,\u201d Hailey said. She recommended that instead of overconsuming new products, people could thrift or utilize items they already have.</p><p>Additionally, through her role, Hailey wants to spread awareness about language revitalization. \u201cI really want to spread awareness for language revitalization. Because I know a lot of traditional knowledge, and traditional knowledge and ways of living with the land are embedded in language,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not only in Canada, but around the world there\u2019s a lot of Indigenous languages that are endangered right now.\u201d</p><p>She also wants to speak up about forest fire prevention. \u201cA lot of [forest fires] are man-made or caused by man. And we only have one earth. We\u2019re the only planet in the solar system that has life. But, if we keep disrespecting the earth, then where are we going to go? So, we have to really put into perspective the amount of damage humans can do. And as Indigenous people, we already know these issues and we\u2019ve been talking about it for a long time.\u201d</p><p>When asked about advice she would give to Indigenous people interested in environmental activism, Hailey said, \u201cI would say the things we feel is common knowledge is not common knowledge for everybody.\u201d Hailey explained that she grew up on the reserve, and spent a lot of time on and around the land. She learned to have respect for animals and trees. \u201cAnd now that I live in the city, I\u2019ve realized that many people don\u2019t understand these basic principles and it\u2019s crazy to me. So I would say the first step is definitely encouraging people to understand values of empathy. Because even having empathy for the land and animals, that\u2019s a big step.\u201d</p><p>When asked for any advice she would have for people who are interested in pageants, Hailey said, \u201cI would tell them to just try it out even if you don\u2019t feel confident or you don\u2019t feel like you can do it. Because, honestly every time I\u2019ve gone to a pageant I\u2019ve learned something about myself. And at the end of the day having self-growth or having a new experience to tell your friends and family about is so worth it, even if you don\u2019t end up winning. The experiences are once in a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>After being asked how she thinks being Miss Earth Canada can help the Indigenous community in Canada overall, Hailey responded by saying, \u201cSo, honestly the first step is visibility because people around the world still think Indigenous people are living in teepees. They don\u2019t really think we\u2019re still around, because they read about us in the history books or the text books. So with me going to [Miss Earth Canada], it\u2019s starting to bring awareness and more visibility. And then since it\u2019s earth-focused, that\u2019s where I can really incorporate culture. And that\u2019s what I want to do. My whole journey is to advocate and bring awareness to Indigenous culture. And I want to show everybody how beautiful Indigenous culture is.\u201d</p><p>More information about Hailey Hamelin-Wilson can be found at her official Instagram account @haileyykat.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-448f228aaaf64ef79888728af46b95c7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GSS-4MX3-RSX7-T151-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"945\"/><timeReceived>08:13 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 19, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It shows $92.7 million has been budgeted for \"capital assets\" in 2025-2026, a category that explicitly includes the purchase of aircraft, though none of this is earmarked for new waterbombers.</p><p>The confidential budget presentation lists \"key ministry procurements,\" including dam rehabilitation, a new forest fire base in Kenora and long-term helicopter service contracts for the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch - but no waterbombers.</p><p>There's no mention of money for new waterbombers in the May's provincial budget, either.</p><p>Ford's office declined an interview request and did not respond to questions. After this story went online, his spokesperson emailed to explain the waterbomber order has not been completed.</p><p>\"The province must go undergo a procurement process before the final cost is released,\" wrote Hannah Jensen. \"We are required to negotiate the final costs for procurement and once that process concludes, final costs can be shared, and money can be allocated to purchase the equipment.\"</p><p>Jensen did not answer follow-up questions about why the purchase price of $530 million, publicly announced in February, wasn't being used, even in confidential internal planning documents.</p><p>This spring, the province called upon other jurisdictions for assistance, receiving two waterbombers from Quebec. These have helped fill the hole left by three of Ontario's waterbombers, which have been grounded due to a lack of pilots, according to OPSEU, the public sector union that represents fire rangers and pilots. </p><p>\"We've got this commitment where they say, 'We're buying six more water bombers.' OK, but we don't even have enough pilots to fly the ones we have,\" said JP Hornick, president of OPSEU. \"Announcements about stuff, about infrastructure projects, about new water bombers - they're really splashy, but they don't address the problem that is the crisis underneath it, which is how are you bringing in the people to do the work to actually fly the bombers?\"</p><p>Last month, the Star published The Coming Firestorm, a three-part series that outlined a severe staffing shortage on the front lines of defence against forest fires. At a time when climate change is creating more and bigger wildfires, Ontario has 100 fewer fire rangers than it did a decade ago.</p><p>This year, more than 375,000 hectares of forest have already burned in Ontario, making this season one of the five worst in the last 30 years - and there are three months left.</p><p>The Ministry of Natural Resources declined to answer questions and referred the Star to its previous statements, which did not directly address the waterbomber purchase.</p><p>\"Ontario remains an internationally recognized leader in wildfire fire management,\" states an email from Natural Resources Minister Mike Harris Jr.'s office sent June 23. \"Every fire season, Ontario works with provincial, federal, and international partners to ensure the necessary resources are deployed to keep communities in our province, and across North America, safe. These mutual aid partnership agreements enable the sharing of an additional 320 personnel, equipment, and aircraft between agencies.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, as the Red Lake 12 fire northwest of Thunder Bay continues to grow - and could soon become the biggest forest fire in Ontario's history - the effects of the waterbomber shortage are becoming clear.</p><p>Because the waterbombers operate in pairs, there are only three \"tanker packages\" available for the entire province, said Noah Freedman, a wildland firefighter crew leader, and vice-president of OPSEU Local 703. With 37 fires currently burning and as many as a dozen new blazes breaking out every day, the bombers can only attack a small fraction of the fires. </p><p>\"Successful containment of wildfires starts when they're small. Waterbombers come in when we're getting our pumps set up and they smash the fire down to something more manageable that we can contain quickly,\" Freedman said. \"This season, more often than not, if there's a lot of fires, they'll just go: 'Sorry, we're not sending air attack.' \"</p><p>The waterbomber purchase was announced during the last election campaign in February and remains online under the headline \"Only Doug Ford and the Ontario PCs will protect northern Ontario.\" Ford's re-election campaign promised $530 million for the purchase of six new waterbombers, expanding the province's fleet of \"super scoopers\" from nine to 15.</p><p>That half a billion dollars is not listed in the leaked planning document. A section that outlines \"Key 2025-26 Capital Projects\" lists 13 much smaller expenditures for forest-fire fighting, including $10.8 million for an \"Avionics Upgrade to CL-415 Waterbombers,\" $3.2 million for \"Twin Otter Engine Overhauls\" and $8.6 million for the \"Construction (of a) Forward Attack Base in Socket Lake.\"</p><p>Last month, Ford said the order had been placed. \"We ordered another six more water bombers ... the problem is right now they're backlogged,\" he said, according to a CBC report. \"They produce them in Alberta, God bless them. But it's taking four years to produce more water bombers.\"</p><p>\"Where's the evidence that they've actually been ordered, purchased or even budgeted for?\" said Lise Vaugeois, the NDP MPP for Thunder Bay-Superior North. \"The North is burning now, three communities have been evacuated, and they're just wasting time.\"</p><p>The new waterbombers aren't even being made yet, said John Gradek, a professor of aviation and supply chain management at McGill University. The manufacturer, De Havilland Canada, is still building a factory outside Calgary, where the first CL-515 waterbombers aren't scheduled to roll off the line until late 2027 or early 2028.</p><p>De Havilland did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Gradek said the factory will be able to make 10 waterbombers a year and there are already 22 planes on order from European countries, which would delay delivery to Ontario until the early to mid 2030s, even if the order were placed today. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2025070375987094</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G5X-HV33-RSK2-10GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1131\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

The Company has four divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, Gold Division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, an Antimony-Gold Division as well as an investment in MetalQuest Minings (TSXV:MQM | OTC:MQMIF) a high purity Lac Otelnuk Iron Ore Project.</p><p>On September 25th, the Company announced a $3,500,000 financing with a lead order from Mr. Eric Sprott for $2,000,000. Due to heightened investor demand, the Company increased the financing to $4,000,000 on September 26th. On October 10th, the Company closed the second tranche of the financing with Eric Sprott subscribing to $2,000,000. On October 10th, Mr Sprott owned 37.4% of the Company on a partially diluted basis and is the largest shareholder. The Company is well financed with no debt.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North Americas largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>On October 1st 2025, the Company announced that it has entered into agreement to option the Bonanza Gold Project, located in the Kenora Gold District. The Project consists of 114 mining claims and 1 patented Mining Claim totalling 2,191 hectares or 5,414 acres. The Project has multiple high-grade mineral occurrences with spectacular visible gold at surface along with excellent infrastructure including road access to all areas of the Project along with provincial grid power lines. The Kenora Gold District is known for its high-grade Archean lode-gold deposits, the district has supported mineral exploration and some mining for more than a century. Some of the active majors and mid-tier companies in the District are Agnico Eagle, Kinross, Centerra and New Gold. NAMs technical team is currently back in the field working on the 2nd phase of our Fall Program.</p><p>Management, with NAMs Technical Team, are also preparing the Bonanza Gold Projects Go-Forward Plan, Exploration Plan and budgets for the balance of 2025 and for the year 2026. Further announcements on the Bonanza Gold Project will be forth coming. During the visit, the Company filmed a due diligence site visit video which takes the viewer behind the scenes of a project acquisition. The second part of this corporate video is expected to be released mid day on October 15th, 2025.</p><p>Photographs of Selected Due Diligence High-Grade Samples Collected by NAM Technical Representatives</p><p>The Companys Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (MinRes), one of the worlds largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area.</p><p>New Age Metals Lithium division project map</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canadas critical metals sector, with New Age Metals portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Ages properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat LakeWinnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>On September 9th 2025, the Company announced the completion of the Summer 2025 Exploration Program on the 100% owned Alaskan PGM-Cu-Ni Genesis Project. The project is road-accessible and situated within 3 km of the all-season Richardson Highway and a high-capacity power line. Known mineralization covers a distance of 9 km across the prospect. The target areas have never been drilled. A Technical Report is available. The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>The Alaskan Gensis Project has ample surface showings of copper, nickel, platinum and palladium and has never been drilled.

Although the Company believes that such statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts; they are generally, but not always, identified by the words \"expects\", \"plans\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"interpreted\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"projects\", \"aims\", \"suggests\", \"indicate\", \"often\", \"target\", \"future\", \"likely\", \"encouraging\", \"pending\", \"potential\", \"goal\", \"objective\", \"opportunity\", \"prospective\", \"possibly\", \"preliminary\", and similar expressions, or that events or conditions \"will\", \"would\", \"may\", \"can\", \"could\" or \"should\" occur, or are those statements, which, by their nature, refer to future events. The Company cautions that forward- looking statements are based on the beliefs, estimates and opinions of the Company's management on the date the statements are made, and they involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Consequently, there can be no assurances that such statements will prove to be accurate and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Except to the extent required by applicable securities laws and the policies of the TSXV or the NYSE American, the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements if management's beliefs, estimates or opinions, or other factors, should change. Factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward- looking statements include risks associated with the Company's receiving all the approvals necessary for completion of the Private Placement and the timing of such approvals.

Although the Company believes that such statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts; they are generally, but not always, identified by the words \"expects\", \"plans\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"interpreted\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"projects\", \"aims\", \"suggests\", \"indicate\", \"often\", \"target\", \"future\", \"likely\", \"encouraging\", \"pending\", \"potential\", \"goal\", \"objective\", \"opportunity\", \"prospective\", \"possibly\", \"preliminary\", and similar expressions, or that events or conditions \"will\", \"would\", \"may\", \"can\", \"could\" or \"should\" occur, or are those statements, which, by their nature, refer to future events. The Company cautions that forward- looking statements are based on the beliefs, estimates and opinions of the Company's management on the date the statements are made, and they involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Consequently, there can be no assurances that such statements will prove to be accurate and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Except to the extent required by applicable securities laws and the policies of the TSXV or the NYSE American, the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements if management's beliefs, estimates or opinions, or other factors, should change. Factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward- looking statements include risks associated with the Company's receiving all the approvals necessary for completion of the Private Placement and the timing of such approvals.

(TSX.V: NAM | OTCQB: NMTLF | FSE: P7J) (\"NAM\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that further to its news release of October 1, 2025, the Company has received TSX Venture Exchange approval for the Bonanza Gold Project (the \"Project\") with arms-length parties, Mr. Doug Bundy, Mr. Dave Burt and Mr. Jon Burt (the \"Partners\"), who are all local Kenora Mining District Prospectors. The Partners granted the Company an option to acquire 100% of the Project. The Project consists of 114 mining claims and 1 patented Mining Claim totalling 2,191 hectares or 5,414 acres and is located ~25 km southeast of Kenora in northwestern Ontario (the \"Transaction\"). The Partners will also retain a 2% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty, of which NAM has the right to re-purchase 1% for $1 million.</p><p>Highlights</p><p>Highlights of the Bonanza Gold Project are:</p><p>Multiple high-grade mineral occurrences of gold at surface;</p><p>Excellent infrastructure, including road access to all areas to the Project and provincial grid power lines;</p><p>Location 25 km southeast of City of Kenora, a major northwestern Ontario economic hub with a population of ~14,800;</p><p>Select due diligence surface grab sample assays include 1.1 g/t Au, 3.7 g/t Au, 8.9 g/t Au, 13.2 g/t Au, 22.2 g/t Au, 31.9 g/t Au and up to 127 g/t Au from five prospects on the Project (see Table 2 below);</p><p>Lack of modern-day exploration; and</p><p>Drill-ready with 3-year permits in place.</p><p>Our long-term goal is to assemble a district-scale gold asset in Kenora that can ultimately attract the attention of major gold producers that are now cash rich with significant new exploration funds.</p><p>In connection with the closing of the Transaction, the Company is issuing an aggregate 302,298 common shares, at a deemed price of $0.4135 per share, and is making a total cash payment of $40,000 to the Partners pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The remaining share payments under the terms of the agreement, will be calculated based on the 10-day trading average of NAM shares at the time of each issuance subject to a minimum deemed issue price of $0.2475 per share. The agreement also provides for contingent milestone payments of $250,000 in cash or shares, or combination thereof, on the completion of an NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource and Technical Report outlining more than one million ounces of gold, and an additional $250,000 in cash or shares, or combination thereof, for a compliant Mineral Resource exceeding 2.5 million ounces. If the Company issues any shares in connection with the contingent milestone payments, those shares remain subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval.</p><p>The shares issuable are subject to a four-month plus one-day hold period in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws. No finder's fees were paid by the Company in connection with the Transaction.</p><p>With the gold price and demand at historic highs, parts of the Kenora District have seen limited application of modern exploration methods, which provides NAM with an opportunity to unlock significant value through the use of new techniques, advanced technologies and upgraded mineralization models. Our long-term goal is to assemble a district-scale gold asset in Kenora that can ultimately attract the attention of major gold producers that are now cash rich with significant new exploration funds, as a result of their recent enhanced profitability. Given the severe lack of funds in recent years for the junior mining industry, there has been little new modern-day exploration completed in this region.</p><p>Chairman and CEO Harry Barr states, \"We began our search for new gold assets in early 2024, leading to the establishment of our Gold-Antimony Division in Newfoundland in early 2025. Since then, our technical and management teams have been systematically reviewing projects on an international scale.</p><p>Always more comfortable with North American assets, the Directors, Management and Technical Team of NAM believe the Bonanza Gold Project and parts of the Kenora Mining District have been under-explored, under-appreciated, and under-funded in recent years. This new acquisition adds to our diversified mineral portfolio, and we believe it is a significant gold exploration project for the Company. This additional gold Project will allow our shareholders more exposure to what we believe is one of most significant gold rallies in recent history. Gold is not a new metal for the New Age Metals management team and board of directors; in fact, we collectively have over 150 years experience in the gold industry.</p><p>Currently, our Technical Team is working with the Prospectors Mr. Bundy and Mr. Burt and are completing a second phase of work on the Bonanza Project. Field work is expected to be concluded by the end of the month, and a number of assays will be sent to the lab. Additionally, the team will be completing desktop work to coordinate all the results from both phases of work and compile a tremendous amount of digital data that came from the property and Government sources over the years.</p><p>Lastly, the technical/prospecting team are re-boxing old core from historical drilling on the property and moving it to a new facility. Results are expected before year end and Management are working to complete the 2026 exploration budget for the Bonanza Gold Project.</p><p>From the onset, our corporate objective has been to acquire and develop critical metal projects. Today we are a well financed, multi-asset company that is aggressively expanding its project portfolio across gold, antimony, lithium, and platinum group metals. In my opinion, our flagship asset is still the <url normalizedValue=\"https://newagemetals.com/river-valley-palladium-project\">https://newagemetals.com/river-valley-palladium-project</url>/ and both platinum and palladium have enjoyed major price increases in the last 3 months.</p><p>In June of this year, NAM upsized its equity position in MetalQuest Mining to ~12%. MetalQuest Mining inc. (TSXV:MQM | OTCQB: MQMIF | FRA:E7Q) who controls a 100% of a substantial, high-purity iron deposit project in the Labrador Trough, Quebec. Approximately $120 million has been spent to date, including a historical NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate and a 2015 Feasibility Study<url normalizedValue=\"https://metalquestmining.com/news/metalquest-mining-welcomes-distinguished-global-steel-mining-executive-praveen-kumar-jha-as-a-strategic-adviser-for-mqm-and-its-lac-otelnuk-iron-ore-project-labrador-trough-quebec/\">https://metalquestmining.com/news/metalquest-mining-welcomes-distinguished-global-steel-mining-executive-praveen-kumar-jha-as-a-strategic-adviser-for-mqm-and-its-lac-otelnuk-iron-ore-project-labrador-trough-quebec/</url>\"</p><p>Farid Mammadov, VP Investor Relations states, \"In today's climate of global uncertainty, gold has once again proven itself to be one of the world's most essential metals. Gold price has reached an all high and global demand continues to climb. These market conditions have opened the door for NAM to add to its already diversified and significant project portfolio and mineral inventory. The response to our recent private placement indicates that there is renewed investor interest in both our company and the broader junior mining industry. Proof that the industry is turning around was the recent upsizing of our private placement to $4,000,000. Mr. Eric Sprott indicated his intention to subscribe for $2,000,000 hard dollars for last week's placement. Currently, the Company has approx. $6.5 Million in cash, marketable securities and restricted securities and no debt.\"</p><p>The Kenora Gold District</p><p>The Kenora Gold District, located in northwestern Ontario, has been recognized since the late-1800s as one of Canada's most prolific gold camps. Known for its high-grade Archean lode-gold deposits, the district has supported mineral exploration and some mining for more than a century. With established infrastructure, year-round access, and a highly skilled workforce, Kenora has potential to become a cornerstone of Ontario's mining industry. Some of the active majors and mid-tier companies in the District are Agnico Eagle, Kinross, Centerra and New Gold.</p><p>Due Diligence Site Visit and Sampling</p><p>A due diligence site visit and verification sampling program was successfully executed in early September, 2025. Twenty-five grab samples were taken from quartz veins, quartz-carbonate veins and sulphide zones at 5 prospects distributed along 4 km across the Property. The mineralized vein and zones are hosted in silicified, carbonated and sulphidized (mainly pyrite) mafic to intermediate volcanic and plutonic host rocks. The rocks are cut by a regional high-strain zone and property-scale and smaller scale structures and generally metamorphosed under greenschist conditions.</p><p>The mineral occurrences sampled and RUSH gold assay results are listed in Table 1. Photographs of selected high-grade samples are shown in Figure 1. The due diligence program successfully confirmed the presence of high-grade gold mineralization on the Project, particularly at the Triggs, Kite Lake, Stella and Blue Star Prospects.</p><p>Figure 1.

Two certified reference materials (\"CRMs\") were inserted into the sample batch. The CRMs were sourced from industry-certified providers and selected to match, as closely as possible, the expected mineralization style and grade ranges of the samples.</p><p>All samples were individually sealed in heavy-duty plastic bags, labelled with unique sample numbers, and placed into rice bags for transport. Continuous possession of the samples was maintained until they were dropped off at a courier service in Saskatoon for express delivery to SGS Canada Minerals laboratory facilities in Burnaby, British Columbia. At this facility, the samples were weighed and prepared into pulps in accordance with SGS's standard procedures before being analysed on a RUSH basis for gold.</p><p>The analytical work included:</p><p>Gold: Au exploration grade 50-g Fire Assay with Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (\"AAS\") (reporting limits 5 to 10,000 ppb) (GE_FAA50V5</p><p>Gold: Au over limit analysis high-grade 50-g Fire Assay with Gravimetric Finish (reporting limits 0.5 to 10000 ppm) (GO_FAG50V);</p><p>Internal laboratory QA/QC procedures at SGS included the insertion and analysis of certified reference materials, analytical blanks and sample duplicates with the submitted samples to monitor analytical accuracy and precision.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Dr. William Stone, P.Geo. and a Qualified Person for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and a consultant to NAM, has collected, reviewed and approved the scientific and technical disclosure in this press release.</p><p>The Qualified Person has not completed sufficient work to verify the historical information on the neighbouring and other properties in the Kenora region. Nevertheless, the Qualified Person considers that drilling and analytical results were completed to industry standard practices. The reader is cautioned that mineral occurrences, prospects and deposits on neighbouring properties are not necessarily indicative of mineralization on the Company's properties. This information may provide an indication of the exploration potential of the Properties, but might not be representative of exploration results.</p><p>About NAM</p><p>New Age Metals is a junior mineral exploration and development company focused on the discovery, exploration, and development of critical green and precious metal projects in North America. The Company has four divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, Gold Division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, an Antimony-Gold Division as well as an investment in <url normalizedValue=\"https://metalquestmining.com\">https://metalquestmining.com</url>/ a high purity Lac Otelnuk Iron Project#ftn1.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North America's largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska. The PGM Division is both an industrial and critical metal division.</p><p>On October 1st 2025, the Company announced that it has entered into agreement to option the Bonanza Gold Project, located in the Kenora Gold District. The Project consists of 114 mining claims and 1 patented Mining Claim totalling 2,191 hectares or 5,414 acres. The Project has multiple high-grade mineral occurrences with spectacular visible gold at surface along with excellent infrastructure including road access to all areas of the Project along with provincial grid power lines. The Kenora Gold District is known for its high-grade Archean lode-gold deposits and has supported mineral exploration and some mining- for more than a century. Some of the active majors and mid-tier companies in the District are Agnico Eagle, Kinross, Centerra and New Gold. NAM's technical team is currently working on the exploration plan and budget for the balance of 2025 and for 2026. Further announcements on the Bonanza Gold Project will be forth coming.</p><p>The Company's Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (\"MinRes\"), one of the world's largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area.</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canada's critical metals sector, with New Age Metals' portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Age's properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat Lake-Winnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAM's Gold-Antimony division is in Newfoundland and spans roughly 20,000 hectares. The majority of these properties are in St. Alban's area, along Canstar's Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Gold's Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 Exploration of the Project, Phase 2 has been initiated, and further news will follow. On July 30th, the Company was pleased to announce that it has received formal approval under Newfoundland and Labrador's Junior Exploration Assistance (\"JEA\") Program, including eligibility for the Critical Minerals Assistance (\"CMA\") and Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (\"PCMA\") streams. The potential rebate total for eligible exploration activities is $71,975.</p><p>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with today's issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.</p><p>MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron#ftn3 projects at Lac Otelnuk (Quebec), where approximately $120 million has been spent on the project. For more information, <url normalizedValue=\"https://metalquestmining.com/\">https://metalquestmining.com/</url>. High-purity iron oxide became a critical metal Federally in Canada and in the Provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador in 2024. In the summer of 2025, MQM contracted AtkinsRealis, an international engineering company, to complete a GAP Analysis on the Lac Otelnuk Project and its 2015 Feasibility Study.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities on an international scale. Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of expending sufficient explorations and development expenditure to eventually option our projects with Major and Junior mining companies through to exploration and development phases on to production.</p><p>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>Investors are invited to visit the New Age Metals website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newagemetals.com\">www.newagemetals.com</url> where they can review the company and its corporate activities.

While sufficient crews will stay at the territory\u2019s fire bases, the government can recall resources within 24 hours as needed if the local fire situation changes, per the release.</p><p>The Yukon has experienced a busy season so far, fire officials told reporters during a July 30 briefing. The territory has brought in 192 firefighters as of that briefing, in addition to the 50 export firefighters that were sent outside the territory by that point in time.</p><p>The Yukon government responded to the request the province made through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. The national centre\u2019s situational report for Aug. 12 puts Saskatchewan, as well as Manitoba, at Level 5 for preparedness. Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick were at Level 4.</p><p>Contact Dana Hatherly at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dana.hatherly@yukon-news.com\">dana.hatherly@yukon-news.com</email></p><p>News Reporter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20250813PTEA0004879873</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGY-4H83-RRYW-D015-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Along the route, children will stop at interactive stations, hear presentations from FireSmart representatives, and collect items to build their own \"to-go bags\" \u2014 emergency kits containing essentials such as identification, medication, food, water and phone chargers, designed to last at least 72 hours during an evacuation.</p><p>The afternoon session is already full, and only a few spots remain for the morning. Signs will be posted to guide participants along the trail.</p><p>Callahan noted that the Northwest Fire Centre does not have the same reputation for catastrophic wildfires as other B.C. regions, but that the area is still vulnerable. Large fires occur roughly once every 200 years.</p><p>\"We're right there. We're due. A lot of people are realizing that with our forests. They're seeing the climate changing, and saying \u2018fire-smarting my property is exactly what we need to do to protect our homes,'\" she said.</p><p>Wildfire preparedness is increasingly on people's minds, she added. \"Being prepared is at the forefront of everybody's mind, because everybody knows somebody who has been impacted by a forest fire in B.C.\"</p><p>The program is aimed at children to instill knowledge early. \"In this event, it's like the school system, where you teach children something young, they grow with that information,\" she said. \"We're empowering the youth. The more information we can give them, the better decisions they'll make when they're homeowners themselves.\"</p><p>Funded through the province's Park Enhancement Fund, which is financed by the BC Parks Licence Plate Program, the scavenger hunt is a first for the northwest. Callahan hopes to share the concept with other municipalities so their FireSmart chapters can host similar events. \"The message is clear and direct. It's relevant to everybody,\" she said.</p><p>The event was developed through grant funding and team brainstorming, Callahan added. \"It's our little baby right now, and we're hoping to develop it further and spread the message.\"</p><p>Those unable to attend can find safety tips and resources on the FireSmart Kitimat Facebook page.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Kitimat Northern Sentinel</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KITINS-news20250813PKI4752591</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KITINS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGR-4Y83-RXPP-G000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438223</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"444\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

While sufficient crews will stay at the territory's fire bases, the government can recall resources within 24 hours as needed if the local fire situation changes, per the release.</p><p>The Yukon has experienced a busy season so far, fire officials told reporters during a July 30 briefing. The territory has brought in 192 firefighters as of that briefing, in addition to the 50 export firefighters that were sent outside the territory by that point in time.</p><p>The Yukon government responded to the request the province made through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. The national centre's situational report for Aug. 12 puts Saskatchewan, as well as Manitoba, at Level 5 for preparedness. Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick were at Level 4.</p><p>Contact Dana Hatherly at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dana.hatherly@yukon-news.com\">dana.hatherly@yukon-news.com</email></p><p>Copyright 2025 Yukon News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20250812IYN4752475</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGK-VMG3-RT38-N41C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Judge Tony Graf agreed to make some allowances to protect Robinson\u2019s presumption of innocence before a trial. Utah prosecutors have charged Robinson with aggravated murder and plan to seek the death penalty.

Republicans have offered few answers, saying they won\u2019t negotiate until Democrats end the shutdown. The moment revives a familiar dynamic in a the Republican Party that is united in opposing the Affordable Care Act but still without a clear plan to replace it. The lack of a plan to address to rising costs risks political backlash for Republicans in next year\u2019s midterms. Democrats have said tax credits that kept the costs lower should be extended and refused to reopen the government until they are.</p><p>WORDS: 1264 - MOVED: 10/27/2025 2:53 p.m. EDT</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:e94d96a8a837a5f7f681dc6893872d3b&amp;mediaType=text\">https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:e94d96a8a837a5f7f681dc6893872d3b&amp;mediaType=text</url></p><p>___</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>INTERNATIONAL</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>CB--TROPICAL WEATHER</p><p>Hurricane Melissa bears down on Jamaica and threatens to be the island\u2019s strongest recorded storm</p><p>SUMMARY: Hurricane Melissa has intensified into a Category 5 storm as it draws closer to Jamaica, where forecasters say it will unleash catastrophic flooding, landslides and widespread damage. The intensification happened Monday. At that strength, the system would be the strongest hurricane to hit the island since record-keeping began in 1851.

The United States has proposed creating a force to oversee the ceasefire agreement in the Israel-Hamas war. Israel\u2019s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday that Israel opposes Turkey\u2019s participation because of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s hostility to Israel. The 20-point ceasefire agreement brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump does not mention which countries would provide troops. Countries that are considering taking part also want more clarity on the force\u2019s mandate.

Markets in Argentina rallied, the peso surged and the country\u2019s sovereign bonds jumped on Monday in response. The chronically depreciating Argentine peso \u2014 which international investors and Argentine depositors were dumping in droves just last week to hedge against a Milei defeat \u2014 soared more than 10% to trade at over 1,300 per dollar on Monday.

Facing Trump\u2019s call for a quick ceasefire and bruising, new U.S. sanctions on Russia\u2019s oil industry, Putin again is reminding the U.S. and other Western allies about Moscow\u2019s nuclear arsenals to back his longstanding and maximalist demands.

The private placement will consist of 500,000 Flow-Through Shares at a price of $0.30 per Flow-Through Share representing total raised of $150,000.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. All securities to be issued under the Offering will be subject to a four-month statutory hold period in Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The funds will be utilized for ongoing work on the Fay Lake, Melgurd Lake but mainly for the North Star gold properties.</p><p>Properties</p><p>The Fay Lake Property consists of 17 contiguous claims comprising of 2719 ha. lies 25km Northeast of Flin Flon, Manitoba. It is contiguous to the south with Hudbay Minerals Vamp Lake Cu-Zn-Au VMS property and also contiguous to the northeast, with the former Puffy Lake Gold mine. Fay Lake contains approximately 5 km of mapped VMS horizons similar to Vamp Lake. Separately, west of the rail line, a 9 km shear structure, presently known to contain similar mineralization as the Puffy Lake Gold deposit with samples assaying up to 14.33 g/t Au.</p><p>The Melgurd property consisting of 11 mineral claims totalling 7411 ha., lies Northwest of Flin Fon Manitoba just north of the Shotts Lake copper-zinc VMS deposit in Saskatchewan. Boreal's airborne magnetic and EM survey shows both EM conductors and gradient magnetic trends of the Shott Lake horizon continuing north onto the Melgurd property in the area of a felsic volcanic package. Prospecting and mapping in the summer and fall of 2023 and 2024 have outlined an area of significant garnet and anthophyllite alteration, locally this alteration is associated with gossans.</p><p>The North Star Group property, consisting of 2922 Ha in 21 contiguous claims and two mining leases is located 50 kilometres west of Snow Lake Manitoba. The Property consist of three contiguous properties which are: the North Star Gold Property; the Gold Rock Mining Lease and the Sewell Lake Critical Metals Property which is contiguous and within the same stratigraphy as HudBay Minerals Rail Zone Copper Deposit to the south and the former Dickstone Copper Zinc Mine to the North.</p><p>Based on recent work on the Fay Lake (in Manitoba) and the Melgurd Lake (in Saskatchewan) properties and the recently acquired North Star Property (in Manitoba) (see April 17, 2025 News Release) the plans going forward are as outlined below:</p><p>Planned Exploration and Drill Targets</p><p>In 2024-2025 a rigorous exploration program of geological mapping and prospecting in conjunction with ground geophysics, and detailed Airborne EM analysis for the sole purpose of drill target development was carried out on the Fay Lake property and the Melgurd Lake property. From this work targets have been outlined for drilling. These targets will be tested by drilling subject to the required funds being raised in 2026. Further ground geophysics is planned for the western portion of the Fay Lake Grid, not previously covered, prior to drilling.</p><p>Plans for North Star this fall are to prepare the grid with further geological verification to ready the project for drilling in 2026.</p><p>Use of Proceeds</p><p>Planned Programs</p><p>The bulk of the funds raised will be utilized for two purposes: to prepare the North Star grid for drill targets on the North Star Vein system and for completion of reports, assays, maps and geophysical surveys on the Fay Lake and Melgurd Properties</p><p>North Star</p><p>Line cutting and refurbishing old Grids</p><p>Refurbish and recut the Grid from South of the North Star deposit on Line 46 N to Line 59 N between Baselines 46 E and Tie Line 59 E for both mapping and drilling purposes. This portion of the grid is almost 25 years old and overgrown to obliterated as it was cut a few years (12) after a forest fire.</p><p>Geological Mapping, Prospecting and Sampling</p><p>The Grids from Lines 59+50 N south to L 46 N will require geological remapping and detailed sampling to bring it up to the standard and detail of the northern grids that cover the Gold Rock and Richard Veins, with special emphasis on the section in between the North Star and Gold Rock deposits.</p><p>Drilling (planned for 2026 and involve a follow up financing)</p><p>Selective infill drilling, as well as down plunge drilling on the Gold Rock Vein with a view of completing a resource estimate and NI 43-101 compliant technical report (never undertaken). Ultimately the plan is to drill off enough tonnes that the combined resource of the North Star and Gold Rock Vein Structures, with sufficient grade, will warrant to bring it to a prefeasibility study. Even if successful on the first pass, this objective will require a few additional drill programs.</p><p>Fay Lake</p><p>Proceeds from this financing will be used to perform ground geophysical surveys over the western portion of the Redwin Lake grid and Fay Lake Grid (not previously covered) as well as the north eastern portion of the Sunrise grid to follow the strike extension of the Sunrise conductor to the eastern shore of Fay Lake. Drill testing of designed targets will follow up confirmation of Airborne conductors by ground geophysics on the Fay Lake property subject to a successful financing and direct consultation with Kiciwapa Cree Nation.</p><p>Proceeds will also be used for assays, maps and reports for this past summer's (2025) gold exploration program through mapping and prospecting of the western portion of the Puffy Lake Mine style gold mineralization trend, east of the Railroad to evaluate its on strike continuity. Approximately 10-line kilometers was completed on this trend where previous samples assayed up to 14.33 g/t Au. Proceeds will also be used for assays and evaluation of one of the Koscielny Lake gold prospects, sampled this fall which is located at the eastern end of the property south of the Puffy Lake Gold Mine. Here mineralization contained values of up to 11.81 g/t Au (0.38 oz/ton Au) over one meter (J. Pearson, Sept. 4, 2024, National Instrument 43-101 Fay Lake technical report).</p><p>Melgurd Lake</p><p>On the Melgurd Lake property, proceeds will be utilized for assays and preparation of maps and report from this summer's mapping of the Keep Lake grid.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Stephen L.

Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canada's critical metals sector, with New Age Metals' portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Age's properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat Lake-Winnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newagemetals.com/new-age-metals-completes-summer-2025-exploration-program-on-the-genesis-pgm-cu-ni-project-alaska\">https://newagemetals.com/new-age-metals-completes-summer-2025-exploration-program-on-the-genesis-pgm-cu-ni-project-alaska</url>/ on the 100% owned Alaskan PGM-Cu-Ni Genesis Project.

It shows $92.7 million has been budgeted for \"capital assets\" in 2025-2026, a category that explicitly includes the purchase of aircraft, though none of this is earmarked for new waterbombers.</p><p>The confidential budget presentation lists \"key ministry procurements,\" including dam rehabilitation, a new forest fire base in Kenora and long-term helicopter service contracts for the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch - but no waterbombers.</p><p>There's no mention of money for new waterbombers in the May's provincial budget, either.</p><p>Ford's office declined an interview request and did not respond to questions. After this story went online, his spokesperson emailed to explain the waterbomber order has not been completed.</p><p>\"The province must go undergo a procurement process before the final cost is released,\" wrote Hannah Jensen. \"We are required to negotiate the final costs for procurement and once that process concludes, final costs can be shared, and money can be allocated to purchase the equipment.\"</p><p>Jensen did not answer follow up questions about why the purchase price of $530 million, publicly announced in February, wasn't being used, even in confidential internal planning documents.</p><p>This spring, the province called upon other jurisdictions for assistance, receiving two waterbombers from Quebec. These have helped fill the hole left by three of Ontario's waterbombers, which have been grounded due to a lack of pilots, according to OPSEU, the public sector union that represents fire rangers and pilots.</p><p>\"We've got this commitment where they say, 'We're buying six more water bombers.' OK, but we don't even have enough pilots to fly the ones we have,\" said JP Hornick, president of OPSEU.</p><p>\"Announcements about stuff, about infrastructure projects, about new water bombers - they're really splashy, but they don't address the problem that is the crisis underneath it, which is how are you bringing in the people to do the work to actually fly the bombers?\"</p><p>Last month, the Star published The Coming Firestorm, a three-part series that outlined a severe staffing shortage on the front lines of defence against forest fires. At a time when climate change is creating more and bigger wildfires, Ontario has 100 fewer fire rangers than it did a decade ago.</p><p>This year, more than 375,000 hectares of forest have already burned in Ontario, making this season one of the five worst in the last 30 years - and there are three months left to go.</p><p>The Ministry of Natural Resources declined to answer questions and referred the Star to its previous statements, which did not directly address the waterbomber purchase.</p><p>\"Ontario remains an internationally recognized leader in wildfire fire management,\" states an email from Natural Resources Minister Mike Harris Jr.'s office sent June 23. \"Every fire season, Ontario works with provincial, federal, and international partners to ensure the necessary resources are deployed to keep communities in our province, and across North America, safe. These mutual aid partnership agreements enable the sharing of an additional 320 personnel, equipment, and aircraft between agencies.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, as the Red Lake 12 fire northwest of Thunder Bay continues to grow - and could soon become the biggest forest fire in Ontario's history - the effects of the waterbomber shortage are becoming clear.</p><p>Because the waterbombers operate in pairs, there are only three \"tanker packages\" available for the entire province, said Noah Freedman, a wildland firefighter crew leader, and vice-president of OPSEU Local 703. With 37 fires currently burning and as many as a dozen new blazes breaking out every day, the bombers can only attack a small fraction of the fires.</p><p>\"Successful containment of wildfires starts when they're small. Waterbombers come in when we're getting our pumps set up and they smash the fire down to something more manageable that we can contain quickly,\" Freedman said. \"This season, more often than not, if there's a lot of fires, they'll just go: 'Sorry, we're not sending air attack.'\"</p><p>The waterbomber purchase was announced during the last election campaign in February and remains online under the headline \"Only Doug Ford and the Ontario PCs will protect northern Ontario.\" Ford's re-election campaign promised $530 million for the purchase of six new waterbombers, expanding the province's fleet of \"super scoopers\" from nine to 15.</p><p>That half a billion dollars is not listed in the leaked planning document. A section that outlines \"Key 2025-26 Capital Projects\" lists 13 much smaller expenditures for forest fire fighting, including $10.8 million for an \"Avionics Upgrade to CL-415 Waterbombers,\" $3.2 million for \"Twin Otter Engine Overhauls\" and $8.6 million for the \"Construction (of a) Forward Attack Base in Socket Lake.\"</p><p>Last month, Ford said the order had been placed.</p><p>\"We ordered another six more water bombers ... the problem is right now they're backlogged,\" he said, according to a CBC report. \"They produce them in Alberta, God bless them. But it's taking four years to produce more water bombers.\"</p><p>\"Where's the evidence that they've actually been ordered, purchased or even budgeted for?\" said Lise Vaugeois, the NDP MPP for Thunder Bay-Superior North. \"The North is burning now, three communities have been evacuated, and they're just wasting time.\"</p><p>\"It's a funny way to put it, but we've got to light a fire under this government to get them to move on this,\" she added.</p><p>The new waterbombers aren't even being made yet, said John Gradek, a professor of aviation and supply chain management at McGill University. The manufacturer, De Havilland Canada, is still building a factory outside Calgary, where the first CL-515 waterbombers aren't scheduled to roll off the line until late 2027 or early 2028.</p><p>De Havilland did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Gradek said the factory will be able to make 10 waterbombers a year and there are already 22 planes on order from European countries, which would delay delivery to Ontario until the early to mid 2030s, even if the order were placed today.</p><p>The first CL-515 prototype won't even be ready until this fall or next spring, Gradek said.</p><p>\"There is no price tag yet for these airplanes,\" he added. \"What you're buying is a waterbomber on spec.\"</p><p>Even if a final price has not yet been determined, there should be a deposit noted and some sort of earmark for the balance due.</p><p>\"There should be a statement by the Ontario government and an agreement with De Havilland to keep six slots on the production line for Ontario waterbombers,\" Gradek said. \"There has to be a public statement and public accounting for the capital associated with the purchase of these airplanes.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025070375985753</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G5W-29Y3-S42F-S02X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1256\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

It shows $92.7 million has been budgeted for \"capital assets\" in 2025-2026, a category that explicitly includes the purchase of aircraft, though none of this is earmarked for new waterbombers.</p><p>The confidential budget presentation lists \"key ministry procurements,\" including dam rehabilitation, a new forest fire base in Kenora and long-term helicopter service contracts for the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch - but no waterbombers.</p><p>There's no mention of money for new waterbombers in the May's provincial budget either.</p><p>\"Where's the evidence that they've actually been ordered, purchased or even budgeted for?\" said Lise Vaugeois, the NDP MPP for Thunder Bay-Superior North. \"The North is burning now, three communities have been evacuated, and they're just wasting time.\" </p><p>\"It's a funny way to put it, but we've got to light a fire under this government to get them to move on this,\" she added.</p><p>Ford's office declined an interview request. The Ministry of Natural Resources referred the Star to its previous statements, which did not directly address the waterbomber purchase.</p><p>\"Ontario remains an internationally recognized leader in wildfire fire management,\" states an email from Natural Resources Minister Mike Harris Jr.'s office sent June 23. \"Every fire season, Ontario works with provincial, federal, and international partners to ensure the necessary resources are deployed to keep communities in our province, and across North America, safe. These mutual aid partnership agreements enable the sharing of an additional 320 personnel, equipment, and aircraft between agencies.\"</p><p>This spring, the province has already called upon other jurisdictions for assistance, receiving two waterbombers from Quebec. These have helped fill the hole left by three of Ontario's waterbombers, which have been grounded due to a lack of pilots, according to OPSEU, the public sector union that represents Fire Rangers and pilots. </p><p>\"We've got this commitment where they say, 'We're buying six more water bombers.' OK, but we don't even have enough pilots to fly the ones we have,\" said JP Hornick, president of OPSEU.</p><p>\"Announcements about stuff, about infrastructure projects, about new water bombers - they're really splashy, but they don't address the problem that is the crisis underneath it, which is how are you bringing in the people to do the work to actually fly the bombers?\"</p><p>Last month, the Star published The Coming Firestorm, a three-part series that outlined a severe staffing shortage on the front lines of defence against forest fires. At a time when climate change is creating more and bigger wildfires, Ontario has 100 fewer fire rangers than it did a decade ago.</p><p>This year, more than 375,000 hectares of forest have already burned in Ontario, making this season one of the five worst in the last 30 years - and there are three months of fires left to go.</p><p>Now, as the Red Lake 12 fire northwest of Thunder Bay continues to grow - and could soon become the biggest forest fire in Ontario's history - the effects of the waterbomber shortage are also becoming clear.</p><p>Because the waterbombers operate in pairs, there are only three \"tanker packages\" available for the entire province, said Noah Freedman, a wildland firefighter crew leader, and vice-president of OPSEU Local 703. With 37 fires currently burning and as many as a dozen new ones breaking out every day, the bombers can only attack a small fraction of the fires.</p><p>\"Successful containment of wildfire starts when they're small. Waterbombers come in when we're getting our pumps set up and they smash the fire down to something more manageable that we can contain quickly,\" Freedman said. \"This season, more often than not, if there's a lot of fires, they'll just go: 'Sorry, we're not sending air attack.'\"</p><p>The waterbomber purchase was announced during the last election campaign in February and remains online under the headline \"Only Doug Ford and the Ontario PCs will protect northern Ontario.\" Ford's re-election campaign promised $530 million for the purchase of six new waterbombers, expanding the province's fleet of \"super scoopers\" from nine to 15.</p><p>That half a billion dollars is not listed in the leaked budget document. A section that outlines \"Key 2025-26 Capital Projects\" lists 13 much smaller expenditures for forest fire fighting, including $10.8 million for an \"Avionics Upgrade to CL-415 Waterbombers,\" $3.2 million for \"Twin Otter Engine Overhauls\" and $8.6 million for the \"Construction (of a) Forward Attack Base in Socket Lake.\"</p><p>Last month, Ford said the order had been placed.</p><p>\"We ordered another six more water bombers ... the problem is right now they're backlogged,\" he said, according to a CBC report. \"They produce them in Alberta, God bless them. But it's taking four years to produce more water bombers.\"</p><p>The new waterbombers aren't even being made yet, said John Gradek, a professor of aviation and supply chain management at McGill University. The manufacturer, De Havilland Canada, is still building a factory outside Calgary, where the first CL-515 waterbombers aren't scheduled to roll off the line until late 2027 or early 2028.</p><p>De Havilland did not respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Gradek said the factory will be able to make 10 waterbombers a year and there are already 22 planes on order from European countries, which would delay delivery to Ontario until the early to mid 2030s, even if the order were placed today.</p><p>The first CL-515 prototype won't even be ready until this fall or next spring, Gradek said.</p><p>\"There is no price tag yet for these airplanes,\" he added. \"What you're buying is a waterbomber on spec.\"</p><p>Told that no money had been budgeted for the waterbomber purchase, Gradek said: \"I'm surprised.\"</p><p>Even if a final price has not yet been determined, there should be a deposit noted and some sort of earmark for the balance due. </p><p>\"There should be a statement by the Ontario government and an agreement with De Havilland to keep six slots on the production line for Ontario waterbombers,\" he said. \"There has to be a public statement and public accounting for the capital associated with the purchase of these airplanes.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025070275983670</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G5S-C333-RRSP-50D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1152\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The Company has four divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, Gold Division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, an Antimony-Gold Division as well as an investment in <url normalizedValue=\"https://metalquestmining.com\">https://metalquestmining.com</url>/ a high purity Lac Otelnuk Iron Ore Project.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North America's largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>On October 1st 2025, the Company announced that it has entered into agreement to option the Bonanza Gold Project, located in the Kenora Gold District. The Project consists of 114 mining claims and 1 patented Mining Claim totalling 2,191 hectares or 5,414 acres. The Project has multiple high-grade mineral occurrences with spectacular visible gold at surface along with excellent infrastructure including road access to all areas of the Project along with provincial grid power lines. The Kenora Gold District is known for its high-grade Archean lode-gold deposits, the district has supported mineral exploration and some mining for more than a century. Some of the active majors and mid-tier companies in the District are Agnico Eagle, Kinross, Centerra and New Gold. NAM's technical team is currently working on the exploration plan and budget for the balance of 2025 and for 2026. Further announcements on the Bonanza Gold Project will be forth coming.</p><p>The Company's Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (\"MinRes\"), one of the world's largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canada's critical metals sector, with New Age Metals' portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Age's properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat Lake-Winnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAM's Antimony-Gold division is in Newfoundland and spans over 19,800 hectares consisting of 11 non-contiguous properties. Six of these properties are in St. Alban's area, along Canstar's Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining 5 properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Gold's Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 of the Project, Phase 2 has been initiated, and further news will follow. On July 30th, the Company was pleased to announce that it has received formal approval under Newfoundland and Labrador's Junior Exploration Assistance (JEA) Program, including eligibility for the Critical Minerals Assistance (CMA) and Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (PCMA) streams. The potential rebate total for eligible exploration activities is $71,975.</p><p>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with today's issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.</p><p>MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron ore projects, where approximately $120 million has been spent on the project. For more information, <url normalizedValue=\"https://metalquestmining.com\">https://metalquestmining.com</url>/ . High-purity iron ore became a critical metal Federally in Canada and in the Provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador in 2024. In the summer of 2025, MQM has contracted AtkinsRealis, an international engineering company, to complete a GAP Analysis on the Lac Otelnuk Project and its 2015 Feasibility Study.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities on an international scale. Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of optioning our projects with major and junior mining companies through to production</p><p>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>Investors are invited to visit the New Age Metals website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newagemetals.com\">www.newagemetals.com</url> where they can review the company and its corporate activities.

The Company has four divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, Gold Division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, an Antimony-Gold Division as well as an investment in MetalQuest Minings (TSXV:MQM | OTC:MQMIF) a high purity Lac Otelnuk Iron Ore Project.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North Americas largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>On October 1st 2025, the Company announced that it has entered into agreement to option the Bonanza Gold Project, located in the Kenora Gold District. The Project consists of 114 mining claims and 1 patented Mining Claim totalling 2,191 hectares or 5,414 acres. The Project has multiple high-grade mineral occurrences with spectacular visible gold at surface along with excellent infrastructure including road access to all areas of the Project along with provincial grid power lines. The Kenora Gold District is known for its high-grade Archean lode-gold deposits, the district has supported mineral exploration and some mining for more than a century. Some of the active majors and mid-tier companies in the District are Agnico Eagle, Kinross, Centerra and New Gold. NAMs technical team is currently working on the exploration plan and budget for the balance of 2025 and for 2026. Further announcements on the Bonanza Gold Project will be forth coming.</p><p>The Companys Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (MinRes), one of the worlds largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canadas critical metals sector, with New Age Metals portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Ages properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat LakeWinnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAMs Antimony-Gold division is in Newfoundland and spans over 19,800 hectares consisting of 11 non-contiguous properties. Six of these properties are in St. Albans area, along Canstars Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining 5 properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Golds Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 of the Project, Phase 2 has been initiated, and further news will follow. On July 30th, the Company was pleased to announce that it has received formal approval under Newfoundland and Labradors Junior Exploration Assistance (JEA) Program, including eligibility for the Critical Minerals Assistance (CMA) and Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (PCMA) streams. The potential rebate total for eligible exploration activities is $71,975.</p><p>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with todays issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.</p><p>MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron ore projects, where approximately $120 million has been spent on the project.

Five teams of water bombers and fire rangers have also been dedicated to the area. </p><p>Mayor Doug Elmslie told a press briefing on Thursday that officials were \"cautiously optimistic\" about their efforts, but warned the region was \"one lightning strike away from being right back in the soup again\" due to the dry conditions. </p><p>Elmslie told reporters that \"the suspicion\" is that the Burnt River fire was caused by a lightning strike from a storm last week. Another fire that erupted last Friday in the Head Lake area involves 4.5 hectares of land, but the status of that blaze has been \"under control\" for several days.</p><p>\"With Fire resources fully engaged in these fires, resources are constrained,\" the municipality warned in the news release on Friday afternoon. \"Any fire complaints for open air burning will be treated with zero tolerance.\" </p><p>No evacuation order for the residents in the area has been given. A burn ban is in place across not only Kawartha Lakes, but other municipalities such as Aurora, Newmarket, Vaughan and Markham, following days of heat and little rain in southern Ontario. </p><p>What are stages of fire control? </p><p>The Ministry of Natural Resources uses a series of classifications to assess the risk level of wildfires. These statuses can change frequently, and are correlated to a fire's ability to spread.</p><p>Not under control: A fire deemed \"not under control\" is one that's not responding to suppression techniques. These fires continue to spread along their perimeter despite emergency efforts. Just this Tuesday, both Haliburton 19 and Fire Region One were classified as \"not under control.\" Being held: The next step in tackling a wildfire is getting it to \"being held\" status. This is a fire that is responding well to suppression, so much so that it has stopped spreading or will only spread to a predetermined point. These fires have the possibility of returning to \"not under control\" status. Under control: These fires are ones that have responded well to suppression that they are at no longer at risk of spreading. Haliburton 19, as well as two other fires in the region, Haliburton 16 and 18, are currently \"under control.\"Out: As the name suggests, these are blazes that have been completely extinguished. Being Observed: An additional classification, \"being observed,\" is used for wildfires that are being closely monitored but left alone, as their burning may pose certain ecological benefits. </p><p>For more information on wildfires and the Ministry of Natural Resources Stages of Control for Fires, see their website.</p><p>With files from Asma Sahebzada </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025081576339078</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH7-SFH3-RRP9-H010-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"552\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

It's best to be prepared,\" said Elmslie.</p><p>He continued to urge the public to continue to avoid both fire areas to allow emergency vehicles and personnel to access the area. This includes use of drones which is not only unsafe, but illegal.</p><p>Elmslie also reminds the public that a total burn ban is in effect until further notice and any fire complaints for open-air burning will be treated with zero tolerance. To report a burning complaint, call 705-324-2191.</p><p>Fortunately, noted communications, advertising and marketing manager Cheri Davidson, complaints to fire services have dropped dramatically, indicating people are \"getting the message.\"</p><p>The road closures on County Road 49 between County Road 121 and Bury's Green and Prospect Road from south of 1304 Prospect Rd. to north of 1375 Prospect Rd. remain in effect. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2025081576330626</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH3-8X83-RWY6-F21D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"563\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 15, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001372</classCode><className>PRESS RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N621910CC</classCode><className>AMBULANCE &amp;

(NAM or the Company) is pleased to provide a corporate overview of its Platinum Group Metals (PGM) division, including updates on the flagship River Valley Palladium Project in Ontario and the Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska, and commentary on the PGM market outlook. The PGM division forms a core part of NAMs strategy to develop critical and precious metal projects in North America.</p><p>Highlights of the PGM Division //st * The River Valley Palladium Project is 100% owned by New Age Metals. The Project is currently at the development stage, having completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) in 2023. River Valley is a multi-million ounce Palladium-dominated Mineral Resource. The current Mineral Resource Estimate contains 2.3 Moz of palladium + platinum + gold in the Measured and Indicated classification (plus 1.6 Moz Inferred ) at a $15/tonne NSR cut-off. In addition, copper could be a significant potential byproduct of eventual Palladium and Platinum mining * The Alaskan Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project is also 100% owned by New Age Metals. The Project is road-accessible, has powerline access and is strategically located ~65 km south of Glennallen and ~265 km east of Anchorage. Surface exploration has identified reef-style PGM mineralization (chromite-hosted, with grab samples up to 2.4 g/t Pd and 2.4 g/t Pt) and magmatic Ni-Cu sulfides (samples up to 0.96% Ni and 0.58% Cu) across multiple zones. NAM completed an exploration summer 2025 field program and is in the process of organizing a phase 2 follow up program. * Palladium reached an all-time-high price in 2022 of ~US$3,400 per ounce. We are once again seeing a resurgence in the prices of both Palladium and Platinum as prices of Gold and Silver are trading at all time highs. It is important to note that Palladium and Platinum are also precious metals. Palladium is trading +65% YTD and Platinum is trading +70% YTD.</p><p>1 Company press release titled New Age Metals Delivers New Positive Preliminary Economic Assessment of the River Valley Project, dated June 29, 2023.</p><p>River Valley Palladium Project Overview</p><p>The River Valley Palladium Project is NAMs flagship asset, located approximately 100 km east-northeast of the City of Sudbury, Ontario. The deposit is a large, near-surface disseminated PGM-copper sulphide system hosted in the Paleoproterozoic-age River Valley Intrusion. It currently ranks as one of Canadas largest undeveloped primary PGM deposits, with an NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource of approximately 2.3 million ounces of combined palladium, platinum and gold in the Measured and Indicated classifications, plus 1.6 million ounces in the Inferred classification.</p><p>Figure 1: River Valley Project</p><p>Harry Barr, NAMs Chairman &amp;CEO, noted that As opposed to the 2019 PEA, which design was based on a series of open pit along the strike length of the River Valley Project and it was geared towards a large, bulk tonnage open pit scenario, the 2023 PEA outlines a smaller, higher-grade operation with lower CAPEX, expanded underground mining, and a much smaller environmental footprint. Except for a hydrometallurgical PGM recovery test study, River Valley has been inactive since 2024, when Palladium prices fell below US$1,000/oz Pd. With the resurgence in PGM prices in 2025, NAM is making plans to relaunch the River Valley Project.</p><p>Beyond the PEA, NAM continues to de-risk and add value to River Valley. Comprehensive environmental baseline studies, re-initiated in 2020 after a long hiatus, were ongoing through 2024 to build a stronger foundation for future permitting. These studies cover surface water and groundwater monitoring, hydrology, flora/fauna surveys, and more, and have actively involved local Indigenous communities in the field data collection process. This proactive approach to environmental and community engagement at this early stage is expected to position River Valley favorably for advanced development milestones. The Company has a current Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), with which we strive to build and maintain a strong working relationship with the Nipissing First Nation and the Temagami First Nation, who have traditional claims to the land.</p><p>In late-2023, NAM commissioned Platsol testwork with SGS Canada Ltd. to evaluate recovery of PGMs via hydrometallurgy (which could potentially produce refined metals on-site), aiming to boost platinum and rhodium recoveries and improve project economics. The positive results from these studies will be a guide to the next phase of project engineering2.</p><p>NAM is also planning a series of additional drilling programs to convert Inferred to Indicated Mineral Resources and exploring down-dip/down-plunge extensions of the known mineralized zones, with the goal of expanding the Mineral Resource base and increasing the proportion of higher-grade material in future mine plans.</p><p>The Project has several high priority drill targets, particularly at depth. With a significant exploration budget, the Company has the possibility of expanding its Mineral Resources on the River Valley Project. Together, these initiatives are advancing River Valley toward the Pre-Feasibility Study and Feasibility Study stages and, ultimately, a production decision.</p><p>Additionally, the Company has submitted to the Ontario Ministry of Energy and Mines and our First Nation Partners, new three-year exploration permit applications. The permits are expected to be in place by year end and will allow the Company to carry out work on the River Valley Project, which is to the north (as defined in the 2023 PEA), and the Mustang Zone, along strike to the south, for the first time since the previous operators drilled approximately 67 holes (~16,440 metres) in the early 2000s. The collective length of the known River Valley mineralized zones (10) is approximately 16 km (10 miles).</p><p>2 Company press release titled NAM Reports High PGM Recoveries from Proof-of-Concept Platsol Testwork on River Valley, dated February 29, 2024.</p><p>Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project Overview</p><p>The Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project is an earlier-stage exploration project located in the Valdez Creek mining district of southern Alaska, approximately 265 km east of Anchorage. NAM owns 100% of Genesis, which encompasses 4,144 hectares (10,240 acres) of State of Alaska mining claims in a geologically prospective mafic/ultramafic complex. A key advantage of Genesis is its exceptional access and infrastructure for a remote Alaskan project. The claim block lies within 3 km of the all-season Richardson Highway and a high-capacity electric transmission line, with historical access trails reaching into the property from a nearby lodge on the highway. This proximity to infrastructure substantially lowers the logistical barriers for exploration and future development compared to typical greenfield projects in Alaska. Recently, the Trump Administration has made several key investments in both Canadian and US companies that are developing rare earth and critical metal projects in America. The week of October 13th, the Canadian Federal Government announced plans to similarly fund Canadian critical metal projects as well as JP Morgan Chase announced a plan to invest up to $10 billion in U.S. companies critical to national security and economic resilience as part of a broader $1.5 trillion pledge.</p><p>Figure 2: Map showing a portion of the ATV trail (red line), walking trail (green line) and the preliminary sample points (yellow dots) from the fieldwork portion of the project.</p><p>Surface exploration to date has identified two compelling styles of magmatic mineralization at Genesis. The first is a reef-style PGM mineralization hosted by chromitite layers, analogous to the Platreef or Bushveld-type occurrences selective rock sampling has returned grades of up to 2.4 g/t Palladium and 2.4 g/t Platinum in these chromite-hosted PGM reefs. The second style is disseminated to massive nickel-copper sulfide mineralization, with surface samples assaying up to 0.96% Ni and 0.58% Cu, along with associated PGMs. Notably, these mineralized zones occur at surface and have been traced in outcrop for roughly 2,000 metres of strike length with approximately 40 m true thickness in one target area (Sheep Hill). Both the PGM-bearing reefs and the Ni-Cu sulfide zones remain open in all directions (west, east, north, and at depth), indicating significant room to expand known mineralization with further exploration drilling.</p><p>The broader exploration potential at Genesis is underscored by the scale of the geochemical and geophysical anomalies on the property. PGM and base metal anomalies have been identified along a 9 km trend across the prospect, and multiple target areas remain untested by any drilling. In the summer of 2025, NAM completed a field program focused on detailed geological mapping and sampling at Sheep Hill, collecting 134 new rock samples (163 including QA/QC blanks/standards) which have been sent for assay, with results pending. This work further refined the target zones and improved trail access ahead of an eventual maiden drill program. Genesis represents a promising discovery-stage PGM project in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, and NAMs strategy is to leverage partnerships to unlock its value. The Company is actively seeking an earn-in or joint venture partner to advance Genesis, given the projects large scale and the significant exploration capital required to fully assess its potential. A partnership would allow NAM to remain focused on its flagship River Valley Project while still benefiting from major exploration successes at Genesis through retained ownership.</p><p>About Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) and Market Outlook</p><p>Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) primarily palladium, platinum, and rhodium are critical metals for modern industry and clean technology. Their unique properties include catalytic activity, high melting points, and resistance to corrosion, which enable a wide range of applications. The automotive sector is the largest consumer of PGMs: over 80% of annual palladium and rhodium output is used in catalytic converters to reduce vehicle emissions, helping cars meet stringent air quality standards. Platinum is also used in catalytic converters (especially for diesel engines) and is increasingly important in next-generation hydrogen fuel cells for vehicles and energy storage, where it serves as a critical catalyst. In addition, hybrid cars may use as much as three times the PGM loading compared to traditional cars. Beyond automobiles, PGMs are used in jewelry (platinum and palladium provide durable, tarnish-resistant settings), electronics (small amounts of PGMs in circuit boards, hard disks, and sensors improve performance), medical devices and pharmaceuticals (e.g. platinum in pacemakers and anti-cancer drugs), as well as chemical and petroleum refining (platinum/palladium catalysts for production of chemicals and fuel). This diversity of uses underpins a robust baseline demand for PGMs across economic cycles.</p><p>More recently, analyst started discussing the increased use of platinum and palladium as a store of value, like gold, due to the fact it has a higher density and is easier to transport compared to silver.</p><p>The market outlook for PGMs remains positive, driven by constrained supply and evolving demand in both traditional and emerging applications. Global PGM supply is highly concentrated geographically, which poses supply risks. South Africa alone produces about 70 to 80% of the worlds platinum (and most of the rhodium, iridium, and ruthenium), whereas Russia is the top palladium supplier (around 40% of global output). In recent years, PGM markets have been in deficit as demand outstripped supply. Notably, the platinum market entered a structural deficit in 20212022 and is forecast to remain in deficit through 2025, according to Johnson Mattheys latest analysis. Palladium had over a decade of consecutive deficits (20122024), which drove prices to the record highs., In 2025, palladium is expected to move closer to balance as automotive demand eases slightly and recycling increases.</p><p>Figure 3: 5-year price chart for the price of palladium per ounce in US Dollars. Palladium is up 68.4%.</p><p>Tighter emissions regulations in Europe, China, and other regions are maintaining high loadings of PGMs in exhaust after-treatment systems. Looking ahead, emerging growth areas such as the coming hydrogen economy are expected to bolster PGM demand platinum-based catalysts are essential for proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and for electrolysers that produce hydrogen fuel. Coupled with limited new mine supply and the concentration of existing supply in a few jurisdictions, the fundamentals for PGMs can be said to be a favorable market outlook in the medium and long term. In Canada and the US, PGMs are classified as Critical Minerals due to their irreplaceable role in reducing emissions and enabling technologies like fuel cells and the dominance of supply from high-risk international sources.</p><p>Unprecedented Government Support for Critical Metals</p><p>Recently Analysts have stated that this level of investment in mining projects from both countries was only available during short periods in World War I and II. Finally, the mining industrys corporates Management teams have additional methods of mine finance and believe their industry is entering into unprecedented territory for critical metals exploration and mine developments.</p><p>About NAM</p><p>New Age Metals is a junior mineral exploration and development company focused on the discovery, exploration, and development of critical green and precious metal projects in North America. The Company has four divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, Gold Division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, an Antimony-Gold Division as well as an investment in MetalQuest Minings (TSXV:MQM | OTC:MQMIF) a high purity Lac Otelnuk Iron Ore Project.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North Americas largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska. The PGM Division is both an industrial and critical metal division.</p><p>On October 1st 2025, the Company announced that it has entered into agreement to option the Bonanza Gold Project, located in the Kenora Gold District. The Project consists of 114 mining claims and 1 patented Mining Claim totalling 2,191 hectares or 5,414 acres. The Project has multiple high-grade mineral occurrences with spectacular visible gold at surface along with excellent infrastructure including road access to all areas of the Project along with provincial grid power lines. The Kenora Gold District is known for its high-grade Archean lode-gold deposits and has supported mineral exploration and some mining- for more than a century. Some of the active majors and mid-tier companies in the District are Agnico Eagle, Kinross, Centerra and New Gold. NAMs technical team is currently working on the exploration plan and budget for the balance of 2025 and for 2026. Further announcements on the Bonanza Gold Project will be forth coming.</p><p>The Companys Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (MinRes), one of the worlds largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canadas critical metals sector, with New Age Metals portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Ages properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat LakeWinnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAMs Gold-Antimony division is in Newfoundland and spans roughly 20,000 hectares. The majority of these properties are in St. Albans area, along Canstars Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Golds Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 Exploration of the Project, Phase 2 has been initiated, and further news will follow. On July 30th, the Company was pleased to announce that it has received formal approval under Newfoundland and Labradors Junior Exploration Assistance (JEA) Program, including eligibility for the Critical Minerals Assistance (CMA) and Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (PCMA) streams. The potential rebate total for eligible exploration activities is $71,975.</p><p>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with todays issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron ore3 projects at Lac Otelnuk (Qubec), where approximately $120 million has been spent on the project. For more information, please visit MetalQuestMining.com. High-purity iron oxide became a critical metal Federally in Canada and in the Provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador in 2024. In the summer of 2025, MQM contracted AtkinsRealis, an international engineering company, to complete a GAP Analysis on the Lac Otelnuk Project and its 2015 Feasibility Study.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities on an international scale. Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of expending sufficient explorations and development expenditure to eventually option our projects with Major and Junior mining companies through to exploration and development phases on to production.</p><p>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>Investors are invited to visit the New Age Metals website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newagemetals.com\">www.newagemetals.com</url> where they can review the company and its corporate activities.

(TSX.V: NAM; OTCQB: NMTLF; FSE: P7J.F) (\"NAM\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide a corporate overview of its Platinum Group Metals (\"PGM\") division, including updates on the flagship River Valley Palladium Project in Ontario and the Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska, and commentary on the PGM market outlook. The PGM division forms a core part of NAM's strategy to develop critical and precious metal projects in North America.</p><p>Highlights of the PGM Division</p><p>The River Valley Palladium Project is 100% owned by New Age Metals. The Project is currently at the development stage, having completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\") in 2023. River Valley is a multi-million ounce Palladium-dominated Mineral Resource. The current Mineral Resource Estimate contains 2.3 Moz of palladium + platinum + gold in the Measured and Indicated classification (plus 1.6 Moz Inferred) at a $15/tonne NSR cut-off. In addition, copper could be a significant potential byproduct of eventual Palladium and Platinum mining</p><p>The Alaskan Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project is also 100% owned by New Age Metals. The Project is road-accessible, has powerline access and is strategically located ~65 km south of Glennallen and ~265 km east of Anchorage. Surface exploration has identified reef-style PGM mineralization (chromite-hosted, with grab samples up to 2.4 g/t Pd and 2.4 g/t Pt) and magmatic Ni-Cu sulfides (samples up to 0.96% Ni and 0.58% Cu) across multiple zones. NAM completed an exploration summer 2025 field program and is in the process of organizing a phase 2 follow up program.</p><p>Palladium reached an all-time-high price in 2022 of ~US$3,400 per ounce. We are once again seeing a resurgence in the prices of both Palladium and Platinum as prices of Gold and Silver are trading at all time highs. It is important to note that Palladium and Platinum are also precious metals. Palladium is trading +65% YTD and Platinum is trading +70% YTD.</p><p>1 Company press release titled \"New Age Metals Delivers New Positive Preliminary Economic Assessment of the River Valley Project\", dated June 29, 2023.</p><p>River Valley Palladium Project Overview</p><p>The River Valley Palladium Project is NAM's flagship asset, located approximately 100 km east-northeast of the City of Sudbury, Ontario. The deposit is a large, near-surface disseminated PGM-copper sulphide system hosted in the Paleoproterozoic-age River Valley Intrusion.It currently ranks as one of Canada's largest undeveloped primary PGM deposits, with anNI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource of approximately 2.3 million ounces of combined palladium, platinum and gold in the Measured and Indicated classifications, plus 1.6 million ounces in the Inferred classification.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/be8904a766d00ec6e26160a1339a02fc.pngClick\">https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/be8904a766d00ec6e26160a1339a02fc.pngClick</url> Image To View Full Size</p><p>Figure 1: River Valley Project</p><p>Harry Barr, NAM's Chairman &amp; CEO, noted that \"As opposed to the 2019 PEA, which design was based on a series of open pit along the strike length of the River Valley Project and it was geared towards a large, bulk tonnage open pit scenario, the 2023 PEA outlines a smaller, higher-grade operation with lower CAPEX, expanded underground mining, and a much smaller environmental footprint. Except for a hydrometallurgical PGM recovery test study, River Valley has been inactive since 2024, when Palladium prices fell below US$1,000/oz Pd. With the resurgence in PGM prices in 2025, NAM is making plans to relaunch the River Valley Project.\"</p><p>Beyond the PEA, NAM continues to de-risk and add value to River Valley. Comprehensive environmental baseline studies, re-initiated in 2020 after a long hiatus, were ongoing through 2024 to build a stronger foundation for future permitting. These studies cover surface water and groundwater monitoring, hydrology, flora/fauna surveys, and more, and have actively involved local Indigenous communities in the field data collection process. This proactive approach to environmental and community engagement at this early stage is expected to position River Valley favorably for advanced development milestones. The Company has a current Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\"), with which we strive to build and maintain a strong working relationship with the Nipissing First Nation and the Temagami First Nation, who have traditional claims to the land.</p><p>In late-2023, NAM commissioned Platsol(TM) testwork with SGS Canada Ltd. to evaluate recovery of PGMs via hydrometallurgy (which could potentially produce refined metals on-site), aiming to boost platinum and rhodium recoveries and improve project economics. The positive results from these studies will be a guide to the next phase of project engineering2.</p><p>NAM is also planning a series of additional drilling programs to convert Inferred to Indicated Mineral Resources and exploring down-dip/down-plunge extensions of the known mineralized zones, with the goal of expanding the Mineral Resource base and increasing the proportion of higher-grade material in future mine plans.</p><p>The Project has several high priority drill targets, particularly at depth. With a significant exploration budget, the Company has the possibility of expanding its Mineral Resources on the River Valley Project. Together, these initiatives are advancing River Valley toward the Pre-Feasibility Study and Feasibility Study stages and, ultimately, a production decision.</p><p>Additionally, the Company has submitted to the Ontario Ministry of Energy and Mines and our First Nation Partners, new three-year exploration permit applications. The permits are expected to be in place by year end and will allow the Company to carry out work on the River Valley Project, which is to the north (as defined in the 2023 PEA), and the Mustang Zone, along strike to the south, for the first time since the previous operators drilled approximately 67 holes (~16,440 metres) in the early 2000s. The collective length of the known River Valley mineralized zones (10) is approximately 16 km (10 miles).</p><p>2 Company press release titled \"NAM Reports High PGM Recoveries from Proof-of-Concept Platsol Testwork on River Valley\", dated February 29, 2024.</p><p>Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project Overview</p><p>The Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project is an earlier-stage exploration project located in the Valdez Creek mining district of southern Alaska, approximately 265 km east of Anchorage. NAM owns 100% of Genesis, which encompasses 4,144 hectares (10,240 acres) of State of Alaska mining claims in a geologically prospective mafic/ultramafic complex. A key advantage of Genesis is its exceptional access and infrastructure for a remote Alaskan project. The claim block lies within 3 km of the all-season Richardson Highway and a high-capacity electric transmission line, with historical access trails reaching into the property from a nearby lodge on the highway. This proximity to infrastructure substantially lowers the logistical barriers for exploration and future development compared to typical greenfield projects in Alaska. Recently, the Trump Administration has made several key investments in both Canadian and US companies that are developing rare earth and critical metal projects in America. The week of October 13th, the Canadian Federal Government announced plans to similarly fund Canadian critical metal projects as well as JP Morgan Chase announced a plan to invest up to $10 billion in U.S. companies critical to national security and economic resilience as part of a broader $1.5 trillion pledge.</p><p>Figure 2: Map showing a portion of the ATV trail (red line), walking trail (green line) and the preliminary sample points (yellow dots) from the fieldwork portion of the project.</p><p>Surface exploration to date has identified two compelling styles of magmatic mineralization at Genesis. The first is a reef-style PGM mineralization hosted by chromitite layers, analogous to the Platreef or Bushveld-type occurrences - selective rock sampling has returned grades of up to 2.4 g/t Palladium and 2.4 g/t Platinum in these chromite-hosted PGM reefs. The second style is disseminated to massive nickel-copper sulfide mineralization, with surface samples assaying up to 0.96% Ni and 0.58% Cu, along with associated PGMs. Notably, these mineralized zones occur at surface and have been traced in outcrop for roughly 2,000 metres of strike length with approximately 40 m true thickness in one target area (Sheep Hill). Both the PGM-bearing reefs and the Ni-Cu sulfide zones remain open in all directions (west, east, north, and at depth), indicating significant room to expand known mineralization with further exploration drilling.</p><p>The broader exploration potential at Genesis is underscored by the scale of the geochemical and geophysical anomalies on the property. PGM and base metal anomalies have been identified along a 9 km trend across the prospect, and multiple target areas remain untested by any drilling. In the summer of 2025, NAM completed a field program focused on detailed geological mapping and sampling at Sheep Hill, collecting 134 new rock samples (163 including QA/QC blanks/standards) which have been sent for assay, with results pending. This work further refined the target zones and improved trail access ahead of an eventual maiden drill program. Genesis represents a promising discovery-stage PGM project in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, and NAM's strategy is to leverage partnerships to unlock its value. The Company is actively seeking an earn-in or joint venture partner to advance Genesis, given the project's large scale and the significant exploration capital required to fully assess its potential. A partnership would allow NAM to remain focused on its flagship River Valley Project while still benefiting from major exploration successes at Genesis through retained ownership.</p><p>About Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) and Market Outlook</p><p>Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) - primarily palladium, platinum, and rhodium - are critical metals for modern industry and clean technology. Their unique properties include catalytic activity, high melting points, and resistance to corrosion, which enable a wide range of applications. The automotive sector is the largest consumer of PGMs: over 80% of annual palladium and rhodium output is used in catalytic converters to reduce vehicle emissions, helping cars meet stringent air quality standards. Platinum is also used in catalytic converters (especially for diesel engines) and is increasingly important in next-generation hydrogen fuel cells for vehicles and energy storage, where it serves as a critical catalyst. In addition, hybrid cars may use as much as three times the PGM loading compared to traditional cars. Beyond automobiles, PGMs are used in jewelry (platinum and palladium provide durable, tarnish-resistant settings), electronics (small amounts of PGMs in circuit boards, hard disks, and sensors improve performance), medical devices and pharmaceuticals (e.g. platinum in pacemakers and anti-cancer drugs), as well as chemical and petroleum refining (platinum/palladium catalysts for production of chemicals and fuel). This diversity of uses underpins a robust baseline demand for PGMs across economic cycles.</p><p>More recently, analyst started discussing the increased use of platinum and palladium as a store of value, like gold, due to the fact it has a higher density and is easier to transport compared to silver.</p><p>The market outlook for PGMs remains positive, driven by constrained supply and evolving demand in both traditional and emerging applications. Global PGM supply is highly concentrated geographically, which poses supply risks. South Africa alone produces about 70 to 80% of the world's platinum (and most of the rhodium, iridium, and ruthenium), whereas Russia is the top palladium supplier (around 40% of global output). In recent years, PGM markets have been in deficit as demand outstripped supply. Notably, the platinum market entered a structural deficit in 2021-2022 and is forecast to remain in deficit through 2025, according to Johnson Matthey's latest analysis. Palladium had over a decade of consecutive deficits (2012-2024), which drove prices to the record highs., In 2025, palladium is expected to move closer to balance as automotive demand eases slightly and recycling increases.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/5360705fed88305c7425617e60028b9d.pngClick\">https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/5360705fed88305c7425617e60028b9d.pngClick</url> Image To View Full Size</p><p>Figure 3: 5-year price chart for the price of palladium per ounce in US Dollars.Palladium is up 68.4%.</p><p>Tighter emissions regulations in Europe, China, and other regions are maintaining high loadings of PGMs in exhaust after-treatment systems. Looking ahead, emerging growth areas such as the coming hydrogen economy are expected to bolster PGM demand - platinum-based catalysts are essential for proton-exchange membrane (\"PEM\") fuel cells and for electrolysers that produce hydrogen fuel. Coupled with limited new mine supply and the concentration of existing supply in a few jurisdictions, the fundamentals for PGMs can be said to be a favorable market outlook in the medium and long term. In Canada and the US, PGMs are classified as Critical Minerals due to their irreplaceable role in reducing emissions and enabling technologies like fuel cells and the dominance of supply from high-risk international sources.</p><p>Unprecedented Government Support for Critical Metals</p><p>Recently Analysts have stated that this level of investment in mining projects from both countries was only available during short periods in World War I and II. Finally, the mining industry's corporates Management teams have additional methods of mine finance and believe their industry is entering into unprecedented territory for critical metals exploration and mine developments.</p><p>About NAM</p><p>New Age Metals is a junior mineral exploration and development company focused on the discovery, exploration, and development of critical green and precious metal projects in North America. The Company has four divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, Gold Division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, an Antimony-Gold Division as well as an investment in <url normalizedValue=\"https://metalquestmining.com\">https://metalquestmining.com</url>/ a high purity Lac Otelnuk Iron \"Ore\" Project.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North America's largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska. The PGM Division is both an industrial and critical metal division.</p><p>On October 1st 2025, the Company announced that it has entered into agreement to option the Bonanza Gold Project, located in the Kenora Gold District. The Project consists of 114 mining claims and 1 patented Mining Claim totalling 2,191 hectares or 5,414 acres. The Project has multiple high-grade mineral occurrences with spectacular visible gold at surface along with excellent infrastructure including road access to all areas of the Project along with provincial grid power lines. The Kenora Gold District is known for its high-grade Archean lode-gold deposits and has supported mineral exploration and some mining- for more than a century. Some of the active majors and mid-tier companies in the District are Agnico Eagle, Kinross, Centerra and New Gold. NAM's technical team is currently working on the exploration plan and budget for the balance of 2025 and for 2026. Further announcements on the Bonanza Gold Project will be forth coming.</p><p>The Company's Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (\"MinRes\"), one of the world's largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canada's critical metals sector, with New Age Metals' portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Age's properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat Lake-Winnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAM's Gold-Antimony division is in Newfoundland and spans roughly 20,000 hectares. The majority of these properties are in St. Alban's area, along Canstar's Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Gold's Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 Exploration of the Project, Phase 2 has been initiated, and further news will follow. On July 30th, the Company was pleased to announce that it has received formal approval under Newfoundland and Labrador's Junior Exploration Assistance (\"JEA\") Program, including eligibility for the Critical Minerals Assistance (\"CMA\") and Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (\"PCMA\") streams. The potential rebate total for eligible exploration activities is $71,975.</p><p>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with today's issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.</p><p>MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron \"ore\"3 projects at Lac Otelnuk (Quebec), where approximately $120 million has been spent on the project. For more information, <url normalizedValue=\"https://metalquestmining.com/\">https://metalquestmining.com/</url>. High-purity iron oxide became a critical metal Federally in Canada and in the Provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador in 2024. In the summer of 2025, MQM contracted AtkinsRealis, an international engineering company, to complete a GAP Analysis on the Lac Otelnuk Project and its 2015 Feasibility Study.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities on an international scale. Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of expending sufficient explorations and development expenditure to eventually option our projects with Major and Junior mining companies through to exploration and development phases on to production.</p><p>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>Investors are invited to visit the New Age Metals website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newagemetals.com\">www.newagemetals.com</url> where they can review the company and its corporate activities.

They've battled fires on islands, caused by campfire embers. They've battled them in roadside ditches, sparked by a discarded cigarette.</p><p>On Sunday, they fought three fires in one day.</p><p>\"We had a fire caused from farm equipment,\" he said. \"It started a field on fire, spread into forested areas and we ended up with a 20-acre fire.\"</p><p>It's little surprise that his municipality north of Kingston\u00a0is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.southfrontenac.net/living-in-south-frontenac/fire-and-emergency-services/fire-ban-status/\">under a fire ban</url>. It enacted one on Aug. 1, banning fireworks, campfires and cooking fires. Only cooking appliances with a mechanical shut-off are permitted, such as propane stoves.</p><p>As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-gatineau-heat-wave-warning-august-1.7606573\">hot, dry conditions blanket much of eastern Ontario</url>, other communities are following suit. <url normalizedValue=\"https://ottawa.ca/en/health-and-public-safety/ottawa-fire-services/open-air-fire-permit\">Ottawa imposed a fire ban on Aug. 6</url> and the National Capital Commission did so <url normalizedValue=\"https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/closures/open-fire-ban-for-gatineau-park-and-leamy-lake-park?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">for Gatineau and Lac Leamy parks on Monday</url>.</p><p>Ottawa Fire Services sector chief Marc Lalonde, who manages the east rural sector,\u00a0said the only fires that have broken out within city limits recently have been relatively minor - but the risk is significant.</p><p>\"Right now we have a complete fire ban, so no open air fires whatsoever. No campfires, no cooking fires that are not in a self-contained elevated device, such as a barbecue,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"Barbecues are legal, but other than that it is a full fire ban.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/carletonplacefire/photos/effective-august-8-2025-and-until-further-notice-carleton-place-fire-department-/1059739899664834/?_rdr\">Carleton Place</url> is also under a fire ban.

But with that, it could bring lightning, and that's another hazard for us in these dry conditions without enough moisture in the air.\"</p><p>The Mississippi Mills fire ban prohibits open air burning of all kinds, including campfires and fireworks.</p><p>\"Everyone has to be aware of their cooking, their campfires, discarding of cigarettes along the highways or anywhere else, and walking the trails,\" he said. \"Just be conscious.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadaottawaeasternontariodrydroughtweatherfireban17606374</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGF-G993-RRR1-H1C5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"467\"/><timeReceived>12:44 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

The fire, which was reported late Tuesday afternoon, did not exceed one hectare in size, and did not require an attack from waterbombers, an AFFES regional spokesman said. Silver Falls, which offers campsites but is not staffed, is located on the south end of Dog Lake about a 40-minute drive from Kakabeka Falls. It wasn\u2019t immediately known what caused the fire. The largest wildfire burning in Northwestern Ontario remains Kenora No. 20, which late Tuesday was pegged at 320 square kilometres and was classified as not under control. The fire is located about 40 kilometres west of Kenora. \u201cThe wildland fire hazard remains high to extreme across the Northwest region,\u201d the AFFES bulletin said.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-aad18cfe76c74cf5916ee6ffbfdd2eff</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FXN-DRG3-RRSW-034S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"214\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 29, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DN6R</classCode><className>PUBLIC OFFICIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N712190QM</classCode><className>STATE PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009ESU</classCode><className>UNMANNED AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000A7R6</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT PILOTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N481100CC</classCode><className>AIRLINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N712190QM</classCode><className>STATE PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We're not expecting evacuations at this point,\" said Kawartha Lakes Mayor Doug Elmslie during the briefing.</p><p>The Burnt River fire is in a very remote area with primarily hunting camps and seasonal residents and only a handful of permanent homes. The Kirkfield area fire is \"more of a concern\" said Elmslie, particularly where it relates to  livestock.</p><p>Households are encouraged to have an emergency kit easily accessible should evacuation becomes necessary.</p><p>Elmslie once again urged the public to respect firefighting efforts and refrain from attending the fire areas and using drones to capture footage.</p><p>Elmslie extended deep appreciation to those battling the blazes via 22 attack lines. Close to half of the personnel involved are from the MNR with five ground crews assigned specifically to the Burnt River fire.</p><p>Fighting fires at any time can be hazardous but hot, humid weather can increase risks. Lizotte said the safety of fire crews is \"a top priority.\" Personnel are making \"excellent progress\" by taking frequent breaks and increased hydration.</p><p>A road closure remains in effect on County Road 49 between County Road 121 and Bury's Green until further notice. Prospect Road is also closed from south of 1304 Prospect Rd. to north of 1375 Prospect Rd. while crews continue to fight OFR001.</p><p>Kawartha Lakes remains under a total burn ban. There will be \"zero tolerance\" for any kind of open air burning. Residents that witness smoke are asked to report it immediately to Kawartha Lakes Fire and Rescue Service at 705-324-2191.</p><p>With ever-increasing weather-related emergencies, it is important for all households to have an emergency plan and a 72-hour emergency kit available, the ministry advises.

The invitation gives a six point explanation of what an OCP is. My intention here is to focus on the last two words of the sixth point: climate change. I am not focusing on how to prevent or minimize climate change; too many of the world's \"Drill Baby Drill\" politicians have made such a mockery of the 1.5\u00b0 global warming ceiling that a 2\u00b0 or even a 2.5\u00b0 limit may now be exceeded. With greater frequency of weather extremes all but inevitable, what could we, as a community, do in anticipation of the resulting emergencies?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We may get helpful information about what to expect from a visit to Heritage Park Museum's \"Heat and Hope: Global Climate Change, Local Consequences\" exhibit, but we cannot look back and learn from the ways we dealt with nature's tantrums the last time we experienced climate change. Climate change has no history; that is a problem. How can we plan for the unknown?</p><p>What if our region were to experience a fire season worse than what the Prairie provinces are experiencing this year? Should our OCP contain a policy calling on the city to meet with local hotels to determine our emergency shelter capacity for regional fire refugees? The city could write a plan for emergency shelter space allocation as an alternative to having fire refugees from this region flown to distant cities. Along these lines, how about a policy calling on the city to meet with local farmers to explore our capacity to provide shelter for farm animals caught in a forest fire evacuation zone?</p><p>What if the Highway 16 transportation corridor were blocked for an extended period by an unspecified natural catastrophe? Should an OCP policy call on the city to meet with local supermarkets to develop an emergency ration distribution plan, a scheme to ensure that everyone in town has assured access to basic needs until our transportation infrastructure is restored? What if our electricity supply were to be interrupted for an extended period? Should our OCP include a policy calling on the city to identify and secure minimal electricity supply capacity to serve the community in an emergency? What if \u2026?</p><p>The city is looking at a 20-year horizon for its climate adaptation strategies. Should we worry that, looking back from the year 2050, some OCP climate change adaption strategies adopted in 2025 should now be dismissed for being silly? Would that matter? On the other hand, if a 2025 OCP climate change adaption strategy should be proven to have been a factor in just one life having been saved, that would be cause for celebration.</p><p>We can learn a valuable lesson from the recent Kerr County, Texas, catastrophe. The US weather service had issued rain storm warnings for the region, but these warnings never reached Kerr County's residents. The Guadalupe River torrent killed over 100 people. It can be argued, however, that the cause of these tragic deaths was not a torrential flood; the cause was the absence of an effective warning system to alert Kerr County residents in time to allow them to flee to higher ground before the Guadalupe River's floodwaters reached their community.</p><p>The OCP review's philosophical objective should be a resolve to protect Terrace from ever becoming Canada's own Kerr County with its deadly \"flash flood alley\".</p><p>Andr\u00e9 Carrel is a retired public sector administrator living in Terrace, B.C.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Terrace Standard</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TERSTN-news20250819PTA4753872</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TERSTN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJ0-YTH3-RRW0-G16Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438220</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"577\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

In the Okanagan Valley, more than 200 Peachland homes are at risk. In Lytton, two First Nation reserves have issued evacuation orders, in the same region devastated by wildfire four years ago. And in Harrison Hot Springs in the Fraser Valley, campers are being urged to stay away. As Lyndsay Duncombe shows us, it is a situation that's reigniting fear for many who have lived through this before.</p><p><br/><br/>LYNDSAY DUNCOMBE (REPORTER):<br/>It's hot, it's dry, and anxiety is smouldering in much of British Columbia. Crews are fighting new fires, almost two dozen of them. Most sparked by lightning.<br/><br/>PAUL WEIBE (WITNESS):<br/>Helicopters showed up, and then like bombers. And you could see trees exploding. It was, it was like, I've never been in an actual forest fire like that. It was, it was super intense.<br/><br/>LYNDSAY DUNCOMBE (REPORTER):<br/>What Paul Weibe saw from the beach was an all-out effort to save homes in Peachland. Two main highways briefly closed, people from 400 properties forced to flee. Many are now allowed back, but it's stressful.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER:<br/>I have nothing. I have absolutely nothing. Like, no clothes, no toothbrush, no nothing.<br/><br/>LYNDSAY DUNCOMBE (REPORTER):<br/>Scenes like this are especially troubling for people living near Lytton, the village was destroyed by fire four years ago, now newly rebuilt homes are socked in by smoke, and it's scary.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER 1:<br/>And it's the colour of that smoke. It's that angry kind of orangey colour.<br/><br/>LYNDSAY DUNCOMBE (REPORTER):<br/>The fire is 10 kilometres away from the village, so not an immediate threat. There's more concern for two sparsely populated First Nation reserves nearby. Evacuation orders are in effect there.<br/><br/>CHIEF NIAKIA HANNA (CHIEF OF LYTTON FIRST NATION):<br/>We watch it more on an hour-to-hour basis, sometimes minute-to-minute. Changes depend on the wind conditions.<br/><br/>LYNDSAY DUNCOMBE (REPORTER):<br/>There's more lightning in the forecast. Fire officials say it's not whether there will be new fires, but where and how fast crews can put them out.<br/><br/>KARLEY DESROSIERS (BC WILDFIRE SERVICE FIRE INFORMATION OFFICER):<br/>Fires can, are growing really quickly upon ignition, which is kind of the main challenge that we do experience when things get unseasonably dry and very, very hot.<br/><br/>LYNDSAY DUNCOMBE (REPORTER):<br/>The long weekend forecast will bring warmth and worry.

Everybody wants to go home. It's really exhausting here. They want to be able to sleep in their own home,\" said Deer Lake's head councillor, Jeremy Sawanis. \"It's so noisy in Toronto, too.\"</p><p>The remote Oji-Cree community, located in Treaty 5 territory, is about 600 kilometres northwest of Thunder Bay. It's only accessible by air or winter road.\u00a0</p><p>Its evacuation was prompted by Red Lake 12, a wildfire that's now more than 194,000 hectares in size. However, the fire is moving away from the community, and crews are starting to take down the sprinkler systems that have been protecting the First Nation's homes and essential infrastructure.</p><p/><p>For Sawanis, being in Toronto has been a big culture shock.</p><p>\"I spend my whole time out in the bush, right? This just gets depressing after a while,\" he said. \"I should be out fishing and hunting, [I] need to be on the land.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, more than 2,000 evacuees from Sandy Lake First Nation remain in communities in southern Ontario, also because of Red Lake 12. Its evacuation was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/sandy-lake-first-nation-evacuation-update-1.7558329\">assisted\u00a0by the Canadian Armed Forces earlier in June.</url></p><p>Mamakeesic\u00a0hopes\u00a0all of his community members will be back in Deer Lake by Tuesday. There's been high demand for planes over the last few days, with members of Keewaywin First Nation also returning home, which pushed Deer Lake's repatriation back a day or two, he said.</p><p>\"Everybody is still with us.

This research is focused on advancing Canada's critical metals sector, with New Age Metals' portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Age's properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat Lake-Winnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAM's Antimony-Gold division is in Newfoundland and spans over 19,800 hectares consisting of 11 non-contiguous properties. Six of these properties are in St. Alban's area, along Canstar's Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining 5 properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Gold's Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 of the Project, Phase 2 has been initiated, and further news will follow. On July 30th, the Company was pleased to announce that it has received formal approval under Newfoundland and Labrador's Junior Exploration Assistance (JEA) Program, including eligibility for the Critical Minerals Assistance (CMA) and Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (PCMA) streams. The potential rebate total for eligible exploration activities is $71,975.</p><p>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with today's issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.</p><p>MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron ore projects, where approximately $120 million has been spent on the project.

As Saskatchewan, continues to battle through one of its worst ever wildfire seasons, help has been coming from across the world and from around the country. Today firefighters from Nova Scotia headed off to join the fight, with 51 active fires still burning, and the conditions challenging and dangerous. CTV's Paul Hollingsworth leads us off.</p><p>PAUL HOLLINGSWORTH (Reporter): When Cody Wilkins first saw these wildfires burning out of control, he said to himself...</p><p>CODY WILKINS (Nova Scotia Firefighter): I think we need to be out there and help.</p><p>HOLLINGSWORTH: Wilkins works for Nova Scotia's Department of Natural Resources. He's one of 25 firefighters who are off to Saskatchewan. Their training has prepared them to meet the challenge of this moment.</p><p>WILKINS: Definitely! Yeah, this is fulfilling.

(\"NAM\" or the \"Company\"), is pleased to announce that, due to strong investor demand, the Company has increased the size of its flow-through unit (FT Unit) private placement previously announced September 25, 2025 as filed under the Companys profile on SEDAR+ at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedarplus.ca\">www.sedarplus.ca</url> and on the Companys website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newagemetals.com\">www.newagemetals.com</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Company originally announced the FT Unit portion of the private placement to raise up to $1,200,000 and it will now increase the FT Unit to raise up to $1,700,000. There is no increase to the non-flow-through unit private placement (NFT Unit) and all other terms as described in the September 25, 2025 press release remain unchanged and subject to Exchange approval. The non-flow-through unit private placement remains at a total of $2.3 million. Mr. Eric Sprott, has indicated his intention to subscribe for $2,000,000 of the Private Placement. Mr. Sprott is the largest shareholder in NAM and currently owns 23.2% of the Company.</p><p>Each FT Unit to be issued at a price of $0.26 will consist of one common share of the Company that will qualify as a flow-through share within the meaning of subsection 66(15) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (FT Common Share) and one-half of one common share purchase warrant (a FT Unit Warrant). Each whole FT Unit Warrant shall entitle the holder thereof to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price equal to $0.40 at any time up to 36 months from closing of the Private Placement. In regards to yesterdays announcement and the NFT units, all of those units are placed and that part of the financing has been spoken for.</p><p>The Company may pay, to eligible persons, a finders fee (Finders Fee) with respect to the sale of the Units to non-insiders, which may be comprised of cash and/or non-transferable share purchase warrants. Any Finder Fee Warrants issuable will entitle the finder to purchase one common share at an exercise price of $0.26 for a period of 36 months from closing of the Private Placement. The proceeds of the FT Units will be used for exploration and development on the Companys projects located in Newfoundland, Ontario or Manitoba. Proceeds of the Units will be used for exploration and general working capital. Completion of the Private Placement and any Finder Fees payable are subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.</p><p>All securities to be issued in connection with the Private Placement will be subject to a hold period of four months plus one day from the date of issuance. The closing of the Private Placement is conditional upon the receipt of the conditional approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.</p><p>This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of any securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful including any of the securities in the United States of America. The securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act) or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for account or benefit of, U.S. Persons (as defined in Regulation S under the 1933 Act) unless registered under the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws, or an exemption from such registration requirements is available.</p><p>About NAM</p><p>New Age Metals is a junior mineral exploration and development company focused on the discovery, exploration, and development of critical green metal projects in North America. The Company has three divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, an Antimony-Gold Division as well as an investment in MetalQuest Minings (TSXV:MQM | OTC:MQMIF) high purity Lac Otelnuk Iron Ore Project.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North Americas largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>The Companys Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (MinRes), one of the worlds largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canadas critical metals sector, with New Age Metals portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Ages properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat LakeWinnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAMs Antimony-Gold division is in Newfoundland and spans over 19,800 hectares consisting of 11 non-contiguous properties. Six of these properties are in St. Albans area, along Canstars Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining 5 properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Golds Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 of the Project, Phase 2 has been initiated, and further news will follow. On July 30th, the Company was pleased to announce that it has received formal approval under Newfoundland and Labradors Junior Exploration Assistance (JEA) Program, including eligibility for the Critical Minerals Assistance (CMA) and Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (PCMA) streams. The potential rebate total for eligible exploration activities is $71,975.</p><p>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with todays issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.</p><p>MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron ore projects, where approximately $120 million has been spent on the project. For more information, please visit MetalQuestMining.com . High-purity iron ore became a critical metal Federally in Canada and in the Provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador in 2024. In the summer of 2025, MQM has contracted AtkinsRealis, an international engineering company, to complete a GAP Analysis on the Lac Otelnuk Project and its 2015 Feasibility Study.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities on an international scale. Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of optioning our projects with major and junior mining companies through to production</p><p>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>Investors are invited to visit the New Age Metals website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newagemetals.com\">www.newagemetals.com</url> where they can review the company and its corporate activities.

Under the Oliver Paipoonge ban that took effect Friday at 8 a.m. \"no burning will be allowed in the municipality until the ban is lifted,\" according to a notice posted to the municipality's website. It added: \"No new fire permits will be issued during the fire ban, and all existing fire permits are suspended until further notice.\" </p><p>Conmee, Gillies, Neebing and O'Connor townships issued similar bans earlier in the week. There was no word on Friday whether Thunder Bay or nearby Shuniah planned similar measures. Those who light fires during municipal bans can face fines of several hundred dollars. Some municipalities in southern Ontario routinely impose fire bans until mid-May to prevent grass fires from sparking up. Meanwhile, a regional spokesman for the provincial agency that oversees provincial firefighting efforts said \"there is no restricted fire zone for the Northwest region in development at this time, though hazard conditions remain elevated in the western side of the region and spring hazard conditions can change quickly.\" Restricted fire zones, which are different from municipal bans, are temporary measures to prevent human-caused fires. Municipalities can impose their own bans in areas where restricted fire zones are not in place. Also on Friday, Ontario's Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services (AFFES) agency advised that some parts of NorthwesternOntario may smell smoke drifting from a wildfire located about 60 kilometres northwest of Kenora. Late Thursday, the fire was less than one hectare in size but was considered not under control. The blaze has been attacked by waterbombers. As of Friday morning, 32 fires recorded so far this season by Ontario Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services across the province had burned over less than three square kilometre of land. That compared to the 10-year average of 77 square kilometres for the same period, according to statistics by the Ontario Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-8f47aea7e8024041864ed093c0080dd5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FSM-0KT3-S5VR-X37B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"358\"/><timeReceived>12:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 10, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Fines now range from $75 to $1,000.</p><p>Environment Canada is calling for hot, dry weather in Newfoundland for the coming days, with temperatures between 25 C and 28 C and no rain in the forecast.</p><p>The weather agency has issued an air quality warning for northern portion of the Avalon Peninsula, and special air quality statements were issued for much of the rest of the island.</p><p>Meanwhile, the province issued new evacuation orders Wednesday for cabin-owners in the Martin Lake, Great Rattling Brook and Rushy Pond areas after a new fire broke out near the Bay d'Espoir Highway in central Newfoundland.</p><p>Evacuation orders remain in place for a number of communities in the eastern part of the province, including the Holyrood and Conception Bay South areas, the unincorporated area of Perry's Cove, the town of Salmon Cove, Ochre Pit Cove and Small Point-Adam's Cove-Blackhead-Broad Cove and Kingston.</p><p>Hogan said on Tuesday he visited with families in Victoria, N.L., a community near the Kingston-area fire. \"There's the sense of anxiety and frustration and fear, as you can imagine,\" the premier said. \"At the same time, there's a sense of calmness and relief because everybody is safe.\"</p><p>\"I talked to a woman last night who said her son lost his house, but he was safe in St. John's and that was her main concern. There's going to continue to be a range of emotions as we go though these disasters over the next number of days, and potentially weeks,\" he said.</p><p>The wildfire in the Holyrood area grew very little overnight, staying at about 0.22 square kilometres in size. The premier said the new fire in central Newfoundland was estimated to be about 1.5 square kilometres.</p><p>\"This is all hands on deck,\" Hogan said before thanking the crews of firefighters.</p><p>The province has said three firefighting aircraft from New Brunswick were set to arrive Wednesday.</p><p>Hogan said some residents have raised questions about the province's access to firefighting aircraft and equipment. He said the province has asked for help, adding that decisions about resources are made in co-ordination with the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2025080776276013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GFC-HJD3-RS79-K110-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"528\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.
