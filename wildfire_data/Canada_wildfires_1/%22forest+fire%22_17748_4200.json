The cities included Rome, Florence and Palermo, but also Bolzano, which is usually a refreshing hot-weather escape in the Alps,</p><p>The local National Health Service offices in Rome and Bologna telephoned older residents who live alone to see if they needed groceries or medicines delivered so they wouldn't venture out in the searing heat.</p><p>The Italian air force, which oversees the national weather service, said the interior parts of the islands of Sardinia and Sicily could expect to see temperatures upwards of 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) by Friday. By early afternoon on Thursday in Rome, the city famous for its ornamental as well as strategically placed sidewalk drinking fountains sizzled in 38 C (100 F) heat.</p><p>\"I drink a lot of water, more water, more water and more water,\" said Hank Heerat, a tourist from the Netherlands cycling down the broad boulevard flanking the Roman Forum.</p><p>At the ancient Colosseum, Civil Protection volunteers distributed hundreds of bottles of water to visitors.</p><p>In Serbia, the spell of hot, dry weather prompted four municipalities to declare an emergency after Rzav River levels plummeted, endangering water supplies. Authorities imposed drinking water restrictions affecting some 250,000 people, while the army brought in water tanks for public use.</p><p>\"We have a period of severe drought, we cannot take any more water from the river,\" Zoran Barac, the head of a local water supply utility, told state broadcaster RTS.</p><p>In Spain, the national weather service warned temperatures could hit 44 C (111 F) in some areas in coming days. Parts of the northeastern Catalonia region were forecast to reach 42 C (107.6 F) on Thursday.</p><p>Authorities in Barcelona, the Catalan capital, designated 162 museums, libraries, schools and other public places around the city as \"climate shelters.\" The sites offered an escape from the heat, cool drinking water and staff trained in dealing with heatstroke.</p><p>The surge in temperatures, due to a mass of hot, dry air from Africa, was expected to ease starting on Monday on the Iberian peninsula.</p><p>While Southern Europe is known for sunny, hot summers, climate scientists say there's little doubt climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving extreme events such as heat waves, droughts and wildfires, which they say are likely to happen more frequently as Earth warms.</p><p>A German tourist in Rome concurred.</p><p>Because of climate change, \"temperatures are very high. So I think it's a better option is to reduce the carbon dioxide from the cars and travel more with the metro,\" said Philippe Kutaski near the Colosseum in Rome.</p><p>As in past years, Croatia's Adriatic Sea resorts were hosting hundreds of thousands of tourists. But those stepping out of the sea sweltered as temperatures reached 39 C (102 F) on the coast on Wednesday.</p><p>Crops suffered, too.</p><p>The Italian agriculture lobby Coldiretti said Thursday that 20% of the tomato crop in Italy's south was lost due to torrid heat and humidity. Italy exports nearly 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) worth of tomatoes and tomato products like canned or bottled sauce throughout the world.</p><p>While much attention has focused on southern Europe's heat crisis, it was even hotter on the North African shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Temperatures hit 50 C (122 F) in Tunisia, a record high for the country. The last previous high was 48.2 C (nearly 119 F) in 1968.</p><p>In Algeria, most of the regions of the north of the country have been placed on alert for heat waves. Fires ravaging mountain forests and villages in Algeria's Berber region have killed at least 65 people, including 28 soldiers.</p><p>Blazes have devoured forest and brush areas in Greece and in southern Italy for days.</p><p>In Italy, temperatures in the mid-40s C (over 110 F) in inland parts of Sardinia, Calabria and Sicily made for ripe fire conditions. But long spells of drought also were blamed. By the start of summer in Italy, vegetation had already withered from lack of rain and \"essentially became fuel\" for wildfires, Italian Civil Protection official Luigi D'Angelo told Italian state TV.</p><p>\u2014Frances D'emilio, The Associated Press</p><p>RELATED: Massive forest fire in Greece still burning for 7th day</p><p>RELATED: Heat wave marked by unusually high night time temperatures</p><p>Copyright 2021 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20210812PAB4198211</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BY-SXC1-F0HF-83SH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Group Ltd.

Across the Prairie provinces, more than 160 fires are burning in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and northwest Ontario.</p><p>All told, Canada\u2019s currently active wildfires have consumed about 1.2 million hectares of territory, an area twice the size of Prince Edward Island.</p><p>In 14 different states across the U.S., meanwhile, about 21,000 firefighters are battling 96 fires, including 24 large blazes in Montana and 20 in Idaho.</p><p>\u201cThe demand from the 2021 fire season shows we both need more resources in the future,\u201d the Natural Resources memo says.</p><p>The situation is serious enough to have come up in a phone conversation Monday between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Joe Biden, who agreed that it\u2019s beyond time to come up with a different approach.</p><p>In addition to their shared focus on mitigating climate change, the memo says the two countries are discussing a \u201cco-ordinated investment program\u201d to increase the pool of trained firefighters.</p><p>\u201cGiven that we are seeing longer, more intense fire seasons due to climate change and a resulting strain on resources, Canada and the U.S.are looking at ways to address these challenges in a co-ordinated way,\u201d it says.</p><p>Canada is also working on a \u201cblueprint\u201d for North American collaboration on the science surrounding wildfires, based on a proposal de-veloped by Natural Resources Canada and the U.S. Forest Service in conjunction with experts from all three countries.</p><p>\u201cCanada is continuing to look at ways to work collaboratively with the United States as well as other partner countries to develop innovative solutions, increasing global capacity to respond, and reducing the vulnerability from catastrophic wildfires.\u201d</p><p>Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom told Biden that the U.S. Forest Service, which is responsible for nearly 60 per cent of the forest lands in the state, took a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach to the massive Tamarack fire, which has been burning on both sides of the California-Nevada boundary.</p><p>\u201cThey waited, and what we saw is the fire took off,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe need your help to change the culture in terms of the suppression strategies in this climate, literally and figuratively, to be more aggressive on these federal fires.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, said Johnston, one important step will be for the rest of the world to stop waiting for vast tracts of the continent to catch fire before thinking about how to deal with the problem.</p><p>\u201cThere simply isn\u2019t any easy solution,\u201d he said, noting that California spent nearly two per cent of its annual gross domestic product on dealing with wildfires.</p><p>Proactive strategies \u2014 using mechanical means and prescribed burns when conditions are less volatile to reduce the amount of raw fuel \u2014 will be a critical part of any successful plan.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true that the only way to fight fire is with fire,\u201d Johnston said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice about whether to have fire, but we do have some choices about where and when.\u201d</p><p>\u2014James McCarten, The Canadian Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RIMREV-news20210810PSEA0002052450</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RIMREV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BH-TPN1-F0HF-843X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464673</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"787\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

'We are done.' <br/> The blazes have destroyed homes and reduced thousands of hectares of land to ash on Evia, Greece's second-largest island just northeast of the capital Athens. <br/> Civil protection deputy minister Nikos Hardalias said a fire front in the north of Evia was being pushed by strong winds towards beach villages. <br/> 'We have ahead of us another difficult evening, another difficult night,' he said, adding that 17 aircraft were helping to fight the fires on Evia. <br/> However, fires in the southwestern Peloponnese region and in a northern suburb of Athens had abated, he added. <br/> - 'In God's hands' - <br/> The rugged landscape and dense pine forests on Evia that so appeal to tourists are helping to spread the flames and make the work of firefighters almost impossible. <br/> Even waterbombing planes are struggling, with an official telling local media much of the water was evaporating before it reached the ground. <br/> Hundreds of people have already fled the island and another 349 were taken to safety early on Sunday, the coast guard said. <br/> In Pefki village, young people carried older and disabled people over the sand on to a ferry. <br/> Elsewhere, villagers joined in the battle against the flames, helping firefighters. <br/> 'We are in the hands of God,' 26-year-old Evia resident Yannis Selimis told AFP. 'The state is absent. If people leave, the villages will burn for sure.' <br/> Local officials were critical of the efforts to control the fires, which erupted on the island on Tuesday. <br/> 'I have no more voice left to ask for more aircraft. I can't stand this situation,' local mayor Giorgos Tsapourniotis told Skai TV on Saturday. <br/> Many villages were saved only because young people ignored evacuation orders and stayed on to keep the fires away from their homes, he added. <br/> Alexis Tsipras, leader of the main opposition Syriza party, said the government did not appear to be listening to local concerns about a lack of coordination and equipment. <br/> 'Is there a management plan? HOW LONG will this drama drag on?' he wrote in a tweet. <br/> Local officials were struggling to shelter those forced to flee their homes. <br/> Hardalias said on Saturday that provisional shelter had been provided to 2,000 people evacuated from the island. <br/> - 'Trying times' - <br/> From July 29 to August 7, 56,655 hectares (140,000 acres) were burnt in Greece,according to the European Forest Fire Information System. The average area burnt over the same 10 summer days between 2008 and 2020 was 1,700 hectares. <br/>Britain, France, Spain and other countries have answered Greece's appeal for help, and on Sunday, Serbia announced it was sending 13 vehicles with 37 firefighters and three firefighting helicopters. <br/>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis thanked foreign countries for their help on Sunday. <br/> 'On behalf of the Greek people, I would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all the countries that have sent assistance and resources to help fight the wildfires,' he tweeted. <br/> 'We thank you for standing by Greece during these trying times.' <br/> Police said on Sunday they had arrested at least 10 people for arson, among them three young men in Pireaus for attempting to start a fire in nearby Perama. <br/><url

Two people have been confirmed dead in Greece and eight in Turkey, while dozens have been hospitalised. <br/> While rain brought some respite from the blazes in Turkey over the weekend, Greece continued to suffer from an intense heatwave that Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said should show even doubters the hard reality of climate change. <br/> On Sunday Civil protection deputy minister Nikos Hardalias warned of 'another difficult night' ahead, saying that strong winds were pushing a fire front towards beach villages on Evia, northeast of Athens. <br/> Among 650 firefighters deployed on the island, Greece's second biggest after Crete, were 250 from Serbia and Romania, supported by 11 planes and helicopters dousing flames with water during the day, according to the Greek firefighting services. <br/> But the air support faced 'serious difficulties' because of turbulence, thick smoke and limited visibility, Hardalias said. <br/> Giorgos Kelaitzidis, Evia's deputy governor, echoed many when he blasted the 'insufficient forces' to fight the fires while 'the situation is critical' on the island. <br/> He said at least 35,000 hectares of land and hundreds of homes have been burned. <br/><br/>- 'In the hands of God' - <br/><br/>Hundreds of people have already fled the island and another 349 were taken to safety early on Sunday, the coast guard said. <br/> In Pefki village, young people carried older people over the sand on to a ferry. <br/> Elsewhere, villagers joined in the battle against the flames, helping firefighters. <br/> 'We are in the hands of God,' 26-year-old Evia resident Yannis Selimis told AFP. 'The state is absent. If people leave, the villages will burn for sure.' <br/> The situation looked better elsewhere, with officials saying that fires in the southwestern Peloponnese region and in a suburb north of Athens had abated. A fire on Crete was brought under control. <br/> But Hardalias warned the risk of fires resurging was heightened. <br/> Some 300 firefighters remained mobilised on the Peleponnese and rescue teams on Monday still fought flames at the foot of Mount Parnes, 30 kilometres (17 miles) north of Athens. These included units from Israel as well as Cyprus and France. <br/> From July 29 to August 7, 56,655 hectares (140,000 acres) were burnt in Greece,according to the European Forest Fire Information System. The average area burnt over the same period between 2008 and 2020 was 1,700 hectares. <br/><url

Despite a long history of helping out, both need all hands on deck to battle rampant wildfires on either side of the border, says a Natural Resources Canada background memo obtained by The Canadian Press. Both the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre and its U.S.counterpart are at Level 5 of the \u201cnational preparedness\u201d scale, the highest tier, \u201cindicating a deficit of personnel in both countries,\u201d the memo says. \u201cWithin that context, neither country has been able to share resources with each other.\u201d Both will continue to be able to access other international resources if necessary, the memo notes \u2014 indeed, about 100 firefighters from Mexico recently arrived in B.C. , joining a number of Canadian Armed Forces personnel \u2014 but the situation points to a challenge that\u2019s only going to get worse. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s two outlooks to think about:the first is the outlook for the rest of the summer, and the outlook for the rest of the summer is hot and dry,\u201d said James Johnston, a forest management and wildfire expert at Oregon State University. \u201cThen there\u2019s the outlook for summers to come, and that outlook is even hotter and drier.\u201d Last year, Canada sent 529 front-line crew members, 62 supervisory teams and a number of aircraft to help the U.S.battle a slew of fires across hard-hit California, Oregon and much of the Pacific Northwest, the backgrounder noted. This year, however, both countries have their hands full:in B.C. alone, where 269 active fires were reported Wednesday, experts are anticipating the worst summer in the province in more than 70 years. Across the Prairie provinces, more than 160 fires are burning in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and northwest Ontario. All told, Canada\u2019s currently active wildfires have consumed about 1.2 million hectares of territory, an area twice the size of Prince Edward Island. In 14 different states across the U.S., meanwhile, about 21,000 firefighters are battling 96 fires, including 24 large blazes in Montana and 20 in Idaho. \u201cThe demand from the 2021 fire season shows we both need more resources in the future,\u201d the Natural Resources memo says. The situation is serious enough to have come up in a phone conversation Monday between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Joe Biden, who agreed that it\u2019s beyond time to come up with a different approach. In addition to their shared focus on mitigating climate change, the memo says the two countries are discussing a \u201cco-ordinated investment program\u201d to increase the pool of trained firefighters. \u201cGiven that we are seeing longer, more intense fire seasons due to climate change and a resulting strain on resources, Canada and the U.S.are looking at ways to address these challenges in a co-ordinated way,\u201d it says. Canada is also working on a \u201cblueprint\u201d for North American collaboration on the science surrounding wildfires, based on a proposal developed by Natural Resources Canada and the U.S. Forest Service in conjunction with experts from all three countries. \u201cCanada is continuing to look at ways to work collaboratively with the United States as well as other partner countries to develop innovative solutions, increasing global capacity to respond, and reducing the vulnerability from catastrophic wildfires.\u201d Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom told Biden that the U.S. Forest Service, which is responsible for nearly 60 per cent of the forest lands in the state, took a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach to the massive Tamarack fire, which has been burning on both sides of the California-Nevada boundary. \u201cThey waited, and what we saw is the fire took off,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe need your help to change the culture in terms of the suppression strategies in this climate, literally and figuratively, to be more aggressive on these federal fires.\u201d Indeed, said Johnston, one important step will be for the rest of the world to stop waiting for vast tracts of the continent to catch fire before thinking about how to deal with the problem. \u201cThere simply isn\u2019t any easy solution,\u201d he said, noting that California spent nearly two per cent of its annual gross domestic product on dealing with wildfires. Proactive strategies \u2014 using mechanical means and prescribed burns when conditions are less volatile to reduce the amount of raw fuel \u2014 will be a critical part of any successful plan. \u201cIt\u2019s true that the only way to fight fire is with fire,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice about whether to have fire, but we do have some choices about where and when.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20210806PTEA0002050035</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:639T-KHF1-F0HF-80P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"787\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

However, due to prior commitments, the drill contractor will be moving the rig to their next project. With only a couple of months remaining in the drill season it is unlikely that our current drill contractor will return this season. Alternatives are being considered.Our core shed in Crescent Mills was untouched by the fire although power was interrupted. Power is expected to be restored this week permitting us to fully resume activity. Seven holes (5,872 ft) had been completed on our Superior deposit up until the evacuation order of July 20, 2021. Five holes have been logged and split core sent to the lab for assay. Core from holes 6 &amp;#38; 7 still need to be logged, cut and sent to the lab in Reno. We expect all assays to be completed and received by late October 2021.We initially planned 10-12 holes at Superior to be able to reclassify the Superior resource (60 million tonnes @ 0.41% copper as per our Technical report on Superior dated Nov 7, 2014 available on Sedar) from inferred to indicated. The 7 holes completed will allow us to only partially achieve this objective, but we will be able to quantify the gold and silver credits in the deposit that were largely ignored in assays by prior owners. US Copper CEO Stephen Dunn commented: \"We at US Copper have closely watched the incredible destruction caused by the Dixie Fire and wish to say to all those affected that we are very sorry for the loss and pain that many of you have endured. Our thoughts are especially with those who have lost homes and livelihoods in Greenville and surrounding areas. Also, we would like to pay homage to the dedication and outright heroism of first responders and firefighters who have kept up the fight for weeks on end.  <br/>About US Copper Corp<br/>US Copper controls approximately 13 square miles of patented and unpatented federal mining claims in the Light's CreekCopper District in Plumas County, NECalifornia; essentially, the entire District. The District contains substantial copper (silver) sulfide and copper oxide resources in three deposits - Moonlight, Superior and Engels, as well as several partially tested and untested exploration targets.  <br/>The Superior and Engels Mines operated from about 1915-1930 producing over 161 million pounds of copper from over 4 million tons of rock containing 2.2% copper with silver and gold credits.  <br/>The Moonlight Deposit was discovered and drilled by Placer Amex during the 1960's.

On April 18 and 19, a helicopter moved 35 community members stuck on the Dease Lake side of the washout, supplies, mail and pets from the Dease Lake airport to the Telegraph Creek airstrip.</p><p>Cargo was unloaded from a Bandstra semi-truck in Dease Lake, before being re-packed, weighed and moved by truck to kilometre 58 on the Telegraph Creek road. That allowed for a shorter distance for the supplies to be slung by helicopter.</p><p>Another company, Skeena Resources, used Silver King Helicopters Inc. to transport fuel to the community over the span of three days, ending on April 22. The Tahltan Nation Development Corporation constructed a berm at kilometre 61 of the road for use as a staging area. Fuel was trailered to that location by Northwest Fuels and then taken by helicopter sling to the Tahltan Centre Grocery Store where Stikine River Expediting transferred and pumped the fuel.</p><p>And a third company, Newmont Corporation, has hired Alkan Air to transport groceries, medicine and mail by fixed wing aircraft next week. It has not been possible to use fixed wing aircraft thus far because the airstrip has been too wet.</p><p>Those wet conditions, coupled with a lack of vegetation due to wildfires in 2018 have created the perfect recipe for washouts and slides.</p><p>A spell of warm weather in the area has been quickly melting the heavy snowpack. In 2018, wildfires burned around 120,000 hectares in the area, meaning that there is little foliage to slow the movement of melting snow and water.</p><p>\"It's not common to be be this bad, the forest fire did do a lot of damage, there's no vegetation, there's no trees that are able to be able to soak up all this extra water.\" McPhee said.</p><p>Since the washout, there have been instances of other localized localized slides and creek breaches daily, including a slide in Telegraph Creek itself, blocking access to some residences which are not currently occupied.</p><p>Residents of Telegraph Creek were already hauling snow out of the community to mitigate risks before the washout happened. Three excavators and three gravel trucks were already on the Telegraph Creek side of the washout, which McPhee said was fortunate because they are able to keep working on the slides in and around the community.</p><p>Newcrest Mining has offered to let operators from Telegraph Creek come home to help and bolster the already capable people in the area.</p><p>\"With the fire that we had, all our people are trained and ready to go, knowing what to do and we're very fortunate to have a good crew here,\" McPhee said.</p><p>\"We're very fortunate for Tahltan people to have lots of operators and we have lots of versatile people who are able to wear different hats.\"</p><p>According to McPhee, the road could re-open by Monday, April 26, but that is an optimistic timeline. She said that the worst-case scenario for the road to re-open is the end of the month, but the situation is changing daily.</p><p>READ MORE: Telegraph Creek Road washed out, no timetable to re-open</p><p>@BenBogstie</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ben.bogstie@terracestandard.com\">ben.bogstie@terracestandard.com</email></p><p>Like us on</p><p>\" Facebook and follow us on</p><p>\" Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Terrace Standard</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TERSTN-news20210423PTA4147819</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TERSTN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62H9-11D1-JD2C-J4S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438220</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Across the Prairie provinces, more than 160 fires are burning in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and northwest Ontario.</p><p>All told, Canada's currently active wildfires have consumed about 1.2 million hectares of territory, an area twice the size of Prince Edward Island.</p><p>In 14 different states across the U.S., meanwhile, about 21,000 firefighters are battling 96 fires, including 24 large blazes in Montana and 20 in Idaho.</p><p>\"The demand from the 2021 fire season shows we both need more resources in the future,\" the Natural Resources memo says.</p><p>The situation is serious enough to have come up in a phone conversation Monday between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Joe Biden, who agreed that it's beyond time to come up with a different approach.</p><p>In addition to their shared focus on mitigating climate change, the memo says the two countries are discussing a \"co-ordinated investment program\" to increase the pool of trained firefighters.</p><p>\"Given that we are seeing longer, more intense fire seasons due to climate change and a resulting strain on resources, Canada and the U.S. are looking at ways to address these challenges in a co-ordinated way,\" it says.</p><p>Canada is also working on a \"blueprint\" for North American collaboration on the science surrounding wildfires, based on a proposal developed by Natural Resources Canada and the U.S. Forest Service in conjunction with experts from all three countries.</p><p>\"Canada is continuing to look at ways to work collaboratively with the United States as well as other partner countries to develop innovative solutions, increasing global capacity to respond, and reducing the vulnerability from catastrophic wildfires.\"</p><p>Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom told Biden that the U.S. Forest Service, which is responsible for nearly 60 per cent of the forest lands in the state, took a \"wait-and-see\" approach to the massive Tamarack fire, which has been burning on both sides of the California-Nevada boundary.</p><p>\"They waited, and what we saw is the fire took off,\" Newsom said. \"We need your help to change the culture in terms of the suppression strategies in this climate, literally and figuratively, to be more aggressive on these federal fires.\"</p><p>Indeed, said Johnston, one important step will be for the rest of the world to stop waiting for vast tracts of the continent to catch fire before thinking about how to deal with the problem.</p><p>\"There simply isn't any easy solution,\" he said, noting that California spent nearly two per cent of its annual gross domestic product on dealing with wildfires.</p><p>Proactive strategies &amp; - using mechanical means and prescribed burns when conditions are less volatile to reduce the amount of raw fuel &amp; - will be a critical part of any successful plan.</p><p>\"It's true that the only way to fight fire is with fire,\" Johnston said.</p><p>\"We don't have a choice about whether to have fire, but we do have some choices about where and when.\"</p><p>&amp;

Across the Prairie provinces, more than 160 fires are burning in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and northwest Ontario.</p><p>All told, Canada's currently active wildfires have consumed about 1.2 million hectares of territory, an area twice the size of Prince Edward Island.</p><p>In 14 different states across the U.S., meanwhile, about 21,000 firefighters are battling 96 fires, including 24 large blazes in Montana and 20 in Idaho.</p><p>\"The demand from the 2021 fire season shows we both need more resources in the future,\" the Natural Resources memo says.</p><p>The situation is serious enough to have come up in a phone conversation Monday between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Joe Biden, who agreed that it's beyond time to come up with a different approach.</p><p>In addition to their shared focus on mitigating climate change, the memo says the two countries are discussing a \"co-ordinated investment program\" to increase the pool of trained firefighters.</p><p>\"Given that we are seeing longer, more intense fire seasons due to climate change and a resulting strain on resources, Canada and the U.S. are looking at ways to address these challenges in a co-ordinated way,\" it says.</p><p>Canada is also working on a \"blueprint\" for North American collaboration on the science surrounding wildfires, based on a proposal developed by Natural Resources Canada and the U.S. Forest Service in conjunction with experts from all three countries. </p><p>\"Canada is continuing to look at ways to work collaboratively with the United States as well as other partner countries to develop innovative solutions, increasing global capacity to respond, and reducing the vulnerability from catastrophic wildfires.\"</p><p>Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom told Biden that the U.S. Forest Service, which is responsible for nearly 60 per cent of the forest lands in the state, took a \"wait-and-see\" approach to the massive Tamarack fire, which has been burning on both sides of the California-Nevada boundary.</p><p>\"They waited, and what we saw is the fire took off,\" Newsom said.</p><p>\"We need your help to change the culture in terms of the suppression strategies in this climate, literally and figuratively, to be more aggressive on these federal fires.\"</p><p>Indeed, said Johnston, one important step will be for the rest of the world to stop waiting for vast tracts of the continent to catch fire before thinking about how to deal with the problem.</p><p>\"There simply isn't any easy solution,\" he said, noting that California spent nearly two per cent of its annual gross domestic product on dealing with wildfires.</p><p>Proactive strategies \u2014 using mechanical means and prescribed burns when conditions are less volatile to reduce the amount of raw fuel \u2014 will be a critical part of any successful plan.</p><p>\"It's true that the only way to fight fire is with fire,\" Johnston said.</p><p>\"We don't have a choice about whether to have fire, but we do have some choices about where and when.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 4, 2021.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-2ff93421c3764857b130c6701eefd2d0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:639D-6WG1-DY9S-T3S9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"795\"/><timeReceived>03:43 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 4, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On April 18 and 19, a helicopter moved 35 community members stuck on the Dease Lake side of the washout, supplies, mail and pets from the Dease Lake airport to the Telegraph Creek airstrip.</p><p>Cargo was unloaded from a Bandstra semi-truck in Dease Lake, before being re-packed, weighed and moved by truck to kilometre 58 on the Telegraph Creek road. That allowed for a shorter distance for the supplies to be slung by helicopter.</p><p>Another company, Skeena Resources, used Silver King Helicopters Inc. to transport fuel to the community over the span of three days, ending on April 22. The Tahltan Nation Development Corporation constructed a berm at kilometre 61 of the road for use as a staging area. Fuel was trailered to that location by Northwest Fuels and then taken by helicopter sling to the Tahltan Centre Grocery Store where Stikine River Expediting transferred and pumped the fuel.</p><p>And a third company, Newmont Corporation, has hired Alkan Air to transport groceries, medicine and mail by fixed wing aircraft next week. It has not been possible to use fixed wing aircraft thus far because the airstrip has been too wet.</p><p>Those wet conditions, coupled with a lack of vegetation due to wildfires in 2018 have created the perfect recipe for washouts and slides.</p><p>A spell of warm weather in the area has been quickly melting the heavy snowpack. In 2018, wildfires burned around 120,000 hectares in the area, meaning that there is little foliage to slow the movement of melting snow and water.</p><p>\"It's not common to be be this bad, the forest fire did do a lot of damage, there's no vegetation, there's no trees that are able to be able to soak up all this extra water.\" McPhee said.</p><p>Since the washout, there have been instances of other localized localized slides and creek breaches daily, including a slide in Telegraph Creek itself, blocking access to some residences which are not currently occupied.</p><p>Residents of Telegraph Creek were already hauling snow out of the community to mitigate risks before the washout happened. Three excavators and three gravel trucks were already on the Telegraph Creek side of the washout, which McPhee said was fortunate because they are able to keep working on the slides in and around the community.</p><p>Newcrest Mining has offered to let operators from Telegraph Creek come home to help and bolster the already capable people in the area.</p><p>\"With the fire that we had, all our people are trained and ready to go, knowing what to do and we're very fortunate to have a good crew here,\" McPhee said.</p><p>\"We're very fortunate for Tahltan people to have lots of operators and we have lots of versatile people who are able to wear different hats.\"</p><p>According to McPhee, the road could re-open by Monday, April 26, but that is an optimistic timeline. She said that the worst-case scenario for the road to re-open is the end of the month, but the situation is changing daily.</p><p>READ MORE: Telegraph Creek Road washed out, no timetable to re-open</p><p>@BenBogstie</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ben.bogstie@terracestandard.com\">ben.bogstie@terracestandard.com</email></p><p>Like us on</p><p>\" Facebook and follow us on</p><p>\" Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20210423PAB4147821</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62H9-11D1-JD2C-J4CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Group Ltd.

may have missed out on spring, but one of the country's most prominent weather forecasters says they'll likely get to enjoy a more seasonal summer.</p><p>The Weather Network is calling for slightly warmer than normal temperatures across most of the country, with Ontario and Quebec slated for the longest stretches of significant heat.</p><p>But Chief Meteorologist Chris Scott says the summery conditions in central Canada may come with a price, predicting precipitation levels somewhat above seasonal norms throughout June, July and August.</p><p>Scott says the season may get off to a slow start in the Atlantic provinces, but forecasts more typical summer weather patterns towards the end of June as well as above average storm activity throughout the region.</p><p>He's also expecting to see higher precipitation across much of the prairies, noting the same weather that may complicate spring planting for regional farmers is slated to give way to favourable harvest conditions by season's end.</p><p>Scott says a cooler month of June in British Columbia and the Yukon is expected to lead to temperatures that are slightly above seasonal norms, while average temperatures in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories are projected to fall below levels recorded in a typical summer.</p><p>Scott said regular shots of rain and cool air across most of the country will prevent the warmer-than-average summer from feeling like an \"all-out scorcher,\" but said those pining for patio weather may still be dissatisfied with the forecast after living through a month of May that saw conditions swing from snowfalls to heatwaves in the course of weeks.</p><p>\"If you're lamenting that you seem to have skipped spring where you live, there's going to be some spring weather still in June,\" Scott said in a telephone interview. \"So we're not all in on summer yet, but it is on the way.\"</p><p>Scott said the hot, humid conditions expected to dominate in Quebec and Ontario are currently projected to stretch beyond the summer months and into September.</p><p>He said the main wildcards for meteorologists remain the hurricane season in the Atlantic provinces and forest fire risks farther west, particularly in British Columbia.</p><p>Scott said the forecast suggests the latter may pose less of a concern than in recent years, but notes it only takes one blaze to cause widespread disaster.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 1, 2020.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Hang on. I just referred to the rapper, designer, incoherent philosopher king and billionaire missionary as \"Kanye West.\" I regret the error.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As of this week, his legal name is Ye. It has a nice archaic and ecclesiastical ring to it: Gather ye round, Ye is upon ye. Behold Ye, ye heathens!</p><p>Ye was in Venice this weekend to perform at the wedding of G\u00e9raldine Guiotte and Alexandre Arnault. They must be high society types because their guest list included Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9.</p><p>I can't believe my wife never let me invite Mr. T to our wedding. Sure, he would have opened the envelope and bellowed at his poodle: \"FOOL, WHO ARE THESE FOOLS?\"</p><p>But he would have enlivened the proceedings, which is presumably why Ye was in Venice.</p><p>You know, to sing and entertain.</p><p>In one clip, Ye is onstage in a double-breasted blue blazer and matching mask. I don't mean the masks we've been wearing for the past 18 months. No, this mask was sculpted from hard plastic. It cradled his face like preemie Pampers. Given the cobalt hue and eerie horror vibe, Ye looked like Michael Myers as reimagined by Yves Klein.</p><p>It was visually disturbing. I got no sleep on Tuesday.</p><p>So now Ye is trying to belt out \"Runaway.\" But since Ye's lips, jaw and breathing passages are obstructed by the mask, his words are muffled. He keeps reaching for his noggin, like there's an invisible python twirling around his neck.</p><p>There's a reason sprinters never attempt the 100-metre dash with their Nikes tied together. When I'm typing, I don't wear mittens, as this would make typing needlessly hard.</p><p>Just as it's needlessly hard to sing while WEARING A MASK.</p><p>At first, I thought maybe this Venice face covering was performance art, a wry commentary on alienation, dislocation, running away. But, no. It seems Ye just likes wearing masks these days. Behold some recent headlines: \"Kanye West Causes Terror with Strange Masks On His Last Trip.\" \"Kanye West Wears Creepy White Face Mask in NYC.\" \"Like a Scooby Doo Villain: Kanye West Wears BONKERS Mask to Mystery Michael Cohen Meeting.\"</p><p>While this meeting is definitely a mystery, a New York Post story - \"Kanye West Dons Bizarre Mask For Second Michael Cohen Meeting\" - attempted to explain why Ye looked like a Saks mannequin.</p><p>As Cohen told the paper: \"The purpose (of the mask) was so that people would not recognize him ... the first 10 minutes we sat down, he was mobbed by people ... who wanted photos, and to say hello. So he put on this mask to give him some anonymity, which interestingly enough, did not really work.\"</p><p>Gosh. That is interesting, Michael. You mean to tell me random passersby were even more attracted to a patio table after noticing a former MAGA lieutenant was chatting up a cyborg in a designer bomber jacket? There were also photos this week of Ye in masks shuttling between airports. The imagery was strange. I gotta remove my shoes and belt before clearing security, but Ye gets to travel with a fake Caucasian face?</p><p>But you know what? I think Ye might be laying the groundwork - or facework - for his greatest commercial success yet. And that's saying something. Connect the dots, people. Ye recently applied for a mask trademark. Now he's jetting across the Atlantic, looking like Benicio del Toro after a radical face lift? Maybe he's about to launch a new line of Halloween wear: Yeezy Pagan. Or maybe he realizes this pandemic has opened us to the possibility of wearing even more identity-deleting masks.</p><p>Remember the first time you strapped on a mask during the pandemic? It felt like there was a sock on your elbow. Now this rigmarole feels totally normal. But instead of just reducing exposure to dangerous microbes, what if your mask could obscure who you are? Imagine slipping past neighbours to run errands. Or attending a Zoom family reunion and not having to say a word because nobody knows it's you and are too petrified to ask. I can't afford Yeezy sneakers. But I can hit up Dollarama to purchase a Ye Face Invisibility Cloak, especially if it grants me anonymity at the next staff meeting.</p><p>Did you see the image Ye shared on Monday of his new haircut? I don't know who did this, but it might have been a Black &amp; Decker test lab that dabbles in autonomous edge trimming. Or a drunk Ye handed the clippers to Stevie Wonder. It didn't look like a haircut, so much as a violent assault. There were geometric bald patches, skid marks, jagged lines. Have you ever seen satellite photos after a forest fire?</p><p>That's what Ye's head looked like. And ... bingo.</p><p>Everything Ye is doing now - going incognito while clinking java, butchering his songs, scaring toddlers in the pre-flight lounge, getting a haircut inspired by the placemat mazes at Denny's - is clearly a ploy to make gazillions more by selling masks to the masses. Ye realizes this pandemic has eaten away at our self-concepts.</p><p>Now Ye shall monetize the bedlam, one fake face at a time.</p><p>Twitter: @vinaymenon</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20211021TTA2021102162545872</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63WT-DXT1-JDV5-F0KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Hang on. I just referred to the rapper, designer, incoherent philosopher king and billionaire missionary as \"Kanye West.\" I regret the error.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As of this week, his legal name is Ye. It has a nice archaic and ecclesiastical ring to it: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Gather ye round, Ye is upon ye. Behold Ye, ye heathens!</emphasis></p><p>Ye was in Venice this weekend to perform at the wedding of G\u00e9raldine Guiotte and Alexandre Arnault. They must be high society types because their guest list included Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9.</p><p>I can't believe my wife never let me invite Mr. T to our wedding. Sure, he would have opened the envelope and bellowed at his poodle: \"FOOL, WHO ARE THESE FOOLS?\"</p><p>But he would have enlivened the proceedings, which is presumably why Ye was in Venice.</p><p>You know, to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">sing</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">entertain</emphasis>.</p><p>In one clip, Ye is onstage in a double-breasted blue blazer and matching mask. I don't mean the masks we've been wearing for the past 18 months. No, this mask was sculpted from hard plastic. It cradled his face like preemie Pampers. Given the cobalt hue and eerie horror vibe, Ye looked like Michael Myers as reimagined by Yves Klein.</p><p>It was visually disturbing. I got no sleep on Tuesday.</p><p>So now Ye is trying to belt out \"Runaway.\" But since Ye's lips, jaw and breathing passages are obstructed by the mask, his words are muffled. He keeps reaching for his noggin, like there's an invisible python twirling around his neck.</p><p>There's a reason sprinters never attempt the 100-metre dash with their Nikes tied together. When I'm typing, I don't wear mittens, as this would make typing needlessly hard.</p><p>Just as it's needlessly hard to sing while WEARING A MASK.</p><p>At first, I thought maybe this Venice face covering was performance art, a wry commentary on alienation, dislocation, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">running away</emphasis>. But, no. It seems Ye just likes wearing masks these days. Behold some recent headlines: \"Kanye West Causes Terror with Strange Masks On His Last Trip.\" \"Kanye West Wears Creepy White Face Mask in NYC.\" \"Like a Scooby Doo Villain: Kanye West Wears BONKERS Mask to Mystery Michael Cohen Meeting.\"</p><p>While this meeting is definitely a mystery, a New York Post story - \"Kanye West Dons Bizarre Mask For Second Michael Cohen Meeting\" - attempted to explain why Ye looked like a Saks mannequin.</p><p>As Cohen told the paper: \"The purpose (of the mask) was so that people would not recognize him ... the first 10 minutes we sat down, he was mobbed by people ... who wanted photos, and to say hello. So he put on this mask to give him some anonymity, which interestingly enough, did not really work.\"</p><p>Gosh. That is interesting, Michael. You mean to tell me random passersby were even <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">more</emphasis> attracted to a patio table after noticing a former MAGA lieutenant was chatting up a cyborg in a designer bomber jacket? There were also photos this week of Ye in masks shuttling between airports. The imagery was strange. I gotta remove my shoes and belt before clearing security, but Ye gets to travel with a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fake Caucasian face</emphasis></p><p>But you know what? I think Ye might be laying the groundwork - or facework - for his greatest commercial success yet. And that's saying something. Connect the dots, people. Ye recently applied for a mask trademark. Now he's jetting across the Atlantic, looking like Benicio del Toro after a radical face lift? Maybe he's about to launch a new line of Halloween wear: Yeezy Pagan. Or maybe he realizes this pandemic has opened us to the possibility of wearing even <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">more</emphasis> identity-deleting masks.</p><p>Remember the first time you strapped on a mask during the pandemic? It felt like there was a sock on your elbow. Now this rigmarole feels totally normal. But instead of just reducing exposure to dangerous microbes, what if your mask could obscure who you are? Imagine slipping past neighbours to run errands. Or attending a Zoom family reunion and not having to say a word because nobody knows it's you and are too petrified to ask. I can't afford Yeezy sneakers. But I can hit up Dollarama to purchase a Ye Face Invisibility Cloak, especially if it grants me anonymity at the next staff meeting.</p><p>Did you see the image Ye shared on Monday of his new haircut? I don't know who did this, but it might have been a Black &amp; Decker test lab that dabbles in autonomous edge trimming. Or a drunk Ye handed the clippers to Stevie Wonder. It didn't look like a haircut, so much as a violent assault. There were geometric bald patches, skid marks, jagged lines. Have you ever seen satellite photos after a forest fire?</p><p>That's what Ye's head looked like. And ... <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">bingo.</emphasis></p><p>Everything Ye is doing now - going incognito while clinking java, butchering his songs, scaring toddlers in the pre-flight lounge, getting a haircut inspired by the placemat mazes at Denny's - is clearly a ploy to make gazillions more by selling masks to the masses. Ye realizes this pandemic has eaten away at our self-concepts.</p><p>Now Ye shall monetize the bedlam, one fake face at a time.</p><p>Vinay Menon is the Star's pop culture columnist based in Toronto.

(\"Romios Gold\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that is has acquired 140 single cell mining claims covering 2,753 hectares immediately along strike from Newmont's giant Musselwhite gold mine in NW Ontario (See Map 1).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The claims were acquired from Bounty Gold Corp. in return for a 2% NSR on those claims. Together with Romios' existing claims, the Markop Lake project now covers 5,920 Ha (14,628 acres) with potential for both Musselwhite-type gold mineralization as well as gold related to recently discovered Timiskaming-type geology similar to the Timmins camp.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HIGHLIGHTS: //st * The combined claim block now covers 14 km of an apparent basin-bounding</p><p>set of faults analogous to the Timiskaming-age basins that control much</p><p>of the gold mineralization in the Timmins, Kirkland Lake-Larder Lake and</p><p>numerous other major gold camps. * The new claims include the historic Karl Zeemel Zone 3 (KZ-3) situated</p><p>along the main Timiskaming-type fault. This prospect returned assays of</p><p>23.9 g/t Au over 0.33 m and a grab sample of 4.1 g/t Au in 1988. * Very little exploration work has been done in this area but a major</p><p>forest fire in 2011 has revealed numerous outcrops that have improved our</p><p>geological understanding of the area and researchers have now discovered</p><p>Timiskaming-age (~2690 million years) sedimentary and volcanic rocks</p><p>along this belt. These rocks are the same age as the mineralizing event</p><p>at the Musselwhite mine. * The terms of the sale include a two percent (2.0%) net smelter returns</p><p>royalty (NSR) in respect of the newly acquired claims, subject to the</p><p>right of Romios to buy-back a 1.0% NSR for CDN $0.5 million.</p><p>\"Amalgamating the Bounty Gold claims with Romios' exisiting claim block gives us more than a 14 km strike length of a Timiskaming-type basin target just 10 km from the world-class gold deposit at Musselwhite,\" stated John Biczok, P.Geo., VP of Exploration for Romios. \"Being able to trace the geology across the combined claims will be important in honing in on the most promising sections of these fault structures,\" he concluded.</p><p>\"It is very uncommon for greenstone belts to have only one economic gold deposit, usually where there is one there will be others, and Romios is the most active explorer in the North Caribou greenstone belt outside of Musselwhite's owner, Newmont Corporation,\" added Stephen Burega, President of Romios. \"In addition to our anchor Au-Cu project at Lundmark-Akow Lake, we now have a pipeline of exciting grass-roots projects like Markop Lake that are being advanced through low-cost basic geological mapping, prospecting and soil sampling. We are grateful to Bounty Gold for allowing us to add these new claims to our Markop Lake project and to create a significant land package in a great geological setting.\"</p><p>Map 1: General geology and claim holdings, Markop Lake Project</p><p>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/5376/113134_c\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/5376/113134_c</url></p><p>BACKGROUND</p><p>Many of the major gold deposits in the Canadian Shield are related to the development of fault-controlled basins that allowed deep-seated, gold-bearing fluids to rise up through the crust and deposit mineralization along these fault zones. This event took place &amp;#8804;2690 million years ago and is referred to as \"Timiskaming\" in age. Timiskaming-age rocks have become one of the holy grails geologists look for when exploring for gold in the Shield. The Markop Lake property is situated within one of three known packages of Timiskaming-type rocks along the major crustal boundary between the North Caribou Terrane and the Island Lake Domain, and the parallel Oxford-Stull Domain boundary: the other two sites each have former gold producers and one includes the advanced, )1.7 M Oz Monument BayAu-W project now controlled by Yamana Gold. The )7-million-ounce Musselwhite gold deposit is 10 km along strike to the NW of the Markop Lake claims.</p><p>Several encouraging geological features have been found on the current claims by geologists in recent years, including: //st * The southern boundary fault is marked by impressive fault-scarp breccias,</p><p>indicating that there was a major fault at this edge of the basin in the</p><p>past. * The northern boundary fault lies along the extension of the</p><p>mafic-ultramafic rocks that host the mineralized iron formations at the</p><p>nearby Musselwhite mine and Karl Zeemel deposit, and several gold zones</p><p>are known along this feature, including the KZ-3 prospect on the newly</p><p>acquired claims. * Alkalic mafic volcanics are located in the northern part of the claims.</p><p>These are important components of the Timiskaming model and point to</p><p>deep-seated alkalic magmatism during basin formation. We are unaware of</p><p>any such rocks elsewhere in this greenstone belt.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>The technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by John Biczok, P.

Gavin Newsom for international help with the crisis.</p><p>The crews, accompanied by three senior supervisors, arrived in the state Thursday after a day-long briefing in Idaho, said Marc Mousseau of the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. </p><p>The Canadians will be assigned to the North Complex cluster of lightning-sparked fires, which have burned more than 23,000 hectares in northeastern California so far and are only about 37 per cent contained.</p><p>The firefighters have arrived just in time for what the U.S. National Weather Service is predicting will be a fearsome few days of searing heat across the southwestern part of the country - an extreme event that could prove even hotter than the stretch of August that triggered the current fires.</p><p>\"Some locations may record values upwards of 20 to 25 degrees (F) higher than normal for this time of the year,\" the service warned in an advisory Friday. \"Temperatures overnight are not likely to cool off much, and given the very dry airmass in place, this greatly increases the risk for the spread of wildfires.\"</p><p>Forecasters are bracing for a weekend of record highs - temperatures approaching 46 C - in a state that just last month registered a blistering 54 C record in Death Valley, believed to be the highest temperature recorded on Earth in the last 90 years.</p><p>Newsom thanked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the help when the pair spoke by phone Thursday, according to a readout of the call from the Prime Minister's Office.</p><p>\"The prime minister offered his condolences to Gov. Newsom for the loss of life and devastation resulting from the wildfires throughout the state,\" the statement said.</p><p>\"They also discussed the importance of protecting the environment and fighting climate change, noting in particular its effects on more acute wildfire seasons.\"</p><p>In California, the battle against devastating wildfires has become almost an annual ritual. More than 875 fires, most fuelled by lightning strikes, tinder-dry conditions and blazing heat, have displaced tens of thousands of residents and consumed more than 600,000 hectares so far this year - an area larger than Prince Edward Island.</p><p>Two of the fires currently active in the state are the second- and third-largest fires in California history.</p><p>Canada likely won't be providing any additional assistance unless more help is requested, Mousseau said.</p><p>\"At the time of the request from the United States Forest Service, these were the personnel identified as available for deployment,\" he said. </p><p>\"If there are any additional requests from the U.S. Forest Service, CIFFC will canvas the Canadian agencies at that time.

The heavy downpour mixed with melting snow, leading to flooding. While the full extent of what factors allowed the emergency to unfold is not yet known, it is expected wildfires that burned healthy forests contributed by reducing vegetation that could absorb moisture. </p><p>\u201cYou can see in the Okanagan the effects of the fire would create very permeable areas, and then there are other places where the ash has fallen,\u201d said Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) meteorologist Mindy Brugman. </p><p>Ash settling on the forest floor can impact the watershed by affecting how much moisture can evaporate. Wildfires also, of course, burn trees, meaning the roots are not absorbing moisture the way they previously did. </p><p>Wildfires \u201ckind of change the hydrology of the whole network,\u201d Brugman said. </p><p>Those tree roots also help reinforce the soil, and when damaged, landslides become more common. Landslides can dam rivers and exacerbate flooding. In other words, what B.C. is experiencing is a lethal mix of cascading climate impacts. </p><p>\u201cWe're on the edge of a big increase in these [storms],\u201d said Brugman. \u201cSome areas will get incredible amounts, particularly the Arctic and our West Coast, but even more so if you look at the East Coast like Halifax and even Ottawa,\u201d she said. </p><p>Brugman described modelling from ECCC based on 3 C warming that predicts an increase in the frequency and severity of storms, particularly in the Arctic where the loss of sea ice is expected to lead to unprecedented Category 5 storms by 2080 that could last for more than a week. </p><p>\u201cThe same general rise in atmospheric temperature that allows for extreme heat in the summer also creates the capacity for the air to hold more water vapour that leads to these kinds of destructive atmospheric rivers and heavy rain events,\u201d said climate advocacy group 350\u2019s Cam Fenton. </p><p>\u201cLiterally the same places have been impacted \u2026 by these two ends of the climate emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cThis summer the highway was closed, flames were jumping across the highway, and then [Monday], the rising water actually washed away and shut down that highway again.\u201d </p><p>The Canadian Forces told Canada\u2019s National Observer that 311 people were rescued from vehicles on the highway Monday after being stranded by landslides. That rescue mission is over while the RCMP takes up the search for people who still need help. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Forces confirmed B.C. has not requested further assistance. </p><p>Thousands of people were evacuated from Merritt and Princeton on Monday as the communities were submerged. Those communities are in Conservative environment critic Dan Albas\u2019s federal riding, who said the extensive damage was made worse by inadequate water and sewage infrastructure. </p><p>\u201cWhat we're seeing here is that the extremity of the situation was worsened because of the forest fire situation, and has led to much of the damage that we've seen here,\u201d Albas said. </p><p>Albas said the first priority is making sure everyone is safe and supporting those displaced, but the province should undergo a review of its emergency preparedness. Further, Albas says the province needs to lead in an emergency like this. </p><p>\u201cOne of the challenges is that you have a series of localized crises that are being managed by municipalities; but the province does need to take the lead, in my perspective,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cThe province is the one that has many emergency powers \u2026 it can request further assistance from the federal government. [Emergency Preparedness] Minister [Bill] Blair made it very clear to me that he's offered every support, and the province just needs to ask. </p><p>\u201cSo the province needs to do an assessment of what's required and take that leadership role we know we need,\u201d he said. </p><p>Albas also said that with key infrastructure damaged, issues around supply chains will be ongoing. </p><p>At a press conference Tuesday, B.C.\u2019s Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth said after any extreme weather event, the province will undertake a review. When asked if the province should have taken further steps to warn people about the emergency, Farnworth said alerting took place locally, and there was plenty of warning \u201cout on the media.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat we saw was an absolutely unprecedented deluge like we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cObviously after any event such as this, the province assesses what [happened] and lessons [are] learned for the future.\u201d </p><p>NDP emergency preparedness critic Richard Cannings said the federal government should put more money into its disaster mitigation and adaptation fund. That fund was launched in 2018 with an investment of $2 billion over 10 years. Budget 2021 added $1.375 billion over 12 years, with about 10 per cent of that extra amount earmarked for Indigenous recipients. </p><p>Cannings said there isn\u2019t enough money on the table to help communities devastated by extreme weather, let alone enough to help communities prepare. </p><p>\u201cIf you're saying, 'I want $20 million to [prepare] our community so it doesn't get flooded,' you're at the bottom of the pile when there's a line ahead of you of communities that are trying to rebuild, [and] they're obviously a higher priority,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cSo I think we have to really look at climate adaptation seriously and give it the attention \u2014 and most importantly, the funding \u2014 that it needs. </p><p>\u201cLet's not wait for towns to be destroyed before we give them money,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u200b</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-f43b5052ea4f4a13a94fbdd2b0fb51a2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:643T-CST1-JBVR-303W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"962\"/><timeReceived>12:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 17, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

There has been a small reprieve, though, in the last few days. Heavy rain is helping firefighters for the moment. Tonight reinforcements arrived. CTV's Annie Bergeron-Oliver at Melbourne International Airport. Annie?</p><p>ANNIE BERGERON-OLIVER (Reporter): Lisa, people were clapping as the Canadian and American fire specialists landed here in Melbourne. They bring a wealth of expertise that will help the exhausted Australian firefighters battle blazes across the country that have now claimed an area roughly twice the size of Nova Scotia. Now 28 Canadians are here in the state of Victoria for the next month. They won't be deep in the forests, but instead they'll be part of the state's emergency response team, helping in specialized fields from aviation, to fire protection, fire behavioral analysis, and some will also be managing crews of hundreds of firefighters.</p><p>JONATHAN SCOTT (Ontario Fire Information Officer): It's just really great to assist the Australians with the forest fire situation that's going on here. It's unprecedented bush fire season so it's great we can come help out.</p><p>CHRIS STEPHENSON (Victoria Fire Deputy Commissioner): We are so appreciative of this support. As I said, they seamlessly integrate with our teams, they're great people, they're here for the right reasons, they're only here to help.</p><p>BERGERON-OLIVER: Next week a group of 40 Canadian firefighters will arrive here in Australia, and they will be deployed to the frontlines. Now, rain over the last few days has helped combat these fires, allowing firefighters to get on the offensive, but the hottest days of the summer here in the southern hemisphere, Lisa, are not over, meaning neither is the threat.</p><p>LAFLAMME: All right, Annie Bergeron-Oliver, thank you for this tonight from Melbourne airport. Time for a two-minute break, but when we come back, unyielding questions over an unsolved murder. A new look at a cold case 50 years later. Plus, an historic rendition of O' Canada at an NHL rink.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y19-JM81-JCF0-K00S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"353\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 CTV Televisions, Inc.

Most people are more than happy to clean up after themselves,\" Blake said.</p><p>\"Some will say yes because we're there and then leave without picking up their mess.

Blake said this is because those places are forested enough to provide the solitude the backcountry gives without having to drive out of town for very long.</p><p>But unattended fires in those areas can become dangerous as they are close to residential areas.</p><p>\"We just don't want another situation like what's going on in Penticton, where the wind's going to pick up and we're going to have a forest fire in our backcountry,\" he said.</p><p>The Christie Mountain wildfire, which was discovered on Aug. 18, forced the evacuation of more than 300 homes.</p><p>\"Not to mention, there are a lot of homes in those areas. Postill, there are a lot of homes in that area. Beaver Lake Road, there is a lodge, there are numerous lodges up there and people living in them year-round,\" said Blake.</p><p>He also had a word for those who are planning to venture out to local backcountry areas over the long weekend.</p><p>\"It'd be great if people use the bush responsibly.

Most people are more than happy to clean up after themselves,\" Blake said.</p><p>\"Some will say yes because we're there and then leave without picking up their mess. But we're in fire season, and we're known for our fires now&amp;#x26;#8230; and we're trying to prevent more forest fires from happening.\"</p><p>But when people aren't mindful and leave not only their trash but also smouldering fires, then it doesn't help the situation, Blake said.</p><p>Most of those unattended fires tend to be in areas where a lot of illegal dumping happens: Postill, Beaver Lake, and Gillard. Blake said this is because those places are forested enough to provide the solitude the backcountry gives without having to drive out of town for very long.</p><p>But unattended fires in those areas can become dangerous as they are close to residential areas.</p><p>\"We just don't want another situation like what's going on in Penticton, where the wind's going to pick up and we're going to have a forest fire in our backcountry,\" he said.</p><p>The Christie Mountain wildfire, which was discovered on Aug. 18, forced the evacuation of more than 300 homes.</p><p>\"Not to mention, there are a lot of homes in those areas. Postill, there are a lot of homes in that area. Beaver Lake Road, there is a lodge, there are numerous lodges up there and people living in them year-round,\" said Blake.</p><p>He also had a word for those who are planning to venture out to local backcountry areas over the long weekend.</p><p>\"It'd be great if people use the bush responsibly. If you're going to be in the bush, please be responsible, don't leave your garbage and don't have raging fires right now.\"</p><p>READ: Hidden cameras in Okanagan forests catch illegal dumpers, lead to fines</p><p>READ: Abandoned camper, car, truck left in Okanagan forest</p><p>Twila AmatoVideo journalist, Black Press Okanagan</p><p>Email me at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:twila.amato@blackpress.caFollow\">twila.amato@blackpress.caFollow</email> me on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KLOWNA-4043228</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KLOWNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RB-K9G1-JDH1-C4HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"434\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kelowna Capital News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 31, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DNAA</classCode><className>ILLEGAL DUMPING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFMY</classCode><className>ABANDONED VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DNAA</classCode><className>ILLEGAL DUMPING</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It comes a day after communities several miles south of the lake had abruptly been ordered evacuated as the Caldor Fire raged nearby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">South Lake Tahoe's main medical facility, Barton Memorial Hospital, proactively evacuated 36 patients needing skilled nursing and 16 in acute care beds Sunday, sending them to regional facilities far from the fire, public information officer Mindi Befu said. The rest of the hospital was evacuating following Monday's expanded orders.</p><p>South Lake Tahoe Mayor Tamara Wallace was among those leaving ahead of an evacuation order. She and her husband are taking their dogs and items given to them from their deceased parent \u2014 objects that can't be replaced.</p><p>Wallace did not think the Caldor Fire would come so close. Fires in the past did not spread so rapidly near the resort city of 22,000 people.</p><p>\"It's just yet another example of how wildfires have changed over the years,\" she said. \"It's just a culmination of 14 to 18 more years of dead trees, the droughts we've had since then, those kinds of things.\"</p><p>The region is facing a warning from the National Weather Service about critical fire weather Monday through Tuesday.</p><p>The fire destroyed multiple homes Sunday along Highway 50, one of the main routes to the south end of the lake. The fire also roared through the Sierra-at-Tahoe ski resort, destroying some buildings but leaving the main buildings at the base intact.</p><p>\"Today's been a rough day, and there's no bones about it,\" Jeff Marsolais, forest supervisor for El Dorado National Forest, said Sunday. A few days ago, he had thought crews could halt the Caldor Fire's eastern progress, but \"it let loose.\"</p><p>Flames churned through mountains just a few miles southwest of the Tahoe Basin, where thick smoke sent tourists packing at a time when summer vacations would usually be in full swing ahead of the Labor Day weekend.</p><p>\"To put it in perspective, we've been seeing about a half-mile of movement on the fire's perimeter each day for the last couple of weeks, and today, this has already moved at 2.5 miles on us, with no sign that it's starting to slow down,\" said Erich Schwab, division chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</p><p>The Caldor Fire has scorched nearly 277 square miles (717 square kilometers) since breaking out Aug. 14. After the weekend's fierce burning, containment dropped from 19% to 14%. More than 600 structures have been destroyed, and at least 20,000 more were threatened.</p><p>It's among nearly 90 large blazes in the U.S. Many are in the West, burning trees and brush sucked dry by drought. Climate change has made the region warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more destructive, according to scientists.</p><p>In California alone, more than a dozen large fires are being fought by more than 15,200 firefighters. Flames have destroyed about 2,000 buildings and forced thousands to evacuate this year while blanketing large swaths of the West in unhealthy smoke.</p><p>In Southern California, a section of Interstate 15 closed Sunday after winds pushed a new blaze, the Railroad Fire, across lanes in the Cajon Pass northeast of Los Angeles.</p><p>Farther south, evacuation orders and warnings were in place for remote communities after a wildfire ignited and spread quickly through the Cleveland National Forest on Saturday. A firefighter received minor injuries, and two structures were destroyed in the 2.3-square-mile (5.9-square-kilometer) Chaparral Fire burning along the border of San Diego and Riverside counties, according to Cal Fire. It was 13% contained Monday.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Dixie Fire, the second-largest in state history at 1,205 square miles (3,121 square kilometers), was nearly halfway contained about 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of the Lake Tahoe-area blaze. Nearly 700 homes were among almost 1,300 buildings that have been destroyed since the Dixie Fire began in early July.</p><p>Containment increased to 26% on the French Fire, which covered nearly 40 square miles (104 square kilometers) in the southern Sierra Nevada. Crews protected forest homes on the west side of Lake Isabella, a popular recreation area northeast of Bakersfield.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Defense is sending 200 Army soldiers from Washington state to help firefighters in Northern California, the U.S. Army North said in a statement Saturday. Eight Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve C-130 aircraft capable of dropping thousands of gallons of fire retardant also have been sent to fight wildfires in the West.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Janie Har contributed from San Francisco.</p><p>___</p><p>Noah Berger, The Associated Press</p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20210830PAB4206188</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63GT-7911-F0HF-83PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Group Ltd.

It comes a day after communities several miles south of the lake had abruptly been ordered evacuated as the Caldor Fire raged nearby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">South Lake Tahoe's main medical facility, Barton Memorial Hospital, proactively evacuated 36 patients needing skilled nursing and 16 in acute care beds Sunday, sending them to regional facilities far from the fire, public information officer Mindi Befu said. The rest of the hospital was evacuating following Monday's expanded orders.</p><p>South Lake Tahoe Mayor Tamara Wallace was among those leaving ahead of an evacuation order. She and her husband are taking their dogs and items given to them from their deceased parent &amp; - objects that can't be replaced.</p><p>Wallace did not think the Caldor Fire would come so close. Fires in the past did not spread so rapidly near the resort city of 22,000 people.</p><p>\"It's just yet another example of how wildfires have changed over the years,\" she said. \"It's just a culmination of 14 to 18 more years of dead trees, the droughts we've had since then, those kinds of things.\"</p><p>The region is facing a warning from the National Weather Service about critical fire weather Monday through Tuesday.</p><p>The fire destroyed multiple homes Sunday along Highway 50, one of the main routes to the south end of the lake. The fire also roared through the Sierra-at-Tahoe ski resort, destroying some buildings but leaving the main buildings at the base intact.</p><p>\"Today's been a rough day, and there's no bones about it,\" Jeff Marsolais, forest supervisor for El Dorado National Forest, said Sunday. A few days ago, he had thought crews could halt the Caldor Fire's eastern progress, but \"it let loose.\"</p><p>Flames churned through mountains just a few miles southwest of the Tahoe Basin, where thick smoke sent tourists packing at a time when summer vacations would usually be in full swing ahead of the Labor Day weekend.</p><p>\"To put it in perspective, we've been seeing about a half-mile of movement on the fire's perimeter each day for the last couple of weeks, and today, this has already moved at 2.5 miles on us, with no sign that it's starting to slow down,\" said Erich Schwab, division chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</p><p>The Caldor Fire has scorched nearly 277 square miles (717 square kilometers) since breaking out Aug. 14. After the weekend's fierce burning, containment dropped from 19% to 14%. More than 600 structures have been destroyed, and at least 20,000 more were threatened.</p><p>It's among nearly 90 large blazes in the U.S. Many are in the West, burning trees and brush sucked dry by drought. Climate change has made the region warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more destructive, according to scientists.</p><p>In California alone, more than a dozen large fires are being fought by more than 15,200 firefighters.

These can quickly turn into a fast-moving brush or forest fire. It's important for everyone to follow the rules and use extra caution, especially during dry conditions.</p><p>Here's how to prepare and care for a recreational fire and the people around it:Do not light a fire or keep it burning in windy conditions. The wind may carry embers and spread the fire.Beach fires are not allowed on parkland or private property (other than your own).Always light beach fires below the high tide line.Recreational fires must not exceed 24 inches (60 centimetres) in diameter.Maintain a fireguard around the fire &amp;#x26;#8211; a fuel-free area where all flammable materials (grass, kindling, driftwood, etc.) have been removed.Never leave a fire unattended.Be cautious when supervising kids near the fire. Teach kids how to stop, drop and roll if their clothing should catch fire.Keep a bucket of water nearby for extinguishing the fire.Make sure the fire is completely extinguished and the ashes are cold to the touch before leaving the area. An abandoned fire can become a dangerous and fast-moving blaze.</p><p>Report abandoned fires by calling the fire department's non-emergency line at 250-286-6266. If it is an emergency, dial 9-1-1.</p><p>Although recreational fires are currently permitted, during dry, hot conditions the Campbell River Fire Department may restrict or ban them. Always check local and provincial fire restrictions before lighting any fire.</p><p>For more information on fire safety visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.campbellriver.ca/fire\">www.campbellriver.ca/fire</url>.

Interior led him to focus on forest industry to find specialized solutions.</p><p>\"We collaborated with the integrated remote sensing lab at UBC to start to answer some questions such as, can we use drones to assess forest inventory throughout the harvest cycle?\" Wilcox said.\"Can we identify early infestation or burn severity? Can we accurately measure wood inventory at pulp mills, sawmills and pellet plants?\"</p><p>Travelling to B.C.'s forest industry competitors in Scandinavia and the southeastern U.S. showed the need for B.C. to innovate or fall behind. FYBR Inc. is currently managing inventory for 50 mills in North America, and processing thousands of hectares of forest imagery each month. And with travel and in-person meetings restricted, the technology found new uses like meeting governments' increasing demand for environmental reporting.</p><p>\"Digitizing the forest or mill and bringing it to a virtual boardroom has been incredibly powerful, especially during this pandemic when we can't all physically be in the same room,\" he said. \"We saw older, experienced foresters using this information to share wisdom with younger, tech-savvy foresters who were keen to take on the role of drone pilots. We saw industry working with government to adopt a new technology and a new process to improve fibre utilization and reporting.\"</p><p>RELATED: B.C.'s low-carbon plan depends on faster industry permits</p><p>RELATED: Pinnacle extends Japan wood pellet deal with Mitsubishi</p><p>For the B.C. government, maintaining inventory of the vast Crown lands of B.C.'s Interior and Coast has long been a challenge. The forests ministry needs to not only monitor harvest licences and watershed protection, but measure the extent of forest fire damage to replant forests.</p><p>At a separate panel with B.C. cabinet ministers Jan. 28, Forests Minister Katrine Conroy said B.C. planted a record 300 million trees in 2020. \"They did it without a single COVID outbreak in any of their camps, which is pretty incredible,\" Conroy said.</p><p>The federal government has made a further commitment to tree planting, although there hasn't been a federal budget in more than a year to dedicate funds to a plan that also extends to urban areas.</p><p>A Seattle company called DroneSeed is using large drones to drop what it calls \"seed vessels\" on burned areas of forest, but it isn't as good as boots on the ground setting seedlings by hand.</p><p>@tomfletcherbc</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tfletcher@blackpress.ca\">tfletcher@blackpress.ca</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on</p><p>\"<url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/BlackPressMedia\">http://twitter.com/BlackPressMedia</url>\" Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20210129PAB4109117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61X5-2WM1-JD2C-J2FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"638\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Group Ltd.

Art's Scout Troop formed an honour guard when Art and Cora married on a sweltering August 18th in 1956. Many family adventures and much laughterfollowed. In 1964 the family moved to Vancouver while Art obtained a Bachelor of Education in Industrial Arts from UBC, then in 1966 to Qualicum Beach to raise the family. Art barged a house from Vancouver when a suitable home was hard to find. Then when Cora found the perfect lot, he designed and did the finishing work on a new family home.</p><p>Teaching woodwork and drafting brought Art to Qualicum Beach, and in early days at Qualicum High, Art sponsored a Christian Fellowship group and walked to and from work, prompting one student to ask if he owned a car. He took a Vice-Principal position at Parksville Junior High before returning to the classroom at a new Ballenas Secondary, then to the new Kwalikum Secondary before retiring in 1988. Art took a genuine interest in his students, leading to some lifelong friendships. Colleagues commented, for many years after his retirement, on Art's lunchtime show of peeling his daily apple in one continuous length, a skill his children also were delighted by. Art described himself as a \"would-be\"gardener. He was inspired by friendly contests with colleagues while reaping the economic and health benefits of homegrown fruit and vegetables.</p><p>Art's interest in the community saw him elected in 1975 for a twoyear term as Aiderman. Elected as Mayor in 1977, he was acclaimed in subsequent elections until he stepped down in 1990 to travel. As Mayor, he represented Qualicum Beach on the Regional District Board, initiated the first Official Community Plan, and was involved in the acquisition of the Memorial Golf Course and Lot 10. He supported The Old School House from its inception, serving as president and even painting the entire building one summer using his bucket truck. He participated in Citizens on Patrol for 15 years. Art served as president of Qualicum Beach Historical and Museum Society for 11 years, had a role in the early days of the lawn bowling facility, and was integral in starting the Parksville-Qualicum Beach Community Foundation. A highlight as Mayor was welcoming the Queen and Prince Philip to Qualicum Beach on their unofficial visit to the Milner Estate in 1987. He was pleased and proud for his youngest daughter Anne to follow in his political footsteps.</p><p>Art's faith led him to life-long service in his church. He was a Sunday School teacher, and an Elder, served on the Board, and sang in the Choir, and when St. Stephen's added a hall, he built the new tall windows to match the church. He worked diligently for Moorecroft United Church camp on the management board for over 20 years and acted as a cabin leader and director of boys'and backpack camps and later at Keen Ager camps. He was Groundskeeper for one summer and supplied much manual labour over the years, building and repairing everything from wooden rowing and sailing boats to painting old school buses.</p><p>Art led his family on too many adventures to tell all. Still, some included:hikes up Mt. Arrowsmith to the Rosseau chalet he had helped to build, trips to Expo 67 in Montreal and Disneyland, and a tour of BC, all with the family of seven in a 16 foot-trailer. Later, over 2 years, Art and Cora crossed Canada in their 5th wheel, stopping at small-town churches and friends'homes, then back across the USA. Art would be found in the summertime at Sproat Lake, spending happy family days on property he purchased at age 25. Art's family will continue to gather there to boat, swim, and sing songs around a campfire. The family also will continue Art's tradition of singing grace when gathered.</p><p>Art's lifelong passion was building things with his hands. He maintained a home woodworking shop, built furniture including beds, redwood tables and chairs, buffets, desks, and later hand-turned burl bowls, candle sticks, and plates under the Beachland Woodcraft brand. For recreation, he made swings, paddle boards, paddlesand, most of all, boats -5 wooden boats in total. As well he maintained or rebuilt 8 wooden boats. This included The Swan, which after laying almost 50 years in the coldest water of Sproat Lake, was raised in 2004 with the work of accomplished volunteers. The hull received fresh ribs, planks, and coach house, and a used steam engine and a new wood-fired boiler were installed. Art's great joy was blowing the steam whistle while cruising the Lake. The Swan, later donated, can be viewed at the Maritime Museum in Port Alberni. Art's appreciation of telling a good story led him to collaborations on several books of local history:Great Central Lake's When the Whistle Blew, Sproat Lake Reflections, and his memoir, Mr. Qualicum.</p><p>In 1995, Art and Cora were named the Qualicum Beach Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year in recognition of their \"outstanding contribution to community\". Rotary acknowledged Art's work in the community awarding him with the Paul Harris Fellowship in 2001. In 2008 Art received the BC Community Achievement Award from the Premierand Lieutenant Governor at Government House. 2011 saw Art honoured with Freeman of the Town of Qualicum Beach, and in 2012 he was awarded the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal. Art said, \"As a Christian, I believed it was right to serve my community.\"Also in 2012, he was the recipient of the Qualicum Beach Chamber of Commerce-Coastal Credit Union Lifetime Achievement Award.</p><p>Art was a man of integrity, vision, humour, and strength.</p><p>He loved us all so well and we are all so proud of him.</p><p>He will be greatly missed.</p><p>Celebration of Life for family, friends, and community on Saturday, April 15,2023, at 1 pm at the Qualicum Beach Civic Centre.</p><p>In lieu of flowers please consider a donation to the Society of Organized Services or Arrowsmith Search &amp; Rescue Society.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AVLNWS-news20230125PPFA0003299897</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AVLNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67D8-G621-JD2C-J1BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4117\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Columns of smoke also billowed from the nearby Nk'Mip Creek wildfire that happened at the same time last summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The winery itself was not physically damaged by the blaze. But smoke from the colossal fires blanketed the sky and travelled over swathes of land, seeping into the grapes of many vineyards in the Okanagan Valley, one of British Columbia's top-producing wine regions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The smoky air was enough to alter Misson's red grapes, which he suspects were exposed during a specific ripening stage - known as veraison - that made them more vulnerable to smoke damage than his white grapes, which were unharmed.</p><p>\"Fifty per cent of my volume - basically 100 per cent of my reds - have been affected by smoke. We were getting hit from lefts and rights and upper cuts. It was a combination of all the surrounding wildfires, I think,\" Misson said. \"The grapes are not heavily contaminated, but the impact is definitely there and we're trying to see if we can fix it.\"</p><p>\"We've talked about the option of just not bottling it this year ... the last thing I want to do is a release of a less than adequate wine.\"</p><p>It has been a difficult year for B.C. wine producers after record-breaking summer temperatures and smoke taint from wildfires took a toll on the $2.8 billion industry, with average yields estimated to be down by 30 per cent due to extreme weather conditions, according to Wine Growers British Columbia. The Okanagan Valley, nicknamed the \"Smokanagan\" because of increasing wildfires in the area, in south-central B.C., is home to more than 85 per cent of the province's 284 grape wineries.</p><p>The 2021 wildfire season in B.C. was the third worst on record in terms of area burned, and the town of Lytton broke Canadian heat records with temperatures peaking at a scorching 49.6 C. Climate change and extreme weather patterns exacerbate the frequency and intensity of wildfires, driven by decreased rainfall, higher temperatures, lower humidity and increased wind speeds. Global wildfires are expected to increase by 14 per cent by 2030, 30 per cent in 2050, and 50 per cent by the end of this century, the United Nations said in February.</p><p>A hint of smokiness in wine can be deemed desirable. Some effects from smoke can go undetected and even give similar flavour characteristics as wine aged in oak. But when wine is smoke-tainted, an extreme result of smoke impact, the flavour is often compared to that of an ashtray. Most tainted wines are unsellable.</p><p>Smoke taint occurs when volatile phenols, a class of airborne molecules present in wildfire smoke, are absorbed into grape skins and vine leaves. In an attempt to get rid of them, enzymes in the grape bind the volatile phenols with sugar molecules to form new compounds, which are precursors to possibly undesirable smoky flavours.</p><p>But the extremely tricky part for wine producers is that these unpleasant flavours and odours only become apparent and are detected after fermentation, when yeast is added to the grape, and after wineries have invested money and time to harvest and ferment tonnes of grapes that initially smell perfectly fine.</p><p>Misson's winery is not the only one to have been hit by extreme heat and climate conditions this past year. Another Okanagan winery, Blue Mountain Vineyard and Cellars also located in Okanagan Falls, announced in April that its grapes were contaminated by smoke from the Thomas Creek Wildfire and would not be bottling its 2021 vintage.</p><p>\"While attempts to mitigate the impact of the contamination were tried, the results did not meet the winery's quality standards,\" the winery said in a statement. \"We made the very difficult decision not to bottle the 2021 vintage simply because we were not willing to compromise the reputation.\"</p><p>Smoke taint from wildfires is a global phenomenon and has had crushing impacts on wineries around the world including in Australia and California, which have had record-breaking wildfire seasons in recent years. Wine Australia estimated that the cost of smoke taint following the 2003 wildfires was $300 million in lost revenue.</p><p>Wine Growers British Columbia</p><p>spokesperson Laura Kittmer said there is a silver lining to the smaller yields and extreme heat.</p><p>\"Less wine was produced in 2021, but what we are seeing is the wine that was produced is very high quality with intense flavours,\" Kittmer said. Wine Growers British Columbia said in an email that there is no data suggesting there will be a significant increase in the price of wine due to 2021\u2019s decreased yield.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mitigating the damage</emphasis></p><p>Wesley Zandberg, an analytical chemist at the University of British Columbia's Okanagan campus, says smoke poses a massive threat to B.C.'s wine industry.</p><p>Zandberg studies smoke taint and ways to prevent smoke molecules from getting into the grapes in the first place. The concentration of contamination from volatile phenols he's watching out for is measured in amounts as little as just 10 parts per billion.</p><p>\"So a teaspoon of smoky aroma in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Some volatile phenols are really pungent, it's astonishingly low concentrations,\" Zandberg said.</p><p>Zandberg and a team of students in his laboratory have been spearheading research on smoke taint since 2015. Grapes are typically most vulnerable in the week or two following the period of veraison when the grape skin softens and changes colour.</p><p>\"It's important to stress that smoke taint is not guaranteed every time you have smoke exposure,\" Zandberg said.</p><p>He has been experimenting with different agricultural sprays, coating grapes that are placed inside tents filled with smoke from burned pine needles, local soil and bark, simulating the effects of a forest fire on B.C. vineyards. This summer, Zandberg hopes to continue evaluating already approved agricultural sprays to protect grapes, but said the use of the products is complicated.</p><p>\"Sprays could be coating the grape in a way that's protective so the smoke can't get in. But on the flip side, you could be making the grapes stickier and the taint worse,\" Zandberg said.</p><p>Ross Wise, chair of the British Columbia Wine Grape Council, said the industry is learning to adapt and that labs that test for smoke taint have been busier than usual, \"probably out of an abundance of caution.\"</p><p>\"We can get our grapes tested before we harvest, so we get a good picture of whether there's smoke impact on our wine. Then we can make decisions on whether we pick the grapes at all or whether we can hand harvest them,\" Wise said.</p><p>Wise, who is also a winemaker at Black Hills Estate winery in Oliver, which was under an evacuation alert during the wildfires last summer, said hand harvesting was a good way to mitigate smoke impact.</p><p>\"By hand harvesting grapes you enable the juice to stay out of contact with the skin of the grape for longer. Then you have the option of pressing the grape immediately when it gets to the winery,\" Wise said.</p><p>\"If you limit that contact time, it limits the potential to pick up smoke from the skin of the grapes, whereas machine harvest breaks the skin, so you have a bit more contact of the juice with the skin.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impact on tourism</emphasis></p><p>Wineries in the area whose grapes were not impacted by smoke taint did not get away from the devastating wildfire season scot-free.</p><p>Breanna Nathorst, spokesperson for Grizzli Winery in Kelowna, said the winery witnessed an 80 per cent decrease in traffic last summer because of smoke, despite being out of the way of ignited forests.</p><p>\"Being a winery and in the tourism industry, you have to think a lot about international and non-local tourism,\" Nathorst said. \"We've had to update all of our offerings and experience to focus on our local neighbourhood because our non-local guests won't visit if there's smoke.\"</p><p>The business model of the winery has been adjusted to include farmers' markets and an outdoor cinema so locals can set up picnics and enjoy food on the weekends.</p><p>\"With all the cancellations, we really had to adapt quickly,\" Nathorst said.</p><p>Montekarn's Misson has also had to adjust. His smoke-affected red grapes are undergoing a treatment of activated carbon, which can neutralize undesirable flavours. He's optimistic that it will work, but has resigned himself to the possibility that he might not be bottling a red vintage this year.</p><p>\"It's just the reality of where we're living at this particular time on the planet. It's getting warmer, there's no doubt about it,\" Misson said.</p><p>\"It is what it is and there's nothing I can do to change it.\"</p><p>Ghada Alsharif is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star.

She had seen smoke while driving south along Highway 19, near the Little Qualicum bridge. RCMP have yet to confirm the 911 call.</p><p>In the most recent Point-in-Time Homeless Count 2018, presented by the Oceanside Task Force on Homelessness, only 42 people were identified as experiencing homelessness in the Parksville Qualicum Beach area. A total of 57 per cent of that count had been homeless for one year or more, while 43 per cent had been homeless for less than one year.</p><p>Auren Ruvinsky, co-ordinator of the Oceanside Task Force on Homelessness, said \"it's important to keep in mind that these figures are only of people coming forward and identifying themselves.\"</p><p>Regional District of Nanaimo Electoral Area F (Coombs, Hilliers, Errington, Whiskey Creek, Meadowood) director Leanne Salter said \"there are a lot of people living here, you just can't see them. Lots of people living in the bush. And they span the area from under the overpass by the ramp, and all the way up.\"</p><p>Salter said an estimate of 300 people experiencing homelessness along the Melrose Road area in Whiskey Creek seemed accurate.</p><p>READ MORE: Mobile forensic unit remains in Whiskey Creek following discovery of 3 dead bodies</p><p>\"We have a lot of people living in RVs out there. That's probably not as bad as people living rough with nothing.\"</p><p>On Saturday night, Oct. 31, residents close to the gravel pit on Melrose Road said they had heard gunshots and several loud explosions that night, followed by the smell of burning plastic. Many dismissed the idea of foul play because it was Halloween night, and fireworks were rampant.</p><p>Salter stated that the RDN does not get complaints from the surrounding Whiskey Creek area about people \"living it rough.\" She believes that part of the reason there is a homeless community in that area is because they're not being \"pushed out,\" which tends to happen in more populated areas.</p><p>The other part, she said, comes down to an over-arching health issue.</p><p>\"If you're a sick person and you need medical care, you need medical care. You don't need to be put into a house with kind people with big hearts that care about you, but can't take care of your medical issue because they're not trained to do that.\"</p><p>Her guess is that it's cheaper to build housing for people experiencing homelessness, than it is to provide them with the medical help they need.</p><p>\"And with COVID, its even more exacerbated. What little services, and they were minimal, that were in place prior to COVID, are not even available now.\"</p><p>Cpl. Chris Manseau, RCMP division media relations officer, said there is nothing new to release regarding the bodies found, the gunshot victim or any potential suspects at large.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mandy.moraes@pqbnews.com\">mandy.moraes@pqbnews.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter&amp;#160;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PARKQB-4072211</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PARKQB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6176-W4V1-JDH1-C2TJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438316</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"512\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Parksville Qualicum Beach</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 5, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000863</classCode><className>HOMELESSNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>ST0009EVK</classCode><className>MEDICINE &amp; HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009ZGJ</classCode><className>ELECTORAL DISTRICTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST0009XRV</classCode><className>HALLOWEEN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000754</classCode><className>FORENSICS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DN62</classCode><className>FIREWORKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Backed by his life's savings, local man Brad Sullivan set out to prove them wrong, surprising himself and others with his resounding success. A discovery he estimates to be 400 feet long and 10 feet thick in places was discovered after only two months of searching. \"There's been people going up for 15 years for rhodonite, and they only found little pieces,\" he said. He'd gone out bear hunting with a friend when he discovered the area, west of Youbou.\"</p><p>I wonder whatever became of that?</p><p>25 years ago</p><p>\"Armed robber escapes\" was certainly a headline that grabbed some attention on the front of the Oct. 30, 1996 edition of the Lake News.</p><p>\"A lone robber who help up the Royal Bank in Lake Cowichan Saturday escaped with only a small amount of cash. Despite hasty police work setting up road blocks to check vehicles, Sgt. Ron Merchant [said] the man was not apprehended.</p><p>\"Police said the robber entered the Royal Bank shortly after 3 p.m. The man told the teller he had a gun which he indicated was in his pocket. The teller handed the man a small amount of money and when he demanded more and didn't receive it, left the bank heading west on South Shore Road.\"</p><p>In other news, \"Many issues of potential risk to staff and patients were reported\" in a report revealing the potential risks at Cowichan District Hospital.</p><p>The report, commissioned by the hospital's CEO Don Brown, and carried out by Sharon Dixon, of St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, was 24 pages and \"Dixon reports on many problems, both real and perceived in the various departments of the hospital.\"</p><p>It seems some of the problems are long-standing.</p><p>\"The report states that the capacity for patients in the emergency department, exceeds the staffing provided; that there is an average of 75 visits per day which are managed by two staff around the clock.\" Also, \"staff perceive that their ability to deliver services effectively and safely is exceeded by the workload.\"</p><p>40 years ago</p><p>Anyone who believes there's not much action around the lake must not have been reading the paper four decades ago.</p><p>This headline from the Oct. 28, 1981 edition of the Lake News must have left readers wondering who bought the movie rights.</p><p>\"Trapped loggers burst through ring of fire to freedom\" it said.</p><p>\"'By helping each other, we saved our lives'. This was the thankful comment of one of three loggers who assisted each other to safety as a forest fire threatened to engulf them last week.\"</p><p>Holy cow.</p><p>\"Mesachie Lake resident Bill Goranson, 37, received serious injuries to his arm and hand. He will be off work for some time to recover. The other two loggers, Lyle Halberd and Bill Howie of Victoria, suffered from smoke inhalation and less serious burns, but have returned to work. All three work for B.C. Forest Products Port Renfrew division.</p><p>\"'We are lucky to be alive, we were trapped by the fire,' Goranson said.</p><p>\"The fire broke out in an active logging area Thursday morning when a line rubbing against a rock threw out sparks which quickly started a fire. Goranson and Halberg were hosing down the fire when a blazing tree branch fell on Howie. Goranson climbed down the hillside to rescue him.</p><p>\"'He had been pinned down there for a few minutes but he was able to get out before I arrived. The flames were all around us.'\"</p><p>Halberg went down the hill to help.</p><p>\"'When we looked around, we realized we were in serious trouble.\" They were surrounded by fire.</p><p>\"'We didn't panic. We just hung together and looked for a way out. We had no choice but to go out through the fire somewhere&amp;#x26;#8230;we shouted and ran through it. The heels of my shoes were burned off. My shirt caught fire. I couldn't roll on the ground because the ground was on fire, too.'\"</p><p>The men had taken turns helping each other over the bluff. Their teamwork is what ultimately saved all three.</p><p>\"Goranson said the three were lucky because 'we didn't lose our heads.'\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sarah.simpson@cowichanvalleycitizen.comLike\">sarah.simpson@cowichanvalleycitizen.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECG-4235062</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECG2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6406-50V1-JDH1-C08M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Lake Cowichan Gazette</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 31, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001502</classCode><className>ROBBERY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000CMA3</classCode><className>SPORT HUNTING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N448310CC</classCode><className>JEWELRY RETAILERS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

As well there were mushroom displays and sales, slide shows and tantalizing edibles.</p><p>\"People flocked to the barbecued wild salmon which was served on both days from 11 a.m. till 2 p.m. by Frank Sutherland and Ted Burns of the Salmonid Enhancement Society.</p><p>\"Ingeborg [Woodsworth] as usual had almost 80 varieties of mushrooms, edible and toxic for close examination by spectators. Dozens of people enjoyed several slide show presentations on mushroom identification on both days. She believes education is the key to a safe and successful mushroom picking trip into the woods.\"</p><p>Also a decade ago, rock hunter Brad Sullivan struck\u2026. rhodonite!</p><p>\"If managed correctly, Youbou area rhodonite claim could be worth millions of dollars,\" wrote editor Tyler Clarke. \"It was long believed that all of the major rhodonite claims in the Cowichan Lake area had already been mined. Backed by his life's savings, local man Brad Sullivan set out to prove them wrong, surprising himself and others with his resounding success. A discovery he estimates to be 400 feet long and 10 feet thick in places was discovered after only two months of searching. \"There's been people going up for 15 years for rhodonite, and they only found little pieces,\" he said. He'd gone out bear hunting with a friend when he discovered the area, west of Youbou.\"</p><p>I wonder whatever became of that?</p><p>25 years ago</p><p>\"Armed robber escapes\" was certainly a headline that grabbed some attention on the front of the Oct. 30, 1996 edition of the Lake News.</p><p>\"A lone robber who help up the Royal Bank in Lake Cowichan Saturday escaped with only a small amount of cash. Despite hasty police work setting up road blocks to check vehicles, Sgt. Ron Merchant [said] the man was not apprehended.</p><p>\"Police said the robber entered the Royal Bank shortly after 3 p.m. The man told the teller he had a gun which he indicated was in his pocket. The teller handed the man a small amount of money and when he demanded more and didn't receive it, left the bank heading west on South Shore Road.\"</p><p>In other news, \"Many issues of potential risk to staff and patients were reported\" in a report revealing the potential risks at Cowichan District Hospital.</p><p>The report, commissioned by the hospital's CEO Don Brown, and carried out by Sharon Dixon, of St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, was 24 pages and \"Dixon reports on many problems, both real and perceived in the various departments of the hospital.\"</p><p>It seems some of the problems are long-standing.</p><p>\"The report states that the capacity for patients in the emergency department, exceeds the staffing provided; that there is an average of 75 visits per day which are managed by two staff around the clock.\" Also, \"staff perceive that their ability to deliver services effectively and safely is exceeded by the workload.\"</p><p>40 years ago</p><p>Anyone who believes there's not much action around the lake must not have been reading the paper four decades ago.</p><p>This headline from the Oct. 28, 1981 edition of the Lake News must have left readers wondering who bought the movie rights.</p><p>\"Trapped loggers burst through ring of fire to freedom\" it said.</p><p>\"'By helping each other, we saved our lives'. This was the thankful comment of one of three loggers who assisted each other to safety as a forest fire threatened to engulf them last week.\"</p><p>Holy cow.</p><p>\"Mesachie Lake resident Bill Goranson, 37, received serious injuries to his arm and hand. He will be off work for some time to recover. The other two loggers, Lyle Halberd and Bill Howie of Victoria, suffered from smoke inhalation and less serious burns, but have returned to work. All three work for B.C. Forest Products Port Renfrew division.</p><p>\"'We are lucky to be alive, we were trapped by the fire,' Goranson said.</p><p>\"The fire broke out in an active logging area Thursday morning when a line rubbing against a rock threw out sparks which quickly started a fire. Goranson and Halberg were hosing down the fire when a blazing tree branch fell on Howie. Goranson climbed down the hillside to rescue him.</p><p>\"'He had been pinned down there for a few minutes but he was able to get out before I arrived. The flames were all around us.'\"</p><p>Halberg went down the hill to help.</p><p>\"'When we looked around, we realized we were in serious trouble.\" They were surrounded by fire.</p><p>\"'We didn't panic. We just hung together and looked for a way out. We had no choice but to go out through the fire somewhere\u2026we shouted and ran through it. The heels of my shoes were burned off. My shirt caught fire. I couldn't roll on the ground because the ground was on fire, too.'\"</p><p>The men had taken turns helping each other over the bluff. Their teamwork is what ultimately saved all three.</p><p>\"Goranson said the three were lucky because 'we didn't lose our heads.'\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sarah.simpson@cowichanvalleycitizen.com\">sarah.simpson@cowichanvalleycitizen.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 Lake Cowichan Gazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECG-news20211031PLC4235062</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECG2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6401-DJR1-F0HF-831G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

This year, three deaths have been recorded so far.  <br/> Beyond the loss of human life, such huge wildfires will cause immense and long-lasting biodiversity loss, says Diana Bell from British University of East Anglia's School of Biological Sciences.  <br/> 'Greece is home to more than 6,000 different species of plants and trees,' with some of them 'not found anywhere else in the world', Bell told AFP. <br/> And when locals flee their homes as their properties are engulfed in flames, more rural areas are abandoned \u2014 increasing their flammability, she added. <br/> Athens has linked the wildfires to climate change, but environmental groups have accused the government of using rising temperatures as an excuse to cover up the lack of means and prevention policies.  <br/> The country has ignored policy proposals from the World Wildlife Fund for 20 years, said the head of the group's Greek chapter, Demetres Karavellas. <br/> 'The climate crisis is not an excuse to fail but must be taken as an alarm to instigate change,' he said. <br/><url

The intersection is on a slight curve in the road at a blind spot with a solid yellow line turning onto Smythe from Lakeside.</p><p>The city has done an initial analysis, estimating it will cost $1.5 million to upgrade the intersection.</p><p>Donna Butler, of Ecora Engineering, spoke on behalf of the property owner at the public hearing. She said the 27 homes would increase traffic in the area by seven per cent. City staff recommends that the property developer pay 15 per cent of the intersection costs.</p><p>\"Mr. Skinner is willing to pay 10 per cent of the share of the costs which more than covers the seven per cent increase in traffic,\" said Butler.</p><p>In her remarks to council, Butler said Skinner has already put in $440,000 to improve access to Smyth Drive which has helped access to Skaha Bluffs and his winery.</p><p>\"Mr. Skinner has demonstrated good will and has compromised on the amount of housing there. Listening to the Lakeside residents, the homes would allow for secondary suites but not carriage houses. He owns Painted Rock which employees 20 staff.

She had seen smoke while driving south along Highway 19, near the Little Qualicum bridge. RCMP have yet to confirm her 911 call.</p><p>In the most recent Point-in-Time Homeless Count 2018, presented by the Oceanside Task Force on Homelessness, 42 people were identified as experiencing homelessness in the Parksville Qualicum Beach area. A total of 57 per cent of that count had been homeless for one year or more, while 43 per cent had been homeless for less than one year.</p><p>Auren Ruvinsky, co-ordinator of the Oceanside Task Force on Homelessness, said \"it's important to keep in mind that these figures are only of people coming forward and identifying themselves.\"</p><p>Regional District of Nanaimo Electoral Area F (Coombs, Hilliers, Errington, Whiskey Creek, Meadowood) director Leanne Salter said \"there are a lot of people living here, you just can't see them. Lots of people living in the bush. And they span the area from under the overpass by the ramp, and all the way up.\"</p><p>Salter said an estimate of 300 people experiencing homelessness along the Melrose Road area in Whiskey Creek seemed accurate.</p><p>READ MORE: Mobile forensic unit remains in Whiskey Creek following discovery of 3 dead bodies</p><p>\"We have a lot of people living in RVs out there.

Sounds like a good time was had by all, according to Carolyne Austin. \u201cFine weather greeted visitors to the 11th annual Salmon and Mushroom Festival at Lake Cowichan Centennial Hall this past Saturday,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFive hundred adults and about two dozen children entered the hall over the weekend enjoying the various vendors from the Girl Guide cookie sellers, to those selling jewelry, preserves, art, greeting cards and mushroom growing kits. As well there were mushroom displays and sales, slide shows and tantalizing edibles.</p><p>\u201cPeople flocked to the barbecued wild salmon which was served on both days from 11 a.m. till 2 p.m. by Frank Sutherland and Ted Burns of the Salmonid Enhancement Society.</p><p>\u201cIngeborg [Woodsworth] as usual had almost 80 varieties of mushrooms, edible and toxic for close examination by spectators. Dozens of people enjoyed several slide show presentations on mushroom identification on both days. She believes education is the key to a safe and successful mushroom picking trip into the woods.\u201d</p><p>Also a decade ago, rock hunter Brad Sullivan struck\u2026. rhodonite! \u201cIf managed correctly, Youbou area rhodonite claim could be worth millions of dollars,\u201d wrote editor Tyler Clarke. \u201cIt was long believed that all of the major rhodonite claims in the Cowichan Lake area had already been mined. Backed by his life\u2019s savings, local man Brad Sullivan set out to prove them wrong, surprising himself and others with his resounding success. A discovery he estimates to be 400 feet long and 10 feet thick in places was discovered after only two months of searching. \u201cThere\u2019s been people going up for 15 years for rhodonite, and they only found little pieces,\u201d he said. He\u2019d gone out bear hunting with a friend when he discovered the area, west of Youbou.\u201d</p><p>I wonder whatever became of that? 25 years ago \u201cArmed robber escapes\u201d was certainly a headline that grabbed some attention on the front of the Oct. 30, 1996 edition of the Lake News.</p><p>\u201cA lone robber who help up the Royal Bank in Lake Cowichan Saturday escaped with only a small amount of cash. Despite hasty police work setting up road blocks to check vehicles, Sgt. Ron Merchant [said] the man was not apprehended.</p><p>\u201cPolice said the robber entered the Royal Bank shortly after 3 p.m. The man told the teller he had a gun which he indicated was in his pocket. The teller handed the man a small amount of money and when he demanded more and didn\u2019t receive it, left the bank heading west on South Shore Road.\u201d</p><p>In other news, \u201cMany issues of potential risk to staff and patients were reported\u201d in a report revealing the potential risks at Cowichan District Hospital.</p><p>The report, commissioned by the hospital\u2019s CEO Don Brown, and carried out by Sharon Dixon, of St. Paul\u2019s Hospital in Vancouver, was 24 pages and \u201cDixon reports on many problems, both real and perceived in the various departments of the hospital.\u201d</p><p>It seems some of the problems are long-standing.</p><p>\u201cThe report states that the capacity for patients in the emergency department, exceeds the staffing provided; that there is an average of 75 visits per day which are managed by two staff around the clock.\u201d Also, \u201cstaff perceive that their ability to deliver services effectively and safely is exceeded by the workload.\u201d</p><p>40 years ago Anyone who believes there\u2019s not much action around the lake must not have been reading the paper four decades ago.</p><p>This headline from the Oct. 28, 1981 edition of the Lake News must have left readers wondering who bought the movie rights.</p><p>\u201cTrapped loggers burst through ring of fire to freedom\u201d it said.</p><p>\u201c\u2018By helping each other, we saved our lives\u2019. This was the thankful comment of one of three loggers who assisted each other to safety as a forest fire threatened to engulf them last week.\u201d</p><p>Holy cow. \u201cMesachie Lake resident Bill Goranson, 37, received serious injuries to his arm and hand. He will be off work for some time to recover. The other two loggers, Lyle Halberd and Bill Howie of Victoria, suffered from smoke inhalation and less serious burns, but have returned to work. All three work for B.C. Forest Products Port Renfrew division.</p><p>\u201c\u2018We are lucky to be alive, we were trapped by the fire,\u2019 Goranson said.</p><p>\u201cThe fire broke out in an active logging area Thursday morning when a line rubbing against a rock threw out sparks which quickly started a fire. Goranson and Halberg were hosing down the fire when a blazing tree branch fell on Howie. Goranson climbed down the hillside to rescue him.</p><p>\u201c\u2018He had been pinned down there for a few minutes but he was able to get out before I arrived. The flames were all around us.\u2019\u201d Halberg went down the hill to help. \u201c\u2018When we looked around, we realized we were in serious trouble.\u201d They were surrounded by fire.</p><p>\u201c\u2018We didn\u2019t panic. We just hung together and looked for a way out. We had no choice but to go out through the fire somewhere\u2026we shouted and ran through it. The heels of my shoes were burned off. My shirt caught fire. I couldn\u2019t roll on the ground because the ground was on fire, too.\u2019\u201d The men had taken turns helping each other over the bluff. Their teamwork is what ultimately saved all three.</p><p>\u201cGoranson said the three were lucky because \u2018we didn\u2019t lose our heads.\u2019\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECG-news20211028PQSA0002181110</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECG2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63YC-J5D1-JD2C-J1FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"947\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

They contained the initial blazes, but new fires raged closer to the decommissioned plant.</p><p>Emergencies Service chief Mykola Chechetkin reported to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that rains helped firefighters put out the flames, but acknowledged that it would take a few more days to extinguish smouldering grass.</p><p>Chechetkin said emergency workers have prevented the fire from engulfing radioactive waste depots and other facilities in Chornobyl.</p><p>The 2,600-square-kilometre (1,000-square-mile) Chornobyl Exclusion Zone was established after the 1986 disaster at the plant that sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over much of Europe. The zone is largely unpopulated, although about 200 people have remained despite orders to leave.</p><p>Ukraine's emergencies service said radiation levels in the capital, Kyiv, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of the plant, were within norms after the forest fires.</p><p>President Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians not to panic.</p><p>\"We all remember the lessons of April 26, 1986,\" he said in an online statement Tuesday. \"No one is hiding the truth from you. Right now the truth is that the situation there is under control.\"</p><p>On Monday, activists warned that the blazes were getting dangerously close to waste storage facilities.</p><p>Yaroslav Yemelyanenko, a member of the public council under the state agency in charge of the closed zone around the plant, said one fire was raging within 2 kilometres (about 1.2 miles) from one of the radioactive waste depots.</p><p>Last week, officials said they tracked down a person suspected of triggering the blaze by setting dry grass on fire in the area. The 27-year-old man said he burned grass \"for fun\" and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to spread quickly.</p><p>On Monday, police said that another local resident burned waste and accidentally set dry grass ablaze, triggering another devastating forest fire. They said he failed to report the fire to the authorities.</p><p>Blazes in the area have been a regular occurrence. They often start when residents set dry grass on fire in the early spring - a widespread practice in Ukraine, Russia and some other ex-Soviet nations that often leads to devastating forest fires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-70f9ec4ca1e68ad653245c4d45ce2f0e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YNG-1RH1-DY9S-T0PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"422\"/><timeReceived>01:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Since becoming the first Cree company to make the prestigious Profit 100 list of Canada\u2019s fastest growing companies in 2008, ADC has shown no signs of slowing down. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard at trying to capture business outside of our territory,\u201d said Derrick Neeposh, president of both ADC and its parent organization, Cree Regional Economic Enterprises Company (CREECO). \u201cCapturing opportunities in the south is one of the key components of the expansion of the company. We\u2019re still eyeing some opportunities in Ontario and hopefully in other provinces as well.\u201d </p><p>Neeposh told the Nation that while an attempt to provide services for a mining campsite in Ontario\u2019s Long Lake First Nation didn\u2019t ultimately materialize, SOPFEU, Quebec\u2019s forest fire suppression service, recently knocked on its doors. At the same time, ADC continues to expand its reach and business offerings within Cree communities. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done some initial work in specialized services, such as duct cleaning for air ventilation services in commercial buildings,\u201d said Neeposh. \u201cOther areas involve janitorial services for the facilities of the Cree School Board, Cree Health Board, Cree Nation Government and local band offices. There\u2019s just a never-ending network of possibility when it comes to working with the communities and regional entities.\u201d </p><p>Gestion ADC began as a joint venture between Cree Construction Development Company (CCDC) and Aliments Domco Cree, before CCDC became full owner of the company in 1996. CREECO designated it as an independent subsidiary a few years ago. As CCDC president Robert Baribeau recently remarked, \u201cIt was big enough to fly on its own.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think back to the start of this journey and how we had the vision to participate in the development of the territory,\u201d Neeposh stated. \u201cDevelopment was happening all around us, and we saw an opportunity to train and employ many people to provide essential catering and janitorial services on large industrial worksites.\u201d </p><p>Growing from early contracts with Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec to overseeing the management of vast mining camps, ADC\u2019s reliable service has enabled these companies to focus on their core business without worrying about their staff\u2019s wellbeing. As the first Canadian Indigenous company to obtain ISO-9001 certification in its field, ADC has provided a wide range of site management solutions, including housekeeping, facility maintenance and security. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve operated restaurants, bars, convenience stores, kiosks, cafeteria and anything the client requires in the remote site,\u201d former director Anthony MacLeod told Canadian Business Journal in 2011. \u201cBut if you can imagine when there are 2,300 men and women living on a camp, all the necessities of a small town need to be there.\u201d  </p><p>While the Covid pandemic complicated staffing and interrupted certain projects, ADC quickly introduced new electrostatic spraying technology to the region\u2019s mine sites and schools to eliminate deadly germs. The company also leveraged its immense purchasing power to secure an ample supply of personal protective equipment, which it then offers to local stores.  </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking at providing that [electrostatic] technology to daycares, for example, where it gets important to take care of our people,\u201d explained Neeposh. \u201cIf we\u2019re given this opportunity, we take it to heart to be part of the solution. People come first, business comes second. That\u2019s a testament to what the company is capable of doing.\u201d </p><p>Gestion ADC recently won a contract to renovate the kitchen and take over the operations of La Perle Bleue, the restaurant of the Espresso Hotel, which annually accommodates about 20,000 Cree patients and family escorts who require medical services in Montreal.  </p><p>\u201cWe heard their cries for help on social media, patient complaints about the quality of food they were getting from the hotel,\u201d Neeposh said. \u201cThe Cree Health Board approached us and gave us the opportunity to find a solution together. Today, we\u2019re very proud of the fact that patients are getting better quality food.\u201d </p><p>Gestion ADC\u2019s experience in serving a diverse clientele made it a natural choice for providing healthy and balanced meals that draw on Indigenous food traditions and ingredients. As a company proudly owned by the Cree Nation, supporting the Cree culture while contributing to the Nation\u2019s growth has always been at its heart.  </p><p>Cree communities share in the success of CREECO companies \u2013 in 2020-2021, CCDC returned $2.8 million and Gestion ADC returned $1.4 million to the communities. Joint ventures with local partners remain an important component of both companies, including ADC\u2019s partnerships with Mistissini\u2019s Kiskinshiish, Wemindji\u2019s Wolf Camp and Waswanipi\u2019s Miyuu Kaa.   </p><p>\u201cWe always bear in mind that the shareholders are just as important as the staff that run these companies,\u201d shared Neeposh. \u201cWe want to help other First Nations as well. How we run the company is one thing but sending out that example of who we are and where we come from is equally important.\u201d </p><p>In celebrating this anniversary, Gestion ADC emphasized that its 370 dedicated employees are at the heart of its achievements. Training programs applied under Apatisiiwan Skills Development are a big part of operations, along with ample on-the-job empowerment. </p><p>\u201cAn individual approached me a year ago and said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be a janitor all my life, I want to start my own janitorial business cleaning homes,\u2019\u201d Neeposh recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s an example of the training benefits. If a person has an entrepreneurial mind, they will develop that on their own.\u201d </p><p>With growing business volume necessitating the hiring of a director general and eventually a full-time president, Neeposh looks at emerging mine sites in Eeyou Istchee as an opportunity for both the company and Cree youth. At career fairs, ADC promotes benefits like working half the year on a full salary through 14-day shifts on- and off-site. </p><p>\u201cThe workforce required for future mine sites is just a dropin a bucket when you look at the 500 youth who will turn 18 next year,\u201d Neeposh explained. \u201cThat\u2019s a big workforce we have to prepare for. It\u2019s a wonderful experience for a lot of young people who come out of high school and don\u2019t want to go to school in the south.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a726549c19794cb8a758a972abc59e29</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:645H-3BC1-JBVR-345J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1076\"/><timeReceived>03:36 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 25, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

There was so much dust swirling in the air that people in Red Deer had to turn on their lights in the middle of the afternoon in order to see. By nightfall, some snow began to fall. However, while that cut down the dust somewhat, very little snow actually fell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The climate of Western Canadian prairies is well known for its prolonged alternating periods of dry, wet, warm and cold weather. The winter of 1930-1931 was unusually warm and dry &amp;#x26;#8211; in the terminology of the time, \"an open winter.\" One sign of the very dry conditions was a sizeable forest fire by Rocky Mountain House, which had started well before the early March dust storm hit.</p><p>It was very unusual to have notable fires and large dust storms before the start of spring. Consequently, there were lots of comments about the unprecedented conditions. What people didn't realize was that this was actually one of the first signs of one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of western North America &amp;#x26;#8211; the start of the great Dust Bowl, which led to the decade being dubbed the Dirty Thirties.</p><p>While the onset of a multi-year drought was a major factor in this disaster, so were the widespread farming practices of the time. The native prairie grasslands and natural groves of trees had been broken up as the region was turned into farmlands. Moreover, land was often heavily cultivated, with stubble being burned off as a form of weed control. That made for fine, loose soils, with little ground cover to control wind erosion.</p><p>The March 1931 storm was soon followed by another wave of widespread dust storms that hit in May. In one dust storm at Ponoka, it was reported that visibility was reduced to a mere 10 metres.</p><p>To add to the grim conditions, there were widespread outbreaks of grasshoppers over the summer that consumed a good deal of the green growth which had emerged. Those infestations continued in subsequent years.</p><p>Conditions remained grim in 1932. In April 1932, there were reports of trains being held up by large dust storms in south eastern Alberta and south western Saskatchewan. Starting on May 9, 1934, a massive set of \"black blizzards\" swept across the Canadian and American plains. Thousands of tonnes of dust reportedly fell on such cities as Chicago. In some communities across the prairies, plows had to be brought out to clear the drifts of soil.</p><p>One of the worst set of storms struck on April 14, 1935, dubbed in many media accounts as Black Sunday. Millions of tonnes of soil moved across the plains. There were reports of many lives lost in the horrific storm conditions, several by \"dust pneumonia.\" In May 1935, a special large health conference was held in the U.S. to discuss the widespread chronic respiratory problems.</p><p>New waves of massive dust storms swept across the Western plains in 1936. On May 18, 1937, people in Red Deer again had to turn on their lights in mid-day in order to see. Several had to repaint their homes and businesses afterwards to repair the storm's \"sand-blasting.\" In October, people in Rocky Mountain House area were complaining about the thick coatings of dust on window sills and other flat surfaces.</p><p>Meanwhile, major government programs were adopted to improve agricultural practices and to reduce the erosion damage of dust storms. One notable one in Canada was the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA), which encouraged new cultivation and cropping practices, creation of more pastureland and adoption of water conservation measures such as the installation of farm dugouts.</p><p>The return of a cool wet cycle in the early 1940s helped to bring an end to the Dust Bowl. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of farms across the prairies were abandoned and an estimated 3.5 million people moved in hopes of finding better places to live and find sustainable employment. The \"Old West\" had come to a permanent end.</p><p>Red Deer historian Michael Dawe's column appears Wednesdays.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-4127007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:625W-CF21-F103-316J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"668\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors.

That said, the fire may have had further reach if not for previous mitigation efforts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Randy Harris is a registered professional forester who is now retired after 38 years with the BC Forest Service. During the last eight years of his career, he was the ecosystem restoration leader for the Rocky</p><p>Mountain District in Cranbrook.</p><p>Harris explained that the final control of Bill Nye was made easier by the fact that the wildfire mitigation team tied the south boundary of the fire to an existing ecosystem restoration (ER) unit near Lakit Lake, on July 22nd.</p><p>He adds that after speaking with fire crews, the ecosystem restoration burn served as a good anchor point for their back burn.</p><p>'\u2018This tie in, through a prescribed burn, linked a fuel reduced area with good fire guards to the wildfire and reduced the risk that the fire could have run off the mountain</p><p>and into the housing around Campbell Meyer road,\u201d Harris explained. \u201cWhile the ER burn did not truly reduce fire suppression, it saved a lot of time to have a ready constructed fire guard to burn from. Also, if the guard was breached in the ER project [area], fire control would be very simple in grass fuel type.\u201d</p><p>He adds that crews plan to tour the area after the burn season is over, to see what further information they can gain.</p><p>In terms of the mitigation work that was done for the Lakit Lake burn, Harris explained that there were several different</p><p>efforts and projects over the course of some years.</p><p>\u201cThe Lakit Lake logical burn unit (LBU) was treated in three stages and totalled 400 hectares,\u201d Harris said. \u201c24 hectares were harvested by Tembec (now Cafor) in 2004. 53.6 hectares [of forest fuel] was spaced and pile burnt in 2008, and six small units were funded by the Government Forest Investment account. The whole 400 hectare unit (with some 63 hectares of untreated Wildlife Tree units) was prescribed burnt in 2009.\u201d</p><p>Harris says that the Rocky Mountain Forest District staff</p><p>oversaw the prescription spacing and prescribed burn operations, while actual on-ground work was completed by local contractors.</p><p>Marc Trudeau is a coordinator with the Rocky Mountain Trench Natural Resources Society, which was involved in the Lakit Lake LBU.</p><p>He explained that the society is a nine-member organization that was established in 1996 to tackle to problem of declining grasslands and open forest ecosystems in the Rocky Mountain Trench. Their ecosystem restoration projects also help to reduce forest fire fuels and protect areas against wildfires.</p><p>The Rocky Mountain Trench Natural Resources Society coalition consists of the following organizations: Cranbrook Community Forest Society, East Kootenay Invasive Species Council, East Koo\u00ac</p><p>tenay Wildlife Association, Kootenay Livestock Association, Rocky Mountain Naturalists, Southern Guides &amp; Outfitters, Waldo Stockbreeders Association, Wildsight and the Windermere District Farmers Institute.</p><p>\u201cGrasslands and open forests are major contributors to our region\u2019s exceptional biodiversity. They provide grazing for elk, bighorn sheep, white-tailed deer, and domestic livestock,\u201d Trudeau explained. \u201cThese ecosystems also provide habitat for many wildlife species, including the majority of the region\u2019s rare and endangered species such as Lewis\u2019s woodpecker, American badger and long-billed curlew.\u201d</p><p>Trudeau said that using an existing ER treatment area as a</p><p>defendable boundary would make sense, because of the reduction in available fuel to burn and/or to provide a logical tie in point for a burn off.</p><p>\u201cGrasslands and open forests contribute to a healthy environment in other ways too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey offset the effects of greenhouse gases by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They preserve and enrich soil by preventing erosion</p><p>and adding nutrients. They discourage the spread of insects that attack and kill trees, and they form natural firebreaks that can help stop the advancement of catastrophic wildfire. Many also value grasslands and open forests for their recreational, aesthetic and spiritual values.\u201d</p><p>Trudeau adds that the total funds raised by the Trench Society to prepare the Lakit Face for prescribed burn was approxi\u00ac</p><p>mately $107,583.</p><p>The main funders included the Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program at $71,000, Provincial Land Base Investment Funds of $21,583, Columbia Basin Trust $10,000 and Wild Sheep Society of BC at $5,000. Prescribed burn planning and ignitions are conducted by the BC Wildfire Service.</p><p>As stated in the Rocky Mountain Trench Ecosystem</p><p>Restoration Program\u2019s five year plan for 2019 to 2023, prepared in 2018, the plan is a continuation of the longstanding ecological restoration process that has been active since 1997.</p><p>\u201cRegardless of the program, almost all projects proposed involve spacing by mechanical thinning and/or prescribed burning, with the primary objective of converting dense forests to a more open</p><p>canopy,\u201d says the report, prepared by Harris. \u201cThis thinning is necessitated by the interruption of the historic fire regime of the local forests and grasslands by more effective fire suppression that has occurred since the Second World War.\u201d</p><p>He explains that most forests in the district have been affected, to some extent, by ingrowth. Ingrowth increases fuel loads that feed</p><p>wildfires. It also creates denser canopies that shade out the grass and shrub forage that wildlife and cattle depend on.</p><p>The goal of the program is to restore the designated 109,400 hectares of the Trench and support the native and historical condition matrix of trees, plants and animals - while create sustainable forage for wild and domestic grazing animals.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRANDT-news20210914PPZ242541</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRANDT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63M0-T831-F0HF-81F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

In disaster times, it is even more onerous  to keep up with one\u2019s treatment. </p><p>\u201cWe have a system that is archaic and  rigid\u2026 we live in the climate apocalypse, and this is going to keep  happening,\u201d said Garth Mullins, a board member of the BC Association for  People on Methadone and Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users. </p><p>Drug user rights are inherently tied to  climate justice, Mullins said. The impacts of the climate crisis \u2014 like  record forest-fire seasons that left the province vulnerable to the  intense floods occurring now \u2014 hammer Indigenous, Black and other  marginalized communities the most, within which substance users are  overrepresented. </p><p>More than 3,000 people have died of toxic  drugs in B.C. since March 2020, and this year is on track to be the most  fatal year on record for the second year in a row. </p><p>While British Columbians are advised to  have at least 72 hours to two weeks supply of all their medications in  their emergency kit, people who use drugs can\u2019t follow that advice. </p><p>The two major first-line treatments for  substance use disorders, methadone and Suboxone, are given through  supervised consumption at pharmacies or specialized clinics, with a  limited amount of take-home doses \u2014 known as \u201ccarries\u201d \u2014 permitted under  loosened pandemic rules. </p><p>Mullins has seen and heard anecdotal  evidence that patients with carries are not being allowed to take doses  home anymore by certain prescribing physicians and pharmacists,  something he has advocated to the province to change in recent months. </p><p>With highways washed out and many  pharmacies flooded, Mullins is worried many people who would normally be  able to access a known and regulated dosage may begin to experience  withdrawal or access the criminalized supply to prevent illness. </p><p>And the risk of overdose is particularly high for those who haven\u2019t used in a while and whose tolerances have decreased. </p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so dope sick you can barely  move, how are you going to be able to evacuate yourself?\u201d he asked.  \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get drugs that will kill you; it\u2019s very hard to get drugs  that will save you.\u201d </p><p>In a recent literature review,  Sud examined the impacts of other natural disasters on opioid  treatments in countries around the world to understand what actions the  pandemic requires in Canada. </p><p>What he and his co-investigator found was  disturbing. Amid limited access to pharmacies and emergency  prescriptions in the first place, some patients, already in withdrawal,  were being told they had to continue in withdrawal to prove they needed  medications. </p><p>\u201cAnd those were the people presenting to health care in the first place,\u201d he said.  </p><p>Both Mullins and Sud said that ensuring  patients have carries and emergency stockpiles is essential for disaster  preparedness now and in calmer times.  </p><p>In a message, Ward says she wants Health  Minister Adrian Dix to temporarily remove the requirement for  prescriptions for methadone and Suboxone, which the provincial cabinet  can do through an order-in-council, to allow users to access medications  no matter where they have been displaced. </p><p>The Ministry of Mental Health and  Addictions acknowledged the state of emergency and flooding heightens  risks of harm to people who use drugs in an emailed statement to The  Tyee. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working with the BC Centre on  Substance Use, health authorities, including the First Nations Health  Authority, people with lived and living experience and other partners,  on actions to ensure people living with opioid use disorder can maintain  their treatment plans while staying safe,\u201d wrote a spokesperson. </p><p>The Tyee reached out to Fraser Health but has yet to hear back. </p><p>Six clinics offering substance use  services, including prescription treatment \u2014 and harm reduction  collectives in the affected regions contacted by The Tyee \u2014 also did not  respond or did not have capacity to respond today given the disaster,  one said. </p><p>Mullins said the full extent of harm likely won\u2019t be known for days or weeks after the flooding subsides. </p><p>But both he and Sud stressed that this must  be a learning moment to overhaul prescribing guidance that treats drug  users as untrustworthy and makes it hard for them to access supports and  health care without discrimination. </p><p>\u201cThis harm is avoidable if we can learn  some of these lessons around how we can reform care, and normalize and  regularize care for people using substances,\u201d said Sud.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e0021f30e8ca409ab52b26321ebc9c5d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6441-BK11-DY9S-T21R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1118\"/><timeReceived>07:46 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 18, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That said, the fire may have had further reach if not for previous mitigation efforts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Randy Harris is a registered professional forester who is now retired after 38 years with the BC Forest Service. During the last eight years of his career, he was the ecosystem restoration leader for the Rocky</p><p>Mountain District in Cranbrook.</p><p>Harris explained that the final control of Bill Nye was made easier by the fact that the wildfire mitigation team tied the south boundary of the fire to an existing ecosystem restoration (ER) unit near Lakit Lake, on July 22nd.</p><p>He adds that after speaking with fire crews, the ecosystem restoration burn served as a good anchor point for their back burn.</p><p>\u201cThis tie in, through a prescribed burn, linked a fuel reduced area with good fire guards to the wildfire and reduced the risk that the fire could have run off the mountain</p><p>and into the housing around Campbell Meyer road,\u201d Harris explained. \u201cWhile the ER burn did not truly reduce fire suppression, it saved a lot of time to have a ready constructed fire guard to bum from. Also, if the guard was breached in the ER project [area], fire control would be very simple in grass fuel type.\u201d</p><p>He adds that crews plan to tour the area after the burn season is over, to see what further information they can gain.</p><p>In terms of the mitigation work that was done for the Lakit Lake burn, Harris explained that there were several different</p><p>efforts and projects over the course of some years.</p><p>\u201cThe Lakit Lake logical burn unit (LBU) was treated in three stages and totalled 400 hectares,\u201d Harris said. \u201c24 hectares were harvested by Tembec (now Cafor) in 2004. 53.6 hectares [of forest fuel] was spaced and pile burnt in 2008, and six small units were funded by the Government Forest Investment account. The whole 400 hectare unit (with some 63 hectares of untreated Wildlife Tree units) was prescribed burnt in 2009.\u201d</p><p>Harris says that the Rocky Mountain Forest District staff</p><p>oversaw the prescription spacing and prescribed burn operations, while actual on-ground work was completed by local contractors.</p><p>Marc Trudeau is a coordinator with the Rocky Mountain Trench Natural Resources Society, which was involved in the Lakit Lake LBU.</p><p>He explained that the society is a nine-member organization that was established in 1996 to tackle to problem of declining grasslands and open forest ecosystems in the Rocky Mountain Trench. Their ecosystem restoration projects also help to reduce forest fire fuels and protect areas against wildfires.</p><p>The Rocky Mountain Trench Natural Resources Society coalition consists of the following organizations: Cranbrook Community Forest Society, East Kootenay Invasive Species Council, East Koo\u00ac</p><p>tenay Wildlife Association, Kootenay Livestock Association, Rocky Mountain Naturalists, Southern Guides &amp; Outfitters, Waldo Stockbreeders Association, Wildsight and the Windermere District Farmers Institute.</p><p>\u201cGrasslands and open forests are major contributors to our region\u2019s exceptional biodiversity. They provide grazing for elk, bighorn sheep, white-tailed deer, and domestic livestock,\u201d Trudeau explained. \u201cThese ecosystems also provide habitat for many wildlife species, including the majority of the region\u2019s rare and endangered species such as Lewis\u2019s woodpecker, American badger and long-billed curlew.\u201d</p><p>Trudeau said that using an existing ER treatment area as a</p><p>defendable boundary would make sense, because of the reduction in available fuel to burn and/or to provide a logical tie in point for a burn off.</p><p>\u201cGrasslands and open forests contribute to a healthy environment in other ways too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey offset the effects of greenhouse gases by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They preserve and enrich soil by preventing erosion</p><p>and adding nutrients. They discourage the spread of insects that attack and kill trees, and they form natural firebreaks that can help stop the advancement of catastrophic wildfire. Many also value grasslands and open forests for their recreational, aesthetic and spiritual values.\u201d</p><p>Trudeau adds that the total funds raised by the Trench Society to prepare the Lakit Face for prescribed burn was approxi\u00ac</p><p>mately $107,583.</p><p>The main funders included the Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program at $71,000, Provincial Land Base Investment Funds of $21,583, Columbia Basin Trust $10,000 and Wild Sheep Society of BC at $5,000. Prescribed burn planning and ignitions are conducted by the BC Wildfire Service.</p><p>As stated in the Rocky Mountain Trench Ecosystem</p><p>Restoration Program\u2019s five year plan for 2019 to 2023, prepared in 2018, the plan is a continuation of the longstanding ecological restoration process that has been active since 1997.</p><p>\u201cRegardless of the program, almost all projects proposed involve spacing by mechanical thinning and/or prescribed burning, with the primary objective of converting dense forests to a more open</p><p>canopy,\u201d says the report, prepared by Harris. \u201cThis thinning is necessitated by the interruption of the historic fire regime of the local forests and grasslands by more effective fire suppression that has occurred since the Second World War.\u201d</p><p>He explains that most forests in the district have been affected, to some extent, by ingrowth. Ingrowth increases fuel loads that feed</p><p>wildfires. It also creates denser canopies that shade out the grass and shrub forage that wildlife and cattle depend on.</p><p>The goal of the program is to restore the designated 109,400 hectares of the Trench and support the native and historical condition matrix of trees, plants and animals - while create sustainable forage for wild and domestic grazing animals.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIMDBU-news20210914PPL242173</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIMDBU2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63M0-T831-F0HF-81D4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.
