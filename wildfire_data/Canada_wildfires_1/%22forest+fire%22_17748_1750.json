Seeing snow blanketing the hills and mountains and cheerful skiers and snowshoers heading out to the runs and trails definitely puts a smile on anyone\u2019s faces.</p><p>But this unusually late start to winter is worrisome, especially after the hot, dry summer and record-breaking forest fire season B.C. and Canada as a whole experienced last summer. Just a few months ago, forecasters were warning an unusually mild and dry winter was coming, thanks to El Nino and climate change.</p><p>And here we are. At the start of 2024 and only seeing winter conditions now.</p><p>While some will gripe at shovelling snow and having to traverse slippery, snowchoked mountain passes, the snow and cold is needed to maintain natural water lev-els and healthy cycles in the forests and wildlife.</p><p>Which brings us to a looming question:what does this mean for our region, and the province, for this year\u2019s wildfire predictions? It\u2019s already not looking good. Almost two-thirds of the province\u2019s fire zones were still experiencing moderate-to-extreme drought conditions, according to the British Columbia Drought Conditions Map.</p><p>Low water levels in rivers and lakes with little precipitation expected between now and spring means low ground water levels to hydrate the soil and plant life.</p><p>Even then, with years of ongoing dry conditions having a cumulative effect on our drought situation, one wet spring or summer, or late heavy snowfall will be, pardon the phrase, a drop in an almost empty bucket.</p><p>It\u2019s not morose or fatalistic, but proactive to be ready in the event we are next for a major fire. While steps are being taken to minimize risks, like thinning forests and clearing deadfall in some areas, we as individuals and communities have to take some responsibility to be prepared.</p><p>-Black Press Teresa Bird-Publisher 250-720-7756 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Teresa.Bird@blackpress.ca\">Teresa.Bird@blackpress.ca</email></p><p>Andrew Bailey-Editor 250-534-9213 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Andrew.Bailey@WesterlyNews.ca\">Andrew.Bailey@WesterlyNews.ca</email></p><p>Display Advertising Thursday 2:00pm Deadlines: Annual Subscription Rates: Who We Are: Local Area $78 B.C. $91 Canada $104 United States $130 To subscribe call:250-723-6399 or visit<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.westerlynews.ca/subscribe\">www.westerlynews.ca/subscribe</url></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:office@westerlynews.ca\">office@westerlynews.ca</email></p><p>Classified Advertising Monday 10:00am <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:classifieds@westerlynews.ca\">classifieds@westerlynews.ca</email></p><p>The Tofino-Ucluelet Westerly News, a division of Black Press, respects your privacy.

A province over, experts warn flames could overtake towns in B.C. as emergency crews prepare for a \"last stand.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As thousands evacuate amid notices of declining air quality across Canada, officials warn the risk of hot, dry weather and severe fires this spring and summer remains high.</p><p>Air quality worsens as wildfires rage in Canada</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre is reporting 146 active fires across the country as of Sunday, including 39 out-of-control flames - burning through nearly 230,000 hectares of land so far. In comparison, more than 200 fires were burning across the country around the same time last year, with roughly 50 out of control.</p><p>On Sunday, Environment Canada issued a special air quality alert extending from B.C. to Ontario.</p><p>While the Air Quality Health Index shows a low risk for Ontario on Monday morning, Environment Canada forecasts the air quality for places including North Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury and Thunder Bay to worsen from \"low\" to \"moderate\" throughout the day. With air quality at \"moderate risk,\" people with heart or breathing problems are urged to \"consider reducing or rescheduling strenuous activities outdoors\" if they are experiencing symptoms like difficulty breathing. People in the general population don't need to modify outdoor activities unless they experience symptoms like irritated throats or coughing</p><p>Meanwhile, federal officials are predicting weather conditions for spring and summer that could lead to greater wildfire risks, including above-normal temperatures nationwide and an ongoing drought in Western Canada expected to persist through May.</p><p>This same drought, a result of the current El Nino weather system, also contributed to the early start of fire season this year, noted Kent Moore, a professor of physics at U of T Mississauga researching the dynamics of our climate system and its long-term impacts.</p><p>As global temperatures continue to climb as a result of climate change, experts warn Canada must brace for longer and more intense wildfire seasons to come.</p><p>\"We're going to see lots more wildfires in the coming years and decades as the climate warms,\" Ze'ev Gedalof, an associate professor researching forestry and climatology at the University of Guelph, previously told the Star. \"Climate scientists have been saying this for decades, and people are just not paying attention.\"</p><p>Is climate change making wildfires worse?</p><p>Although wildfires are a natural process that can be beneficial for the ecosystem, the events have been happening at an \"unprecedented level\" in recent years, Gedalof said.</p><p>\"It's not rocket science,\" he continued. \"When it gets warmer and drier, we're going to see longer fire seasons and we're going to see hotter fires.\"</p><p>There are three main ingredients for a wildfire, according to John Innes, a professor of forestry at the University of British Columbia - its intensity hinges on the source of ignition (and how frequently they occur), the state of the fuel and the presence of conditions that spread the fire, like strong wind.</p><p>\"Climate change affects all of those,\" he said. Specifically, scientists expect more thunderstorms and windy conditions as the weather changes, which can spark and spread fires. Meanwhile, woods are drier as temperatures warm, providing for excellent fuel, Innes said.</p><p>\"We are anticipating that it's going to get hotter and warmer, particularly the springs and the autumns - and so the fire season becomes longer,\" Innes continued, adding that there are no longer fire seasons in parts of the Southern U.S. because the risk of fire has become present year-round. In \"50 to 80 years,\" Innes sees the same thing happening to Canada.</p><p>If a wildfire gets intense enough, it can even generate its own weather, including thunder and lightning - potentially spawning more fires, according to Jeff Brook, an associate professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health.</p><p>Brook added that climate change has impacted the seasons in which certain species are active - like mountain pine beetles, which usually get killed off by the cold but are now able to survive year-round due to warming winters. As a result, they've become an epidemic in the B.C. interior, devastating forests - \"and dead forests are even more susceptible to burning,\" he said.</p><p>Wildfires to increase both in intensity and duration</p><p>While we can't predict exact weather conditions in the future, climatologists say wildfires on average will increase in intensity and duration in coming years.</p><p>That's not to say every year will be as intense as 2023 going forward, but it will mean major fires will become more common: \"There is a concept called return period, which is how often would one expect to see a fire season of this intensity,\" Moore explained.</p><p>\"As the climate changes, we expect to see that return period go down - so rather than having a fire season like this once every 20 or 30 years, we may see a fire season like this every ten years or every five years,\" he said.</p><p>While occasional fires can be good for the ecosystem, the unprecedented burns in recent years are too much, said Gedalof: \"Most of these ecosystems are going to take decades to adapt (to Canada's new fire conditions) ... These changes are happening much, much faster than ecosystems can respond to.\"</p><p>A vicious cycle: Wildfires are major polluters</p><p>In extreme years, wildfires can become major sources of greenhouse gasses. In 2023, Canada's record-shattering fires produced 23 per cent of the global, annual wildfire carbon emissions. About 480 million tonnes of wildfire emissions were recorded, almost five times the national average for the past two decades.</p><p>Wildfires are \"a very large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,\" Brook said, adding they're an example of what climatologists call a \"positive feedback\" - climate change makes wildfires worse, which in turn makes climate change worse.</p><p>\"It's a vicious cycle,\" he said. According to his research, when comparing total emissions in B.C. over the past five years, a bad year of forest fires has \"four times the amount of greenhouse gas emissions as a quieter year.\"</p><p>\"If our boreal forests burn, they'll dwarf (emissions) from our own human activities, which is concerning as this starts to happen more and more and more.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2024051371476678</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C18-FXV1-F197-5036-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1085\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The Jan. 1 figures showed snowpack levels below 44 per cent.</p><p>All basins (minus the Northwest with no data available) are below norms with the Stikine (minus 10 per cent) closest to the norm. The Okanagan (minus 14 per cent) and the South Thompson (minus 19 per cent) also recorded snowpacks above 80 per cent of normal.</p><p>The gaps in the snowpack are especially pronounced in B.C. \u2019s most populated parts. Vancouver Island is 70 below normal, while the South Coast is down 59 per cent from normal.</p><p>The Skagit basin at the border between the Fraser Valley and the Similkameen is at 100 per cent below normal. Overall, nine snow stations measured all-time lows for their period of record.</p><p>A historical look back underscores the widespread lack of snow.

At the American Honey Show in New Orleans, her creamed honey got a perfect score -- and was awarded Best in Show, which she puts down to the three rules of honey: location, location, location. Amanda Goodman Lee spoke to Chris Walker on \"Daybreak Kelowna\" today.</p><p><br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>AMANDA GOODMAN LEE: Well, you know what? I think it's so good because it's from the Kootenays. [chuckles] It's from our region. And I think that has a lot to do with it. With what the nectar source that the bees are feeding on. But I've also heard from lots of our customers that we are so passionate and we love what we do so much that I think that also is, comes through in the jar. And it's, it's really the work of the bees. And it's the greatest reward we get when we're beekeeping is at the end of season, when we're extracting that honey and that liquid gold is coming out of the machine. So, you know, I think it's, there's many, many honeys in the world that are really delicious, like, that you don't get here. Like, varietals are different by region. Our honey will taste different than honey maybe in the Okanagan or the Lower Mainland or up in The Piece. But, I think it's all the things that combine the love. Just the purity, raw honey of it all.<br/><br/>CHRIS WALKER: You also won first place for your fireweed honey, which I understand is, is really difficult to harvest. Could you tell us a bit about that?<br/><br/>AGL: Yes. So, fireweed honey is, fireweed is where there has been a clear-cut or a forest fire. And it's sort of the forest vegetation that grows up in, on the mountains. And so, it took us a few years to source out a location. Beekeepers, we're notorious for keeping our location secret and quiet. At this past year, we had just a bumper crop of fireweed. It's a clear, almost water-white honey. The temperature between the mountain top where our hives are and the valley floor where we get our Kootenay wildflower is approximately 10 degrees, so you need it to be at least 30 degrees on the valley floor to get that 20 degrees up top. Otherwise, the bees can't fly. You need a good snowpack in the wintertime so that there's that nectar flow. So, we need that moisture to produce nectar in the flowers.<br/><br/>CW: Now, can you tell us about this auction? Because some of these jars were auctioned off. And the, I'm looking at the prices here. It's quite incredible. Tell us about this.<br/><br/>AGL: So, when they do, when you enter the American Honey Show, they take all the jars, and they auction them off for their charity. So, during the day, our fireweed -- which got a blue ribbon -- was auctioned off, and it went for $250 USD a jar, [CW chuckles] if you can imagine. I was just so shocked. And we had eight jars and they all sold.<br/><br/>CH: That was Amanda Goodman Lee speaking to Chris Walker -- host of Daybreak Kelowna -- today.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCBCT-AIH24012513</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCBCT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B6V-VJ01-JCWB-N00D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487018</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"485\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Forest fires continue to rage across British Columbia, threatening many of our rural communities, with many more expected throughout the season. We have already seen the horrendous impacts these fires can have on our communities. I am truly at a loss for words over the devastation wreaked on our beautiful town of Lytton, as well as the tragic loss of life. Peo-ple across the province are heartbroken for residents of Lytton who have lost everything. I have spent the past few weeks traveling around the Fraser-Nicola region and amidst the feelings of loss and grief, I was also met with an incredible feeling of hope when I saw how British Columbians and Canadians have come together to support those in need. The incredible work of our firefighters, emergency responders, local officials and of course our many volunteers cannot be understated.</p><p>Many of our local farmers who have been working the land for generations have offered invaluable insight for our recovery and will be an essential voice at the table for future forest fire prevention.</p><p>Our region is also blessed to be home to many knowledgeable First Nations communities who have called this land home for thousands of years. Their local wisdom and guidance have been critical for our local efforts. In our time of need, it is their tireless advocacy and actions that are keeping us safe and readying us for the difficult recovery process.</p><p>As your MLA, I will continue to engage with local leaders across the region to hear their concerns and ensure the province offers Lytton and all rural communities the support they need to stay protected and make a full recovery.</p><p>Jackie Tegart is the MLA for Fraser-Nicola.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOPEST-news20210716PQJA0002013307</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOPEST2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6356-J9S1-F0HF-84DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"292\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

It said the fire is dangerous and residents should prepare to leave at short notice.</p><p>Information posted Monday by the BC Wildfire Service said nine wildfires had started in the province in the previous 24 hours.</p><p>Officials have worried this year's wildfire season could be a challenging one, with much of the province continuing to experience significant drought. </p><p>Parker said those in his region, like much of the province, have been worried about the lack of snowpack which is at record lows in B.C.</p><p>\"And then we just have had limited, limited amounts of precipitation in the last month,\" he said.</p><p>\"So, that dry grass season, it's even drier than it normally would be. It's always a threat, and we've always dealt with some grass fires during the early spring season, but this year they seem to be a lot more volatile, just from the dry conditions.\"</p><p>Last year's B.C. wildfire season saw more than 28,400 square kilometres of forest and land burned, hundreds of homes destroyed and tens of thousands of people forced to evacuate. Canada\u2019s 2023 wildfire season was the most destructive ever recorded, with the Interagency Forest Fire Centre reporting 18.5 million hectares of land was burned</p><p>Langan, who lives on a remote property in the Cariboo alert zone with her daughters, says their nearest permanent neighbour is 15 kilometres away. Her property is powered by a generator.</p><p>\u201cAt times, there was a lot of smoke and you couldn't see where the fire actually was. The wind changed directions and at times the smoke would drift here over the ranch and you could definitely smell it,\u201d said Langan, whose ranch is at the north end of Ben Lake. </p><p>She said she had been watching helicopters fly over her house on their way to the fire.</p><p>Cariboo Regional District had called her to alert her about the fire, which she said was nice, but she said she had no plans to leave immediately and hadn't packed. She described herself as a \"calm person.\"</p><p>Seeing wildfires up close isn't new to Langan, who worked with neighbours to put out wild fires in 2017.</p><p>\u201cOne of the local contractors brought over a dozer and helped with that. At that time, when they later on issued an evacuation order, nobody left because we knew that the only ones who were gonna save our homes were us,\u201d said Langan. </p><p>In northern Alberta, residents of Saprae Creek Estates, a hamlet near Fort McMurray, were told Sunday to prepare themselves for a possible evacuation</p><p>RCMP asked on Monday members of the public to immediately stop flying drones over the fire, or risk charges. \u201cThis behaviour is a major public safety concern as helicopters are a key element to combating these fires and keeping them under control,\" Mounties said in a news release.</p><p>Another alert was issued in Alberta on Monday for the rural subdivision of Bilby Common in Lac Ste. Anne County, west of Edmonton, but it has since been rescinded.</p><p>\u2014 By Ashley Joannou and Nono Shen in Vancouver, and Lauren Krugel in Calgary</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 22, 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-907ab6a4f64845fc9d98d1541cf3391e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BVY-5581-DY9S-T2WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><timeReceived>05:39 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 22, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Cariboo</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>British Columbia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Prairies/BC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>National</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GX055</classCode><className>VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Smoke plumes from forest fires in Quebec and northeastern Ontario will continue to affect the area, resulting in deteriorated air quality. Conditions are expected to improve for some areas Tuesday night or Wednesday.</p><p>According to the statement, issued at 4:16 p.m. on Saturday, June 24 and ending at 5:51 for South River - Burk's Falls before being re-issued at 7:01 a.m. and updated at 3:31 p.m. on June 27, high levels of air pollution are expected today and Wednesday due to smoke from forest fires. Smoke plumes from forest fires over northeastern Ontario and Quebec will move into the area this afternoon or tonight, resulting in deteriorated air quality. Conditions are expected to improve for some areas on Thursday.</p><p>Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerable from hour to hour.</p><p>Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.</p><p>For more details, please consult canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html.</p><p>Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.</p><p>People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.</p><p>Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.</p><p>Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.</p><p>If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.</p><p>Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.</p><p>If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.</p><p>Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.</p><p>Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.</p><p>If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA.</p><p>Visit airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.</p><p>Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for Almaguin, and here for North Bay - West Nipissing areas.</p><p>Lead</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20230627TMAC2023062768319080</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K1-SG01-F197-520N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"754\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Homeowners and private landowners are recommended to work with an insurance agency to have an assessment done by a qualified arborist on their private property.</p><p>Air quality may remain poor as a result of smoke from nearby fire activity. Those with respiratory issues, small children, and the elderly should consider this before they choose to return to the area.

The travelling smoke from those fires saw the local air quality health index - a one-to-10 scale based on the levels of various pollutants, such as fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ground-level ozone - reach as high as a Level 8, at which point it is advised for strenuous outdoor activities to be put on hold, especially if one begins to experience symptoms like coughing and throat irritation.</p><p>That smoke, according to a June 8 Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph (WDG) Public Health news release, \"can enter our lungs and bloodstream and cause serious health complications.\"</p><p>The fires causing the hazy skies are far from the only ones nationwide, with more than 2,200 wildfires and about four-millionhectares burnt, more than 450 times the size of Guelph, during the 2023 wildfire season. This is well above the 25-year average of 2.5 million hectares, with Ontario's forest fire season lasting through to the end of October.</p><p>The largest Ontario fire thus far, dubbed Red Lake 5, had burnt 12,742 hectares as of June 8. Speaking on June 5, national Minister of Emergency Preparedness Bill Blair said 2023 is shap- ing up to be one of, if not the, worst forest fire seasons in Canada's history. So what does this mean for Guelph and future forest fire seasons? The ongoing impact of climate change likely means the hazy skies of last week will be more common in the future.</p><p>\"The climate's warming in Canada. We've seen a long-term increase in the area burnt by forest fires, and there are a number of studies that demonstrate a clear link between climate warming and an increase in the area burned by forest fires,\"Nathan Gillett, a research scientist with the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis at Environment and Climate Change Canada, told the Mercury Tribune.</p><p>\"The warmer temperatures dry out the forest more quickly, and so forest fires can ignite more easily, they can spread more quickly when they do ignite - the link is pretty clear,\"said Gillett.</p><p>\"It won't happen every year, and there will be naysayers who say, 'Look, we didn't get any fires this year.'We expect that to happen, but we expect events like what we're experiencing now to be more common,\"said Ze'ev Gedalof, an associate professor researching forestry and climatology at the University of Guelph.</p><p>\"Things like widespread smoke, it's going to affect people from Guelph to New York state, where the forests aren't particularly flammable, but we are down wind from big fires.\"</p><p>While not guaranteed to happen every year, Gedalof said incoming smoke from faraway forest fires \"is probably our new normal.\"So what does a future with more stretches of hazy summer skies look like? And what can be done to mitigate those impacts? \"Many of us now have in our workplaces or in our homes some powerful HE-PA filters, so that will definitely help.

Marie. </p><p>Orazietti\u2019s journey into public service began in the 1990s when he served as a teacher and became a Sault city councillor (in Ward One) at just 28 years old. </p><p>After serving two terms on council, Orazietti pivoted into provincial politics and was elected as the MPP of Sault Ste. Marie in 2003. </p><p>As a member of the Ontario Liberal Party, Orazietti served four consecutive terms in this seat, while also filling several cabinet positions such as the Minister of Natural Resources, Minister of Government and Consumer Services and Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services. </p><p>Throughout his time in office, Orazietti\u2019s contributions to the community were recognized through various accolades, including the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012), the Sault Ste. Marie Chamber of Commerce President's Award (2016) and the Justice I.A. Vannini Award (2017). </p><p>Once he retired from politics in 2017, Orazietti returned to the education sector by becoming the dean of Sault College, where he oversaw its aviation, business, environment, culinary and trades and technology programs. </p><p>Orazietti then became Sault College's president this past summer following the retirement of Dr. Ron Common. </p><p>The City of Sault Ste. Marie has been handing out its Medal of Merit since 1969. </p><p>Recent recipients include the likes of artist Michael Burtch (2017), former mayor Steve Butland (2018), Lieutenant Colonel (ret) Lance Knox (2019), the Shingwauk Residential Schools Centre (2020) and Indigenous language keeper Barbara Nolan (2021). </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kdarbyson@postmedia.com\">kdarbyson@postmedia.com</email></p><p>The Local Journalism Initiative is made possible through funding from the federal government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-0dd1b331e9f64a57bd560f0e1ffd2bcc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B12-K261-JBVR-33PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"505\"/><timeReceived>04:47 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 1, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The 27-year-old man said he burned grass \"for fun\" and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to expand quickly.</p><p>Two blazes erupted Saturday in the zone around Chornobyl that was sealed after the 1986 explosion at the plant.</p><p>Firefighters said they managed Monday to put out the smaller of the two fires, which engulfed about five hectares (12 acres), but the second one continued burning, covering about 20 hectares (50 acres). They said they were using aircraft to extinguish the blaze.</p><p>The authorities said that radiation levels in the area engulfed by fires substantially exceeded normal levels, but the emergencies service said radiation levels in the capital, Kyiv, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) south, were within norms.</p><p>The 2,600-square-kilometre (1,000-square-mile) Chornobyl Exclusion Zone was established after the April 1986 disaster at the plant that sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over much of Europe. The zone is largely unpopulated, although about 200 people have remained despite orders to leave.</p><p>Blazes in the area have been a regular occurrence. Some of them start when residents set dry grass on fire in the early spring - a widespread practice in Ukraine, Russia and some other ex-Soviet nations that often leads to devastating forest fires.</p><p>Ukrainian police said that they beefed up patrols in the area around the Chornobyl zone to prevent new fires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-42196386aa6dc9fb664de5da7995ad70</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YKS-83B1-JBVR-346C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"281\"/><timeReceived>09:44 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 6, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Trump paints a darker picture. Will mismatched moods matter?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 At the top of his first speech as her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz turned to Vice President Kamala Harris and declared, \u201cThank you for bringing back the joy.\u201d The next day, Harris took the theme a step further, branding the Democratic ticket \u201cjoyful warriors.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Contrast that with former President Donald Trump, who opened a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida a few days later by saying, \u201cWe have a lot of bad things coming up,\" and predicting the U.S. could fall into an economic depression unseen since the dark days of 1929 or even another world war. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cI think that our country is, right now, in the most dangerous position it\u2019s ever been in, from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint,\" Trump said Thursday. </p><p>Democrats are playing up their sunnier outlook, promoting the idea that voters can be inspired to support someone and not just cast their ballot against the other side.

They reportedly still hold the western part of the town, which is the site of an important natural gas transit station.</p><p>The Ukrainian operation is taking place under tight secrecy, and its goals \u2014 especially whether Kyiv\u2019s forces aim to hold territory or are staging a raid \u2014 remain unclear. The stunning maneuver that caught the Kremlin\u2019s forces unawares counters Russia\u2019s unrelenting effort in recent months to punch through Ukrainian defenses at selected points along the front line in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>Russia has seen previous incursions into its territory during the nearly 2 1/2-year war, but the foray into the Kursk region marked the largest attack on its soil since World War II, embarrassing President Vladimir Putin and constituting a milestone in the hostilities.</p><p>___</p><p>Israel-Hamas war latest: Leaders of France, Germany and Britain endorse calls for cease-fire in Gaza</p><p>The leaders of France, Germany and Britain have endorsed calls for a cease-fire in Gaza, the return of scores of hostages held by Hamas and the \u201cunfettered\u201d delivery of humanitarian aid.</p><p>In a joint statement released Monday, they endorsed the latest push by the United States, Qatar and Egypt to broker an agreement to end the 10-month-old Israel-Hamas war.</p><p>The mediators have spent months trying to get the sides to agree to a three-phase plan in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages captured in its Oct. 7 attack in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and Israel would withdraw from Gaza.</p><p>\u201cThe fighting must end now, and all hostages still detained by Hamas must be released.

After 15 years in power, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country last week \u2014 chased out by young protesters, Prome among them, who say they are fed up with the way her increasingly autocratic rule has stifled dissent, favored the elite and widened inequalities.</p><p>Students initially poured into Bangladesh's streets in June, demanding an end to rules that set aside up to 30% of government jobs for the descendants of veterans who fought the country's 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. Protesters said that benefitted supporters of Hasina's Awami League, which led that struggle \u2014 and who already were part of the elite. The quota and others for marginalized groups meant only 44% of civil service jobs were awarded based on merit.</p><p>That such jobs lay at the center of the movement was no coincidence: They are some of the most stable and best paying in a country where the economy has boomed in recent years but not created enough solid, professional jobs for its well-educated middle class.</p><p>___</p><p>Major wildfire rages out of control on fringes of Greek capital; hundreds of firefighters deployed</p><p>ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 Hundreds of firefighters backed by more than 30 water-dropping planes were battling a major forest fire raging out of control Monday on the northern fringes of the Greek capital. Hospitals and residential suburbs were evacuated.</p><p>Fanned by strong winds, the blaze that began Sunday afternoon was racing through pine forests left tinder-dry by repeated heat waves this summer, coming on the heels of a particularly dry winter. June and July of this year were the hottest months ever recorded in Greece, which also recorded its warmest winter ever.</p><p>By mid-morning, the fire was burning mainly on two separate fronts, with some parts in particularly difficult to reach areas on a mountain northeast of Athens, Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said.</p><p>Authorities were faced with \u201can exceptionally dangerous fire, which we have been fighting for more than 20 hours under dramatic circumstances,\u201d Kikilias said. Conditions were exacerbated by the very strong winds.</p><p>The fire department said 670 firefighters, backed by 27 teams specially trained to tackle wildfires and including more than 80 members of the armed forces, were battling the flames. More than 180 vehicles were deployed, while more than 30 water-dropping planes and helicopters were providing aerial support.</p><p>___</p><p>After fire struck Maui's Upcountry, residents of one town looked to themselves to prep for next one</p><p>In the days after wildfire ripped through a rural neighborhood in the Maui mountain town of Kula, residents were determined to do what they could to prevent a repeat. With donated hoses and some impromptu training, some even learned how to open a standpipe to attack flames themselves if needed.</p><p>It\u2019s part of a self-reliance mindset that took hold after the blaze last August, when the Upcountry fire destroyed 19 homes. Since that blaze, which had firefighters trucking in water from elsewhere because of a loss in system pressure, the people of Kula are determined to do all they can to be ready for next time.</p><p>\u201cAnyone around who sees something, you\u2019re on duty,\u201d said Mark Ross, who lost a rental property where he had planned to retire with his wife. Ross, who is among residents who learned how to tap the standpipe from a retired fireman using donated hoses to stamp out hot spots for months after the fire, called the training \u201ckind of a lifeline for everybody who still lives in that neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>The fire that hit Kula was far smaller than the one that devastated the historic town of Lahaina, about 24 miles (about 38 kilometers) away. At least 102 people died in Lahaina, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century, and thousands of homes burned. </p><p>But what\u2019s happened in Kula in the year since has been a lesson in community-led recovery. Residents stood watch for months to protect their homes from flare-ups as roots smoldered underground. They cleared debris. They installed cameras to watch for signs of future fires. And they\u2019re working to restore burned forests, including launching a nursery for native plants aimed at reintroducing a native ecosystem to an area that had been overtaken by thirsty invasive trees.</p><p>___</p><p>Paris closes the Olympics, and Los Angeles turns to Tom Cruise for its 2028 mission</p><p>SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) \u2014 Setting out to prove that topping Paris isn\u2019t mission impossible, Los Angeles rolled out a skydiving Tom Cruise, Grammy winner Billie Eilish and other stars on Sunday as it took over Olympic hosting duties from the French capital, which closed out its 2024 Games just as they started \u2014 with joy and panache.</p><p>Capping two and a half extraordinary weeks of Olympic sports and emotion, Paris' boisterous, star-studded closing ceremony in France\u2019s national stadium mixed unbridled celebration with a somber call for peace from International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach.</p><p>Following in Paris' footsteps in 2028 promises to be a challenge: It made spectacular use of its cityscape for its first Games in 100 years, with the Eiffel Tower and other iconic monuments becoming Olympic stars in their own right as they served as backdrops and venues for medal-winning feats.</p><p>But the City of Angels, like the City of Light, showed that it, too, holds some aces.</p><p>Cruise \u2014 in his Ethan Hunt persona \u2014 wowed by descending from the top of the stadium to electric guitar \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d riffs.

And without much coaxing, they might help cut the grass. </p><p>Americans are showing more interest in owning miniature cows, goats, donkeys and other diminutive farm animals, a trend driven by hobby farmers looking for easy-to-manage livestock and homesteaders who like the idea of having a petite pig or a scaled-down sheep as a pet. </p><p>Animal breeders say sales of pint-sized farm animals have grown since the COVID-19 pandemic, when more people started raising backyard chickens for fun and fresh eggs. Like chickens, mini farm animals appeal to beginners who want the taste of a rugged, agrarian lifestyle.</p><p>\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have access to several acres, but if they have a one-acre plot, they can keep a miniature cow or a few miniature goats,\u201d said Brian Gazda, who has a small farm in East Idaho and with two friends runs a YouTube channel called \u201cHobby Farm Guys.\u201d </p><p>Platforms like YouTube and especially TikTok have played an important part in raising the profile of mini farm animals, said Martin Fysh, a vice president and divisional merchandising manager for rural lifestyle retailer Tractor Supply Co. On any given day, TikTok users put cuteness on parade with videos of tiny blue-eyed goats and 2-foot-tall horses that have received millions of views. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-7551e478c11e8798cf67cf1a58694ddf</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CPK-X7T1-JBVR-30F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2340\"/><timeReceived>06:04 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 12, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The military and the Canadian Coast Guard are also helping with equipment, he said.<br/><br/> The Canadian Press<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2023060368072522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CM-R7M1-JDV5-F2VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"384\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

The situation is so dire that the Alberta government is already asking key industries to cut back on their water allowances.<br/><br/> The threat of wildfires, the evil twin of drought, is also looming. So much so that the official forest fire season was moved up to the middle of February. That's because in the middle of winter, Alberta wildland firefighters are already battling 57 fires across the province.</p><p><br/><br/> \"We had over 60 wildfires that were carry-over wildfires from the 2023 season (the worst on record), which is incredibly high compared to what we typically see,\" explained Alberta Wildfire information officer Melissa Story.<br/><br/> But despite the action and millions being spent to mitigate these anticipated disasters, the words \"climate change\" never cross the lips of United Conservative Party (UCP) government officials and don't appear in any of its media releases. And perhaps even more alarming, many of the news articles detailing government action to combat drought and wildfires in Alberta don't mention climate change either.<br/><br/> Instead, the warming effect of the El Nino weather system is cited as the cause. But as the scientists, who study this know, it's the combination of climate change and El Nino that is causing such hot, dry weather and the resultant drought and forest fires. Even without El Nino it was clear that global warming was already underway.<br/><br/> Either government officials don't believe climate change is happening at a quicker rate than originally anticipated or they want to cover up the connection between the high carbon emissions spewed by the fossil fuel industry in Alberta and dangerous global warming. Never mind that the link has been proven again and again.<br/><br/> It's a different story across the border in B.C. That province has also been dealing with the impacts of climate change; record-breaking wildfires, some of which have encroached on cities such as fast-growing Kelowna; floods that have caused havoc for farmers, homeowners, and the province's highway system; and severe drought.<br/><br/> But NDP premier David Eby is not in denial about what has caused these disasters even though oil and natural gas extraction and LNG projects are all important to B.C.'s economy.<br/><br/>  \"British Columbia will be strong on climate, even if we're the only province in Canada standing strong on climate, because in British Columbia, we don't see another choice. Anyone who tells you that there's another choice is lying to you as a politician,\" he recently told the biennial Globe Forum which draws business leaders, policymakers and non-government organizations from far and wide to discuss sustainability issues.<br/><br/> So does that mean Alberta's UCP government is ignoring climate change because it would rather encourage the oil industry to keep pumping out oil no matter the consequences? Or is it simply ideological; resistance to any attempts to control the market economy.<br/><br/> Likely both factors are at play, just like in Louisiana where the petroleum industry also has a strong foothold. Parts of that state are rapidly sinking due to rising sea levels brought about by climate change. But the governor seems oblivious to it all.<br/><br/> Instead, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry is considering eliminating the state's climate change task force in favour of creating a better \"business climate,\" which means pumping and refining as much oil as possible.<br/><br/> And just like Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who automatically opposes any regulations the federal government introduces to cut carbon emissions, Landry is fighting U.S. President Joe Biden's plans to transition away from fossil fuels.<br/><br/> It would be so much more helpful for Albertans who will have to deal with ravaged farm lands, water shortages and wildfires if their government would simply face reality and stop pretending that these are just temporary inconveniences. They aren't.<br/><br/> The sooner the government climate deniers admit that, the sooner we can take action to possibly avoid the worst of what is to come.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2024022770751251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BF1-2481-F197-50KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"678\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

(AP) \u2014 The 200-foot wall of flames, the burning embers landing miles away and the carloads of evacuees fleeing to shelter at a high school \u2014 it all took place in New Jersey but could happen in almost every part of the country this week due to dry conditions and strong winds that have raised the danger of forest fires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As firefighters worked Wednesday to contain a fire that tore through 6 square miles (15 square kilometers) of New Jersey's Pine Barrens, the National Weather Service issued so-called \u201cred flag warnings\u201d on Wednesday for 20 states spanning the nation. The agency cautioned that dry, windy conditions similar to those in New Jersey were increasing the danger of forest fires elsewhere, too.</p><p>The blaze in Manchester, near Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, forced the evacuation of around 170 homes late Tuesday, with police and fire officials going door-to-door to ask people to take temporary shelter at a nearby high school. Helicopters were filling large containers with water from a nearby lake Wednesday and dropping it on the flames.</p><p>No one was injured and no homes were damaged, although firefighters said 20 structures were still considered threatened Wednesday afternoon, by which time the fire had been 60% contained.</p><p>\u201cWe saw the red glow in the sky, and every time the wind would shift, it got worse,\u201d said Jason Cylenica, who lives in the neighborhood closest to the fire. His wife, Cynthia Tiemper, said burning embers were landing in their back yard Tuesday night, making them decide to evacuate even before the fire department knocked on their door at 10:45 p.m.</p><p>\u201cWe left so fast I didn't even bring socks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018You grab the dog, I\u2019ll grab this and let's go.\u2019 When we got back here this morning and saw that everything was still here, it was like prayers had been answered.\"</p><p>Although the state is not in a drought, there's no chance of rain until the weekend in the part of New Jersey where the fire is burning. The state on Wednesday banned campfires and imposed restrictions on charcoal or gas fires.</p><p>April is the peak month for forest fires in New Jersey, officials said. And despite its status as the nation's most densely populated state, 40% of it is forest. There are about 1,500 wildfires a year in New Jersey, according to the state Forest Fire Service.</p><p>Forest fires are a common occurrence in the Pine Barrens, a 1.1 million-acre state and federally protected reserve about halfway between Philadelphia to the west and the Atlantic coast to the east. On Wednesday afternoon, the Forest Fire Service was responding to another blaze in West Milford in the northwest potion of the state near Route 23, but estimates of the size of that fire were not immediately available.</p><p>\u201cThis fire exhibited extreme fire behavior,\u201d John Cecil, an assistant commissioner in the state's Department of Environmental Protection, said of the Pine Barrens blaze. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be dramatic, but this was a severe situation that these guys and gals managed to keep in a place and protect lives and property from that.\u201d</p><p>About 75 firefighters, two helicopters, bulldozers and 15 fire engines were being used to battle the flames. </p><p>Greg McLaughlin, the Forest Fire Service chief, said the blaze began on the grounds of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, a military facility spanning several municipalities at about 4 p.m. Tuesday. Military personnel tried to extinguish it, but winds soon spread the fire beyond the base's perimeter and across a busy highway, Route 539, necessitating a large response from numerous municipalities in the region. </p><p>A cause of the fire wasn\u2019t given, but authorities said they\u2019re investigating.</p><p>In the parking lot of a firehouse miles away from the fire scene, McLaughlin held up a plastic bag filled with small pieces of charred wood \u2014 dead embers that had flown through the air over two miles away and threatened to start new fires.</p><p>Last month, a wildfire in the Pine Barrens threatened over a dozen homes in Little Egg Harbor, not far from the site of a massive forest fire in 2007 at an Air National Guard target range. That fire burned nearly 27 square miles (70 square kilometers). </p><p>Fire is an essential element of the Pine Barrens ecosystem; many of the pine trees there rely on heat from fires to release seeds from their cones, providing for the growth of new trees. </p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Michael Catalini in in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC\">www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-53677823ee4d7c49be9848cc7aed1e13</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:680S-43S1-JBVR-33GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><timeReceived>06:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 12, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Is the relative humidity low? Is the storm carrying rain? How hot is it? Are the winds off the mountain moving towards town? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If lightning strikes and thunder shudders through the valley, meteorologists with the BC Wildfire Service use the data to predict whether the storm is likely to spark a forest fire \u2014 and what that fire might look like on the ground.  </p><p>Every morning during the months-long fire season, Matt MacDonald, lead fire weather forecaster with the BC Wildfire Service, examines conditions with his team and hundreds of frontline firefighters. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing this whole analysis, essentially putting a story together that we deliver in the way of a fire weather briefing,\u201d MacDonald explained. \u201cWe\u2019re continuously updating the forecasts and making adjustments to how we think the weather is going to evolve, and then highlighting the areas of highest concern.\u201d </p><p>The service operates 240 weather stations around the province, strategically placed in forests and on mountains \u2014  including one on an alpine ridge near Smithers. These meteorologists, known as fire weather forecasters, assess conditions daily and sometimes hourly by monitoring data from weather stations and Environment Canada. Their analysis informs which hotspots to watch and decisions about where and when firefighters are deployed. </p><p>As the size, frequency, duration and intensity of wildfires increases, it\u2019s impossible to ignore how the burning forests around us shape our lives and impact our communities. Yet most of us know very little about what firefighters do on a daily basis or how decisions around wildfires \u2014 such as which homes to prioritize during firefighting response \u2014 are made. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of this secret world, in some ways, that people don\u2019t know much about,\u201d Kira Hoffman, a fire ecologist and researcher with the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions, said. \u201cI feel like we should know more about it. We should know how fires are fought.\u201d </p><p>Last year was B.C.\u2019s biggest wildfire season on record. Wildfires continue to escape our limited control, torching communities and displacing thousands, while reshaping vast parts of the province\u2019s landscapes. Part of the challenge is B.C.\u2019s vast and varied geography. </p><p>\u201cWe have complex topography, we have complex economies, we have complex cultures,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cAll of those need very specific place-based fire research and fire knowledge. We can\u2019t expect what\u2019s going to work in Vancouver to work in Hazelton.\u201d </p><p>MacDonald echoed the sentiment, describing the province as the \u201cepitome of complex terrain.\u201d The province has six regional fire centres, which are each divided into fire zones. There are 33 zones across the province.  </p><p>\u201cEach of these fire centres, each of these zones, each of these localities has their own intrinsic local effects and local climatology. Our work as fire weather forecasters is to try and really dig into the details and produce the best, most accurate forecasts we can for that very specific spot.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all trained meteorologists, but we look at weather through a somewhat different lens than your standard meteorologists,\u201d he said.  </p><p>MacDonald described humidity as a key driver of how the fuels that feed a fire evolve over time.  </p><p>\u201cOnce we have fire in the landscape [humidity] really dictates how intensely a fire will burn,\u201d he explained. </p><p>Relative humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapour in the air, which affects fire dynamics on the landscape. For example, low relative humidity sucks moisture out of potential fuels, making them more flammable. This especially affects finer fuels like grass and pine needles, where many wildfires begin. </p><p>The fire weather forecasters monitor moisture levels in both the materials above ground, which are called fine fuels, and the duff, the organic materials that make up the top 10 to 15 centimetres of the forest floor. Each is given a moisture code, informing analysis of how fire will interact with the landscape. The higher the code, the greater the risk. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll typically look at the duff moisture code as an indicator of the potential for ignition from lightning,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if we\u2019re forecasting lightning and it\u2019s falling into a place that\u2019s had a lot of rain, there\u2019s less concern.\u201d  </p><p>If the duff moisture codes are more elevated and lightning is forecasted, MacDonald said there\u2019s potential for either immediate ignition or what the wildfire service calls holdover fires.  </p><p>\u201cLightning likes to strike ridge tops, or tree tops, and then it\u2019ll smoulder, actually, through the root ball and that duff layer,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt can actually smoulder for upwards of two weeks. And then if the fuel is dry and we get a little bit of wind, these fires can flare up.\u201d </p><p>Holdover fires can burn through winter, flaring up again in the spring. They\u2019ve sometimes been described as \u201czombie fires,\u201d a term many firefighters dislike.   </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of alarmist, right?\u201d Jeff Walsh, a wildfire officer based in the Bulkley fire zone near Smithers, B.C., told The Narwhal. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a factual term that we use. Zombies have to die and come back to life. Holdover fires never died. Essentially, they just burrow underground so it\u2019s just a carryover between seasons \u2014 and they\u2019re not as rare as one would expect.\u201d </p><p>Drought makes holdover fires more prevalent; as the water table drops, fires can burrow deeper underground. In B.C.\u2019s northeast, multiple years of drought have made fighting those fires more hazardous. Walsh said most of this year\u2019s fires in the region, like the 145,000-hectare Patry Creek wildfire near Fort Nelson on Treaty 8 territory, are holdovers from the 2023 fire season.    </p><p>\u201cBecause the water table is typically higher in that marshy, \u2019skeggy country, like the Northern Rockies and North Peace, the spruce trees and deciduous [trees] are pretty shallow rooted,\u201d he said. When land isn\u2019t so parched, fire skims through those landscapes, burning the trees without scorching the wet root systems. \u201cBut because of the drought, the water table\u2019s lower and they dig in and actually burn \u2014 like completely consume all the roots of the trees.\u201d  </p><p>Getting into an area to clean up after that kind of fire moves through isn\u2019t easy. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s crews digging down six, seven feet,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s pictures of crews chasing smoke, digging holes, standing in these holes that are up to their chests at least.\u201d </p><p>And because the fires are burning tree roots, he said massive sections of burnt forest are being blown down after the fire moves through.  </p><p>\u201cIt just looks like a tornado went through there in terms of everything\u2019s on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re finding in that country, with the deep burning in the whole root systems, is basically the whole stand is compromised.\u201d </p><p>The BC Wildfire Service has strict safety protocols to protect its crews from falling trees. It means crews sometimes can\u2019t safely go into areas to clean up after a fire, which in turn increases the likelihood of fires left burning underground, ready to flare up again in dry winds and high temperatures. </p><p>While there have always been wildfires on the landscape, they are becoming bigger and more destructive.  </p><p>In 2021, the town of Lytton, B.C., burned and has yet to be rebuilt. Last year, fires swept through Scotch Creek, B.C., leaving a wake of devastation; this year, a wildfire razed about a third of the Jasper, Alta., townsite and scorched vast tracts of the national park\u2019s iconic forests. </p><p>MacDonald, who worked as an Environment Canada meteorologist for 18 years before joining the BC Wildfire Service in 2020, said he\u2019s witnessed underlying climatic conditions intensify over the past two decades.  </p><p>\u201cInstead of getting these ridges of high pressure that last three or four or five days, we get these really intense ridges \u2014 the recent one in July lasted 20 days and delivered excessive heat for prolonged periods of time.\u201d  </p><p>In forests, those high pressure ridges are causing unprecedented conditions. </p><p>\u201cWhen you hear guys who have 30 to 35 years under their belt say, \u2018I\u2019ve never seen fire behave this way, I\u2019ve never seen fire burn with that much intensity,\u2019 that\u2019s worth a lot in my books,\u201d he added. </p><p>The BC Wildfire Service has a long track record of protecting lives and preventing fires from destroying communities, but scientists expect wildfires will burn through more towns and villages \u2014 and even cities. Until recently, forest management focused on suppression \u2014 putting fires out as quickly as possible \u2014 which left combustible materials like dead trees and dry needles and branches to accumulate for decades, increasing the risk today. Along with the prohibition of Indigenous fire stewardship and the pervasive effects of climate change, experts say we\u2019re on a trajectory that can\u2019t be reversed overnight.  </p><p>But there are ways we can adapt and prepare. </p><p>Hannah Swift leads FireSmart BC, an organization that works to educate and provide support for wildfire preparedness, prevention and mitigation. She told The Narwhal it\u2019s important people understand they have some agency over what happens when a fire burns through their community. </p><p>\u201cPreviously, there was sort of a misunderstanding that if a wildfire gets into a community, there\u2019s nothing you can do,\u201d she said, noting there are numerous steps homeowners can take to protect their properties. </p><p>\u201cWhen we see wildfires move into communities, the majority of homes that are destroyed actually burn from the inside out, not the outside in,\u201d she said. A good place to start protecting properties is by installing \u201cmetal mesh covers over vents or openings in homes,\u201d she explained. </p><p>\u201cWhat we see is when embers come into a community, it\u2019s the embers that damage the home,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you have an ember shower coming over structures, generally those are brought through communities by wind. If there\u2019s an open gable in the attic, then embers actually get into the interior of the house, and they light up curtains or carpets. That\u2019s when the home burns from the inside out.\u201d </p><p>Even urban areas like Vancouver are not immune. In early August, underlying hot, dry conditions stoked the flames of a fire that consumed a half-built condominium in the city and sent flaming debris hurtling over the neighbourhood. As John Vaillant, author of Fire Weather, wrote for the Globe and Mail, \u201cembers were landing blocks away \u2026 where they had to be chased down and extinguished by additional personnel. It\u2019s dry here in August; just imagine if one of those had gotten away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re always going to see these events,\u201d Swift said. \u201cBut we can fire smart to a level where a fire can move through a community without any way of igniting the structures \u2014 by removing the fuels within that immediate zone of the home.\u201d Fuels include debris on roofs and leaves in gutters, she said.  </p><p>Swift said many communities in B.C. have programs in place through FireSmart BC that provide free assessments for property owners. With an assessment in hand, homeowners can look into rebates from local governments to cover the mitigation work, or do it themselves. Once a property is certified through a FireSmart program, owners can also talk to their insurance companies about discounts on premiums. </p><p>\u201cThere are insurers starting to partner with us, where they will offer either a rebate or a discount on yearly insurance rates to those homeowners who have taken action and completed all of those recommended steps to mitigate their home,\u201d she said.  </p><p>Swift said the members of the BC Wildfire Service are highly skilled at protecting structures and will implement protection measures like rooftop sprinklers during what\u2019s called an \u201cinterface fire,\u201d which has the potential to simultaneously burn buildings and forest fuel or vegetation. But they only have so much capacity, she said, noting firefighters on the ground have to make tough decisions about which homes to prioritize saving. </p><p>\u201cThe sprinklers are the cherry on top of mitigation work that\u2019s already taken place,\u201d she said, choosing her words carefully as she explained the process. \u201cBut if a property hasn\u2019t been mitigated \u2014 well, sprinklers are going to be less effective.\u201d  </p><p>She said firefighters will focus their efforts on protecting properties most likely to survive, which tend to be homes that have already applied FireSmart principles.  </p><p>That doesn\u2019t mean the crews on the ground and behind the scenes aren\u2019t doing everything they possibly can to protect all homes in communities. MacDonald said his team receives specific fire weather forecast requests whenever a wildfire gets close to where people live. </p><p>\u201cWhenever these fires pose a threat to values, like community infrastructure values or sometimes Indigenous values, cultural values, we\u2019ll get a spot request,\u201d he said. Values can refer to things like bridges, homes, businesses, sacred sites and important hunting or trapping areas. </p><p>\u201cThis is a very detailed, comprehensive look at the area, and very detailed forecasts of all those weather elements, like the temperatures, the wind, precipitation and chance of lightning, and how that\u2019s all going to evolve over the next 72 hours. So it enables the team who\u2019s been deployed to that fire to really assess and strategize how they\u2019re going to respond and attack this fire.\u201d  </p><p>Walsh said the BC Wildfire Service has people throughout the province \u201cthinking about and looking at every fire start that happens, whether it\u2019s on site or in an office, making assessments around potential impacts and then making tough decisions around where resources go.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe have the same tensions as everybody in the community \u2014 we want to see your community safe.\u201d </p><p>Last year, four firefighters were killed during wildfire response across Canada and an additional four died in a car accident while returning from a shift on the B.C. fireline. This year, a 24-year-old firefighter with the Alberta Wildfire service died while responding to the Jasper fire. These tragic losses of lives are rare. Within the world of wildfire response, safety protocols include specialized fire weather forecasts from people like MacDonald and his team. </p><p>MacDonald said the ever-changing dynamics around wildfire response means there\u2019s a constant back and forth between his team of forecasters and the crews on the ground \u2014 and his team regularly provides specific safety forecasts to support firefighters on the front lines through radio communications. </p><p>\u201cFor our firefighters who are out there, we will issue two types of weather warnings,\u201d he said.  </p><p>The first is a wind warning \u2014 and the wildfire service\u2019s definition of strong winds is considerably lower than Environment Canada\u2019s criteria. \u201cIn the forest environment, sustained winds of 30 kilometres an hour can actually be enough to start pushing over trees, particularly drought-stricken trees.\u201d The second is for thunderstorms, as lightning strikes can exacerbate an already-raging fire. </p><p>Hoffman, a former firefighter with the BC Wildfire Service who now supports Indigenous communities in revitalizing cultural burning practices, said it\u2019s easy to forget most people don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be on a fire line. Fighting fire has been such a big part of her life \u2014 but increasingly, wildfires are a part of everyone else\u2019s reality, too. </p><p>\u201cThere will be more Jaspers, there will be more Lyttons \u2014 there\u2019s no way we can live in this province and not have that happen,\u201d she said. </p><p>As wildfires impact more communities every year, frontline firefighters are facing increasing pressures. As The Narwhal reported last year, the firefighter turnover rate in B.C. and Alberta is around 50 per cent or higher. </p><p>\u201cI think we need to spend more time appreciating the people who are doing this,\u201d Hoffman added. \u201cBecause if we don\u2019t value the people, we\u2019re going to get into more mental health situations, more issues where there\u2019s just not enough support for those first responders.\u201d  </p><p>Firefighters are doing the best they can, she said. </p><p>\u201cI think that we just need more respect for that.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-ddfd2fb1136c4448ad741407347de0c2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CSR-MH11-DY9S-T0V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2723\"/><timeReceived>12:04 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 21, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Army clearing machinery and volunteers are supporting efforts on the ground. <br/> The state civil protection agency on Thursday had said hundreds of people had been evacuated from over a dozen villages and hamlets in the surrounding area, as well as from local monasteries. <br/> Two more hamlets were evacuated on Friday as a precaution, a fire spokeswoman told AFP. <br/> To indicate the speed of the fire, Hardalias said it had crossed 10.3 kilometres (6.4 miles) in less than five hours on Thursday. <br/> Fire-fighting efforts have been complicated by the lack of access roads in some areas. <br/><br/>- 'Total disaster' - <br/><br/>'The fire got to within five kilometres of Megara' on Thursday, a local resident told Skai TV, referring to a nearby coastal town. <br/> 'Vineyards, cottages, crops have been burned, it's a total disaster many of my friends have had their homes burned,' he said. <br/> 'We were here (last) night. By around 9:10 pm (1810 GMT) the game was lost, flames were leaping five metres high. We had to leave, and we came back at two in the morning,' another man told Skai near the remains of his home, some embers still smoking. <br/> Officials said a number of properties have been destroyed, but declined to give precise figures before the fire was extinguished completely. <br/> The blaze started late on Wednesday in the Corinthian Gulf village of Schinos, apparently by someone burning vegetation in an olive grove, the civil protection agency said. <br/> Smoke from the fire choked Athens on Thursday with ash falling from the sky. <br/> The national observatory in Athens said the smoke had reached the Cycladic islands as far as Ikaria. The health ministry recommended people limit physical activity and close doors and windows. <br/> 'We could say the atmosphere (on Thursday) was 10 times more toxic' than usual,' observatory senior researcher Nikos Michalopoulos told Open TV. <br/> Wildfires pose a challenge for Greece every year during the dry summer season, with strong winds and temperatures frequently exceeding 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). <br/> Hardalias on Friday said the Geraneia mountains fire broke out relatively early in the season, around a month before Greece has scheduled to have its water bomber fleet at full strength on June 15. <br/> An equivalent fire in mid-May had occurred 20 years earlier on the island of Samos, he said. <br/> In 2018, 102 people died in the coastal resort of Mati, near Athens, in Greece's worst ever fire disaster. <br/> The post Greek firefighters 'cautiously optimistic' of subduing forest fire[1] appeared first on Digital Journal[2]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/greek-firefighters-cautiously-optimistic-of-subduing-forest-fire/article\">https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/greek-firefighters-cautiously-optimistic-of-subduing-forest-fire/article</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com\">https://www.digitaljournal.com</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO100903162160204294025876100173</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62R7-NXV1-JCMN-Y01M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><timeReceived>1:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 21, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000DAPH</classCode><className>MALLINCKRODT PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>MNK (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

The bulletin was issued Thursday (Feb. 8).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Drought hazards are especially pronounced in areas with low snowpack, including Vancouver Island, the South Coast and the Lower Fraser.</p><p>\"Extremely low seasonal runoff forecasts for the Okanagan, Kalamalka-Wood, Nicola Lake and Nicola River are also indicative of elevated seasonal drought hazards,\" it reads.</p><p>The report points out that two to three months still remain in the snow season, but its tone is not optimistic.</p><p>\"While conditions may change slightly over this period, current trends in low snowpack are expected to persist,\" it reads.</p><p>While the latest figures mark an improvement from the first bulletin of 2024, January's snow event was not enough to create seasonal conditions, never mind make up the gap from the previous survey. The Jan. 1 figures showed snowpack levels below 44 per cent.</p><p>RELATED: B.C.'s snow-pack 44% below normal on heels of worst drought in recent memory</p><p>All basins (minus the Northwest with no data available) are below norms with the Stikine (minus 10 per cent) closest to the norm. The Okanagan (minus 14 per cent) and the South Thompson (minus 19 per cent) also recorded snowpacks above 80 per cent of normal.</p><p>The gaps in the snowpack are especially pronounced in B.C.'s most populated parts. Vancouver Island is 70 below normal, while the South Coast is down 59 per cent from normal.</p><p>The Skagit basin at the border between the Fraser Valley and the Similkameen is at 100 per cent below normal. Overall, nine snow stations measured all-time lows for their period of record.</p><p>A historical look back underscores the widespread lack of snow. Last year, on Feb. 1, the average of all snow stations in British Columbia was 79 per cent of normal, compared to 61 per cent on Feb. 1, 2024.</p><p>\"Snow basin indices are much lower this year compared to 2023 due to very dry and warm conditions through the snow accumulation season,\" it reads.</p><p>Looking ahead, the report speaks of \"very high likelihood (60 to 100 per cent chance)\" of above normal temperatures across all of B.C. over the February through April period to prevailing climatic conditions, including the current El Nin~o phenomenon.</p><p>Speaking Thursday morning at an unrelated event, Premier David Eby said he is really worried about the summer ahead.</p><p>\"The weather that we are having is so unpredictable and so extreme right now, that the economic\u2026and human impacts in our province, feel so much more acute,\" he said. \"We are the early warning sign for the rest of Canada with what is coming with climate change.\"</p><p>He added preparations for the summer continue. They include implementing recommendations emerging from the wildfire task force appointed last year, he added. B.C. will also look to the federal government for continued support around military resources, he said, adding that B.C. will also do what it can to support other jurisdictions.</p><p>\"We know they help us when we are in our forest fire season as well and we do what we can to help each other out in this remarkable time we live in,\" he said.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20240208PAB4569249</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B93-FMH1-JD2C-J02V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"571\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Group Ltd.

Bring lawn chairs, games, a book to read \u2014 whatever you'd like to spend time doing, as you relax and mingle in our pop-up town square.</p><p>Town squares are the traditional heart of a city, and for centuries have been an integral part of human settlements and play a significant role in enhancing community life. Residents of Nelson and area are invited to come and imagine what a town square or park situated in the heart of downtown Nelson could look and feel like.</p><p>There will also be opportunities to speak with others around topics such as the Official Community Plan, better public transportation, and how we could explore making parts of downtown Nelson more pedestrian friendly, an idea that surfaced very strongly in recent community input around public space in Nelson.</p><p>Join your community in making our Sunday Town Square an enjoyable and successful experience for everyone!

Fire officials said about 80 acres (30 hectares) had burned by Monday.</p><p>A helicopter and 40 firefighters were working to put the fire out Monday, officials said. Greg McLaughlin, chief of the New Jersey Forest Fires Service, said no injuries have been reported.</p><p>A cause for the fire had not been determined, officials said.</p><p>Chris Franek, the state forest fire service's assistant division fire warden, said fires on similar terrain usually burn upward but that Sunday's fire, which started below a trail at an elevation of about 1,400 feet burned downhill because the trail area is rocky and without abundant vegetation. He said fires are rare there at this time of year because the area usually has a layer of snow.</p><p>Incident Commander Eric Weber told WFMZ-TV the ground crews operating at night had to contend with difficult terrain. A helicopter dropped water on the fire Sunday, officials said.</p><p>\"It's pretty steep and rugged,\" Weber said. \"It's probably the steepest terrain in the entire state of New Jersey.\"</p><p>Pictures and video shared Sunday on social media showed a wall of flames not far from Interstate 80, which carries traffic to and from New York City and goes through the water gap. It was backed up in both directions.</p><p>Some delays were reported during the Monday morning commute, but officials said the highway was open in both directions. They warned, though, that smoky conditions would likely remain until at least Tuesday and flames would also be visible.</p><p>The fire broke out on a sunny February day that saw unusually mild.

The health ministry recommended people limit physical activity and close doors and windows. <br/> Another fire broke out Thursday in Viotia, central Greece. <br/><br/>- Difficult terrain - <br/><br/>Bleary-eyed villagers said they barely had time to dress as they were brought from nearby communities to the coastal Corinthian Gulf village of Alepochori for safety. <br/> 'I was woken up by the sound of the planes. I was startled and my husband told me there was a fire,' local resident Irini Lianou told AFP. <br/> 'We had no electricity and we rushed outside. There was panic, with the planes and helicopters, the police and ambulances everywhere,' she added. <br/> In the village of Kato Alepochori, police used loudhailers to tell residents to leave. <br/> Fire service chief Stefanos Kolokouris said reinforcements had been rushed in from around the country to contain the blaze, which local officials said had a front 10 kilometres wide. <br/> 'It's a large fire in a pine forest (and the) terrain is difficult,' Kolokouris told Skai TV. <br/> 'This is a dense forest that had never burned before,' Yiorgos Gionis, mayor of the neighbouring resort town of Loutraki, told Alpha TV. <br/> Kolokouris said he believed the fire could be brought under control during the day. <br/> But the winds picked up in the afternoon. <br/><br/>- First major fire this year - <br/><br/>Many people have summer homes in the area, but lives are not under immediate threat, fire officials said. <br/> However, electricity has been out in the area and it could take 48 hours to restore service, according to state grid technicians on the scene. <br/> 'This is the first major fire of 2021 communities have been evacuated as a precaution,' fire department spokesman Vassilis Vathrakogiannis had earlier told Skai. <br/> 'We have no information ( people's lives threatened) and we have not had to rescue anyone,' he said. <br/> Over 180 firemen with 62 fire engines in addition to volunteers have been deployed to the area, backed by 17 planes and three helicopters, the fire service tweeted. <br/> A handful of homes are believed to have been burned, the Loutraki mayor said. <br/> The fire on Wednesday had reached the sea, burning two boats in the coastal village of Mavrolimni, local officials said. <br/> Wildfires pose a challenge for Greece every year during the dry summer season, with strong winds and temperatures frequently exceeding 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). <br/> In 2018, 102 people died in the coastal resort of Mati, near Athens, in Greece's worst ever fire disaster. <br/> The post Greek villages evacuated as forest fire rages[1] appeared first on Digital Journal[2]. <br/> [ 1]: <url

Because ultimately whatever we have, at the provincial or federal level, has to respond to the emergency. We need to get that right.\"</p><p>Multiple reports have shown that climate change is leading to more frequent and more severe weather events. </p><p>In the last three summers, Canada has seen record temperatures, severe droughts, massive flooding, hurricanes and, in 2023, the worst wildfire season ever.</p><p>Since the beginning of the year, more than 18.5 million hectares \u2014 or 185,000 square kilometres \u2014 of land burned.</p><p>That is nearly 2.5 times more than the previous record of 7.6 million hectares set in 1989, and more than nine times the average area burned annually over the last 25 years.</p><p>Every region of Canada felt it, with tens of thousands of people evacuated and several thousand homes and other structures destroyed. Poor air quality warnings forced people indoors for days, if not weeks, at a time.</p><p>With many regions seeing lower-than-usual precipitation this fall, the conditions are shaping up for high risk of another bad fire season next summer.</p><p>Canada relied heavily on international firefighters coming in to help, as well as the military. </p><p>Gen. Wayne Eyre, the chief of the defence staff, has made clear the military is being relied on too much and too often for domestic deployments.</p><p>The government doesn't disagree with that sentiment, but it currently doesn't have many other options.</p><p>The Canadian Press first reported in June that Canada was studying options for creating a national response agency. </p><p>At the time, a task force comprising the ministers of environment, natural resources, emergency management and public safety was meeting to suss out the possibilities.</p><p>Over the past five months since he took over the emergency preparedness file, Sajjan has spent a lot of time meeting with experts, local community leaders and provincial agencies, he said, in an attempt to identify gaps and seek input on what could work better. </p><p>Canada is one of the few G7 countries without a national emergency co-ordinating agency of some kind. </p><p>The United States has the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which operates within the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>Germany has the Interministerial Panel on National Crisis Management, which co-ordinates crisis management between states.</p><p>Australia, which is not part of the G7 but has shared fire resources with Canada numerous times, has its National Emergency Management Agency.</p><p>Sajjan said there are some lessons to be learned from the FEMA model in the U.S., but he seemed more interested in examining the German and Australian agencies. Both of them lean heavily on local and regional resources, and play more of a co-ordinating role.</p><p>The minister said he anticipates running some pilot projects in 2024 that would start by building off of existing organizations, like the Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada.</p><p>\"Because this way we can immediately respond to the emergencies without having to wait for years to build something up to respond,\" he said.</p><p>His vision leans toward local-level civilian reserve forces that can respond quickly and be shared when needed.</p><p>\"Germany actually has a model like this, and I'm quite impressed,\" he said.</p><p>\"But we have a lot of work to do to get a better understanding how it works.

Because ultimately whatever we have, at the provincial or federal level, has to respond to the emergency. We need to get that right.\"</p><p>Multiple reports have shown that climate change is leading to more frequent and more severe weather events.</p><p>In the last three summers, Canada has seen record temperatures, severe droughts, massive flooding, hurricanes and, in 2023, the worst wildfire season ever.</p><p>Since the beginning of the year, more than 18.5 million hectares \u2014 or 185,000 square kilometres \u2014 of land burned.</p><p>That is nearly 2.5 times more than the previous record of 7.6 million hectares set in 1989, and more than nine times the average area burned annually over the last 25 years.</p><p>Every region of Canada felt it, with tens of thousands of people evacuated and several thousand homes and other structures destroyed. Poor air quality warnings forced people indoors for days, if not weeks, at a time.</p><p>With many regions seeing lower-than-usual precipitation this fall, the conditions are shaping up for high risk of another bad fire season next summer.</p><p>Canada relied heavily on international firefighters coming in to help, as well as the military.</p><p>Gen. Wayne Eyre, the chief of the defence staff, has made clear the military is being relied on too much and too often for domestic deployments.</p><p>The government doesn't disagree with that sentiment, but it currently doesn't have many other options.</p><p>The Canadian Press first reported in June that Canada was studying options for creating a national response agency.</p><p>At the time, a task force comprising the ministers of environment, natural resources, emergency management and public safety was meeting to suss out the possibilities.</p><p>Over the past five months since he took over the emergency preparedness file, Sajjan has spent a lot of time meeting with experts, local community leaders and provincial agencies, he said, in an attempt to identify gaps and seek input on what could work better.</p><p>Canada is one of the few G7 countries without a national emergency co-ordinating agency of some kind.</p><p>The United States has the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which operates within the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>Germany has the Interministerial Panel on National Crisis Management, which co-ordinates crisis management between states.</p><p>Australia, which is not part of the G7 but has shared fire resources with Canada numerous times, has its National Emergency Management Agency.</p><p>Sajjan said there are some lessons to be learned from the FEMA model in the U.S., but he seemed more interested in examining the German and Australian agencies. Both of them lean heavily on local and regional resources, and play more of a co-ordinating role.</p><p>The minister said he anticipates running some pilot projects in 2024 that would start by building off of existing organizations, like the Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada.</p><p>\"Because this way we can immediately respond to the emergencies without having to wait for years to build something up to respond,\" he said.</p><p>His vision leans toward local-level civilian reserve forces that can respond quickly and be shared when needed.</p><p>\"Germany actually has a model like this, and I'm quite impressed,\" he said.</p><p>\"But we have a lot of work to do to get a better understanding how it works.

Premier David Eby walked in to the Starbucks at Quinsam Crossing, he was followed by a coterie of other MLAs, assistants and RCMP.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He sat down after ordering a coffee, and remarked on how nice and new the building looked. It was Eby's first stop, albeit an unofficial one, on his trip to Campbell River to be part of the official signing of an agreement between the Nanwakolas Council and Western Forest Products to manage timber in the North Island.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This is a celebration of a really important forestry agreement between Western Forest Products and the local First Nations and its really a template for what we hope to do across the province,\" he said.</p><p>\"Its really a template for what we hope to do across the province: agreements between Nations and forestry supported by the local community where there's economic development and opportunity and stability particularly for the forest industry, which we know is facing a lot of challenges right now around price and availability of trees.</p><p>\"So this is exactly what we're looking for that kind of alignment of interest where the community comes out the net winner and First Nations are recognized and environmental values are protected,\" he said.</p><p>The signing of the agreement comes after more than 2.84 million hectares of forest and land burned in 2023, and some fires carried on burning through the winter despite the snow. According to a report by the Auditor General of Canada, \"because of climate change, forest fires in Canada are expected to get bigger and happen more often. Canada's forests are becoming a net source of emissions because of forest fires and disturbances caused by insect outbreaks, such as the mountain pine beetle. In some recent years, forest fires and insect disturbances have released over 200 Mt CO2 eq per year to the atmosphere.\"</p><p>\"It's a pretty dire situation across the province,\" Eby said. \"There's a lot of parts of the province in the most extreme level of drought we've had a lot of fires burning over the winter under the snow.</p><p>\"The really remarkable thing about wood products is that they're part of the climate solutions,\" he said. \"So instead of using steel or concrete which are very carbon-intensive with products have the potential to sequester carbon as well as reduce the carbon footprint of new buildings and construction. So we've really been emphasizing mass-timber construction and developing mass timber industry here in British Columbia.\"</p><p>RELATED: Shuswap group pleased to see wildfire concerns recognized by B.C. task force</p><p>Eby said that so far, over 2,000 people have applied to fight forest fires for the upcoming season. The province recently updated the emergency preparedness act, part of which was discussed in a recently held BC Townhalls Event.</p><p>\"One of the realities in an emergency \u2026 is that people might be away on vacation,\" he said. \"They might own a property that is a vacation home itself, and they're not there full-time. It's very difficult for firefighters to get permission to go on the land and fight the fire to protect those homes. The law has to provide them with a shield to be able to go in and fight the fire \u2026 I would be glad for firefighters to go in to any property that I would be so fortunate as to own, to fight a forest fire.\"</p><p>Wildfire and disaster management is not the only concern on the minds of North Islanders going into the 2024 election season. Eby acknowledged the overdose crisis, the healthcare crisis, affordability and housing, saying that these problems are bigger than even B.C.</p><p>\"We're regularly in contact with Alberta, Washington State and other jurisdictions that are dealing with (the opioid crisis) to find out are they trying something that's working really well and and how can we learn from what they're doing? And we hope they're doing the same with us because nobody has found the silver bullet yet.\"</p><p>Despite some changes in B.C.'s political landscape, Eby's NDP party is polling ahead with 43 per cent of undecided votes.</p><p>\"The focus of our government right now is is on the legislative session. We're in right now about dealing with the issues that are important to British Columbians.

I watched every special and flick I could find. When I finally got my library card at age eight, I was checking out books by the bagloads, learning about all things prehistoric.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When you\u2019re a dinosaur kid, you become very familiar with mass extinctions, which are frightfully common in the Earth\u2019s geological history. In summary:Some change in global conditions, either a massive release of carbon dioxide and methane (and oxygen in one case) into the atmosphere, continental drift, one or more invasive species, or, on rare occasions a foreign body like a meteor or major geological disaster causes local circumstances in an ecosystem to change enough so whatever is living in that ecosystem can\u2019t sustain itself anymore.</p><p>Usually the creatures that have the hardest time are the ones which take the longest to breed the next generation, which in our current time includes humans. The last mass extinction before the industrial revolution was the loss of the megafauna \u2014 mammoths, woolly rhinoceros, and short faced bears in our neck of the woods, which evidence suggests was caused by the spread of humans across the planet who slashed and burned heavy foliage along the way to build their homes.</p><p>I bring this up as we are entering another week of Inuvik being encased in a cloud of smog from a nearby forest fire which, at least as of this writing, is not poised to burn the town to a crisp. Regardless, I strongly recommend you wear an N95 mask when you go outside, as forest fire smoke is very different from smoking tobacco or cannabis. This is ash and soot, the charred remains of tree bark and furry little animals. You really don\u2019t want to breathe that in.</p><p>But, unfortunately, we collectively made our choice, deciding that enriching a select few of us was more important than ensuring the long-term viability of civilization. Now, we\u2019re clearly in the \u201cfind out\u201d phase.</p><p>As it turns out, climate change isn\u2019t just no more glaciers. It\u2019s also runaway inflation as climate disasters and crop failures disrupt supply chains. Of course, any comment on inflation needs to point out costs of goods have been artificially kept low for decades by globalization, where we used gigantic greenhouse gas emitting transport vessels to move goods from economies with low valued currency to our privileged shores. Not only did this create widespread inequality across the Earth, it also accelerated climate change.</p><p>If you think things are bad now, just wait until there\u2019s droughts across the Midwest of the United States, also known as the breadbasket of North America. Inflation will seem like a minor problem when there is no food available. Here in the North we\u2019re slightly insulated against food shortages thanks to the hunting and on the land culture which still exists up here \u2014 so long as the land cooperates. But as reported a few weeks ago in the Inuvik Drum, living on the land is likely going to look extremely different in 2050 than it does today.</p><p>Another aspect of climate change people need to realize is that as reality sets in and areas become simply too hot for human habitation, those humans are going to move to places they can survive, meaning heading towards the poles. This will put massive pressure on our own supply chains and infrastructure, assuming the people who migrate here in desperation come peacefully.</p><p>We\u2019re already at the point where floods and heat are killing people. It just gets worse from here. We need to start taking climate change seriously.</p><p>Now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLEHFP-news20230817UAEA0003803330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YP-BW81-F0HF-83R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"586\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Premier David Eby walked in to the Starbucks at Quinsam Crossing, he was followed by a coterie of other MLAs, assistants and RCMP.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He sat down after ordering a coffee, and remarked on how nice and new the building looked. It was Eby's first stop, albeit an unofficial one, on his trip to Campbell River to be part of the official signing of an agreement between the Nanwakolas Council and Western Forest Products to manage timber in the North Island.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This is a celebration of a really important forestry agreement between Western Forest Products and the local First Nations and its really a template for what we hope to do across the province,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's really a template for what we hope to do across the province: agreements between Nations and forestry supported by the local community where there's economic development and opportunity and stability particularly for the forest industry, which we know is facing a lot of challenges right now around price and availability of trees.</p><p>\"So this is exactly what we're looking for that kind of alignment of interest where the community comes out the net winner and First Nations are recognized and environmental values are protected,\" he said.</p><p>The signing of the agreement comes after more than 2.84 million hectares of forest and land burned in 2023, and some fires carried on burning through the winter despite the snow. According to a report by the Auditor General of Canada, \"because of climate change, forest fires in Canada are expected to get bigger and happen more often. Canada's forests are becoming a net source of emissions because of forest fires and disturbances caused by insect outbreaks, such as the mountain pine beetle. In some recent years, forest fires and insect disturbances have released over 200 Mt CO2 eq per year to the atmosphere.\"</p><p>\"It's a pretty dire situation across the province,\" Eby said. \"There's a lot of parts of the province in the most extreme level of drought we've had a lot of fires burning over the winter under the snow.</p><p>\"The really remarkable thing about wood products is that they're part of the climate solutions,\" he said. \"So instead of using steel or concrete, which are very carbon-intensive, wood products have the potential to sequester carbon as well as reduce the carbon footprint of new buildings and construction. So we've really been emphasizing mass-timber construction and developing mass timber industry here in British Columbia.\"</p><p>RELATED: Shuswap group pleased to see wildfire concerns recognized by B.C. task force</p><p>Eby said that so far, over 2,000 people have applied to fight forest fires for the upcoming season. The province recently updated the emergency preparedness act, part of which was discussed in a recently held BC Townhalls Event.</p><p>\"One of the realities in an emergency \u2026 is that people might be away on vacation,\" he said. \"They might own a property that is a vacation home itself, and they're not there full-time. It's very difficult for firefighters to get permission to go on the land and fight the fire to protect those homes. The law has to provide them with a shield to be able to go in and fight the fire \u2026 I would be glad for firefighters to go in to any property that I would be so fortunate as to own, to fight a forest fire.\"</p><p>Wildfire and disaster management is not the only concern on the minds of North Islanders going into the 2024 election season. Eby acknowledged the overdose crisis, the healthcare crisis, affordability and housing, saying that these problems are bigger than even B.C.</p><p>\"We're regularly in contact with Alberta, Washington State and other jurisdictions that are dealing with (the opioid crisis) to find out are they trying something that's working really well and and how can we learn from what they're doing? And we hope they're doing the same with us because nobody has found the silver bullet yet.\"</p><p>Despite some changes in B.C.'s political landscape, Eby's NDP party is polling ahead with 43 per cent of undecided votes.</p><p>\"The focus of our government right now is is on the legislative session. We're in right now about dealing with the issues that are important to British Columbians. We'll be going with the fixed date election in October,\" he said. \"We'll present the direction that we're going and the progress that we've made the piece we put in place. All the big issues are not going to be solved by October.</p><p>\"I want to under promise and over deliver,\" he said, laughing.</p><p>Eby posed for a photo outside of the coffee shop, and went back inside to prepare for the next stop on his itinerary.</p><p>Through the discussion, Eby had barely touched his coffee.</p><p>RELATED: NDP lead 'sustained, substantial' in B.C.'s 'shifting political landscape': poll</p><p>Nanwakolas Council, WFP announce 'Landmark' forestry agreement</p><p>Copyright 2024 Campbell River Mirror</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPRIV-news20240405PCB4589402</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPRIV2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BR8-7WN1-F0HF-84G1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Among those were major wildfires in British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the climate changes, Canada is experiencing longer fire seasons with more severe and complex fires that are more expensive to manage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's a look at the most urgent situations in Western Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fort Nelson, B.C. fires rage on as First Nation's evacuation order lifts</p><p>As of Monday, B.C. continued to battle two wildfires of note in the northeastern part of the province, where some evacuation orders remained in place.</p><p>The Canadian Press reported that the mayor of the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality in British Columbia said drones were endangering helicopters being used to fight wildfires near Fort Nelson.</p><p>Rob Fraser said helicopter pilots fighting wildfires are under an immense amount of stress and cannot be looking out for drones, warning \"they will cause these guys to crash.\"</p><p>People caught using drones in the wildfire evacuation areas will be prosecuted \"to the biggest limit\" possible, Fraser said.</p><p>In total, there were 119 wildfires on Monday; ten out-of-control fires, four being held and 105 fires under control. Five wildfires were declared in the last 24 hours and 41 were declared in the last seven days.</p><p>Overall, there were six evacuation orders and six alerts. Evacuation orders remained in place for the broader Northern Rockies Regional Municipality, the Fort Nelson First Nation and the Lytton First Nation. </p><p>At the nearby Doig River First Nation, an evacuation order was downgraded to an alert, and people were urged to stay prepared if another evacuation order is issued.</p><p>The province had 425 firefighting personnel, two incident management teams, 42 aviation resources, 17 pieces of heavy equipment and 48 resources of structure protection.</p><p>The BC Wildfire Service said Monday that favourable weather in the upcoming days in the province's northeast will help crews make progress, but the drought means conditions are still unseasonably dry.</p><p>Manitobans forced to leave get more support after returning home</p><p>The 675 people from Cranberry Portage and surrounding areas who were cleared to return home on Sunday after wildfires forced an evacuation of their communitiy last week may be eligible to receive emergency financial support, the Manitoba government says.</p><p>That's in addition to support offered by Emergency Social Services when evacuations extend beyond three days, including direct costs for accommodations and help with meal and transportation costs, The Canadian Press reported Saturday.</p><p>The fire near Flin Flon remained about 370 square kilometres in size on Friday, but officials said the fireline closest to Cranberry Portage was under control.</p><p>As of Sunday, five fires burned in the province, including one out-of-control fire, according to the provincial government. Efforts to quell the blazes included the use of six water bombers, 14 helicopters and three other aircraft.

Wildfire Service announced Thursday.</p><p>The Parker Lake wildfire remained 2.5 kilometres southwest of Fort Nelson, with minimal growth, while the Patry Creek wildfire remained 25 kilometres north, the service announced.</p><p>The rain created favourable conditions for the next several days, but was not enough to break the long-term drought.</p><p>Encroaching B.C. fires prompt evacuation, 4,700 people forced to fleeTwo out-of-control wildfires in Northern B.C. prompted an evacuation order for the town of Fort Nelson, which has a population of 4,700.

Ten active wildfires were considered out of control, six were being held and 107 were under control.</p><p>In total, there were eight evacuation orders and five evacuation alerts.

)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jordan Evoy's escape from wildfires raging in Canada's far north was the \"scariest moment\" of his life as flareups closed roads, forcing him to backtrack to catch a military flight out in the Northwest Territories' largest ever evacuation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hundreds of people were airlifted to safety from remote villages overnight into Tuesday, after Yellowknife, the largest city in the region, declared an emergency.</p><p>For many in smaller communities, it was the second time in recent months that residents were forced to leave their homes.</p><p>With several roads to the south closed after being engulfed by flames, a ride aboard military aircrafts - deployed along with 120 soldiers to beat back the blazes - was the only means of escape.</p><p>Evoy, a resident of Fort Smith, told AFP he had tried to drive south to Alberta province, but had to turn back and heed officials' pleas to immediately go to the airport, warning that the \"safest way out is on a plane.\"</p><p>\"The highway was engulfed in flames and smoked out,\" the 28-year-old said, describing his panicked bolt to safety over land as \"the scariest moment of my life.\"</p><p>\"The forest fire crossed the highway, I couldn't see anything in front of me,\" he said.</p><p>\"Flames were jumping over my truck\" and he said he worried its tires would melt in the heat. \"The asphalt was on fire.\"</p><p>All along the route there were many abandoned and charred vehicles.</p><p>\"There was no cell service, so I had no way of knowing where I was,\" said Evoy.</p><p>Eventually he made his way back to Hay River and caught a military flight to Fort McMurray, Alberta.</p><p>Several towns and Indigenous communities were under evacuation orders - displacing 15 percent of the territory's population or about 6,000 people - while firefighters in some areas were forced to pull back as strong winds stoked the flames.</p><p>\u2013 Region 'especially challenging' \u2013</p><p>The tiny hamlet of Enterprise at the junction of two major highways has been almost completely destroyed.</p><p>Images shared on social media and on Canadian television showed an orange smokey haze over the region, large swaths of blackened forests, and melted headlights and peeled paint from the heat on those cars and trucks that made it through to safety before roads became completely undrivable.</p><p>The Northwest Territories fire department said Yellowknife, with a population of 20,000, was not facing an imminent threat despite fast-moving fires coming within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the regional capital.</p><p>No alert or evacuation has been ordered for the city but officials declared a state of emergency late Monday to facilitate receiving additional resources.</p><p>Wildfire official Mike Westwick told a news conference that fighting fires in the near Arctic is \"especially challenging\" due to the vast size of the region and its sparse population, with few access roads.</p><p>\"It's difficult to get crews and equipment in,\" he explained.</p><p>This season, megafires have spread across Canada with remarkable intensity, forcing 168,000 to flee their homes and scorching 13.5 million hectares (33.4 million acres) - almost twice the area of the last record of 7.3 million hectares, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).</p><p>Four people have died so far in this year's wildfires.</p><p>As of Tuesday, there were nearly 1,100 fires still burning, including more than 230 in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>In westernmost British Columbia province, meanwhile, a heatwave has sent temperatures soaring to over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), hampering efforts to bring wildfires under control.</p><p>Temperatures, however, are not expected to top a record set in June 2021, when the mercury in Lytton hit 49.6C before the village was destroyed days later by a fire that killed two residents.</p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/military-airlifts-provide-escape-as-wildfires-sweep-canadas-far-north/article\">Military airlifts

One Arrow First Nation has also instituted a ban on open fires. The bans came into effect on Friday, April 26th and includes small fire pits as well as the burning of brush piles, stubble, and the like. Barbecues, propane heaters, and propane fire rings are permissible, but caution is urged. Always have a fire extinguisher or a pail of water nearby in case of an emergency.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Full fire bans are also in effect for the Rural Municipalities of Aberdeen #373, Duck Lake #463, and Prince Albert #461, as well as in the Makwa Lake, Meadow Lake, and the Battlefords provincial parks. SaskParks has also issued fire bans for the Bronson Forest, Cowan Dam, Beatty Lake, Beaver Cowan, and Pagan Lake recreation sites. </p><p>The snowfall received on April 16th through 18th temporarily alleviated the dry conditions, but as that moisture has now been absorbed into the soil, the dry vegetation is once again a prime fuel source for fires. Anyone spotting a fire is to call 911 to report it and dispatchers will then dispatch the appropriate fire and rescue services. </p><p>Saskatchewan has had 82 fires already this year which is four times the five-year average. As of Monday, April 29th, there were six active fires in the province, down from eleven over the weekend. </p><p>The SPSA owns and operates a fleet of ten air tankers and seven bird-dog aircraft which provides for both land-based and amphibious wildfire tanker operations to suppress wildfires. Utilizing a modern, efficient, and fast tanker fleet, Saskatchewan is able to deliver aerial services within the province, to other jurisdictions within Canada, and to other external partners. A land-based airtanker group typically consists of two CV 580As working with one Bird Dog Turbo commander. The CV 580As each have a capacity to carry up to 7,955.7 litres, which is the equivalent of 1,750 imperial gallons of fire retardant or gel. They can also load fire suppressant foam. The human contingent is typically made up of five pilots, two Aircraft Maintenance Engineers, and one Air Attack Officer, although the Bird Dog does have the ability to transport four additional people. The amphibious airtanker group typically consists of two CL-215Ts working with one Turbo Command. The CL215T has a capacity to carry 5455 litres (1200 imperial gallons) of water and needs only 1250 metres (4100 ft) for approach, scoop, and climb-out, a feat that can be accomplished in roughly 10 seconds. </p><p>The current fleet includes four Convair 580A land-based tankers, six CL-215T Turbine powered water-scooping airtankers, and seven smaller bird-dog aircraft that guide the tankers and direct other air traffic over and near the wildfire, but on April 23 Premier Moe revealed more details of the four repurposed land-based airtankers being purchased for the SPSA at an approximate cost of $187.06 million. The two Dash 8-Q400AT and two Dash 8-Q400MRE will replace the Convair 580As which will approach the end of their useful lifespan in 2027. The Dash 8-Q400AT planes will be dedicated air tankers, while the Dash 8-Q400MRE models can be fitted as an airtanker and reconfigured to provide multiple roles for air operations such as air evacuations, patient transport, and cargo hauling. Both models have increased capacity and efficiency and produce 30 percent less emissions than a similar-sized airtanker.  </p><p>Conair Aerial Firefighting President and CEO Matt Bradley said. \u201cThey are the first province to invest in the safety and security of their citizens with a purchase of the multi-role air tankers, built by Canadians for Canadians.\u201d The budgetary impact for the SPSA's 2024-25 capital budget is a $5.52 million deposit with an additional three-year payment plan commitment. Federal funding of $16.29 million is committed to offset the cost of the aircraft through Natural Resources Canada's Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate Program (FMWCC). </p><p>The first of the four airplanes is expected to arrive in late summer of 2025, with the remaining arriving by the end of 2027. \u201cSaskatchewan relies on land-based airtanker aircraft as part of its approach to managing wildfires,\u201d Corrections, Policing and Public Safety Minister Paul Merriman said. \u201cThese aircraft are used in instances where waterbombers may not be able to access lakes to fill up their tanks.\u201d  </p><p>The Convair 580As have served the province since 2007-8 when they were purchased to replace the De Havilland Tracker that the province had been operating for since the late 1970s. The Dash 8-Q400 will be converted to emergency response aircraft by Conair Aerial Firefighting, which is part of the Conair Group Inc, of Abbotsford, BC, and specializes in retrofitting firefighting aircraft. The Q400s are part of the WestJet fleet and are used on some of their shorter Encore routes. </p><p>The Q400s are described as being capable of adapting well to hard-to-reach areas in sensitive conditions and is being called upon to help in the fight against the ever more dangerous forest fire seasons. Being able to work off of most 5000 ft runways and existing air tanker base infrastructure means that not a lot of upgrades are needed to bring it into service. The aircraft also has one of the lowest fuel burns, using 58 percent of the fuel to carry 88 percent of a typical Type 1 air tanker which means fewer carbon emissions. As reported in Simply Flying (<url normalizedValue=\"https://simpleflying.com/de-havilland-canada-dash-8-q400-complete-history/\">https://simpleflying.com/de-havilland-canada-dash-8-q400-complete-history/</url>), de Havilland of Canada is building a new factory in Alberta with the explicit intention to restart Dash 8-400 production later this decade meaning parts and repairs should not become obsolete before the craft\u2019s lifespan ends. </p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s tactically flexible, it\u2019s fuel-efficient, and it's fast. It's also very maneuverable over the fire. It's got good downhill run capability and is extremely good at low speeds,\u201d said Jeff Berry, Director of Business Development, at Conair Aerial Firefighting Canada. With that positive review, Saskatchewan residents should be reassured the investment is money well spent.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a2131be6831743f28a0a788664d6a54b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BY2-W5H1-JBVR-33DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1036\"/><timeReceived>08:44 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 2, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Forest fires continue to rage across British Columbia, threatening many of our rural communities, with many more expected throughout the season. We have already seen the horrendous impacts these fires can have on our communities. I am truly at a loss for words over the devastation wreaked on our beautiful town of Lytton, as well as the tragic loss of life. People across the province are heartbroken for residents of Lytton who have lost everything.</p><p>I have spent the past few weeks traveling around the Fraser-Nicola region and amidst the feelings of loss and grief, I was also met with an incredible feeling of hope when I saw how British Columbians and Canadians have come together to support those in need. The incredible work of our firefighters, emergency responders, local officials and of course our many volunteers cannot be understated.</p><p>Many of our local farmers who have been working the land for generations have offered invaluable insight for our recovery and will be an essential voice at the table for future forest fire prevention. Our region is also blessed to be home to many knowledgeable First Nations communities who have called this land home for thousands of years. Their local wisdom and guidance have been critical for our local efforts. In our time of need, it is their tireless advocacy and actions that are keeping us safe and readying us for the difficult recovery process.</p><p>As your MLA, I will continue to engage with local leaders across the region to hear their concerns and ensure the province offers Lytton and all rural communities the support they need to stay protected and make a full recovery.</p><p>MLA for Fraser-Nicola Jackie Tegart</p><p>Copyright 2021 Hope Standard</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOPEST-news20210712PHS4183926</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOPEST2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634B-NCW1-JD2C-J37F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"295\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.
