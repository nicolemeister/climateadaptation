The out of control fire closed in on parts of Pimicikamak Cree Nation and Cross Lake, pushing many to make the smoky drive to safety in Thompson, the Pas and Brandon. CTV's Manitoba bureau chief Jill Macyshon on the threat and new signs of relief.</p><p>JILL MACYSHON (Reporter): The emergency came as night was falling in Pimicikamak, 7,000 forced to flee a northern Manitoba forest fire. A fire that had been smoldering for a week, eating up 1,800 hectares, was suddenly fanned by a southern wind, turning it into an inferno, pushing it closer to the community, and the evacuation order was given.</p><p>CHIEF DAVID MONIAS (Pimicikamak Cree Nation): We had three and a half hours, three to three and a half hours to evacuate people.</p><p>MACYSHON: So a plan originally prepared for the pandemic was used in this fire emergency. Residents were told to leave their belongings behind and drive through heavy smoke to a safe location where they were given fuel to drive through the night.</p><p>KASSIA ROSS (Evacuee): That kind of freaked me out because the fire was so close to where I live.</p><p>MACYSHON: Ross and thousands of others have been re-located to other Manitoba towns and cities. This late-night evacuation call left agencies scrambling.</p><p>JASON SMALL (Canadian Red Cross): It is certainly a challenge to find hotel rooms, and we did the best we could to set things up as quickly as we could, and we continue to work through the morning finding more hotel rooms.</p><p>MACYSHON: Sixty crews have been working on the fire, attacking from the air and the ground. They created a fire-stop that helped slow it, but it was rain today that finally lessened the threat.</p><p>MONIAS: We're just doing the logistics of actually putting people back now.</p><p>MACYSHON: Chief David Monias says evacuees who have nowhere else to go can come home, but only if they are healthy enough to withstand the smoke, and they may be asked for leave again on a moment's notice.</p><p>MONIAS: So there's hot spots that they need to find, and they need to put those out.</p><p>MACYSHON: But for now, some relief is in the forecast in the north, at least two more days of rain and light winds.

Those were in addition to the 4,500 people who on Friday were forced to move out of harm\u2019s way on the Atlantic island that is home to around a million people and is also a popular tourist destination.</p><p>That figure of more than 8,000 evacuees is expected to rise, and perhaps sharply. </p><p>The Canary Islands have been in drought for most of the past few years, just like most of mainland Spain. The islands have recorded below-average rainfall in recent years because of changing weather patterns impacted by climate change.</p><p>European Union officials have blamed climate change for the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in Europe, noting that 2022 was the second-worst year for wildfire damage on record after 2017.</p><p>Greek authorities on Saturday evacuated eight villages near the northeastern border with Turkey, where a large summer wildfire was burning out of control, whipped up by high winds.</p><p>The Tenerife fire comes as Spain\u2019s mainland is bracing for another heat wave. Spain\u2019s state weather service issued a warning Saturday that temperatures would be on the rise in the coming days, hitting 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in parts of the mainland.</p><p>Spain had a record-hot 2022 and is setting new heat records this year amid a prolonged drought that has authorities on alert for wildfires.</p><p>Emergency services for the Canary Islands said later that the number of evacuees \u201ccould surpass 26,000\u201d according to provisional calculations based on the island\u2019s census. The service added that all those people who needed somewhere to take refuge would be directed to shelters.</p><p>The regional government said that \u201cthe fire is beyond our capacity to extinguish it\u201d due to hot and dry conditions and high winds that have fanned the huge flames. Firefighters have been unable to establish a perimeter around the blaze that has consumed at least 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres)</p><p>\u201cWe have never seen a fire of this dimension on the Canary Islands,\u201d the island\u2019s governor, Rosa D\u00e1vila, said.</p><p>No injuries have been reported since the fire broke out late on Tuesday.</p><p>Some 265 firefighters battled the blaze with the help of 19 aircraft, which included units from the mainland sent to help. More reinforcements are on the way, the central government said.</p><p>The fire is located in a steep and craggy mountain area with pine trees, with several municipalities on its flanks. Access for firefighters is extremely difficult.</p><p>The regional chief of the archipelago, Fernando Clavijo, said that police are investigating the cause of the fire. </p><p>The seven-island archipelago is located off the northwest coast of Africa and southwest of mainland Spain. At their nearest point, the islands are 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Morocco.</p><p>More than 2,000 people were evacuated in a wildfire on the nearby La Palma island last month that affected some 4,500 hectares (11,000 acres).</p><p>According to the European Forest Fire Information System, Spain heads the list of EU countries affected by wildfires so far this year, with 75,000 hectares (185,000 acres) burned, ahead of Italy and Greece.</p><p>Spain accounted for almost 40% of the nearly 800,00 hectares (2 million acres) burned in the European Union in 2022, the EU agency said.</p><p>___</p><p>Joseph Wilson reported from Barcelona.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-29397d0e8a5ce7c3e4162280b553c06e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6908-BSC1-JBVR-34SX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"594\"/><timeReceived>02:36 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 19, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Friday, March. 8, 18 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> TICKETS<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.<br/><br/> As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.<br/><br/> PAST LOCATIONS<br/><br/>

It said the IP Survey will \"critically\" extend over the area west of the Goldboro Deposit for near two kilometres, following a VLF geophysical survey which passes through the Goldboro Deposit and continues along strike to the past producing Dolliver Mountain Gold Mine.</p><p>The company is also providing an update on recent forest fire activity in the Province of Nova Scotia, which early last week resulted in a restriction of all activity in and around forest land. It said the travel and work restrictions have now been lifted in most areas of the province and the company has begun to re-mobilize its work teams, including with respects to exploration drilling to the west of Goldboro. The company added it is assessing the impact that the delay will have on its ongoing programs, including its updated Feasibility Study, in particular due to the delay of geotechnical drilling.</p><p>Kevin Bullock, President and CEO, said: \"We are relieved that the risks from the forest fires in Nova Scotia have been substantially reduced over the past few days.... While we are still assessing the potential impact of the delay on our schedule, we are happy to start drilling activity again at the Goldboro Project, both for exploration growth potential and geotechnical activity to support the Feasibility Study.\"</p><p>He added: \"Signal Gold is excited to initiate a further ground geophysical survey to the west of the Goldboro Deposit, as the best place to find a gold deposit is in the shadow of a headframe or next to an existing deposit -- the area west of the Goldboro Deposit has both these characteristics. The first phase of the geophysical survey, along with recent drill results, confirmed that the structure, alteration, and gold mineralization at the Goldboro Deposit continues westward from the Deposit. Additionally, the first phase of ground geophysics and the subsequent drill results validate our exploration approach of targeting IP and VLF geophysical trends allowing us to optimize our exploration approach. With a diamond drill now testing the additional strike of mineralization identified by the first phase of the IP Survey and the extension of the ground geophysical program, there is significant opportunity to expand the near surface mineral resources at Goldboro.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MIDTCA-A2920162</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MIDTCA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68D8-RFK1-F08T-K13J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">377441</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"442\"/><timeReceived>9:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 MT Newswires All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MT Newswires Live Briefs INVESTOR Canada</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20458\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 6, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0008YYT</classCode><className>GEOLOGY &amp; GEOPHYSICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001347</classCode><className>POLLS &amp; SURVEYS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000466</classCode><className>DELAYS &amp; POSTPONEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N212221MM</classCode><className>GOLD MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X7V</classCode><className>MINES &amp; MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N210000CC</classCode><className>MINING &amp; EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DBEH</classCode><className>PROSPECTING &amp; EXPLORATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS173</classCode><className>NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Due to interest rates, debt servicing costs for the province currently account for around $3 billion worth of the provincial budget.</p><p>The projected surplus comes despite higher-than-normal costs associated with fighting the provincial wildfires, the volatile energy sector and the ongoing pause on fuel tax collection.</p><p>According to Horner, the economic outlook remains strong for two main reasons:first, the falling inflation rate and increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is leading to an increase in jobs, and second, net population growth.</p><p>Based on first-quarter projections, Alberta\u2019s GDP is set to remain around three per cent during the 2023-24 fiscal year while inflation is anticipated to hold around 3.1 per cent before dropping to an anticipated 2.2 per cent in 2024, slightly above the Bank of Canada\u2019s goal of two per cent.</p><p>As far as population growth, the province is anticipating a growth of around 4.4 per cent, with around 46,000 people coming from the rest of Canada along side a significant number of non-permanent residents fleeing war in Ukraine or temporary foreign workers.</p><p>In factoring anticipated oil royalty revenues, the Ministry of Finance has dropped the forecasted average of West Texas Intermediate to $75/barrel from $79/barrel.</p><p>According to Horner, every $1 drop in oil price works out to a loss of around $600 million from provincial coffers.</p><p>Horner, cautions that in the overall picture, while a significant sum, a $2 billion-plus surplus is \u201cnot a large surplus\u201d when the overall budget comes in somewhere around $70 billion.</p><p>As already noted, half of any surplus must go towards debt repayment; the other half of the surplus goes into the Alberta Fund. From there one of three things can be done with it; one, more of the money can be put towards the debt, two, the funds can be put towards the Heritage Trust Fund, or three, they can be allocated for one-time program spending.</p><p>The update noted a promise to keep the fuel tax off until at least the end of December, saving Albertans $0.13/litre every time they fill up their vehicles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one more way we are keeping life affordable for Albertans,\u201d said Horner.</p><p>When asked about keeping the tax off past the end of the year, Horner said it is a \u201cguarantee\u201d it will be discussed, along with other affordability options the premier and cabinet will look at.</p><p>One omission in the fiscal update was anything regarding the impending buy-out of the DynaLife lab services contract by the province; when asked about it Horner noted that the deal was not yet finalized, but more information should be coming by the end of the year.</p><p>Another topic of conversation during the media question portion of the press conference was the \u201cunprecedented fire year.\u201d When asked about funding for the forest fire costs, Horner stated that the province has set aside $750 million for fire fighting, of which around $550 million has been used, along with $175 million in \u201cuninsurable losses.\u201d</p><p>The federal government is expected to pick up $75 mil-lion worth of costs for the unisnsurable expenses and $55 million to assist with evacuee expenses.</p><p>A final topic discussed was the ongoing drought in the southern parts of the province, and the possibility of the province instituting the AgriRecovery Program.</p><p>\u201cEvents seem to happen more often and are more impactful,\u201d agreed Horner, noting that the Government of Alberta had requested the federal government activate the program, which is paid for in a 60/40 split between the two levels of government, in July but has yet to hear back.</p><p>CASTOR ADVANCE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CASTOR-news20230907PPRA0003853904</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CASTOR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6945-RKY1-F0HF-80CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459600</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"694\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Due to interest rates, debt servicing costs for the province currently account for around $3 billion worth of the provincial budget.</p><p>The projected surplus comes despite higher-than-normal costs associated with fighting the provincial wildfires, the volatile energy sector and the ongoing pause on fuel tax collection.</p><p>According to Horner, the economic outlook remains strong for two main reasons:first, the falling inflation rate and increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is leading to an increase in jobs, and second, net population growth.</p><p>Based on first-quarter projections, Alberta\u2019s GDP is set to remain around three per cent during the 2023-24 fiscal year while inflation is anticipated to hold around 3.1 per cent before dropping to an anticipated 2.2 per cent in 2024, slightly above the Bank of Canada\u2019s goal of two per cent.</p><p>As far as population growth, the province is anticipating a growth of around 4.4 per cent, with around 46,000 people coming from the rest of Canada along side a significant number of non-permanent residents fleeing war in Ukraine or temporary foreign workers.</p><p>In factoring anticipated oil royalty revenues, the Ministry of Finance has dropped the forecasted average of West Texas Intermediate to $75/barrel from $79/barrel.</p><p>According to Horner, every $1 drop in oil price works out to a loss of around $600 million from provincial coffers.</p><p>Horner, cautions that in the overall picture, while a significant sum, a $2 billion-plus surplus is \u201cnot a large surplus\u201d when the overall budget comes in somewhere around $70 billion.</p><p>As already noted, half of any surplus must go towards debt repayment; the other half of the surplus goes into the Alberta Fund. From there one of three things can be done with it; one, more of the money can be put towards the debt, two, the funds can be put towards the Heritage Trust Fund, or three, they can be allocated for one-time program spending.</p><p>The update noted a promise to keep the fuel tax off until at least the end of December, sav-ing Albertans $0.13/litre every time they fill up their vehicles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one more way we are keeping life affordable for Albertans,\u201d said Horner.</p><p>When asked about keeping the tax off past the end of the year, Horner said it is a \u201cguarantee\u201d it will be discussed, along with other affordability options the premier and cabinet will look at.</p><p>One omission in the fiscal update was anything regarding the impending buy-out of the DynaLife lab services contract by the province; when asked about it Horner noted that the deal was not yet finalized, but more information should be coming by the end of the year.</p><p>Another topic of conversation during the media question portion of the press conference was the \u201cunprecedented fire year.\u201d When asked about funding for the forest fire costs, Horner stated that the province has set aside $750 million for fire fighting, of which around $550 million has been used, along with $175 million in \u201cuninsurable losses.\u201d</p><p>The federal government is expected to pick up $75 million worth of costs for the unisnsurable expenses and $55 million to assist with evacuee expenses.</p><p>A final topic discussed was the ongoing drought in the southern parts of the province, and the possibility of the province instituting the AgriRecovery Program.</p><p>\u201cEvents seem to happen more often and are more impactful,\u201d agreed Horner, noting that the Government of Alberta had requested the federal government activate the program, which is paid for in a 60/40 split between the two levels of government, in July but has yet to hear back.</p><p>STETTLER INDEPENDENT</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STEIND-news20230907PSPA0003853261</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STEIND2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6945-RKY1-F0HF-815H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459608</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

A small maintenance crew will remain in camp at this time. LIFT's Hidden Lake Camp is not considered at immediate risk, however smoky conditions are interfering with routine drilling operations and winds are expected to present challenging conditions for fire-fighting crews over the coming days. LIFT is working with the Government of the Northwest Territories to support local fire-fighting efforts and has released a helicopter to assist in the campaign.</p><p>Francis MacDonald, CEO stated, \"We are monitoring the fire situation closely and will resume normal operations as soon as possible. Our thoughts are with the people who have been evacuated from their homes and communities and with the fire crews that are working tirelessly to protect the Northwest Territories.\"</p><p>About LIFT</p><p>LIFT is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of lithium pegmatite projects located in Canada. The Company's flagship project is the Yellowknife Lithium Project located in Northwest Territories, Canada. LIFT also holds three early-stage exploration properties in Quebec, Canada with excellent potential for the discovery of buried lithium pegmatites, as well as the Cali Project in Northwest Territories within the Little Nahanni Pegmatite Field.</p><p>For further information, please contact:</p><p>Francis MacDonald</p><p>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>Tel: + 1.604.609.6185</p><p>Email: <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@li-ft.com\">info@li-ft.com</url></p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/ZAEWOHO1VO\">www.li-ft.com</url></p><p>Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information</p><p>Certain statements included in this press release constitute forward-looking information or statements (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\"), including those identified by the expressions \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"plan\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"should\" and similar expressions to the extent they relate to the Company or its management.

A small success is that 24 of those 64 fires are either being held or considered out at this time, the Northwest Fire Centre\u2019s Ryan Chapman told reporters Wednesday (July 13) afternoon.</p><p>He was joined by Todd Flannagan, an incident commander for the Vanderhoof and Fort St. James region, and Cliff Chapman, operations director for the BC Wildfire Service in providing an update for the Nadina, Bulkley-Nechako, Fort St. James and Vanderhoof regions.</p><p>\u201cWe have seen more fire on the landscape in terms of number of starts, as well as the continuation of hectares burned on the landscape than we have seen in previous years at this point,\u201d said Cliff Chapman.</p><p>More than 1,000 fires started in April and just under 400 are still burning. In total, over 1.2 million hectares have burned so far this year throughout the province, compared to a 10 year average, which is roughly 76,000 hectares.</p><p>Lighting strikes, (with 51,000 strikes recorded in B.C. in the last seven days with 76 per cent of those concentrated in the Northwest and Prince George Fire Centres) and dry weather conditions are further challenging firefighters.</p><p>\u201cWe have had 392 fires in the last seven days, 230 of those fires remain out of control and many of those fires are present in the Prince George and Northwest fire centres,\u201d said Ryan Chapman.</p><p>More than 2,000 firefighters are in the province right now and the wildfire service is asking for an additional 1,000 through the Canadian interagency Forest Fire Center.</p><p>Another 200 to 300 are expected from Australia, Mexico and the U.S.over the next six to 10 days. The province has also requested people, helicopters and aircraft from the federal government.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to plan ahead for the next two months,\u201d Cliff Chapman added.</p><p>But he said finding help is a challenge because resources are spread thin due to wildfires in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta.</p><p>Northwest Fire Centre update:\u201cOur main priority is to prevent these fires from impacting life and property,\u201d Ryan Chapman said. However, owing to weather conditions, not all fires can be fought at this time, Chapman said firefighters are focusing on the west side of the fire closest to Burns Lake and the south part of the fire that\u2019s near the Tintgael residential area. Parrot Lake and Peacock Creek, which is south of Houston, are also drawing in resources.</p><p>\u201cSo we have had favorable winds over the west. We have been able to get quite close to the fire so we\u2019re using heavy equipment bulldozers, excavators followed up by ground crews. And we have established a guard from this line here which is a main 500 kilowatt transmission line. We\u2019re building that guard as close to the fire as possible. And our main goal is to try to stop the fire at that guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re running air controls every day. We appreciate the public finding fires and phoning them in. We are expecting to keep finding new fires and addressing those as quickly as we can while they\u2019re small.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VANDER-news20230720PRLA0003742182</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VANDER2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68RR-5TD1-JD2C-J1P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438216</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"553\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Due to interest rates, debt servicing costs for the province currently account for around $3 billion worth of the provincial budget.</p><p>The projected surplus comes despite higher-than-normal costs associated with fighting the provincial wildfires, the volatile energy sector and the ongoing pause on fuel tax collection.</p><p>According to Horner, the economic outlook remains strong for two main reasons:first, the falling inflation rate and increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is leading to an increase in jobs, and second, net population growth.</p><p>Based on first-quarter projections, Alberta\u2019s GDP is set to remain around three per cent during the 2023-24 fiscal year while inflation is anticipated to hold around 3.1 per cent before dropping to an anticipated 2.2 per cent in 2024, slightly above the Bank of Canada\u2019s goal of two per cent.</p><p>As far as population growth, the province is anticipating a growth of around 4.4 per cent, with around 46,000 people coming from the rest of Canada along side a significant number of non-per-manent residents fleeing war in Ukraine or temporary foreign workers.</p><p>In factoring anticipated oil royalty revenues, the Ministry of Finance has dropped the forecasted average of West Texas Intermediate to $75/barrel from $79/barrel.</p><p>According to Horner, every $1 drop in oil price works out to a loss of around $600 million from provincial coffers.</p><p>Horner, cautions that in the overall picture, while a significant sum, a $2 billion-plus surplus is \u201cnot a large surplus\u201d when the overall budget comes in somewhere around $70 billion.</p><p>As already noted, half of any surplus must go towards debt repayment; the other half of the surplus goes into the Alberta Fund. From there one of three things can be done with it; one, more of the money can be put towards the debt, two, the funds can be put towards the Heritage Trust Fund, or three, they can be allocated for one-time program spending.</p><p>The update noted a promise to keep the fuel tax off until at least the end of December, saving Albertans $0.13/litre every time they fill up their vehicles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one more way we are keeping life affordable for Albertans,\u201d said Horner.</p><p>When asked about keeping the tax off past the end of the year, Horner said it is a \u201cguarantee\u201d it will be discussed, along with other affordability options the premier and cabinet will look at.</p><p>One omission in the fiscal update was anything regarding the impending buy-out of the DynaLife lab services contract by the province; when asked about it Horner noted that the deal was not yet finalized, but more information should be coming by the end of the year.</p><p>Another topic of conversation during the media question portion of the press conference was the \u201cunprecedented fire year.\u201d When asked about funding for the forest fire costs, Horner stated that the province has set aside $750 million for fire fighting, of which around $550 million has been used, along with $175 million in \u201cuninsurable losses.\u201d</p><p>The federal government is expected to pick up $75 million worth of costs for the unisnsurable expenses and $55 million to assist with evacuee expenses.</p><p>A final topic discussed was the ongoing drought in the southern parts of the province, and the possibility of the province instituting the AgriRecovery Program.</p><p>\u201cEvents seem to happen more often and are more impactful,\u201d agreed Horner, noting that the Government of Alberta had requested the federal government activate the program, which is paid for in a 60/40 split between the two levels of government, in July but has yet to hear back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BASHAW-news20230906UADA0003848613</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BASHAW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:693Y-S2H1-JD2C-J2RS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459599</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"692\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

More than 20 people were killed in the fires.</p><p>A massive wildfire that destroyed vast tracts of forest in northeastern Greece over 17 days was in abeyance on Monday, although hundreds of firefighters were still tackling pockets that continued to burn, the fire department said.</p><p>Reinforcements were sent over the weekend to battle the wildfire burning in the Evros region near the border with Turkey, bringing the total number of firefighters on Monday to 741, backed by 124 vehicles and two aircraft. The blaze has been blamed for the deaths of 20 people, all believed to have been migrants who had recently crossed the border.</p><p>\"There is no active front in the Evros area right now,\" Greece's minister for civil protection, Vassilis Kikilias, said. \"We remain on alert, and the battle obviously continues.\"</p><p>The fire, which broke out on Aug. 19 near the northeastern city of Alexandroupolis and joined with other blazes to form one massive wildfire, burned more than 93,000 hectares (230,000 acres) of land by Sunday, according to the European Union's Copernicus Emergency Management Service, making it the largest single blaze to hit an EU country since records began in 2000.</p><p>Wildfires are common in Greece and other southern European countries during their hot, dry summers. Dozens of fires have been breaking out each day across the country for weeks, with the fire department saying its forces tackled 82 wildfires between Sunday afternoon and Monday afternoon, with 51 of them having broken out in those 24 hours.</p><p>Another fire broke out Monday in woodland on the northern outskirts of Athens. More than 70 firefighters, including 18 from France, backed by two airplanes and three helicopters, managed to bring the blaze under partial control within hours, the fire department said.</p><p>It said a man was arrested on suspicion of causing the fire through negligence.</p><p>With its firefighting forces stretched to the limit, Greece appealed for help from other European countries and has received hundreds of firefighters, as well as a fleet of planes and helicopters, from across the continent. On Sunday, forces from France, Spain, Cyprus, Romania, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Albania and Serbia were still operating in the country.</p><p>READ ALSO: 2 arrested for arson as multiple wildfires continue to burn across Greece</p><p>READ ALSO: Massive forest fire in Greece still burning for 7th day</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230905PAB4510540</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:693R-SJP1-JD2C-J0JJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"659\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

(TSX-V:PEGA)(Frankfurt:0QS0)(OTC PINK:SLTFF) (the \"Company\" or \"Pegasus\") is pleased to announce the analytical results from its 2023 ground exploration program at the Punch Bowl Property, Golden Project in east-central British Columbia (See news release October 06, 2023).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Exploration Highlights:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Abbreviated late fall reconnaissance program included 25 rock samples, with seven (7) having returned greater than 0.13 g/t Au<br/>Three samples returned values of 4.70 g/t Au, 3.87 g/t Au and 1.61 g/t Au<br/>The 2023 samples extended mineralization of the gold bearing quartz vein set to approximately 200 m along strike<br/>Located previously unsampled mineralized quartz vein(s) on McGilvary Ridge</p><p>A late fall exploration program was carried out at the company's Punch Bowl Property on October 6th and 7th, 2023, with a total of 25 grab samples collected (Figure 1). Due to the unprecedented Forest Fire activity across Canada in 2023, the company was limited to an abbreviated exploration program which had been scheduled for earlier in the field season.</p><p>Samples targeted pyrite-bearing quartz veins within northwest-southeast trending recessive phyllitic lenses that have historically returned elevated gold values of up to 573.7 g/t Au (Shaw, 1989). Overall, the program was successful in extending mineralization along strike of known auriferous veins, in addition to locating a previously unsampled mineralized quartz vein.</p><p>\"The Company is greatly encouraged by the results from the exploration campaign at the Punch Bowl Property,\" stated Chris Timmins, President and CEO of Pegasus. \"The assays show that the mineralization observed within the quartz veins is relatively continuous along strike, and the newly discovered quartz vein displays the potential for multiple mineralized zones on McGillivray Ridge.

The property surrounds the historic Punch Bowl Showing, where discrete gold in quartz veins are hosted within quartzites and pelites of the Early Cambrian McNaughton Formation.</p><p>Vertebrae Ridge:</p><p>The Vertebrae Ridge property is comprised of four claims encompassing about 5,324 ha (13,156 acres) roughly 81 kilometers northwest of Golden, BC. During August 2021 ground exploration resulted in the extension of known polymetallic mineralization trends, the confirmation of significant mineralization continuity at historically sampled locations, and the discovery of the Canon Cu-Au Zone. The Company believes the newly discovered Canon Zone may be related to a large oval, alkaline intrusion located a short distance west of the mineralized area.</p><p>Gold Mountain:</p><p>The Gold Mountain Property is an early-stage gold/silver property located approximately 50 km NW of Golden, BC, just north of Highway 1. The property comprises two mineral claims encompassing 802 ha and covering the historic Grizzly Occurrence, which consists of gold and silver mineralization within polymetallic quartz/carbonate veins.</p><p>Quality Assurance / Quality Control</p><p>All samples were collected in the field using a hammer and chisel. Locations were obtained using a handheld GPS or tablet, with samples placed in pre-labelled sample bags. Metal tags with the sample numbers and flagging tape were left at each sample location. A Quality Assurance/Quality Control protocol was incorporated into the program and included the insertion of silica blanks at a rate of approximately 15%.</p><p>Samples were transported to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, for standard sample preparation (code PRP89), which includes drying at 105\u00b0C, crushing to 75% passing 2mm, riffle splitting 250 g, and pulverizing to 85% passing 75 microns. They were analyzed for multi-element (code GE_ARM3V25) and Au by fire assay (code GE_FAA30V5).</p><p>Management cautions that prospecting surface rock samples and associated assays, as discussed herein, are selective by nature and represent a point location and, therefore, may not necessarily be fully representative of the mineralized horizon sampled.</p><p>NI 43-101 Disclosure</p><p>The technical content of this news release has been reviewed and approved by Nathan Schmidt, P.

Hydra is the subject of a 50%-50% joint venture between ALX and Forrestania Resources Limited of West Perth, Australia (\" Forrestania\") (ASX: FRS) formed to explore for lithium-cesium-tantalum (\"LCT\") bearing pegmatites, with ALX as operator.</p><p>The prospecting program that was suspended in early June 2023 due to unprecedented forest fire conditions has resumed in the northeastern area of Hydra. This area remains unaffected by the fires. The ALX geological crew has mobilized to the area of the Python East and Python West sub-projects (see Figure 1 below) where wilderness lodge accommodations were secured. The lodge is serviced by air and serves as a base for the helicopter contracted for the work program. Prospecting is guided by the use of satellite imagery and spectral analysis for lithium and associated pathfinder elements. The work program at Python East and Python West is planned to continue into early September 2023.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Figure 1.

A 2008 sample from the Python West pegmatite returned an anomalous value of 330 parts per million (\"ppm\") lithium, a showing which will be followed up in the current prospecting program.</p><p>Forrestania shares ALX's opinion that Hydra holds potential for LCT pegmatites, supported by the encouraging exploration and development results from nearby projects. Patriot Battery Metals Inc. has reported its maiden National Instrument 43-101-compliant Inferred mineral resource estimate for its Corvette Lithium Project consisting of 109,242,000 metric tonnes (\"Mt\") at an average grade of 1.42% Li 2 O and 160 ppm Ta 2 O 5 containing 1,551,000 Mt Li 2 O and 3,835,000 Mt Lithium Carbonate Equivalent 1. ALX's Volta sub-project lies 20 kilometres to the east of the Corvette Deposit and is 1 kilometre north of the Corvette east property boundary.</p><p>The Viper and Cobra sub-projects are located 50 kilometres north of Q2 Metals Corp.'s Mia Lithium Property, where numerous spodumene-bearing pegmatite outcrop samples have returned significant lithium grades of up to 4.37% Li 2 O 2. Both Viper and Cobra host similar greenstone belt settings.</p><p>1 TSXV: PMET news release July 31, 2023: \" Patriot announces the largest lithium pegmatite resource in the Americas at CV5, Corvette Property, Quebec, Canada.\"</p><p>2 TSXV: QTWO news release December 21, 2022: \" Queensland announces sampling results averaging 2.65% Li 2 O from the Mia LI-1 occurrence at its Mia Lithium property in Quebec, Canada\"</p><p>About Hydra</p><p>Hydra consists of eight sub-projects totaling 29,262 hectares (72,306 acres) known as Volta (4,751 ha.), Echo (5,566 ha.), Nike (2,462 ha.), Sprite (3,437 ha.), Cobra (4,249 ha.), Viper (1,280 ha.), Python East (3,218 ha.) and Python West (4,298 ha.), located within a fertile lithium exploration district that hosts the James Bay, Rose, Whabouchi and Corvette lithium deposits and numerous other lithium showings.</p><p>The Hydra sub-projects were selected for staking based upon the presence of historical lithium, cesium and tantalum lake sediment anomalies and by a review of public-domain geological mapping. A proprietary AI process for pegmatite detection by KorrAI of Halifax, NS is ongoing to prioritize target definition for the 2023 prospecting program.</p><p>To view maps and more information on Hydra, visit our website at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/V787Bt7rrE\">https://alxresources.com/hydra-lithium/</url> .</p><p>National Instrument 43-101 Disclosure</p><p>The technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by John Charlton, P.Geo., a consultant to ALX, who is a Qualified Person in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101.</p><p>About ALX</p><p>ALX is based in Vancouver, BC, Canada and its common shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol \"AL\", on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol \"6LLN\" and in the United States OTC market under the symbol \"ALXEF\".</p><p>ALX's mandate is to provide shareholders with multiple opportunities for discovery by exploring a portfolio of prospective mineral properties in Canada, which include lithium, uranium, nickel-copper-cobalt and gold projects.

former editor of mine was a chain smoker.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My meetings with him were usually held outdoors in the rear of the newspaper office so he could smoke as we chatted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was hard on him to no longer be allowed to smoke in his office, as he had for most of his career up to that point, because the new and harsh smoking regulations began taking effect in the early 2000s that prevented people from smoking in most public spaces.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But he knew he must follow the rules and be a leader in the office, so he suffered through the new workplace reality and put up with getting rained and snowed on regularly in the backyard as he tried to continue to enjoy his ongoing bad habit.</p><p>My editor recognized that he and other smokers were being villainized by society as the full impacts of the health consequences of smoking were becoming more well known, particularly to nonsmokers, and it bothered him that something he had enjoyed with few problems since he was a kid was now a major issue, with many people looking down their noses at him for it.</p><p>That's why he was militant against smokers who toss cigarette butts out their car windows, especially during dry periods like we are currently experiencing on Vancouver Island.</p><p>I remember he would rant and rave every time reports came in of fires started in the dry grass and/or bushes at the side of roads that were started by careless smokers throwing still-lit cigarettes from their cars.</p><p>A video from a security camera of two men working in a backyard that I watched recently clearly illustrates the dangers of cigarettes around dry kindling.</p><p>One of the workers was smoking and when he reached the butt, he took some time rubbing it into the dirt and other materials at the base of a large hedge to make sure it was fully extinguished before leaving it.</p><p>It should be said that the smoker was trying to be responsible by ensuring his cigarette was out, but a whole six hours later, the video shows a tiny flame poke up through the dirt and debris where the cigarette butt was supposedly put out in the now empty backyard, a flame that quickly leapt up into the hedge and, within mere seconds, the whole hedge was on fire.</p><p>Luckily, the homeowner was nearby and called 911 before trying to tackle the fire with his garden hose.</p><p>The fire was eventually doused with no damage to the home, but it could have been a lot worse if the homeowner hadn't intervened.</p><p>My editor, a life-long smoker with no intention of ever quitting, took offence to these types of cigarette-caused fires and would write columns in the newspaper about the issue and condemn and mock his fellow smokers for being so stupid as to throw butts out their windows, stating they should be issued steep fines for their carelessness.</p><p>He would even have me take pictures of his hand holding a lit cigarette out his car window to show smokers what not to do to get his point across.</p><p>That's why I'm sure my editor, who died in 2005 from cancer, would have fully agreed with the decision of the Saanich police department to ticket a driver who threw a cigarette butt out his car window $575 last week to serve as a reminder of the dangers attached to improper cigarette disposal amid dry conditions and extreme provincial forest fire ratings.</p><p>My editor may have been a life-long chain smoker, starting back in a time when commercials would be on the air stating that three out of four doctors smoke Camel cigarettes, but he was also a conscientious member of the community who would not purposely harm anyone.</p><p>He stood outside in the elements to smoke his cigarettes in the back of the newspaper office not only because he had to if he wanted to smoke, but also because he didn't want to cause any adverse health and other impacts to his employees or anyone else.</p><p>He would have given a medal to the police officer who issued the $575 ticket.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Cowichan Valley Citizen</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Using artificial intelligence, the cameras - from wildfire-detection startup Pano AI - are expected to be able to pinpoint new fires within minutes of them starting. <br/><br/> A Rogers system currentlyin place uses Swarm, SpaceX's connectivity service for the so-called internet of things (or IoT), to get data from sensors that measure various nonvisual indicators of forest fire danger, such as soil conditions and wind. <br/><br/> The information can then be seen by UBC and the B.C. Wildfire Service (BCWS), which determines a course of action. <br/><br/> The sensors are used more for prevention right now, Dayal said, but in future when combined with the cameras they could give a better indication of how serious a fire is when it is detected. <br/><br/> He said the areas chosen for the camera placements were identified by the BCWS as key areas for wildfire risk. <br/><br/> \"They don't have enough population density (so that) they're getting notifications by people\" when a wildfire starts, Dayal said. \"This is where we think effectively we get the most value for this camera-based technology.\"<br/><br/> Mathieu Bourbonnais, assistant professor of the department of Earth, environmental and geographic sciences at UBC Okanagan, said in a news release that \"These new technologies will expand the reach and capabilities of our existing network of 5G IoT sensors, giving us real-time data that can provide the foundation for an early warning system for wildfires and improve public safety.\"<br/><br/> Wildfires in B.C. have been very destructive in 2023; nearly 2,200 fires in the province have burned almost 2.5 million hectares, the worst year on record. The previous worst season, in 2018, hit 1.35 million hectares.<br/><br/> This week the province was still issuing evacuation alerts in places threatened by wildfires. Many of the blazes are in remote areas, particularly in the north, but they can still threaten homes in rural areas - and often, by the time they are detected, the fires are large enough they cannot be handled easily. <br/><br/> Aaron Pawlick, manager of strategic initiatives and innovation at the BCWS, said in the news release that the government is seeking new ways to combat wildfires as concern about them grows.<br/><br/> \"We are always interested in new ideas, technology and innovations to inform our work,\" Pawlick said. \"We are pleased to receive data and information from this project and participate with Rogers, UBC and Pano in trialing these innovative technologies.\"<br/><br/> Dayal said the new camera/5G system will be rolled out in the coming weeks and it's hoped that by next year a clear picture of its success will be seen. <br/><br/> \"The measure would be how quickly we learned about a fire and were able to respond to it,\" he said, adding that the project will also help determine the best way to deploy such technology elsewhere in Canada. <br/><br/> As part of Thursday's announcement, Rogers is also donating satellite phones to first responders to aid their efforts.<br/><br/> Of the wildfires where a cause has been determined this year, 312 were started by lightning and 27 caused by humans. As of 4 p.m.  Wednesday, there were still 384 wildfires burning in the province, according to B.C.'s wildfire dashboard.<br/><br/> During the last seven years B.C. has suffered its four worst years on record for wildfires. This year's disastrous season was not limited to the province, with 165,000 square kilometres being burned across Canada. <br/><br/> Researchers have said the increase in wildfire destruction was predicted with climate change, but has arrived sooner than expected. <br/><br/> With files from <br/><br/> The Canadian Press <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023092169143470</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6973-HFM1-F197-50TM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

I remember he would rant and rave every time reports came in of fires started in the dry grass and/or bushes at the side of roads that were started by careless smokers throwing still-lit cigarettes from their cars.</p><p>A video from a security camera of two men working in a backyard that I watched recently clearly illustrates the dangers of cigarettes around dry kindling.</p><p>One of the workers was smoking and when he reached the butt, he took some time rubbing it into the dirt and other materials at the base of a large hedge to make sure it was fully extinguished before leaving it.</p><p>It should be said that the smoker was trying to be responsible by ensuring his cigarette was out, but a whole six hours later, the video shows a tiny flame poke up through the dirt and debris where the cigarette butt was supposedly put out in the now empty backyard, a flame that quickly leapt up into the hedge and, within mere seconds, the whole hedge was on fire.</p><p>Luckily, the homeowner was nearby and called 911 before trying to tackle the fire with his garden hose.</p><p>The fire was eventually doused with no damage to the home, but it could have been a lot worse if the homeowner hadn\u2019t intervened.</p><p>My editor, a life-long smoker with no intention of ever quitting, took offence to these types of cigarette-caused fires and would write columns in the newspaper about the issue and condemn and mock his fellow smokers for being so stupid as to throw butts out their windows, stating they should be issued steep fines for their carelessness.</p><p>He would even have me take pictures of his hand holding a lit cigarette out his car window to show smokers what not to do to get his point across.</p><p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m sure my editor, who died in 2005 from cancer, would have fully agreed with the decision of the Saanich police department to ticket a driver who threw a cigarette butt out his car window $575 last week to serve as a reminder of the dangers attached to improper cigarette disposal amid dry conditions and extreme provincial forest fire ratings.</p><p>My editor may have been a life-long chain smoker, starting back in a time when commercials would be on the air stating that three out of four doctors smoke Camel cigarettes, but he was also a conscientious member of the community who would not purposely harm anyone.</p><p>He stood outside in the elements to smoke his cigarettes in the back of the newspaper office not only because he had to if he wanted to smoke, but also because he didn\u2019t want to cause any adverse health and other impacts to his employees or anyone else.</p><p>He would have given a medal to the police officer who issued the $575 ticket.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COWCIT-news20230831PPYA0003835561</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COWCIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:692N-Y9B1-JD2C-J0HX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438285</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Due to interest rates, debt servicing costs for the province currently account for around $3 billion worth of the provincial budget.</p><p>The projected surplus comes despite higher-than-normal costs associated with fighting the provincial wildfires, the volatile energy sector and the ongoing pause on fuel tax collection.</p><p>According to Horner, the economic outlook remains strong for two main reasons: first, the falling inflation rate and increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is leading to an increase in jobs, and second, net population growth.</p><p>Based on first-quarter projections, Alberta's GDP is set to remain around three per cent during the 2023-24 fiscal year while inflation is anticipated to hold around 3.1 per cent before dropping to an anticipated 2.2 per cent in 2024, slightly above the Bank of Canada's goal of two per cent.</p><p>As far as population growth, the province is anticipating a growth of around 4.4 per cent, with around 46,000 people coming from the rest of Canada along side a significant number of non-permanent residents fleeing war in Ukraine or temporary foreign workers.</p><p>In factoring anticipated oil royalty revenues, the Ministry of Finance has dropped the forecasted average of West Texas Intermediate to $75/barrel from $79/barrel.</p><p>According to Horner, every $1 drop in oil price works out to a loss of around $600 million from provincial coffers.</p><p>Horner, cautions that in the overall picture, while a significant sum, a $2 billion-plus surplus is \"not a large surplus\" when the overall budget comes in somewhere around $70 billion.</p><p>As already noted, half of any surplus must go towards debt repayment; the other half of the surplus goes into the Alberta Fund. From there one of three things can be done with it; one, more of the money can be put towards the debt, two, the funds can be put towards the Heritage Trust Fund, or three, they can be allocated for one-time program spending.</p><p>The update noted a promise to keep the fuel tax off until at least the end of December, saving Albertans $0.13/litre every time they fill up their vehicles.</p><p>\"It's one more way we are keeping life affordable for Albertans,\" said Horner.</p><p>When asked about keeping the tax off past the end of the year, Horner said it is a \"guarantee\" it will be discussed, along with other affordability options the premier and cabinet will look at.</p><p>One omission in the fiscal update was anything regarding the impending buy-out of the DynaLife lab services contract by the province; when asked about it Horner noted that the deal was not yet finalized, but more information should be coming by the end of the year.</p><p>Another topic of conversation during the media question portion of the press conference was the \"unprecedented fire year.\" When asked about funding for the forest fire costs, Horner stated that the province has set aside $750 million for fire fighting, of which around $550 million has been used, along with $175 million in \"uninsurable losses.\"</p><p>The federal government is expected to pick up $75 million worth of costs for the unisnsurable expenses and $55 million to assist with evacuee expenses.</p><p>A final topic discussed was the ongoing drought in the southern parts of the province, and the possibility of the province instituting the AgriRecovery Program.</p><p>\"Events seem to happen more often and are more impactful,\" agreed Horner, noting that the Government of Alberta had requested the federal government activate the program, which is paid for in a 60/40 split between the two levels of government, in July but has yet to hear back.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Stettler Independent</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STEIND-news20230831PST4509247</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STEIND2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:692N-Y9B1-JD2C-J18M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459608</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

And a forecast model suggests fire hot spots are unlikely to receive the more significant precipitation expected further south in the next few days, he added.</p><p>\"There has been a bit of help from the rain for those battling forest fires, but unfortunately those fires continue,\" Flisfefer said. Areas most affected by fires received between 15 and 40 millimetres of rain between Sunday and Wednesday, with possibly higher amounts in only localized areas.</p><p>Meanwhile, wildfire smoke has led the federal weather agency to issue special air quality statements for all of southern Ontario and much of western Quebec. The meteorologists say they expect air quality in the Montreal area to worsen as that smoke moves into the city by Wednesday evening.</p><p>Quebec's forest fire prevention agency reported 110 active fires Wednesday afternoon, including 73 in the southern half of the province.</p><p>Several communities in northern and western Quebec are still subject to evacuation orders. Almost 1,200 vulnerable people from Cree communities are among the evacuees.</p><p>Dr. Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost of the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay said the evacuation process has gone relatively well, but added the situation poses particular health, logistical and cultural challenges for evacuees \u2014 including elders, medical patients, pregnant women and infants \u2014 who have been transferred across hotels and health-care facilities in Montreal, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec City and Saguenay.</p><p>He likened the evacuation to \"going camping without prior notice,\" uprooting people from their homes and lands. The resulting separation of families has taken a mental health toll in a community that places high value on familial bonding, said Virginia Wabano, who is co-ordinating evacuee services from a hotel in Beaupr\u00e9, Que., a town about 40 kilometres east of Quebec City.</p><p>\"Family is very important to us,\" she explained. \"When we go through a crisis, families want to be together. But sometimes there are processes and protocols that hinder that. And then it creates a lot of social issues.\"</p><p>The displacement, she added, has deprived community members of some of the traditional foods that make up their regular diet. There's also concern among evacuees that fires could destroy traditional camps and trap lines.</p><p>Pr\u00e9vost said he worries about not only the potential adverse health effects from the evacuations \u2014 which in some cases have been weeks long \u2014 but also the mental health and social impacts that could linger after evacuees return home.</p><p>\"Being evacuated is one thing. Returning home is another thing,\" he said, describing the evacuees as climate refugees. \"It's a heavy situation.\"</p><p>READ ALSO: Fire centre declares 2023 already worst year ever for Canadian wildfires</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230628PAB4486295</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K1-T7K1-JD2C-J2W1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

North Salt Spring Waterworks District is still at Stage 3 restrictions, and the Salt Spring Island Fire Rescue department says our Fire Hazard Rating is back at an Extreme level. July 2023 went down in history as one of the driest months ever on Salt Spring, showing us just how severe this climate crisis is.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, the big question on our minds is:Are we on Salt Spring Island ready to handle the climate challenges coming our way? Transition Salt Spring has just wrapped up the Climate Report Card 2023, an update on how we're doing with the Salt Spring Island Climate Action Plan 2.0 that came out in 2021. The plan's goal is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030 in line with Canada's commitments at the United Nations and also to get our island and all its humans and non-humans ready for the climate changes heading our way.</p><p>Since the plan came out, we've been making progress in many areas. Electric transportation has increased, taking care of our forests, improving food security and making our buildings resilient against severe weather impacts. All of this shows we're committed to keeping our community safe.</p><p>Some great work worth noting so far:\u07e6 The community bought several important land parcels, helping us protect our forests and trap carbon.</p><p>\u07e6 There's now a Salt Spring Island Watershed Protection Plan.</p><p>\u07e6 The Salt Spring Island Farm-land Trust launched The Root Food Hub.</p><p>\u07e6 The Capital Regional District (CRD), the Farmland Trust, Salt Spring Island Abattoir, and Island Community Services announced a new composting facility.</p><p>\u07e6 Electric vehicles (EVs) are catching on, with a 40 per cent increase from 2020 to 2021. Also, the CRD has supported more EV charging spots, and we have our first two electric school buses.</p><p>\u07e6 Island Pathways received federal dollars to push the Salish Sea Trail Network forward.</p><p>\u07e6 Transition Salt Spring's Climate Adaptation Research Lab (CARL) is working on projects that make our wetlands healthier and cut forest fire risk on Mount Maxwell.</p><p>But here's the hard part:even with all these wins, the Climate Report Card tells us we are far from hitting the mark to meet the goals of the Climate Action Plan. We must recognize that we're not ready for the unusual weather here now and the more extreme weather that's coming. To tackle these issues, we've got to change how we build things, plan our community and take care of our natural areas to cut the risk of things like fires, droughts and storms. It's not just about cutting emissions; it's about getting tougher in the face of wild weather.</p><p>As we gear up for more weather extremes, we must remember that we also need affordable places for folks to live and smart solutions for managing water to enable more housing on the island. The report card reminds us about a crucial issue:climate change hits people differently based on where they live, how much money they have, their gender and their ethnicity. Our actions should ensure everyone on Salt Spring, human and not, becomes more resilient as climate problems worsen.</p><p>Transition Salt Spring has begun the process of engaging with our local elected officials with an invitation to determine which priorities get integrated into their planning, supported by discussions with island organizations and the community. Keep an eye on the Driftwood; Transition Salt Spring will soon roll out the main ideas from the Climate Report Card. If you'd like to learn more about the report, please join us for the next ASK Salt Spring event on Friday, Sept. 29 at 11 a.m. at the Salt Spring Island Multi Space. We look forward to seeing you there! Funding from the Salt Spring Island Foundation and the Capital Regional District made the Climate Report Card possible.l/l/e thank our dedicated board and staff, particularly climate researcher Kacia Tolsma, for bringing this report together.</p><p>BY TRANSITION SALT SPRING</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUDFWD-news20230920PGWA0003883254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUDFWD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:696Y-BN01-JD2C-J048-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484148</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"684\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

nitf:lede=\"true\">A former editor of mine was a chain smoker.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My meetings with him were usually held outdoors in the rear of the newspaper office so he could smoke as we chatted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was hard on him to no longer be allowed to smoke in his office, as he had for most of his career up to that point, because the new and harsh smoking regulations began taking effect in the early 2000s that prevented people from smoking in most public spaces.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But he knew he must follow the rules and be a leader in the office, so he suffered through the new workplace reality and put up with getting rained and snowed on regularly in the backyard as he tried to continue to enjoy his ongoing bad habit.</p><p>My editor recognized that he and other smokers were being villainized by society as the full impacts of the health consequences of smoking were becoming more well known, particularly to nonsmokers, and it bothered him that something he had enjoyed with few problems since was a kid was now a major issue, with many people looking down their noses at him for it.</p><p>That\u2019s why he was militant against smokers who toss cigarette butts out their car windows, especially during dry periods like we are currently experiencing on Vancouver Island.</p><p>I remember he would rant and rave every time reports came in of fires started in the dry grass and/or bushes at the side of roads that were started by careless smokers throwing still-lit cigarettes from their cars.</p><p>A video from a security camera of two men working in a backyard that I watched recently clearly illustrates the dangers of cigarettes around dry kindling.</p><p>One of the workers was smoking and when he reached the butt, he took some time rubbing it into the dirt and other materials at the base of a large hedge to make sure it was fully extinguished before leaving it.</p><p>It should be said that the smoker was trying to responsible by ensuring his cigarette was out, but a whole six hours later, the video shows a tiny flame poke up through the dirt and debris where the cigarette butt was supposedly put out in the now empty backyard, which quickly leapt up into the hedge and, within mere seconds, the whole hedge was on fire.</p><p>Luckily, the homeowner was nearby and called 911 before trying to tackle the fire with his garden hose.</p><p>The fire was eventually doused with no damage to the home, but it could have been a lot worse if the homeowner hadn\u2019t intervened.</p><p>My editor, a life-long smoker with no intention of ever quitting, took offence to these types of cigarette-caused fires and would write columns in the newspaper about the issue and condemn and mock his fellow smokers for being so stupid as to throw butts out their windows, and stating they should be issued steep fines for their carelessness.</p><p>He would even have me take pic-tures of his hand holding a lit cigarette out his car window to show smokers what not to do to get his point across.</p><p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m sure my editor, who died in 2005 from cancer, would have fully agreed with the decision of the Saanich police department to ticket a driver who threw a cigarette butt out his car window $575 last week to serve as a reminder of the dangers attached to improper cigarette disposal amid dry conditions and extreme provincial forest fire ratings.</p><p>My editor may have been a life-long chain smoker, starting back in a time when commercials would be on the air stating that three out of four doctors smoke Camel cigarettes, but he was also a conscientious member of the community who would not purposely harm anyone.</p><p>He stood outside in the elements to smoke his cigarettes in the back of the newspaper office not only because he had to if he wanted to smoke, but also because he didn\u2019t want to cause any adverse health and other impacts to his employees or anyone else.</p><p>He would have given a medal to the police officer who issued the $575 ticket.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

began taking effect in the early 2000s that prevented people from smoking in most public spaces.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But he knew he must follow the rules and be a leader in the office, so he suffered through the new workplace reality and put up with getting rained and snowed on regularly in the backyard as he tried to continue to enjoy his ongoing bad habit.</p><p>My editor recognized that he and other smokers were being villainized by society as the full impacts of the health consequences of smoking were becoming more well known, particularly to nonsmokers, and it bothered him that something he had enjoyed with few problems since was a kid was now a major issue, with many people looking down their noses at him for it.</p><p>That\u2019s why he was militant against smokers who toss cigarette butts out their car windows, especially during dry periods like we are currently experiencing on Vancouver Island.</p><p>I remember he would rant and rave every time reports came in of fires started in the dry grass and/or bushes at the side of roads that were started by careless smokers throwing still-lit cigarettes from their cars.</p><p>A video from a security camera of two men working in a backyard that I watched recently clearly illustrates the dangers of cigarettes around dry kindling.</p><p>One of the workers was smoking and when he reached the butt, he took some time rubbing it into the dirt and other materials at the base of a large hedge to make sure it was fully extinguished before leaving it.</p><p>It should be said that the smoker was trying to responsible by ensuring his cigarette was out, but a whole six hours later, the video shows a tiny flame poke up through the dirt and debris where the cigarette butt was supposedly put out in the now empty backyard, which quickly leapt up into the hedge and, within mere seconds, the whole hedge was on fire.</p><p>Luckily, the homeowner was nearby and called 911 before trying to tackle the fire with his garden hose.</p><p>The fire was eventually doused with no damage to the home, but it could have been a lot worse if the homeowner hadn\u2019t intervened.</p><p>My editor, a life-long smoker with no intention of ever quitting, took offence to these types of cigarette-caused fires and would write columns in the newspaper about the issue and condemn and mock his fellow smokers for being so stupid as to throw butts out their windows, and stating they should be issued steep fines for their carelessness.</p><p>He would even have me take pictures of his hand holding a lit cigarette out his car window to show smokers what not to do to get his point across.</p><p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m sure my editor, who died in 2005 from cancer, would have fully agreed with the decision of the Saanich police department to ticket a driver who threw a cigarette butt out his car window $575 last week to serve as a reminder of the dangers attached to improper cigarette disposal amid dry conditions and extreme provincial forest fire ratings.</p><p>My editor may have been a life-long chain smoker, starting back in a time when commercials would be on the air stating that three out of four doctors smoke Camel cigarettes, but he was also a conscientious member of the community who would not purposely harm anyone.</p><p>He stood outside in the elements to smoke his cigarettes in the back of the newspaper office not only because he had to if he wanted to smoke, but also because he didn\u2019t want to cause any adverse health and other impacts to his employees or anyone else.</p><p>He would have given a medal to the police officer who issued the $575 ticket.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

He said warm, sunny weather could return thereafter with a chance of only isolated showers through the weekend.</p><p>More rain could come in the first week of July, but nothing like the \"organized system\" of showers that had been forecasted for this week, Legault said.</p><p>Despite the rain, the task of controlling the province's fires remains \"colossal,\" said Julie Coupal, SOPFEU assistant director. The agency counted more than 100 wildfires across the province Tuesday, including 77 in the southern half, where more than two dozen fires were considered out of control.</p><p>Ongoing evacuation orders had displaced around 4,400 people as of Tuesday morning, including the residents of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, Mistissini and Waswanipi, as well as parts of the communities of Obedjiwan, Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou, Senneterre and Val-d'Or.</p><p>Elsewhere in Canada, wildfires have forced evacuations and road closures. In B.C., officials partially reopened Highway 99 near Vancouver after a fire in the hills north of the city led them to block access to the freeway on Monday. In Manitoba, residents of Leaf Rapids began evacuating Monday after the town in the north of the province declared a state of emergency due to an encroaching fire.</p><p>In the United States, smoke from Canadian fires have led to air quality alerts in Michigan and Minnesota. Officials in Chicago advised vulnerable residents to stay indoors to avoid adverse health effects.</p><p>Meanwhile, NASA has reported that smoke from wildfires in northern Quebec had reached Europe. The American space agency said satellite imagery from Monday showed smoke extending across the North Atlantic Ocean to the Iberian Peninsula, France and other parts of western Europe.</p><p>Air quality in Europe has not deteriorated to the extent seen in Canada, however, because of the height of the smoke in the atmosphere, NASA explained.</p><p>Smoky air led Environment Canada to issue smog warnings in much of southern Quebec over the weekend, and parts of the province's westernmost region were still subject on Tuesday to an air quality alert.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 27, 2023. </p><p>\u2014 With files from The Associated Press.</p><p>---</p><p>This story was produced with the financial assistance of the Meta and Canadian Press News Fellowship.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-812e2bda1c694935b357890867396b88</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JY-XGS1-JBVR-30P4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"507\"/><timeReceived>05:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 27, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Her job, she explained, is to ensure the camp runs smoothly, that fire crews have all their essential needs met and are as \"comfortable\" as possible when they finish a shift on the fire lines. <br/><br/> \"They're away from home ... so we want to keep them well fed and housed,\" she said.<br/><br/> The small camp has a staff of about eight workers, which includes a chef, cooks, a health staffer, a janitor, a maintenance worker and a designated sandwich maker whose sole job is to ensure each firefighter is equipped with about four sandwiches per day.<br/><br/> Shawn McKerry, a former wildland firefighter in Alberta, knows what these people need for support. Now the dean of Lakeland College emergency training centre in Vermilion, Alta., McKerry previously helped battle some of Alberta's most ferocious and historic wildfires. <br/><br/> After a gruelling day on the fire lines, he said most firefighters are completely exhausted and camp is their refuge.<br/><br/> \"If you want to keep them motivated, high morale and keep them working, you've got to try to be able to support them where (you) can,\" he said. \"Camps aren't the most ideal experience, (but) fortunately, you've got a lot of motivated people who want to go out and help, that are willing to sacrifice some of those comforts - or almost all of those comforts - to get out there and assist in the effort.\"<br/><br/> Those efforts continue to be tested as crews across Canada battle the worst season on record. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre has reported more than 131,000 square kilometres of land and forest have been scorched across the country. <br/><br/>B.C. is experiencing its most destructive season on record for area burned with more than 15,000 square kilometres charred, surpassing the previous record of 13,543 square kilometres set in 2018.<br/><br/> In a social media post last month, the BC Wildfire Service highlighted the contracted staffers it said play \"critical\" roles in the provincial fire fight. <br/><br/> Such jobs include heavy equipment operators, First Nations crew members, first aid attendants and medics, camp and facility managers, kitchen staff, danger tree assessors, fallers, food service staff, forest industry experts, contract firefighters, pilots and air support staff, as well as various other trades, the service said.<br/><br/> Provincial fire information officer Mike McCulley said such workers are often easily overlooked by those outside the service. \"It's a really complex organization and there are many moving pieces to the puzzle,\" he said in an interview. \"I think folks just think that it's just firefighters on the ground fighting fire and that's so far from the truth.\"<br/><br/> McKerry said, after a day in the field, most firefighters needs are simple. \"When you get back to camp, the best luxury you can have is clean washrooms and access to food,\" he said.<br/><br/> At the Takla camp, Callihoo said most firefighters sleep in tents, but working showers, washrooms and a workable kitchen equipped with a dining area are set up on site. <br/><br/> Food quantities are determined based on the number of firefighters on scene, with groceries delivered once a week, she said. \"It's a juggling process because you want to make sure you have enough food for everybody,\" Callihoo said. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023080768689745</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68WG-TRF1-F197-52GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Higher pollution levels will persist throughout Wednesday sitting at level 9, and will continue into the night.<br/><br/> Air quality is expected to stay on the high risk side of the spectrum until Thursday, sitting at level 8. The smoke haze is expected to dissipate into the end of the work week, with air quality possibly improving by Friday.<br/><br/> A thick haze has already blanked neighbouring southern Ontario cities like<url normalizedValue=\"https://weather.gc.ca/airquality/pages/onaq-011_e.html\"> London</url>, where air quality crept to level 9 on Tuesday afternoon, a degree of air pollution expected to rise above the spectrum later into evening, climbing above 10. Other cities like <url normalizedValue=\"https://weather.gc.ca/airquality/pages/onaq-010_e.html\">Windsor</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://weather.gc.ca/airquality/pages/onaq-041_e.html\">Sudbury</url> are also forecasting air quality levels to be \"very high risk\" by Tuesday evening.<br/><br/> \"Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health, even at low concentrations,\" Environment Canada added<br/><br/> The federal agency is advising to reduce direct exposure to wildfire smoke in outdoor settings. Residents with pre-existing health conditions such as lung or heart disease, older adults, pregnant people and children may also experience health effects as the air quality degrades. <br/><br/> Mild irritation and breathing discomfort might show as initial symptoms. Those staying outside for prolonged hours are advised to wear a respirator-type mask, like the N95, preventing fine smoke air particles from passing through small openings.<br/><br/> \"It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms,\" Environment Canada said.<br/><br/> The Toronto District School Board told The Star each school would independently decide whether or not to suspend or move outdoor activities inside throughout the week based on local conditions. <br/><br/> Earlier in June, Toronto's air quality <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/06/06/torontos-air-quality-ranks-among-the-worlds-worst-as-fires-rage-in-ontario-and-quebec.html\">ranked among the world's worst</url>, prompting the cancellation of recreational sports activities, reducing opening hours at the Toronto Zoo and leading to the rescheduling of several outdoor activities, including school trips. <br/><br/> The thick blanket of acrid smoke enveloped Toronto on June 5, polluting the city's air, and worsening its quality up to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.airqualityontario.com/aqhi/today.php?stationid=35125&amp;start_day=5&amp;start_month=6&amp;start_year=2023&amp;showType=chart&amp;station_id=34021&amp;submitter=Refresh+Page\">level 8 or high risk </url>on pockets of the city. A special air quality statement was also issued at the time lasting until June 9.<br/><br/> The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center, a not-for-profit corporation operated by federal, provincial and territorial fire management agencies, recounts on its data set that at least <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">485 fires were burning by Tuesday afternoon</url> nationwide, 115 are raging in Quebec and while 61 in Ontario.<br/><br/> Santiago Arias Orozco is a breaking news reporter, working out of the Star's radio room in Toronto.

It's approximately 16 kilometres west of the town,\u00a0just past Bell Rock along Highway 5. The fire started in a field of grass on private property and has spread.</p><p>The local fire department and wildfire crews were on scene about one hour ago, and TDC Contracting water trucks were also seen entering the property. According to N.W.T. wildfire information officer Mike Westwick the fire is estimated to be 22 hectares.\u00a0</p><p>Westwick said the fire is suspected to have been caused by an escaped burn pile. The fire is classified as out of control, but does not currently pose any threat to the town of Fort Smith.</p><p>\"That means that we haven't successfully built a perimeter that's limiting the spread but progress is being made by crews on the ground,\" he said.</p><p>Smoke and fire are visible from the town and along the highway but there are no highway disruptions yet.\u00a0The wind is pushing the fire south toward the Slave River but Westwick said that can change fast.</p><p>He said that two wildfire crews are on\u00a0the fire with assistance from an aircraft and bulldozer and that protecting cabins, residences, the highway, and fibre infrastructure nearby are their priorities.</p><p>\"We are very alive to the fact that there are a whole lot of cabins and residence nearby and our team is working really, really hard to fight that fire,\" he said.</p><p>Westwick added that wildfires caused people are often more dangerous than lightning-caused fires.\u00a0Lightning-caused fires usually ignite\u00a0in the back country, whereas person-caused fires are generally closer to cabins and other infrastructure.</p><p>\"Our key message this weekend is that the southern part of the territories is set to see some really, really hot and dry weather.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Friday, March. 8, 18 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> TICKETS<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.<br/><br/> As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.<br/><br/> PAST LOCATIONS<br/><br/>

Last week the Prince Albert Grand Council (PAGC), which has a First Nation forest fire protection services contract with the provincial government, urged the province to take preventative measures. The extremely dry winter conditions, following on the tail of the particularly bad 2023 wildfire season, have created a critical risk for wildfires this year. PAGC announced they will begin wildfire mitigation efforts, which can include prescribed burns, forest thinning and pruning, and the mechanical removal of vegetation, as soon as possible. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cliff Buettner, Director of Forestry for the Prince Albert Grand Council said Saskatchewan's wildfire season typically begins on April 1, but added that due to the dry conditions, there is a possibility that it could get an early start this year and the PAGC would be ready. PAGC Grand Chief Brian Hardlotte said preventative action, increased vigilance, and proactive strategies will be necessary to keep communities safe. </p><p>That sentiment holds for the rest of the province as well, especially if the dry conditions persist and are accompanied by early heat like in 2023. Phillip Harder, a hydrologist with Croptimistic Technology Inc., told Global News\u2019 Brody Langager on January 31st, that although things can change, based on the current trajectory, Saskatchewan is likely to see another drought this year. Harder explained that even if we still get a dump of snow, the infiltration potential of the soil is not there right now, and what will allow us to meet the water needs for crops this year will be what we get post-snow melt. \u201cThe best-case scenario is we get slow, gentle rains in April and May, but we can\u2019t guarantee those things.\u201d </p><p>The term soil infiltration refers to the downward entry of water into the soil. As soils dry, especially during drought events, they can crack and become so dried out that there is reduced infiltration and a greater likelihood of surface runoff and erosion, Bruce Lascelles, the United Kingdom Director of Sustainable Land Management explained in a LinkedIn article from August 2022. Rainfall which follows periods of drought, he continued, will take longer to recharge soil and groundwater reservoirs. The past three years of reduced overall rainfall during the growing season has left the soil in a significant moisture deficit which has left it poorly prepared to absorb water from anything other than a slow prolonged gentle rain event. </p><p>More than 80 rural municipalities declared agricultural disaster in 2023 due to drought, and the president of the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities, Ray Orb, expects to see more this spring. Additionally, Orb stated he would like to see the irrigation expansion announced by the Saskatchewan government in the summer of 2020 moving forward. The project\u2019s goal to develop more irrigable acres is part of the long-term growth plan formulated by the government. However, with more irrigation comes the demand for more water. Joel Peru, Water Security Agency\u2019s Director of Irrigation, said that he is not concerned about Lake Diefenbaker\u2019s capacity to supply water to current and future farmers. Referencing a recent WSA analysis of 88 years of flow data on Lake Diefenbaker, Peru said it showed there are 900,000-acre feet of water available, however, the lake itself has only existed since 1967, and the upstream dam on the Oldman River, which provides thirty percent of the water flow for the South Saskatchewan River Basin, was only completed thirty years ago. The problem with relying on data from the past is that it fails to take into consideration current science and the unpredictable nature of the climate changes already being experienced. </p><p>On February 1, CBC published an article written by Jason Markusoff on the talks beginning in Alberta as experts and the provincial government agree that as bad as last year\u2019s drought was this year\u2019s drought could be historically worse and require drastic conservation measures. The Oldman Reservoir west of Fort Macleod is at 28 percent capacity, compared to a normal range between 62 and 80 percent around now. The reservoir on the St. Mary River is at 15 percent when it should be between 41 and 70. St. Mary River joins the Oldman River downriver from Lethbridge, which then joins the Bow River to form the South Saskatchewan River. Groundwater by Kananaskis' Marmot Creek is at its lowest levels in more than a half-century, and tracking of the Bow River at Calgary last summer showed it at the lowest ever measured going back to 1911.

And so, Lake Diefenbaker can manage through more than one year [of] drought. Of course, how long depends on the severity of the drought,\u201d Pomeroy said.

She says while the changing climate can be a result of the El Nino, it still raises cause for concern. \u201cCertainly, when you are starting to break temperatures like we are, there is something else going on beyond just the El Nino,\u201d Lang said. </p><p>Significant long-term moisture deficits remained across western Saskatchewan, in an area of the western portion of the province bordered by Lloydminster in the north, Outlook in the east, and Maple Creek in the south. These areas have gone into winter with below- to well below-normal soil moisture levels, leaving the area vulnerable to water supply issues for the 2024 growing season. In early December, the South Saskatchewan River was currently at its second-lowest level in the past 23 years.  </p><p>In a November 20, 2023, article written by Shane Clausing and shared on FarmnewsNow, Jeremy Welter, a farmer from Kerrobert, shared his worries. Snowfall during the winter has a major impact on soil moisture levels in the spring, but it is less of an issue of moisture; what the snow really provides is moisture conservation. \u201cWhile you\u2019ve got that snow on the fields, it\u2019s kind of like a blanket, so it stops that moisture in the dirt from just evaporating through the soil and disappearing, and that\u2019s what we don\u2019t currently have.\u201d </p><p>Welter also expressed concern about what another poor crop year in Saskatchewan could mean for people across Canada and around the world. \u201cMost of what we produce in Saskatchewan and Western Canada does not stay in Canada. A vast majority of our production goes to other parts of the world, and that is something that weighs on all of us,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe produce food for a very hungry world, and when we are unable to do that, that means somebody, somewhere is potentially going hungry. There is a lot that weighs on the minds of farmers in years and weather cycles like this.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through this before, but I think this is kind of the longest and most sustained drought period we\u2019ve had,\u201d Don Connick, a farmer in Gull Lake said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got four or five years of drought under our belt now where we\u2019ve had below normal rainfall and higher temperatures.\u201d (<url normalizedValue=\"https://farmnewsnow.com/2023/11/30/incredibly-concerning-lack-of-snow-leaves-some-sask-farmers-worried/\">https://farmnewsnow.com/2023/11/30/incredibly-concerning-lack-of-snow-leaves-some-sask-farmers-worried/</url>) </p><p>Contrasting the concern voiced by farmers, hydrologists, and meteorologists, Ian Boxall, the president of the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan (APAS) says he is confident that more snow will be seen yet this winter. Moreover, that snow will be \u201cenough to fill up dugouts for farmers\u2026I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll get the moisture that we require before spring,\u201d Boxall said. However, there is no question that the soil will still benefit from further snow, which is certain to occur yet this winter, because the plus-degree temperatures of late have left the stubble in fields empty so it can trap more snow on the ground. Pomeroy would caution that Saskatchewan\u2019s drought should be a wake-up call for those in agriculture. The strong El Ni\u00f1o system this year, combined with the chronic heating effects of climate change should have everyone looking at ways to conserve water. Fresh water is very much a finite resource and as Stacey Smythe, an assistant deputy minister with Alberta Environment, stated, \u201cMore than agriculture will be impacted if this extreme level of dryness continues.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-543ad88db84d4919a21ce9b430c2b234</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B95-GV31-DY9S-T1R7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1542\"/><timeReceived>09:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 8, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

There may be some hope on the horizon after the number of fires burning across the country fell slightly, but forecasts suggest smoke warnings will remain in place in several provinces into the weekend.</p><p>The record setting air pollution that blanketed Ottawa and much of eastern Ontario with a yellow-tinged haze Wednesday had mostly cleared by Thursday morning, and the sun was even glimpsed briefly.</p><p>But further south, towards the Greater Toronto Area and in areas around Sudbury and North Bay, the air quality remained poor. Environment Canada forecast very high-risk air quality in the GTA, southwestern Ontario and the Niagara region into Thursday night.</p><p>Multiple health studies have linked wildfire smoke to serious health consequences including heart attacks, strokes and breathing problems, and the poor air quality has prompted cancellations or changes to outdoor activities as a result.</p><p>The Toronto District School Board joined several of its counterparts across the region in cancelling outdoor activities and moving recess inside for a second straight day Thursday. The Toronto Zoo also announced it would close early.</p><p>On Friday and Saturday, most of Ontario should expect moderately bad air quality. At high risk, people are advised to reduce their outdoor activities, while at moderate risk the advice is to only consider doing so.</p><p>In British Columbia there was a risk of moderately bad air quality in parts of the Fraser Valley, Vancouver and some parts of Vancouver Island on Thursday. By Friday, the risk is expected to be low almost everywhere in the province but Fort St. John.</p><p>In Alberta, the worst air is near Fort Chipewyan, which remains on an evacuation order as a fire burns out of control.

But this year, from Tuesday to Thursday, the maximum temperatures recorded at the Niagara District Airport were 31.1 C, 31.6 C and 32.1 C, respectively. </p><p><br/><br/> \"Those are not record-breaking temperatures. This time of year, the records are into the 34 C range, thankfully, not broken. That's a relief for me at least,\" said Kidd. \"Maximum high temperatures fluctuate here and there. Three days usually though, that can be longer for a heat spell. Sometimes we see one day or two days ... a little more unusual.\"<br/><br/> Over the next week, temperatures are predicted to be on the lower side of average, staying between 23 and 26 C, with overnight lows about 17 to 20 C. <br/><br/> But in the next few months, Environment Canada's prediction model says Niagara may see a return to extreme heat. At the very least, it is expecting above-average temperatures in July and a \"chance of being above normal\" into August and September. Very similar to what is expected across the province. <br/><br/> With summer underway, there are numerous weather patterns and events people should have their eye on. The first is UV rays, which Kidd said can be surprisingly strong, especially after a few days of cloudiness, and thunderstorms. <br/><br/> People also need to understand the difference between a watch and a warning. A severe thunderstorm watch means people should prepare, as the ingredients are there for a severe weather incident. A warning means take action immediately.<br/><br/> \"When thunder roars, go indoors,\" Kidd added, and stay indoors until the thunder has passed, at least 30 minutes. <br/><br/> \"Most lightning injuries and deaths actually occur, not at the peak of the thunderstorm, but after,\" she explained. \"It's really tough. If you've got your kids and they want to play their soccer, got to keep them off the field for 30 minutes. Because thunder, lightning can come out from a cloud and travel quite a distance and then reach the ground.<br/><br/> \"That's where people get into trouble.\"<br/><br/> If you can't get indoors or to a vehicle, Kidd said don't take shelter under a large tree - which is more likely to get hit by lightning and fall - but find smaller trees and bushes, in low lying areas. Stay out of the water, she said, reminding people \"water is a good conductor of electricity.\"<br/><br/> \"There's a reason we say these things - it's not to be party poopers,\" she said. <br/><br/> The forest fire smoke is expected to remain an issue until the wildfires in northeastern Ontario and Quebec are extinguished. <br/><br/> The resulting air quality can deteriorate quickly, not only from the smoke but also from general pollution, sunlight, and heat. <br/><br/> Keep an eye on the air quality index, especially vulnerable populations, said Kidd. <br/><br/> \"Enjoy your summer and be prepared.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WELTRI-2023070868409390</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WELTRI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68N3-PM91-F197-53XG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433814</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"493\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Welland Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Welland Tribune (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 8, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOA4</classCode><className>WEATHER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
