They're increasing in size and intensity. But our reaction time is slowing and the fires are escaping containment more often.\"</p><p>Climate change is driving a long-term trend toward more and bigger forest fires and Ontario is currently facing one of its worst fire seasons on record. With three months to go, more than 375,000 hectares of forest have already burned, the fifth highest total in the last 30 years. In June, three First Nations in the north were evacuated.</p><p>Last month, the Star revealed that Ontario is operating with more than 100 fewer wildland firefighters than it did 10 years ago - fielding 630 fire rangers, when it used to have 732 - leading to a drop in the number of forest fires brought under control within 24 hours, key to avoiding the massive conflagrations that consume entire communities.</p><p>New staffing numbers provided by OPSEU show how that 14 per cent reduction in personnel is exacerbated on the ground, with 27 per cent fewer crews - groups of four or five fire rangers - available to dispatch to forest fires.</p><p>This year, Ontario is short 53 of the 190 crews it used to operate, with only 60 out of 101 crews in the Northwest Region, west of Marathon, and 77 of 89 crews in the Northeastern Region, stretching from Marathon down to the French and Mattawa Rivers.</p><p>Shortstaffing means that wildfire fighters are being worked to the bone, said Noah Freedman, vice president of OPSEU Local 703.</p><p>Fire Rangers have been working flat out since early May, he said. They've just finished their third 19 day shift in a row, with only two days off between shifts, and they're getting burned out.</p><p>\"The young people, the lack of experience. As fatigue builds, you have people who already don't know what they're doing making poorer and poorer decisions,\" said Freedman.</p><p>Natural Resources Minister Mike Harris Jr. declined an interview request and sent a statement in response to questions from the Star.</p><p>\"Ontario works with provincial, federal, and international partners to ensure the necessary resources are deployed to keep communities in our province, and across North America, safe,\" the statement read. \"These mutual aid partnership agreements enable the sharing of additional personnel, equipment, and aircraft.\"</p><p>The province has already received aid from Quebec and B.C., which have sent two waterbombers and more than 100 firefighters this season, according to data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. </p><p>The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) said nine waterbombers are available this season, though it was unclear whether this total includes the waterbombers on loan from Quebec.</p><p>Harris Jr.'s office disputed the notion that the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch (AFFES) is understaffed, saying there isn't an ideal number of fire rangers but a target \"range\" for hiring.</p><p>\"We're comfortable with the number of crews we have,\" said an official in the minister's office, whom the Star agreed not to name so they could speak on background. \"We have a lot of confidence in our fire rangers.\"</p><p>\"It would be ideal to be fully staffed, but we're not there,\" the official added. \"We'd hire more if there were more applications.\"</p><p>OPSEU says AFFES staff are leaving for more lucrative jobs because Ontario's waterbomber pilots are the worst paid in the country and the fire rangers are among the worst paid.</p><p>Starting pay for Ontario wildland firefighters is $25.38 an hour.</p><p>While Premier Doug Ford has announced the purchase of six new waterbombers, the half a billion dollars associated with their purchase and staffing has not been allocated in the budget. Due to a backlog in orders, the planes would not be delivered for nearly a decade.</p><p>But Hornick said there's no use in buying new waterbombers if we can't staff the ones we already have.</p><p>Fewer pilots means the ones on staff are being worked to the bone. Working shifts that last 10 days, pilots are getting sick and planes are being grounded when they're unavailable to fly, Hornick said. This was the case in June when two waterbombers were grounded due to pilot illness as blazes grew across the north.</p><p>That's in addition to another waterbomber grounded due to lack of crew, bringing the total to three waterbombers, three helicopters, two Turbo Beaver bushplanes and one Twin Otter float plane grounded this season, OPSEU numbers show.</p><p>This represents nine of the 28 aircraft operated by the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch (AFFES) of the Ministry of Natural Resources.</p><p>The loss of experience through retirement is being felt throughout the AFFES, said Hornick. The chief helicopter pilot retired two years ago and hasn't been replaced, they said. (The MNR says \"a temporary Chief Rotary Wing Pilot is in place.\") Twenty of 46 aircraft mechanics have left in the last five years.</p><p>Overall, there's a 40 per cent turnover at the AFFES, leading to younger and less experienced staff being promoted into positions of responsibility, Hornick added.</p><p>The MNR said it has brought in a number of measures to reduce turnover, including establishing 100 new year-round support jobs, reimbursing training costs and expanding standby pay and on-call benefits.</p><p>At the same time, however, recruitment numbers have plummeted, Hornick said, making it harder to train up the next generation of firefighters.</p><p>\"We're seeing fewer and fewer applications,\" they said. \"Anecdotally, I've heard stories about literally trying to recruit people off the street to apply.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WELTRI-2025070676018050</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WELTRI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G6M-7PY3-RRHK-T1G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433814</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1063\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Welland Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Welland Tribune (Ontario) Online</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 6, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;

Our team was really excited to see them go back.\u201d</p><p>The evacuation began in early June, when out-of-control wildfires forced Sandy Lake residents to leave their homes. Kapuskasing, along with neighbouring Smooth Rock Falls, stepped up to host evacuees. Creemergency, a partnership between Kashechewan First Nation and the O\u2019Briens Group, was activated on short notice to co-ordinate the response.</p><p>SEE: 'We understand': Creemergency supporting forest fire evacuees         </p><p>What started as a crisis response quickly became something deeper, Wesley said.</p><p>\u201cThe resilience of the evacuees really stood out,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were incredibly patient. And I can\u2019t say enough about our team. They went above and beyond, building real connections and making sure needs were met every single day.\u201d</p><p>Creemergency provided what Wesley calls \u201cwraparound services,\u201d including transportation, meals, security, and community support rooted in cultural understanding. Many team members are from Kashechewan First Nation and have themselves lived through many evacuations.</p><p>For now, Creemergency isn\u2019t currently working with any new First Nations, but Wesley said they remain on standby as fire season continues.</p><p>\u201cWe had 24 hours\u2019 notice to respond to Sandy Lake. That\u2019s the kind of readiness we bring,\u201d he said. \u201cOur teams can deploy at a moment\u2019s notice. The fires are still burning. We\u2019re ready for anything.\u201d</p><p>Wesley hopes governments are paying attention for future evacuations.</p><p>\u201cServices like ours need to be prioritized,\u201d Wesley said. \u201cWe know our people.

Witnesses said the fire is burning close to an area that was hit with another forest fire a few years ago.</p><p>Both the Coombs and Dashwood fire departments are responding to the blaze and are being supported by RCMP.</p><p>BCWS says there is no imminent threat to \"values,\" which usually means structures or highways.</p><p>The Alberni Valley Chamber of Commerce said while there is currently no threat to the highway, they understand people may have concerns.</p><p>\"The 2023 closure is still fresh in many of our minds on how quickly things can change and how deeply it impacted our region,\" an email from chamber CEO Jolleen Dick says. \"While Highway 4 remains open and there's no current threat to the road, we know some of you may already be getting questions or feeling that familiar uncertainty.\"</p><p>Dick's email adds the Visitor Centre is open Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and is ready to support travellers who may need help navigating the fire situation and may extend its hours to that end.</p><p>Alberni-Clayoquat Regional District (ACRD) has activated an emergency operations centre and is monitoring the situation, a social media post from the ACRD says.</p><p>Travellers along Highway 4 are asked to stay focused on the road and maintain the flow of traffic as wildfire crews are working in the area. Follow DriveBC.ca for up to date traffic information.</p><p>The fire is believed to be human caused, according to the BCWS.</p><p>This is a developing story and we will add more details as they become available.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Alberni Valley News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AVLNWS-news20250731PAE4749172</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AVLNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCY-J4K3-RXT0-70PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"579\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Falling within what's called the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest eco zone, Simcoe County serves as a transition area from the dense, unified coniferous (evergreen) forests to the north to the more broken-up and diverse variety of old and new deciduous trees (e.g., maple or oak) of southern Ontario.</p><p>\"We have a pretty complex mix of species and ages, and along with that, we often have fragmented forest landscape. So that type of difference really does provide for a different level of resilience from danger,\" he tells Simcoe.com.</p><p>Another major factor is the county's proximity to large bodies of water, providing a higher level of humidity. Davis says these high humidity levels have even put a damper on his controlled burn efforts in the past.</p><p>\"The biggest difficulty we have is getting the right conditions to actually get the forest to burn,\" he admits.</p><p>However, all this doesn't mean it's not possible to see such a damaging wildfire locally, says Davis, who even indicates the odd fire has cropped up, while none have presented much a challenge for local fire services.</p><p>\"We just don't tend to have the conditions that we need to see those more catastrophic fire conditions that you see in other areas,\" he reaffirms.</p><p>Is climate change a factor?</p><p>As for the effects of climate change on Simcoe County's chances of a severe wildfire, Davis says it's something that everyone has to pay attention to, adding that it does bring a level of unpredictability to the conversation.</p><p>However, Davis says, the best plan of attack on climate change is to be forearmed.</p><p>\"We still don't want to be nonchalant about it. We need to think about those things. We need to plan for them and be as prepared as we can be,\" he says.</p><p>While the effects of climate change on Simcoe County's forest fire chances are as yet unknown, Andee Pelan, executive director of the environmental advocacy group Living Green Barrie, says she is more concerned about the knock-off effect that an early spring ice storm had on the area's wildfire risk.</p><p>Pelan says the storm brought down a good number of trees in a vast area, creating what's called coarse woody debris. While Pelan says coarse woody debris is naturally occurring - and helps fuel natural, healthy forest fires that forested ecosystems rely on - too much of the stuff could be a bad thing.</p><p>\"Just imagine a backyard campfire. If you add more wood, the fire gets bigger. It's really just simply as that,\" she says.</p><p>While the coarse woody debris generated by the ice storm could be a factor, Pelan says that forest management isn't rocket science - it's much more complex.</p><p>\"Forest planning, there's a million different variables, a lot of things that shift.

The cost of aircrafts are going up. The cost of vehicles is going up. Fire retardant, which we used over a million litres of, has almost doubled in price in the past several years. Food for catering, for feeding all these crews. Obviously, the cost of food has gone up,\u201d director of Yukon Wildland Fire Management Devin Bailey said at the mid-season briefing.</p><p>\u201cAs everything gets more expensive, we\u2019re going to see more expensive responses during fire season.\u201d</p><p>Bailey expressed confidence in the Yukon government\u2019s ongoing support to protect communities from wildfire dangers.</p><p>\u201cYukon government will always ensure that wildland fire management has the funding it needs to ensure that Yukoners are safe,\u201d he said.</p><p>As the nation faces a wildland firefighter shortage, Bailey said the Yukon has brought in more help from outside the territory than ever before. That includes 192 firefighters and support staff from Canada and the United States through the Northwest Fire Fighting Compact, Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre and contract hires.</p><p>The Northwest Fire Fighting Compact is one of eight compacts of its kind across North America that involves the western provinces and northwestern territories as well as Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre is a federally incorporated non-profit corporation that is run by federal, provincial and territorial wildland fire management agencies across Canada.</p><p>Fifty export firefighters were sent from the Yukon to Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan, as well as across the border to Alaska and Oregon this season.</p><p>For the first time, a drone specialist was brought in, which proved to be beneficial, per Bailey.</p><p>With 93 active wildfires, close to 122,500 hectares burned and 38 fires put out, as of the evening of July 30, officials said it has been a busy season, mostly around Dawson City, Mayo and most recently Beaver Creek. Parts of those communities were put under evacuation alert for periods of time. Residents and visitors have seen highway closures and travel advisories in those regions, as well as the Alaska Highway south of the Yukon-B.C. border, particularly around Fort Nelson.</p><p>\u201cA lot of folks in Dawson were waking up in the morning to a really smoky sky and watching those fires sometimes from their backyard,\u201d fire information officer Haley Ritchie said at the briefing.</p><p>Ritchie noted some crew members worked backto-back shifts on the fire line with a mandatory rest period.</p><p>She noted that in the bigger picture, most of the territory has seen enough rain lately to knock down fire danger levels to low to moderate.</p><p>While the Yukon\u2019s capital might feel like it has seen a lull, officials told reporters the territory isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. Although most fires have started by lightning, they said to stay vigilant when it comes to having and putting out fires and other potentially fire-starting activities.</p><p>Four fires of note are still burning as cooler temperatures and humidity have help decreased fire activity in the central region, according to Bailey.</p><p>\u201cThe fires are digging in deep in certain areas where the drought codes are high and there\u2019s still lots of work to do out there,\u201d Bailey said.</p><p>\u201cWe are thinking not only about the well-being of Yukon communities, but also the safety of all of our emergency responders.\u201d</p><p>Officials were unable to put a number on the anticipated cost for the season; however, it will likely increase from the $23 million spent over the 2024 fire season. In past years, spending has hovered around $15 million to $40 million, per Bailey.</p><p>Contact Dana Hatherly at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dana.hatherly@yukon-news.com\">dana.hatherly@yukon-news.com</email></p><p>News Reporter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20250801PTEA0004865015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GD9-5B03-RRP4-Y3S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"666\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

(TSXV: RKR) (OTCQB: RKMSF) (FSE: 1RR1) (\"Rokmaster\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to provide an update for the Duncan Lake and Big Copper Projects.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both the Duncan Lake Project and Big Copper Project are located in southeastern British Columbia and have been steadily advanced by Rokmaster since 2018. Both Projects feature road access in favourable regions with the Trail Smelter within 170 km of the Duncan Lake Project and with the mining town of Kimberley, BC around the Sullivan Deposit within 50 km of the Big Copper Project (Figure 1).</p><p>A five-year Multi-year Area Based Exploration Permit (\"MYAB Permit\") was recently approved on the Duncan Lake Project by the British Columbia Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals (Figure 2). The MYAB Permit allows for up to 21 drill sites north of the historic Duncan Mine, which was developed by Cominco 1957-1960. Cominco identified eight mineralized zones but never produced ore from the mine. Between 1989 and 1997, Cominco and Teck Resources completed 12 diamond drillholes approximately 2,000 metres north of the Duncan Mine which intersected strong lead-zinc mineralization in the east limb of the north plunging Duncan Anticline. Rokmaster completed a small drill program in 2022 by re-entering one of these historic drillholes, which are all now on Rokmaster claims, and successfully intersected the west limb of the Duncan Anticline and cored a wide interval of Zn-Pb-Ag mineralization in the east limb (see news release dated May 17, 2022).</p><p>There is also a five year MYAB Permit covering the southern No.3, No.2, and No.1 Zones previously approved on the Duncan Lake Project. These zones were partially defined in the 1960's by Cominco who completed small trenching programs on surface exposures of massive sphalerite-galena mineralization in the east limb of the Duncan Anticline. This MYAB Permit allows for 26 drillsites and 15 trenches and while it expired in August 2025, an application to extend the end date on the permit due to a large forest fire which burned the region in 2024. The fire extensively burned throughout the No.2 Zone, No.1 Zone, and the Mag Zone with good potential for new outcrop exposure. The application to extend the permit was submitted in April 2025 and is currently in the consultation stage since June 2025.</p><p>Field work on the Duncan Lake Project in 2025 included trenching at the No.3 Zone and further prospecting and sampling in the Mag Zone (Figure 3). This work followed 2023 sampling which collected 127 soil samples and 22 rock samples1. Three of the trenches completed at the No.3 Zone returned high lead and zinc results with appreciable silver grades over meter-scale widths with channel sampling. An outcrop exposure at the No.1 Zone, approximately 3.1 km south of the No.3 Zone, was also channel sampled returning 14.64% combined lead and zinc with 6.67 g/t Ag over 4.5 m (Table 1). More advanced geochemical analysis is ongoing to assess the germanium, gallium, and indium concentrations in the mineralization.</p><p>Table 1: Duncan Lake Project Trench Sample Assay Results No. 3

Widths reported are sampled widths, such that true thicknesses are unknown. 2. All assay intervals represent length-weighted averages. 3. Some figures may not sum exactly due to rounding. 4.Samples were prepared and analyzed by MSALABS in Langley BC. After preparation, samples were analyzed for 30 elements including Zn, Pb and Ag by 4-acid digestion of a 0.2 g subsample with ICP-ES finish (MSALAB ore-grade method ICP-240).</p><p>A five year MYAB Permit was recently approved on the Big Copper Project by the British Columbia Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals (Figure 4). The MYAB Permit allows for 20 helicopter-supported drillsites and 4 helicopter pads. A field work program was completed on the Big Copper Project in 2023 which collected 165 soil samples and 11 rock samples, highlighting anomalous silver values in the southern portion of the Property2. The Big Copper Property hosts a mineralized deformation and alteration front approximately 4.5 km in strike defined by at least three adits, outcrops, seven trenches and several drillholes which support strong copper-silver mineralization. Mineralized zones are hosted within fine-grained siltstones, argillites and dirty quartzites of the Creston formation. The Creston formation is correlative with the Revett Formation which hosts several large sedimentary hosted copper-silver deposits and undeveloped occurrences in northern Montana and Idaho, including the Spar Lake, Montanore and Rock Creek deposits.</p><p>John Mirko, President and CEO, comments:</p><p>\"Having these exploration drill permits in hand provides Rokmaster the flexibility to get right to work on these fantastic projects. We have held and advanced the Duncan Lake and Big Copper Projects for many years and believe in the high potential for exploration success on both. Zinc and copper are critical elements which are very important in the current environment, and both projects have an ideal address for a discovery to be made and developed. The elevated silver concentrations on both projects, particularly on the Duncan Lake Project where the strength and significance of silver may not have been fully recognized, is what we're excited to test in addition to the increasingly critical elements.\"</p><p>Financing Update</p><p>The Company is also pleased to announce that further to its news release on October 7, 2025 that it has closed the first tranche of the flow-through funding (the \"FT Financing\") with the issuance of 11,450,000 FT Units (the \"FT Units\") at a price of $0.04 per FT Unitfor gross proceeds of $458,000 (the \"First Tranche\").</p><p>Each FT Unit issued in the First Tranche is comprised of one flow-through common share (the \"FT Share\") plus one-half (1/2) non-transferable non-flow-through share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a \"NFT Warrant\"). Each NFT Warrant is exercisable to purchase one additional non-flow-through common share of the Company (the \"NFT Warrant Share\") at $0.06 for a period of two years expiring on October 15, 2027.</p><p>The FT Shares will qualify as \"flow-through shares\" (within the meaning of subsection 66(15) of theIncome Tax Act(Canada) (the \"Tax Act\"). The gross proceeds raised from the issuance of the FT Shares will be used by the Company to incur \"Canadian exploration expenses\" (within the meaning of the Tax Act).</p><p>In connection with the First Tranche, the Company paid cash finder's fees of $14,000 and issued 350,000 finder's warrants (the \"Finder's Warrant\") with respect to the sale of FT Units to an arm's length subscriber. Each Finder's Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one additional common share of the Company at $0.05 for a period of two years expiring on October 15, 2027.</p><p>The securities issued pursuant to the First Tranche and Finder's Warrants are subject to a four-month and one day hold period expiring on February 16, 2026.</p><p>Footnote #1: 2023 Geochemical Assessment Report Duncan Lake Project.

The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has responded and additional crews were set to join them on Aug. 10. According to information on the Ontario Forest Fire Info Map [<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov.on.ca/ForestFireInformationMap/index.html?viewer=FFIM.FFIM\">www.lioapplications.lrc.gov.on.ca/ForestFireInformationMap/index.html?viewer=FFIM.FFIM</url>], the fire, designated HAL108: New, is 11 hectares in size, is in Haliburton district, is not yet under control and was started on Aug. 9 at 11:42 a.m. Due to the hot, dry conditions, Marmora and Lake have had a total fire ban in place since Aug. 7, and there has been a total fire ban implemented in all of North Hastings since Aug. 6.</p><p>Surrounding municipalities Limerick, Wollaston and Tudor and Cashel had notices on this wildfire on their township websites over the weekend, cautioning people that if they see water bombers in the area, to move off the lake they\u2019re on within their respective municipality and out of their way so the water bombers can collect water to fight this wildfire in the northern part of Marmora and Lake, which has the potential to spread into their townships if it\u2019s not brought under control. They also cautioned people not to use drones in the area of a wildfire as they could potentially force emergency response teams to ground water bombers, putting lives at risk. As per Ministry guidelines, drones must be kept 9 kilometres away from a forest fire.\u00a0</p><p>Eva Lizotte is a fire information officer with the MNRF and provided the following statement to The Bancroft Times on Aug. 10;</p><p>\u201cHaliburton 18 (HAL018) is 11 hectares in size and is located approximately half a kilometre southeast of Copeway Lake, and 1.7 kilometres north of Bluff Lake. The fire is not under control. There are multiple crews currently assigned to this fire, with suppression tactics being assigned and additional resources mobilized as needed. Air attack operations were conducted yesterday afternoon and will continue where these efforts are most effective. The fire is located approximately 28 kilometres north of Marmora,\u201d he says.\u00a0</p><p>John Connolly is the CAO/Deputy Clerk with Marmora and Lake and told The Bancroft Times on Aug. 10 that they are getting periodic updates from the MNRF as the situation unfolds.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt is my understanding that this is a wildland fire that is on crown land near Burnt Lake and as of the last update earlier this morning it was 11 hectares in size and that they were assessing whether to bring in air support today. I expect another update from MNRF to my chief and deputy chief who will in turn then update myself and the mayor. I will provide that information as we know it. I have been in constant contact and discussion with my chief and the mayor already on this and especially first thing this morning. You will see that we have provided some updates on our firefighters\u2019 social media [<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Facebook.com\">www.Facebook.com</url>, under \u201cMarmora and Lake Fire and Emergency Services\u201d]. Limerick Township provides fire fighting for Marmora and Lake in the north of the municipality under a mutual aid agreement and they have also been posting updates,\u201d he says.\u00a0</p><p>Connolly provided an update several hours later on Aug. 10 confirming that the fire was moving in a northeast direction from their most recent update from the MNRF.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cApparently, they have two crews on the ground and are adding another two crews later today \u2013 already likely on the ground now. The MNRF has advised us that they will keep us updated as events progress. \u00a0We have updated the Marmora &amp; Lake Fire and Emergency Services social media and we will also be updating the municipal website and social media channels shortly. I have also been in contact with the CAO for Hastings County, Connor Dorey, who has also indicated his support should we need it,\u201d he says.\u00a0</p><p>By 7 p.m. on Aug. 10 the following update was provided on the Marmora and Lake Fire and Emergency Services Facebook page;</p><p>\"Marmora and Lake staff remain in regular contact with MNRF officials, who continue to provide updates on the HAL018 wildfire. As of the time of this post, the MNR has confirmed that there are three MNRF crews fighting the fire on the ground who are also being supported through the use of their water bombers to help manage the fire. While we the municipality has offered assistance and support, we have been advised that is not necessary at this point in time, as the fire does not appear to have grown in size.\u00a0</p><p>It remains vital that the public allow professional fire and emergency services personnel to do their jobs. Please keep in mind our previous update to give aircraft room to operate safely and not operate drones in any area, that may present a hazard to aircraft and aircraft safety. We need to keep them safe so that they can keep us safe! We will continue to monitor the situation and share updates as we receive them. The Municipality of Marmora and Lake extends its gratitude for the incredible job that the MNR crews are doing to protect our community.\"</p><p>This is a developing story and The Bancroft Times will bring you updates on this wildfire from Marmora and Lake, and from the surrounding municipalities of Wollaston, Limerick and Tudor and Cashel as they become available in the days ahead.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-ee9201cfc8f84210bfc0720ad5f0f04e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHR-3BS3-RRWV-K17K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><timeReceived>01:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 17, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(\"Rokmaster\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to provide an update for the Duncan Lake and Big Copper Projects.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both the Duncan Lake Project and Big Copper Project are located in southeastern British Columbia and have been steadily advanced by Rokmaster since 2018. Both Projects feature road access in favourable regions with the Trail Smelter within 170 km of the Duncan Lake Project and with the mining town of Kimberley, BC around the Sullivan Deposit within 50 km of the Big Copper Project (Figure 1).</p><p>A five-year Multi-year Area Based Exploration Permit (\"MYAB Permit\") was recently approved on the Duncan Lake Project by the British Columbia Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals (Figure 2). The MYAB Permit allows for up to 21 drill sites north of the historic Duncan Mine, which was developed by Cominco 1957-1960. Cominco identified eight mineralized zones but never produced ore from the mine. Between 1989 and 1997, Cominco and Teck Resources completed 12 diamond drillholes approximately 2,000 metres north of the Duncan Mine which intersected strong lead-zinc mineralization in the east limb of the north plunging Duncan Anticline. Rokmaster completed a small drill program in 2022 by re-entering one of these historic drillholes, which are all now on Rokmaster claims, and successfully intersected the west limb of the Duncan Anticline and cored a wide interval of Zn-Pb-Ag mineralization in the east limb (see news release dated May 17, 2022).</p><p>There is also a five year MYAB Permit covering the southern No.3, No.2, and No.1 Zones previously approved on the Duncan Lake Project. These zones were partially defined in the 1960's by Cominco who completed small trenching programs on surface exposures of massive sphalerite-galena mineralization in the east limb of the Duncan Anticline. This MYAB Permit allows for 26 drillsites and 15 trenches and while it expired in August 2025, an application to extend the end date on the permit due to a large forest fire which burned the region in 2024. The fire extensively burned throughout the No.2 Zone, No.1 Zone, and the Mag Zone with good potential for new outcrop exposure. The application to extend the permit was submitted in April 2025 and is currently in the consultation stage since June 2025.</p><p>Field work on the Duncan Lake Project in 2025 included trenching at the No.3 Zone and further prospecting and sampling in the Mag Zone (Figure 3). This work followed 2023 sampling which collected 127 soil samples and 22 rock samples1. Three of the trenches completed at the No.3 Zone returned high lead and zinc results with appreciable silver grades over meter-scale widths with channel sampling. An outcrop exposure at the No.1 Zone, approximately 3.1 km south of the No.3 Zone, was also channel sampled returning 14.64% combined lead and zinc with 6.67 g/t Ag over 4.5 m (Table 1). More advanced geochemical analysis is ongoing to assess the germanium, gallium, and indium concentrations in the mineralization.</p><p>Table 1 : Duncan Lake Project Trench Sample Assay Results No. 3 and No.1 Zones //st Sample ID Easting Northing Sample Type Zn % Pb % Ag g/t Length 1,2,3,4 (m) T2501-02 505480 5574050 Channel 3.78 1.47 2.00 1.0 T2501-03 505481 5574051 Channel 14.60 8.34 8.00 1.0 T2501-04 505482 5574051 Channel 3.17 2.42 3.00 1.0 Trench 25-01 Weighted Average 7.18 4.08 4.33 3.0 T2502-05 505457 5574132 Channel 4.50 0.81 4.00 1.0 T2502-06 505458 5574132 Channel 4.95 2.63 4.00 1.0 T2502-07 505459 5574132 Channel 9.74 7.53 6.00 1.5 Trench 25-02 Weighted Average 6.87 4.21 4.86 3.5 T2505-04 505600 5573688 Channel 4.70 0.92 1.00 1.0 T2505-05 505601 5573689 Channel 3.77 4.84 3.00 1.0 T2505-06 505602 5573690 Channel 3.41 1.75 1.00 1.5 Trench 25-05 Weighted Average 3.88 2.40 1.57 3.5 T2506-01 506603 5571182 Channel 27.54 7.71 12.00 0.5 T2506-02 506603 5571182 Channel 17.20 4.23 7.00 1.0 T2506-03 506602 5571182 Channel 10.04 1.97 10.00 1.0 T2506-04 506601 5571182 Channel 7.13 0.61 4.00 1.0 T2506-05 506600 5571182 Channel 6.29 0.76 3.00 1.0 No.1 Zone Outcrop Weighted Average 12.10 2.54 6.67 4.5</p><p>Notes to Table 1:</p><p>1.

After preparation, samples were analyzed for 30 elements including Zn, Pb and Ag by 4-acid digestion of a 0.2 g subsample with ICP-ES finish (MSALAB ore-grade method ICP-240).</p><p>A five year MYAB Permit was recently approved on the Big Copper Project by the British Columbia Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals (Figure 4). The MYAB Permit allows for 20 helicopter-supported drillsites and 4 helicopter pads. A field work program was completed on the Big Copper Project in 2023 which collected 165 soil samples and 11 rock samples, highlighting anomalous silver values in the southern portion of the Property2. The Big Copper Property hosts a mineralized deformation and alteration front approximately 4.5 km in strike defined by at least three adits, outcrops, seven trenches and several drillholes which support strong copper-silver mineralization. Mineralized zones are hosted within fine-grained siltstones, argillites and dirty quartzites of the Creston formation. The Creston formation is correlative with the Revett Formation which hosts several large sedimentary hosted copper-silver deposits and undeveloped occurrences in northern Montana and Idaho, including the Spar Lake, Montanore and Rock Creek deposits.</p><p>John Mirko, President and CEO, comments:</p><p>\"Having these exploration drill permits in hand provides Rokmaster the flexibility to get right to work on these fantastic projects. We have held and advanced the Duncan Lake and Big Copper Projects for many years and believe in the high potential for exploration success on both. Zinc and copper are critical elements which are very important in the current environment, and both projects have an ideal address for a discovery to be made and developed. The elevated silver concentrations on both projects, particularly on the Duncan Lake Project where the strength and significance of silver may not have been fully recognized, is what we're excited to test in addition to the increasingly critical elements.\"</p><p>Financing Update</p><p>The Company is also pleased to announce that further to its news release on October 7, 2025 that it has closed the first tranche of the flow-through funding (the \"FT Financing\") with the issuance of 11,450,000 FT Units (the \"FT Units\") at a price of $0.04 per FT Unitfor gross proceeds of $458,000 (the \"First Tranche\").</p><p>Each FT Unit issued in the First Tranche is comprised of one flow-through common share (the \"FT Share\") plus one-half (1/2) non-transferable non-flow-through share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a \"NFT Warrant\"). Each NFT Warrant is exercisable to purchase one additional non-flow-through common share of the Company (the \"NFT Warrant Share\") at $0.06 for a period of two years expiring on October 15, 2027.</p><p>The FT Shares will qualify as \"flow-through shares\" (within the meaning of subsection 66(15) of theIncome Tax Act(Canada) (the \"Tax Act\"). The gross proceeds raised from the issuance of the FT Shares will be used by the Company to incur \"Canadian exploration expenses\" (within the meaning of the Tax Act).</p><p>In connection with the First Tranche, the Company paid cash finder's fees of $14,000 and issued 350,000 finder's warrants (the \"Finder's Warrant\") with respect to the sale of FT Units to an arm's length subscriber. Each Finder's Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one additional common share of the Company at $0.05 for a period of two years expiring on October 15, 2027.</p><p>The securities issued pursuant to the First Tranche and Finder's Warrants are subject to a four-month and one day hold period expiring on February 16, 2026.</p><p>Footnote #1: 2023 Geochemical Assessment Report Duncan Lake Project.

The latest figures posted by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre suggest the fires have torn through 72,000 square kilometres, an area roughly the size of New Brunswick. That surpasses the next worst season in 1989 and is about half the area burned during the record-setting 2023 season, according to a federal database of wildfire seasons dating back to 1972. Climate change, driven by fossil fuel burning, has made Canada's fire season longer and more intense, scientists say. The last three fire seasons are among the 10 worst on record. This season has displaced thousands of people and stifled communities across Canada with smoke. Manitoba and Saskatchewan account for more than half the area burned so far, but British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario are all also well above 25-year averages.</p><p>Eastern Canada</p><p>Fines for violating fire bans soar </p><p>As some of eastern Newfoundland's tinder-dry forests continued to burn out of control on Friday, the provincial government exponentially increased its fines for those caught lighting illegal fires. A visibly angry Premier John Hogan said the fine for a first offence would rise from $75 to $50,000, with potential imprisonment of up to six months for those failing to pay the penalty. \"Despite the serious nature of what's happening, we are continuing to see reports of people setting fires and, in some cases, setting fires intentionally,\" Hogan said. \"It's very clear from the size of the (fine) increase ... that we mean business.\" The fine for a second offence has jumped from $150 to $75,000. And a third violation will cost offenders a whopping $150,000, with up to one year in jail if not paid.</p><p>Wire services </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2025080976288537</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GFT-FWN3-RTXC-X212-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"296\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

The latest figures posted by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre suggest the fires have torn through 72,000 square kilometres, an area roughly the size of New Brunswick. That surpasses the next worst season in 1989 and is about half the area burned during the record-setting 2023 season, according to a federal database of wildfire seasons dating back to 1972. Climate change, driven by fossil fuel burning, has made Canada's fire season longer and more intense, scientists say. The last three fire seasons are among the 10 worst on record. This season has displaced thousands of people and stifled communities across Canada with smoke. Manitoba and Saskatchewan account for more than half the area burned so far, but British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario are all also well above 25-year averages.</p><p>Eastern Canada</p><p>Fines for violating fire bans soar </p><p>As some of eastern Newfoundland's tinder-dry forests continued to burn out of control on Friday, the provincial government exponentially increased its fines for those caught lighting illegal fires. A visibly angry Premier John Hogan said the fine for a first offence would rise from $75 to $50,000, with potential imprisonment of up to six months for those failing to pay the penalty. \"Despite the serious nature of what's happening, we are continuing to see reports of people setting fires and, in some cases, setting fires intentionally,\" Hogan said. \"It's very clear from the size of the (fine) increase ... that we mean business.\" The fine for a second offence has jumped from $150 to $75,000. And a third violation will cost offenders a whopping $150,000, with up to one year in jail if not paid.</p><p>Wire services </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2025080976288425</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GFT-FWN3-RTXC-X28H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"296\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

The cost of aircrafts are going up. The cost of vehicles is going up. Fire retardant, which we used over a million litres of, has almost doubled in price in the past several years. Food for catering, for feeding all these crews. Obviously, the cost of food has gone up,\" director of Yukon Wildland Fire Management Devin Bailey said at the mid-season briefing.</p><p>\"As everything gets more expensive, we're going to see more expensive responses during fire season.\"</p><p>Bailey expressed confidence in the Yukon government's ongoing support to protect communities from wildfire dangers.</p><p>\"Yukon government will always ensure that wildland fire management has the funding it needs to ensure that Yukoners are safe,\" he said.</p><p>As the nation faces a wildland firefighter shortage, Bailey said the Yukon has brought in more help from outside the territory than ever before. That includes 192 firefighters and support staff from Canada and the United States through the Northwest Fire Fighting Compact, Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre and contract hires.</p><p>The Northwest Fire Fighting Compact is one of eight compacts of its kind across North America that involves the western provinces and northwestern territories as well as Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre is a federally incorporated non-profit corporation that is run by federal, provincial and territorial wildland fire management agencies across Canada.</p><p>Fifty export firefighters were sent from the Yukon to Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan, as well as across the border to Alaska and Oregon this season.</p><p>For the first time, a drone specialist was brought in, which proved to be beneficial, per Bailey.</p><p>With 93 active wildfires, close to 122,500 hectares burned and 38 fires put out, as of the evening of July 30, officials said it has been a busy season, mostly around Dawson City, Mayo and most recently Beaver Creek. Parts of those communities were put under evacuation alert for periods of time. Residents and visitors have seen highway closures and travel advisories in those regions, as well as the Alaska Highway south of the Yukon-B.C. border, particularly around Fort Nelson.</p><p>\"A lot of folks in Dawson were waking up in the morning to a really smoky sky and watching those fires sometimes from their backyard,\" fire information officer Haley Ritchie said at the briefing.</p><p>Ritchie noted some crew members worked back-to-back shifts on the fire line with a mandatory rest period.</p><p>She noted that in the bigger picture, most of the territory has seen enough rain lately to knock down fire danger levels to low to moderate.</p><p>While the Yukon's capital might feel like it has seen a lull, officials told reporters the territory isn't out of the woods yet. Although most fires have started by lightning, they said to stay vigilant when it comes to having and putting out fires and other potentially fire-starting activities.</p><p>Four fires of note are still burning as cooler temperatures and humidity have help decreased fire activity in the central region, according to Bailey.</p><p>\"The fires are digging in deep in certain areas where the drought codes are high and there's still lots of work to do out there,\" Bailey said.</p><p>\"We are thinking not only about the well-being of Yukon communities, but also the safety of all of our emergency responders.\"</p><p>Officials were unable to put a number on the anticipated cost for the season; however, it will likely increase from the $23 million spent over the 2024 fire season. In past years, spending has hovered around $15 million to $40 million, per Bailey.</p><p>Contact Dana Hatherly at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dana.hatherly@yukon-news.com\">dana.hatherly@yukon-news.com</email></p><p>Copyright 2025 Yukon News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20250731IYN4749304</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCY-J4K3-RXT0-70K9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"668\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

The moment revives a familiar dynamic in a the Republican Party that is united in opposing the Affordable Care Act but still without a clear plan to replace it. The lack of a plan to address to rising costs risks political backlash for Republicans in next year\u2019s midterms. Democrats have said tax credits that kept the costs lower should be extended and refused to reopen the government until they are.</p><p>WORDS: 1246 - MOVED: 10/27/2025 11:07 a.m. EDT</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:e94d96a8a837a5f7f681dc6893872d3b&amp;mediaType=text\">https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:e94d96a8a837a5f7f681dc6893872d3b&amp;mediaType=text</url></p><p>___</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>INTERNATIONAL</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>CB--TROPICAL WEATHER</p><p>Melissa intensifies to Category 5 on path to slam into Jamaica as island\u2019s strongest recorded storm</p><p>SUMMARY: Hurricane Melissa has strengthened into a Category 5 storm as it draws closer to Jamaica, where forecasters say it will unleash catastrophic flooding, landslides and widespread damage. The intensification happened Monday. The system would be the strongest hurricane to hit the island since record-keeping began in 1851. Melissa has been blamed for six deaths in the northern Caribbean as it heads toward the island. It was on track to make landfall Tuesday in Jamaica before coming ashore in Cuba later in the day and then heading toward the Bahamas. It was not expected to affect the United States.</p><p>WORDS: 996 - MOVED: 10/27/2025 11:27 a.m. EDT</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:c33102eb52bc8dfec08bdcd20968ca1d&amp;mediaType=text\">https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:c33102eb52bc8dfec08bdcd20968ca1d&amp;mediaType=text</url></p><p>___</p><p>LT--ARGENTINA-MIDTERMS</p><p>Milei triumphs in Argentine midterm elections closely watched by Washington</p><p>SUMMARY: Argentina\u2019s libertarian President Javier Milei has won decisive victories in key districts across the country in midterm elections. He clinched a crucial vote of confidence that strengthens his ability to carry out his radical free-market experiment with billions of dollars in backing from the Trump administration. Milei\u2019s governing party won over 40% of votes Sunday to renew almost half of the lower house of Congress, according to media tallies using numbers from electoral authorities. La Libertad Avanza also swept six of the eight provinces in the vote to renew a third of the Senate.

Clashes with security forces ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement left at least four protesters dead as opposition supporters rallied to demand credible results. Biya is 92 and has led the central African nation since 1982. The Constitutional Council said he received over 53% of votes on Oct. 12 while former ally Issa Tchiroma Bakary got over 35%.

She\u2019s a protege of late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whom Trump bonded with over their shared love of golf. It\u2019s a critical meeting for Takaichi, who wants to calm trade tensions. Trump has long complained American cars were shut out of Japanese markets. So Japan\u2019s government has floated the idea of buying a fleet of Ford F-150 trucks to use to inspect roads and infrastructure. Some worry the trucks could clog narrow Japanese streets.

The unhealthy condition of the school house during the hot weather has also been called to attention, and will no doubt be at once remedied. There is every reason to believe that the Dominion Government will next year, if not before, erect a brick building that will contain all the Dominion Government offices now established here. A superintendent has been appointed for the telegraph line from Ashcroft to Atlin. He will probably have his headquarters here. In a few days another operator will be employed in the telegraph office, and it will not be long before night operators will be on duty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">C.P.R.: The C.P.R. local passenger train is very convenient for the public travelling to and from Ashcroft.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good Crop: Jacob Mundorf, of the 20 Mile House, was in town Thursday. He reports his hay crop the largest he has ever had, and expects to put up about 150 tons.</p><p>Good Fishing: Trout fishing on the Thompson is very good. Dr. Clarke, the most enthusiastic fisherman in Ashcroft, caught a splendid string of heavy ones Thursday evening.</p><p>Kindergarten: No better training can be given a child that is too young for school than to attend a kindergarten school. Ashcroft is fortunate in having a kindergarten. It is conducted by Miss Sweet.</p><p>Barkerville: Mr. S.A. Rogers is building a new hotel for the accommodation of the travelling public. His hotel is a popular one in Barkerville, and the improvements now going on will make it still more so. There is no place in the province, taking the cost of supplies into consideration (it costing six cents per pound from Ashcroft, the nearest railway station), where board is as good as the quality furnished by the Barkerville hotels for the prices charged.</p><p>100 YEARS AGO: JULY 25, 1925</p><p>News Notes From Savona; People Of Lake City Hold Whist Drive In Aid Of School: A whist drive and dance in aid of the school was held on Saturday in the town hall, kindly given for the occasion by Mr. J.M. Christian. The whist drive, which commenced at 8 o'clock, was well attended, 12 tables being filled. Dancing commenced at 11, with 35 couples on the floor, and was kept up to an early hour. Five loaded cars came from Walhachin and two from Kamloops. The event was a great success, and the sum of $60 was raised for the school, part of this sum being contributed by the sale of cakes, Mr. T. Shaw making the most able auctioneer. We hope it will not be too long before the next one.</p><p>Walhachin News: Mrs. Thompson gave a children's party in her garden last Friday to about 35 children. Judging by the noise the party was a great success.</p><p>Visitors: Mr. Mott and Mr. Brown of the Empire Mine, Highland Valley were in town on Thursday for some supplies. They have substituted a new Ford for the old wagon, and may be in town more often in the future.</p><p>Weather: The welcome rain of Wednesday night was worth a thousand dollars a minute to the farmers in the vicinity. It was a break in a long and almost unprecedented hot and dry spell. The boys on the roof of the C.P.R. station finished their shingling just in time to escape the rain.</p><p>75 YEARS AGO: JULY 27, 1950</p><p>Lillooet: The weekend was a busy time for volunteer firemen and Forestry Service patrolmen when they fought one of the most threatening forest fires at Lillooet in its history. The fire, which is believed to have been started by berry pickers, came within yards of the town on the down hill run, when as luck would have it the wind changed and turned the fire away. Ninety men from all over the district, including Ashcroft and Clinton, were fighting the fire, which by Monday had covered an area of over 800 acres. The fire was spreading over to Dickey Creek and toward Moha. A strong wind was blowing, which fanned the fire on to destruction on Tuesday. However, they have managed to get a jeep up the creek and saved part of the watershed.</p><p>Quick Response: Dawson Wade are proud of the speed with which their men can jump to it in an emergency. Seven minutes after they received a call for help to fight the Lillooet fire, 10 of their men had gathered up their blankets and were in the car and had stepped on the gas.</p><p>Fire East Of Gladwin: Fire broke out in a thicket of pine trees between the highway and the CPR tracks a mile or so east of Gladwin on Wednesday afternoon a few minutes after a freight train had passed through. It spread rapidly among the trees until Art Kent got on the job with his fire hose and brought it under control. Vic Minnabarriet from Spences Bridge and several men worked through the night shovelling earth on the flames.</p><p>Commissioners Get New Office: The first sod was turned on Lytton's Village office by Isaac Oates. The building will be of Pan Abode cedar logs, the second commercial building of this type in Lytton. The building will measure 14 feet wide by 20 feet long, and is located on Crown land facing Fraser Avenue between the Chong and Gillis properties. The foundation will be of cement and the structure is expected to be completed within two weeks.</p><p>Savona: There are many tourists enjoying the hospitality of the three auto courts and the refreshing swimming in Kamloops Lake.</p><p>Weather: Some thermometers reached 102 in Ashcroft this week. Wednesday the weather cooled off to around 90, and is continuing cooler.</p><p>50 YEARS AGO: JULY 23, 1975</p><p>More Water Soon For Cache Creek: Work is going ahead steadily on the new water reservoir for Cache Creek. Water for human consumption and irrigation has always been a problem in dry belt towns in the summer months. There never seems to be an adequate supply. Cache Creek's population quadruples overnight once the holiday season begins. Motels are usually taxed to capacity, especially on the weekends. Water consumption is at a premium with showers, sprinklers, etc. running full pelt. An adequate and clean water supply is the first requisite of any interior town. Without it, any plans for future expansion are hopeless.</p><p>How Green Flows Our Thompson: Have you noticed our river lately? It's gradually getting back to its beautiful green colour, like old times again. Makes you want to try the fishing. It's an ill wind that blows no one good. Let's hope that pulp mill [in Kamloops] stays closed!</p><p>Journal Gremlins: Last week the Journal had its share of troubles. Firstly one of the staff was home all week with the flu. Secondly, our Compuwriter was kaflooee. This machine sets the news for the paper. So we resorted back to the typewriter. It too went on the fritz for a time. As for the Compuwriter, we have to phone Washington, U.S.A. for repair information. After three long distance calls, we failed to get the machine operating. A repairman was supposed to arrive on Friday, but didn't show up. Sunday morning around 10:30 the editor had a phone call from B.F. Brown that the Journal was broken into during the wee hours. Sure enough, when he arrived at the Journal, there was the R.C.M.P. and Mr. Brown, Dick Blacklock, and the Hellands standing around. The hasp had been forced from the door frame and the glass window on the door had been scored, once on the inner edge of the door frame and heavier scoring closer to the centre of the door. After a few questions and a quick check there seemed to be nothing missing. What gets us is why break in and take nothing and not do any damage.

The CBC's Tricia Kindleman has more.</p><p><br/><br/>TRICIA KINDLEMAN (REPORTER):<br/>The Wesley Ridge wildfire is forcing an evacuation of about 400 properties and a provincial park on the east coast of Vancouver Island due to a wildfire burning out of control. Another 238 properties are under evacuation alert, meaning residents need to be ready to flee at a moment's notice.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER 1:<br/>I think this is bigger than the one I had a couple of years ago. That's a big fire..<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER 2:<br/>On that one for sure. This one is threatening our community a lot more. Then the other one being across the lake.<br/><br/>TRICIA KINDLEMAN (REPORTER):<br/>Officials said they had no reports of homes lost to the blaze on Saturday. BC Wildfire service, though, said some firefighting equipment and railway trestles were lost. Workers and staff were safely withdrawn. In all five, evacuation orders are in place around BC, including around Lytton, which suffered a devastating wildfire in 2021. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center says national availability of resources is limited, and international resources are being mobilized. And there are special air quality warnings and statements across Canada, with smoke from forest fires causing reduced visibility and poor air quality according to Environment Canada. The statements cover the country stretching from eastern British Columbia into western Quebec, varying in severity. Some of that smoke is also travelling south, prompting air quality concerns in some states as well.

They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.</p><p>But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change - a glaring and short-sighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.</p><p>\"If anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\" said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international co-operation is needed.</p><p>\"There's no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\" Hogan said. \"But I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\"</p><p>The country has \"been fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\" when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs.</p><p> This year's first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.</p><p>Late last week, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 72,520 square kilometre burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year.

They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.</p><p>But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change - a glaring and short-sighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to  heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.</p><p>\"If anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\" said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Mass.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international co-operation is needed.</p><p>\"There's no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\" Hogan said. \"But I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\"</p><p>The country has \"been fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\" when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs.</p><p> This year's first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.</p><p>Late last week, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 72,520 square kilometres burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.</p><p>McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data shows that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up, and water that once lapped at people's back doors in Canada's lake communities  is now often hundreds of feet away.</p><p>\"People can make up their own mind as to why that is,\" he said. \"But something clearly has changed.\"</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax - a belief echoed by many in the GOP - and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little to no pushback from Republicans in Congress.</p><p>He's proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare - the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He's declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, cancelled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 1.5 C  above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>The Associated Press reached out to more than half a dozen Republicans who criticized Canada, but none returned phone calls or emails.</p><p>Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine said the wildfires are jeopardizing health and air quality in her state, too, but faulted Republicans for failing to meet the crisis head-on - beginning by acknowledging climate change.</p><p>\"Rather than accept this reality and work together to find proactive, common-sense solutions for preventing and mitigating these fires, Republicans are burying their heads in the sand,\" she said.</p><p>Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat, criticized her Republican colleagues' letter to Canada's U.S. ambassador, saying those \"who are in denial about climate change shouldn't be writing letters prescribing people's actions to try to contain it.\"</p><p>McMullen, the Canadian wildfire expert, said battling the fires isn't as simple as many seem to believe.</p><p>The country and its territories are vast and fires are often in remote areas where the best - and sometimes only - course of action, if there are no residents or structures, is to let them burn or \"it is going to just create another situation for us to deal with in a year or two or 10 or 20 years from now,\" McMullen said.</p><p>Prescribed burns to clear underbrush and other ignition sources are used in some areas, but aren't practical or possible in some forests and prairies that are burning, experts said.</p><p>McMullen has advocated for a Canadian forest fire co-ordination agency to help deploy firefighters and equipment where they're needed.</p><p>But as for stopping worsening fires, \"I don't think there's much they can do,\" said University of Michigan climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck.

They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.</p><p>But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change - a glaring and short-sighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to  heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.</p><p>\"If anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\" said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Mass.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international co-operation is needed.</p><p>\"There's no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\" Hogan said. \"But I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\"</p><p>The country has \"been fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\" when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs.</p><p> This year's first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.</p><p>Late last week, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 72,520 square kilometres burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.</p><p>McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data shows that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up, and water that once lapped at people's back doors in  Canada's lake communities  is now often hundreds of feet away.</p><p>\"People can make up their own mind as to why that is,\" he said. \"But something clearly has changed.\"</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax - a belief echoed by many in the GOP - and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little to no pushback from Republicans in Congress.</p><p>He's proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare - the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He's declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, cancelled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 1.5 C  above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>The Associated Press reached out to more than half a dozen Republicans who criticized Canada, but none returned phone calls or emails.</p><p>Democratic Rep. Chellie  Pingree of Maine said the wildfires are jeopardizing health and air quality in her state, too, but faulted Republicans for failing to meet the crisis head-on - beginning by acknowledging climate change.</p><p>\"Rather than accept this reality and work together to find proactive, common-sense solutions for preventing and mitigating these fires, Republicans are burying their heads in the sand,\" she said.</p><p>Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat, criticized her Republican colleagues' letter to Canada's U.S. ambassador, saying those \"who are in denial about climate change shouldn't be writing letters prescribing people's actions to try to contain it.\"</p><p>McMullen, the Canadian wildfire expert, said battling the fires isn't as simple as many seem to believe.</p><p>The country and its territories are vast and fires are often in remote areas where the best - and sometimes only - course of action, if there are no residents or structures, is to let them burn or \"it is going to just create another situation for us to deal with in a year or two or 10 or 20 years from now,\" McMullen said.</p><p>Prescribed burns to clear underbrush and other ignition sources are used in some areas, but aren't practical or possible in some forests and prairies that are burning, experts said.</p><p>McMullen has advocated for a Canadian forest fire co-ordination agency to help deploy firefighters and equipment where they're needed.</p><p>But as for stopping worsening fires, \"I don't think there's much they can do,\" said University of Michigan climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck. He noted that hotter temperatures are melting permafrost in northern Canada, which dries out and makes the vast boreal forests far more likely to burn.</p><p>Instead, the two countries should collaborate on climate change solutions \"because our smoke is their smoke, their smoke is ours,\" Overpeck said. \"As long as this trend of warming and drying continues, we're going to get a worsening problem.</p><p>\"The good news is ... we know what the cause is ... We can stop it from getting worse.\"</p><p>The Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2025081876355472</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHR-6563-S6K5-H4NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1007\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.</p><p>But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change - a glaring and short-sighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to  heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.</p><p>\"If anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\" said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Mass.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international co-operation is needed.</p><p>\"There's no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\" Hogan said. \"But I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\"</p><p>The country has \"been fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\" when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs.</p><p> This year's first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.</p><p>Late last week, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 72,520 square kilometres burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.</p><p>McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data shows that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up, and water that once lapped at people's back doors in Canada's lake communities  is now often hundreds of feet away.</p><p>\"People can make up their own mind as to why that is,\" he said. \"But something clearly has changed.\"</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax - a belief echoed by many in the GOP - and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little to no pushback from Republicans in Congress.</p><p>He's proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare - the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He's declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, cancelled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 1.5 C  above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>The Associated Press reached out to more than half a dozen Republicans who criticized Canada, but none returned phone calls or emails.</p><p>Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine said the wildfires are jeopardizing health and air quality in her state, too, but faulted Republicans for failing to meet the crisis head-on - beginning by acknowledging climate change.</p><p>\"Rather than accept this reality and work together to find proactive, common-sense solutions for preventing and mitigating these fires, Republicans are burying their heads in the sand,\" she said.</p><p>Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat, criticized her Republican colleagues' letter to Canada's U.S. ambassador, saying those \"who are in denial about climate change shouldn't be writing letters prescribing people's actions to try to contain it.\"</p><p>McMullen, the Canadian wildfire expert, said battling the fires isn't as simple as many seem to believe.</p><p>The country and its territories are vast and fires are often in remote areas where the best - and sometimes only - course of action, if there are no residents or structures, is to let them burn or \"it is going to just create another situation for us to deal with in a year or two or 10 or 20 years from now,\" McMullen said.</p><p>Prescribed burns to clear underbrush and other ignition sources are used in some areas, but aren't practical or possible in some forests and prairies that are burning, experts said.</p><p>McMullen has advocated for a Canadian forest fire co-ordination agency to help deploy firefighters and equipment where they're needed.</p><p>But as for stopping worsening fires, \"I don't think there's much they can do,\" said University of Michigan climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck. He noted that hotter temperatures are melting permafrost in northern Canada, which dries out and makes the vast boreal forests far more likely to burn.</p><p>Instead, the two countries should collaborate on climate change solutions \"because our smoke is their smoke, their smoke is ours,\" Overpeck said. \"As long as this trend of warming and drying continues, we're going to get a worsening problem.</p><p>\"The good news is ... we know what the cause is ... We can stop it from getting worse.\"</p><p>The Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2025081876354740</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHR-6563-S6K5-H4MF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1006\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.</p><p>But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change - a glaring and short-sighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to  heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.</p><p>\"If anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\" said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Mass.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international co-operation is needed.</p><p>\"There's no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\" Hogan said. \"But I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\"</p><p>The country has \"been fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\" when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs.</p><p> This year's first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.</p><p>Late last week, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 72,520 square kilometres burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.</p><p>McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data shows that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up, and water that once lapped at people's back doors in Canada's lake communities  is now often hundreds of feet away.</p><p>\"People can make up their own mind as to why that is,\" he said. \"But something clearly has changed.\"</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax - a belief echoed by many in the GOP - and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little to no pushback from Republicans in Congress.</p><p>He's proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare - the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He's declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, cancelled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 1.5 C  above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>The Associated Press reached out to more than half a dozen Republicans who criticized Canada, but none returned phone calls or emails.</p><p>Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine said the wildfires are jeopardizing health and air quality in her state, too, but faulted Republicans for failing to meet the crisis head-on - beginning by acknowledging climate change.</p><p>\"Rather than accept this reality and work together to find proactive, common-sense solutions for preventing and mitigating these fires, Republicans are burying their heads in the sand,\" she said.</p><p>Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat, criticized her Republican colleagues' letter to Canada's U.S. ambassador, saying those \"who are in denial about climate change shouldn't be writing letters prescribing people's actions to try to contain it.\"</p><p>McMullen, the Canadian wildfire expert, said battling the fires isn't as simple as many seem to believe.</p><p>The country and its territories are vast and fires are often in remote areas where the best - and sometimes only - course of action, if there are no residents or structures, is to let them burn or \"it is going to just create another situation for us to deal with in a year or two or 10 or 20 years from now,\" McMullen said.</p><p>Prescribed burns to clear underbrush and other ignition sources are used in some areas, but aren't practical or possible in some forests and prairies that are burning, experts said.</p><p>McMullen has advocated for a Canadian forest fire co-ordination agency to help deploy firefighters and equipment where they're needed.</p><p>But as for stopping worsening fires, \"I don't think there's much they can do,\" said University of Michigan climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck. He noted that hotter temperatures are melting permafrost in northern Canada, which dries out and makes the vast boreal forests far more likely to burn.</p><p>Instead, the two countries should collaborate on climate change solutions \"because our smoke is their smoke, their smoke is ours,\" Overpeck said. \"As long as this trend of warming and drying continues, we're going to get a worsening problem.</p><p>\"The good news is ... we know what the cause is ... We can stop it from getting worse.\"</p><p>The Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WELTRI-2025081876354975</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WELTRI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHR-6563-S6K5-H4WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433814</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1006\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Welland Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Welland Tribune (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 18, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

Along the route, children will stop at interactive stations, hear presentations from FireSmart representatives, and collect items to build their own \u201cto-go bags\u201d \u2013 emergency kits containing essentials such as identification, medication, food, water and phone chargers, designed to last at least 72 hours during an evacuation.</p><p>The afternoon session is already full, and only a few spots remain for the morning. Signs will be posted to guide participants along the trail.</p><p>Callahan noted the Northwest Fire Centre does not have the same reputation for catastrophic wildfires as other B.C. regions, but that the area is still vulnerable. Large fires occur roughly once every 200 years.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re right there. We\u2019re due. A lot of people are realizing that with our forests.</p><p>They\u2019re seeing the climate changing, and saying \u2018fire-smarting my property is exactly what we need to do to protect our homes,\u2019\u201d she said.</p><p>Wildfire preparedness is increasingly on people\u2019s minds, she added. \u201cBeing prepared is at the forefront of everybody\u2019s mind, because everybody knows somebody who has been impacted by a forest fire in B.C. \u201d</p><p>The program is aimed at children to instill knowledge early. \u201cIn this event, it\u2019s like the school system, where you teach children something young, they grow with that information,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re empowering the youth. The more information we can give them, the better decisions they\u2019ll make when they\u2019re homeowners themselves.\u201d</p><p>Funded through the province\u2019s Park Enhancement Fund, which is financed by the BC Parks Licence Plate Program, the scavenger hunt is a first for the northwest.</p><p>Callahan hopes to share the concept with other municipalities so their FireSmart chapters can host similar events. \u201cThe message is clear and direct. It\u2019s relevant to everybody.\u201d</p><p>The event was developed through grant funding and team brainstorming, Callahan added. \u201cIt\u2019s our little baby right now, and we\u2019re hoping to develop it further and spread the message.\u201d</p><p>Those unable to attend can find safety tips and resources on the FireSmart Kitimat Facebook page.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KITINS-news20250821PQOA0004890248</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KITINS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJD-XMT3-RRHJ-C0SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438223</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"434\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

They've warned that the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.</p><p>But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change - a glaring and short-sighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to  heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.</p><p>\"If anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\" said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Mass.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international co-operation is needed.</p><p>\"There's no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\" Hogan said. \"But I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\"</p><p>The country has \"been fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\" when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs.</p><p> This year's first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the  second-worst year.</p><p>Late last week, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 72,520 square kilometres burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the  Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.</p><p>McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data shows that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up, and water that once lapped at people's back doors in Canada's lake communities  is now often hundreds of feet away.</p><p>\"People can make up their own mind as to why that is,\" he said. \"But something clearly has changed.\"</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax - a belief echoed by many in the GOP - and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little to no pushback from Republicans in Congress.</p><p>He's proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare - the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He's declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, cancelled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 1.5  C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>The Associated Press reached out to more than half a dozen Republicans who criticized Canada, but none returned phone calls or emails.</p><p>Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine said the wildfires are jeopardizing health and air quality in her state, too, but faulted Republicans for failing to meet the crisis head-on - beginning by acknowledging climate change.</p><p>\"Rather than accept this reality and work together to find proactive, common-sense solutions for preventing and mitigating these fires, Republicans are burying their heads in the sand,\" she said.</p><p>Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat, criticized her Republican colleagues' letter to Canada's U.S. ambassador, saying those \"who are in denial about climate change shouldn't be writing letters prescribing people's actions to try to contain it.\"</p><p>McMullen, the Canadian wildfire expert, said battling the fires isn't as simple as many seem to believe.</p><p>The country and its territories are vast and fires are often in remote areas where the best - and sometimes only - course of action, if there are no residents or structures, is to let them burn or \"it is going to just create another situation for us to deal with in a year or two or 10 or 20 years from now,\" McMullen said.</p><p>Prescribed burns to clear underbrush and other ignition sources are used in some areas, but aren't practical or possible in some forests and prairies that are burning, experts said.</p><p>McMullen has advocated for a Canadian forest fire co-ordination agency to help deploy firefighters and equipment where they're needed.</p><p>But as for stopping worsening fires, \"I don't think there's much they can do,\" said University of Michigan climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck. He noted that hotter temperatures are melting permafrost in northern Canada, which dries out and makes the vast boreal forests far more likely to burn.</p><p>Instead, the two countries should collaborate on climate change solutions \"because our smoke is their smoke, their smoke is ours,\" Overpeck said. \"As long as this trend of warming and drying continues, we're going to get a worsening problem.</p><p>\"The good news is ... we know what the cause is ... We can stop it from getting worse.\"</p><p>The Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2025081876354485</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHR-6563-S6K5-H4FN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1007\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 18, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

Firefighters are making progress near St. John's. And as CTV's Garrett Barry reports, they're getting some much needed help from outside of the province.</p><p>GARRETT BARRY (Reporter): Another run from a water bomber before it slips behind the smoke, count four of the province's regular tankers and two more from Quebec working here today. But so desperately needed, they're also being shared with another fire in the Conception Bay North area, and other aircraft are in central Newfoundland, where evacuation advisories grew again today in (inaudible). There's so much demand across the country that firefighters are being stretched thin.</p><p>AWA CISSE (Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre): Basically, every resources are being used. It start with it, it's aircraft or equipment or firefighting.</p><p>BARRY: So now officials in Newfoundland and Labrador are looking further. They're bringing in privately owned aircraft, a pair of black hawk helicopters from Utah, a Sikorsky Fire Raptor, and a handful of other high capacity helicopters. The bill for the rentals, more than $8 million.</p><p>JOHN HOGAN (Newfoundland and Labrador Premier): The approach we're taking right now is to get as many assets here as we can. If we overpay and don't need them because the fires are out, I'll take that all day long.</p><p>BARRY: What hasn't helped is a string of fires set overnight in downtown St. John's in some of the city's busiest areas that police believe are all suspicious. There's been a lot of speculation across the province over the past number of days about the cause of some of these fires, and today's information from St. John's is the closest that any official source has gone to suggesting there's some ill intent behind some of these incidents.</p><p>CONST. JAMES CADIGAN (Royal Newfoundland Constabulary): We suspect that one person is responsible for multiple fires in this case.</p><p>BARRY: Police say it's too early to talk about motive, but like the much bigger Patty's Pond fire, they're looking to speak with anyone who has information.

was burning on a small island on Lac Des Mille Lacs, about 19 kilometres southeast of Upsala.</p><p>The blaze, less than one hectare in size, is one of three small fires that lit up on Friday.</p><p>It was one of 52 active fires across the Northwest that were being monitored by provincial crews, with only four of those classified as not under control.</p><p>\u201cWildland fire hazard is mainly high in the Kenora and Fort Frances fire management areas, moderate to high in the Dryden and Thunder Bay areas, and mainly low to moderate in the Nipigon, Sioux Lookout and Red Lake areas,\u201d an agency bulletin said.</p><p>Among the fires not under control was Red Lake No. 99, which has been pegged at about 300 square kilometres north-east of Poplar Hill First Nation.</p><p>\u201cLow fire behaviour is helping three crews make good progress on ongoing firefighting priorities\u201d targeting No. 99, the agency said. \u201cMore rain is in the forecast for the fire area.\u201d</p><p>Though the 2025 wildfire season across Ontario has been fairly severe, it likely won\u2019t end up as the worst on record.</p><p>According to AFFES data, wildfires have burned just over 5,900 square kilometres across the province as of the end of this week.</p><p>That\u2019s about triple the 10-year average, but still short of amounts burned over in previous years.</p><p>By the time the last wildfire was out in Ontario in 2021, for example, more than 7,800 square kilometres had been torched.</p><p>In 2011, the total amount burned totalled just over 6,300 square kilometres.</p><p>\u201cThis season is actually below the 10-year average for fire numbers, but above the 10 year average in hectares (burned),\u201d AFFES regional spokesman Chris Marchand noted.</p><p>Meanwhile, it doesn\u2019t appear that wildfire smoke has impacted farmland production near Thunder Bay.</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, there seems to be no adverse effect of smoke on the crops,\u201d said Tarlok Singh Sahota, director of Lakehead University\u2019s agricultural research station just west of the city.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

I've never seen three. This is scary.\"</p><p>Manitoba and Saskatchewan account for more than half the area burned so far, but British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario are all also well above their 25-year averages. Fire bans have been announced in multiple provinces, including a total ban on going in the woods in Nova Scotia.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, the military and coast guard were called in to help fight fires in Newfoundland and Labrador this week. Around 1,400 international firefighters have also helped fight Canadian fires so far this year, according to the CIFFC.</p><p>Scientists say that climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, has created longer fire seasons and drier landscapes, sparking more intense and widespread forest fires.\u00a0</p><p>\"I used to always say... some years are cooler and wetter and we will get quiet years,\"\u00a0Flannigan said.</p><p>\"But maybe every year's going to\u00a0be a bad fire year now.\" \u00a0</p><p>Dry conditions across the country have allowed fires to quickly balloon this fire season.</p><p/><p>\"The forests of Canada are too dry, too hot,\" Environment Canada climatologist David Phillips told CBC News. \"This year... there's no kind of reprieve from what we've seen.\"</p><p>This year has seen notable blazes in regions where we haven't historically, such as Newfoundland and Labrador, where one fire has grown to over 5,200 hectares.</p><p>Yan Boulanger, a research scientist in forest ecology at Natural Resources Canada, says Newfoundland \"is not used to [seeing] huge fires.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"But we will have to get more and more used to it, because those ecosystems are also projected to see an increase in fire activity in the upcoming decades.\"</p><p>The other outlier is Quebec, which was one of the hardest-hit provinces in 2023, when an estimated 4.5 million hectares burned.\u00a0</p><p>This year, the province has had a much milder fire season, thanks to frequent precipitation in the spring and early summer, Boulanger says. But a sudden bout of dry conditions in August, usually a quiet fire month for the province, has experts recommending vigilance.\u00a0</p><p>Consequences of repeated fires</p><p>Bad back-to-back fire seasons can have huge consequences.\u00a0</p><p>Fire is a natural part of the lifecycle for many tree species, but a forest can become damaged to the point where trees cannot regrow in the area for years, or even decades. It's called \"regeneration failure.\"</p><p/><p>\"The problem is when we have too much fire and we are getting out of what we are calling the natural variability of the system,\" Boulanger said. \"When such things happen... the forest can lose its resilience.\"</p><p>Scientists are already seeing it in regions of Quebec that were heavily damaged in 2023, and in parts of the Northwest Territories and Alberta, Boulanger says. Right now, around 300,000 to 400,000 hectares are affected by regeneration failure in Quebec.\u00a0</p><p>Fewer trees means less carbon being stored, exacerbating the problem of increased emissions that occur during widespread forest fires. The 2023 fires produced nearly a quarter of the year's global wildfire carbon emissions. Meanwhile, wildfire smoke has been linked to a myriad of health complications, including a higher risk of dementia.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATCH |\u00a0\u00a0Calls picking up for a national wildfire agency:</emphasis></emphasis>\u00a0</p><p>With intense wildfires becoming an annual problem in Canada on a new scale, we need more strategies, experts say.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs (CAFC) has called on Ottawa to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/forest-fire-chiefs-1.7604093\">establish a national forest fire co-ordination agency</url>\u00a0to ensure that personnel and equipment can be distributed across the country when different regions are seeing heavy fires, and that fire chiefs are at the table when national policies are made.\u00a0</p><p>The government has been studying the possibility of creating a national disaster response agency since 2023, and met with CAFC to discuss it in December. But it's time to move beyond the planning stage, according to Ken McMullen, the organization's president and fire chief in Red Deer, Alta.</p><p>\"All parties are saying that they think it's a good idea. The reality is nobody's helped pick up the ball and get it across the finish line,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>Flannigan, at Thompson Rivers University,\u00a0supports the idea, but believes we need to go further and create a robust national emergency management agency that would be able to provide training for fighting wildfires, forecast where fires are likely to occur and whether they're a danger, and then move resources there proactively.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"Yes, it's going to cost money, but if it prevents one Jasper, one Fort McMurray, it pays for itself,\" he said, referring to the Alberta communities ravaged in recent years by fires.\u00a0</p><p>\"The status quo doesn't seem to be working. We're spending billions and billions of dollars on fire management expenditures, but our area burned has quadrupled since the 1970s.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewsclimatewildfireseason202517606371</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGD-NC63-RTJJ-N26R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"928\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

We also set several per share records, which is even more impressive considering the additional shares which were issued for the redemption of the Series K and L debentures during the year. During the nine months ending September 30, 2025 we settled the Series K and L debentures which collectively reduced our leverage and increased our equity by over $200 million. We previously stated our intent to remove convertible debentures from our financial structure to simplify our balance sheet. With the calling of our last outstanding tranche of convertible debentures we will have completed this initiative. We will have no convertible debentures outstanding prior to the end of the year. Our strong financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend from $2.64 to $2.76 per share per annum consistent with our stated goal of providing a stable and growing dividend to our shareholders. The 4.5% dividend increase represents a small proportion of our Adjusted Net Earnings per share increase of 17% on a year to date basis which is consistent with our stated goal of reducing our payout ratio metrics.</p><p>The record financial results are a testament to our diversified and resilient financial model. Our underlying performance demonstrates the essential nature of the goods and services we provide for our customers. Our results continue to be driven from our organic Growth Capital Expenditures along with our acquisitions of Canadian North and Spartan in the past twelve months. Our investment criteria are relatively simple however we remain very disciplined in applying those criteria to assess whether an investment meets our metrics of Free Cash Flow returns and other qualitative characteristics. This is a fundamental part of our business along with maintaining the culture at our subsidiaries so that they continue to be entrepreneurial and drive organic growth.</p><p>I am very excited about our future, as we are positioned at the crossroads of a number of important tailwinds that are expected to drive our country over the longer term. We have always believed in the importance of the North, and we are noting greater emphasis on the North by Federal, Provincial and Territorial governments. EIC is the leader in Northern aviation and that expertise, coupled with our infrastructure, allows us to be a unique service provider as Canada looks to develop the North and defend our sovereignty. This provides us with opportunities to be the chosen service provider as resources are developed including the mining of critical minerals, precious metals or other resources. Furthermore, our infrastructure allows us to play a meaningful role in the intelligence gathering and surveillance of the North. Our Aerospace business line is a global leader in ISR services, and we already have a number of surveillance aircraft along the Eastern and Western coasts of Canada. Accordingly, we believe that the Corporation has a unique value proposition for ISR services in the North. Finally, our pan Canadian medevac operations are well positioned to continue to meet the demands of the communities we serve along with the enhanced service that will be required with significant investment in the North. The tailwinds also provide meaningful opportunities for our Manufacturing subsidiaries. The development of Federal government nation building projects are expected to drive demand for our Environmental Access Solutions business line along with ancillary demand for our Precision Manufacturing and Engineering business line. Lastly, the government continues to identify that affordable housing remains a strategic national priority and our Multi-Storey Window Solutions business line is a direct beneficiary of that focus, although it is expected to remain our most challenging business line.</p><p>Adam Terwin, EICs Chief Corporate Development Officer, commented We were happy to announce the successful completion of the Canadian North acquisition on July 1 along with the finalization of the long-term Air Services Agreement with the Government of Nunavut in mid-July. The integration of Canadian North has gone very well to date. We are executing on our integration plan and have noted positive results and returns consistent with our expectations. Canadian North is a highly strategic asset to Essential Air Services and has fit in culturally very well with our other air operators. The acquisition, which was largely asset backed by the aircraft and infrastructure, is expected to generate Free Cash Flow less Maintenance Capital Expenditures below our typical threshold in our first year of ownership largely driven by elevated Maintenance Capital Expenditures identified during our due diligence process and factors into the purchase price. However, we have already identified significant opportunities for cost savings and revenue growth. We anticipate that the overall returns of the airline will grow steadily throughout the next number of quarters and expect to achieve our targeted returns on capital by the latter part of fiscal 2026. We believed that the North would be critical to Canada for economic development, defence and sovereignty reasons. This belief has been further cemented by recent focus by the Federal government on the strategic importance of the North for all Canadians. EIC has become one of Canadas largest air operators and we are strategically set up to capitalize on opportunities in the North, where our expertise lies. Our relationship with our Northern partners, including the Territorial governments and their communities, is very strong, and the acquisition will provide the opportunity for a mutually beneficial long-term economic partnership.</p><p>Taking a step back, our pipeline of acquisition opportunities continues to be active with a number of targets in both operating segments; however, we remain disciplined in ensuring that we acquire companies that meet or exceed our financial metrics, with strong management teams, and with sustainable, strategic business niches.</p><p>Selected Financial Highlights</p><p>(All amounts in thousands except % and share data) //st Q3 Q3 % Change YTD YTD % Change 2025 2024 2025 2024 Revenue $959,744 $709,856 35% $2,347,948 $1,972,200 19% Adjusted EBITDA $230,569 $192,914 20% $537,941 $461,010 17% Net Earnings $68,737 $55,885 23% $115,954 $93,061 25% per share (basic) $1.32 $1.18 12% $2.26 $1.96 15% Adjusted Net Earnings $75,674 $61,372 23% $137,125 $108,608 26% per share (basic) $1.46 $1.29 13% $2.67 $2.29 17% Trailing Twelve Month Adjusted Net Earnings Payout Ratio (basic) 76% 87% 76% 87% Free Cash Flow $171,441 $136,116 26% $376,349 $298,549 26% per share (basic) $3.30 $2.86 15% $7.33 $6.30 16% Free Cash Flow less Maintenance Capital Expenditures $88,163 $81,201 9% $171,150 $156,116 10% per share (basic) $1.70 $1.71 (1%) $3.33 $3.30 1% Trailing Twelve Month Free Cash Flow less Maintenance Capital Expenditures Payout Ratio (basic) 63% 60% 63% 60% Dividends declared $34,699 $31,403 10% $102,182 $93,849 9%</p><p>Review of Q3 Financial Results</p><p>Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $960 million, which was an increase of $250 million or 35% over the prior period. Revenue in the Aerospace &amp;Aviation and Manufacturing segments grew over the prior year, by $247 million and $3 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $231 million, which was an increase of $38 million or 20% compared to the third quarter of last year.</p><p>Revenue generated by the Aerospace &amp;Aviation segment increased by $247 million or 57% to $680 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased by $46 million or 30% to $202 million over the prior period. The most material drivers of the revenue and profitability increases related to the addition of Canadian North coupled with improved load factors during the quarter after the Manitoba and Ontario forest fire activity subsided, increased flying under the BC medevac contract, enhanced pricing under certain Essential Air Services contracts, improvements in Aerospace training business and continued step based improvement in our Aircraft Sales &amp;Leasing business line as aircraft and engine leasing continues to strengthen.</p><p>Manufacturing segment revenue increased by $3 million to $279 million for the quarter, however Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $6 million to $45 million. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to tariffs on aluminum, operational inefficiencies partly due to customer delays in certain projects along with the strategic decision to retain experienced staff within our Multi-Storey Window Solutions business line, coupled with reduced profitability within our Environment Access Solutions business lines Canadian operations mat rentals due to the deferral of projects into 2026. The US composite matting business continued its strong performance which largely offset the Canadian reduced profitability. These delays and deferrals were primarily due to economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Those uncertainties are starting to abate, and we have noted an uptick in the conversion of customer inquiries into bookings within certain of our business lines. We are continuing to see a historically high number of inquiries from customers amongst our various Manufacturing segment business lines and see this as a positive forward-looking indicator for the prospects of our businesses.</p><p>EIC recorded Net Earnings of $69 million compared to $56 million in the third quarter of last year. The increase was driven by the increases in profitability noted above offset by increases in depreciation of capital assets of $20 million and an increase in depreciation on right of use assets and interest expense on right of use liabilities of $3 million, compared to the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Canadian North and Growth Capital Expenditures incurred over the past 12 months.</p><p>During the quarter we continued giving back to the communities in which we serve. We recognized the National Day for Truth &amp;Reconciliation by welcoming over 1,000 Indigenous guests to a Winnipeg Blue Bomber football game. We also celebrated with three groups of Indigenous pilots as part of our Indigenous Pilot Pathway program in Thompson, Manitoba and Rankin Inlet, Nunavut along with the announcement of the doubling of the Rankin Inlet capacity in 2026. Families and elders were in attendance celebrating the successes of the pilot participants and we were excited to announce that we made offers of employment to eleven of the current year pilot cohort in addition to twelve previous Pathway graduates who are already flying for our various airlines. We are collectively making a real difference in the communities we serve, commented Mike Pyle.</p><p>Richard Wowryk, EICs CFO noted, Our balance sheet continues to be very strong, and our total leverage ratio remains near historical lows and well within our long established guidelines. During the quarter we successfully completed the redemption of our Series L convertible debentures and subsequent to quarter end we announced the early redemption of our last series of convertible debentures. We exercised the early redemption provisions as our weighted average share trading price exceeded 25% of the $60 conversion price on the $115 million Series M convertible debentures. By year end, we will have simplified our capital structure and will have no more convertible debentures outstanding. After the conversions to date, we continue to have significant liquidity with approximately $1.2 billion available to finance acquisitions and organic growth capital investments through its cash on hand, its credit facility and the credit facility accordion feature. The redemption and conversion of these debentures and simplifying our capital structure is a significant milestone for the Corporation and has positioned us to fund the next stage of growth with non-dilutive capital, while not straying from our core principle of maintaining modest levels of leverage.</p><p>Looking at this past quarters performance, we are very proud of our financial results including the record per share metrics. During the past twelve months we have redeemed over $300 million in convertible debentures with the vast majority being converted into equity of the Corporation. The incredible strong third quarter results have delivered record results for all key performance indicators on an absolute basis but also on a per share basis for virtually all of our metrics. We have invested significant growth capital expenditures over the past number of years and are seeing the fruits of such investments in our current year results. Our businesses continue to be very resilient and stable even during these times of political unrest. This is a testament to our long-term view of our investment philosophy. Whilst the tariffs did have some direct impact on Multi-Storey Window Solutions, the overall impact on the consolidated financial results was not material and our management teams stand ready to react to any changes to the tariffs or geopolitical events. In fact, the geopolitical events provide us with opportunities to further invest in our businesses as the Build Canada initiatives of the Federal Government will allow us to utilize our infrastructure and expertise to solve Canadas most important matters. We are all collectively excited about the future prospects for our various businesses as we look into the future.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>Mr. Pyle concluded by saying, Our diversification and investment philosophy continues to show itself in consistent record setting financial performance and metrics coupled with prudent balance sheet management. We continue to execute on our disciplined acquisition and Growth Capital Expenditures strategies. I am extremely confident in our future as we have strong short, medium and longer-term opportunities for growth within each of our operating segments.</p><p>Looking forward to Fiscal 2026, we anticipate that Adjusted EBITDA will be between $825 to $875 million based on our recent contractual announcements, acquisitions to date and near-term organic opportunities. For clarity, this does not include any forecasted mergers and acquisition activity, unannounced contract wins or significant Growth Capital Expenditures for new opportunities. We have not deviated from our strategy since inception of EIC and we will continue to deliver dependable and consistent financial results for our shareholders. In addition, we confirm our guidance for 2025 with an Adjusted EBITDA range of $725 to $765 million, with a bias to the midpoint of the range.</p><p>EICs complete interim financial statements and managements discussion and analysis for the three and nine- months ending September 30, 2025 can be found at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ExchangeIncomeCorp.ca\">www.ExchangeIncomeCorp.ca</url> or at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedarplus.ca\">www.sedarplus.ca</url>.</p><p>Conference Call Notice</p><p>Management will hold a conference call to discuss its 2025 third quarter financial results on Friday, November 7, 2025, at 8:30am ET.

It is used by management to assess its consolidated results and the results of its operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure utilized by many investors to analyze the cash available for distribution from operations before allowance for debt service, capital expenditures, and income taxes. The most comparable IFRS measure, presented in the Corporations Statements of Income as an additional IFRS measure, is Operating profit before Depreciation, Amortization, Finance Costs, and Other. //st</p><p>Three Months September 30, 2025 Three Months September 30, 2024 Nine Months September 30, 2025 Nine Months September 30, 2024 Adjusted EBITDA $ 230,569 $ 192,914 $ 537,941 $ 461,010 Depreciation of capital assets 84,737 64,707 222,061 181,806 Amortization of intangible assets 6,084 5,538 18,344 16,709 Finance costs - interest 30,969 34,225 91,617 95,743 Depreciation of right of use assets 12,612 10,276 34,074 29,669 Interest expense on right of use liabilities 2,776 2,044 6,963 6,076 Acquisition costs 2,319 1,549 7,723 4,098 Earnings before taxes $ 91,072 $ 74,575 $ 157,159 $ 126,909</p><p>Adjusted Net Earnings: is defined as Net Earnings adjusted for acquisition costs, amortization of intangible assets, interest accretion on acquisition contingent consideration, accelerated interest accretion on convertible debentures, and non-recurring items. Adjusted Net Earnings is a performance measure, along with Free Cash Flow less Maintenance Capital Expenditures, which the Corporation uses to assess cash flow available for distribution to shareholders. The most comparable IFRS measure is Net Earnings. Interest accretion on contingent consideration is recorded in the period subsequent to an acquisition after the expected payment to the vendors is discounted. The value recorded on acquisition is accreted to the expected payment over the earn out period. Accelerated interest accretion on convertible debentures reflects the additional interest accretion recorded in a period that, but for the action to early redeem the debenture series, would have been recorded over the remaining term to maturity. This interest reflects the difference in the book value of the convertible debentures and the par value outstanding.</p><p>The Corporation presents an Adjusted Net Earnings payout ratio, which is calculated by dividing dividends declared during a period, as presented in the Corporations Financial Statements and Notes, by Adjusted Net Earnings, as defined above. The Corporation uses this metric to assess cash flow available for distribution to shareholders. //st Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 2024 Net Earnings $ 68,737 $ 55,885</p><p>Acquisition costs (net of tax $90 and $132) 1 2,229 1,417</p><p>Amortization of intangible assets (net of tax $1,612 and $1,468) 4,472 4,070</p><p>Interest accretion on acquisition contingent consideration (net of tax $14 and nil) 38 -</p><p>Accelerated interest accretion on redeemed debentures (net of tax $74 and nil) 198 - Adjusted Net Earnings $ 75,674 $ 61,372 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 2024 Net Earnings $ 115,954 $ 93,061</p><p>Acquisition costs (net of tax $431 and $832) 1 7,292 3,266</p><p>Amortization of intangible assets (net of tax $4,861 and $4,428) 13,483 12,281</p><p>Interest accretion on acquisition contingent consideration (net of tax $39 and nil) 108 -</p><p>Accelerated interest accretion on redeemed debentures (net of tax $107 and nil) 288 - Adjusted Net Earnings $ 137,125 $ 108,608</p><p>Note 1) The tax deductibility of Acquisition Costs is dependent on the nature of the expense and the jurisdiction in which they are incurred.</p><p>Free Cash Flow: is equal to cash flow from operating activities as defined by IFRS, adjusted for changes in non-cash working capital, acquisition costs, principal payments on right of use lease liabilities, and any non-recurring items, such as restructuring costs. Free Cash Flow is a performance measure used by management and investors to analyze the cash generated from operations before the seasonal impact of changes in working capital items or other unusual items. The most comparable IFRS measure is Cash Flow from Operating Activities. Adjustments made to Cash Flow from Operating Activities in the calculation of Free Cash Flow include other IFRS measures, including adjusting the impact of changes in working capital and deducting principal payments on right of use lease liabilities.</p><p>The Corporation presents Free Cash Flow per share, which is calculated by dividing Free Cash Flow, as defined above, by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, as presented in the Corporations Financial Statements and Notes. //st Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 2024 Cash flows from operations $ 185,418 $ 124,971</p><p>Change in non-cash working capital (2,538) 19,931</p><p>Acquisition costs (net of tax $90 and $132) 1 2,229 1,417</p><p>Principal payments on right of use lease liabilities (13,668) (10,203) $ 171,441 $ 136,116 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 2024 Cash flows from operations $ 376,548 $ 216,477</p><p>Change in non-cash working capital 37,035 107,507</p><p>Acquisition costs (net of tax $431 and $832) 1 7,292 3,266</p><p>Principal payments on right of use lease liabilities (35,526) (28,701) $ 376,349 $ 298,549</p><p>Note 1) The tax deductibility of Acquisition Costs is dependent on the nature of the expense and the jurisdiction in which they are incurred.</p><p>Free Cash Flow less Maintenance Capital Expenditures: is equal to Free Cash Flow, as defined above, less Maintenance Capital Expenditures, as defined below.

The Corporation uses this metric to assess cash flow available for distribution to shareholders.</p><p>Maintenance and Growth Capital Expenditures: Maintenance Capital Expenditures is defined as the capital expenditures made by the Corporation to maintain the operations of the Corporation at its current level. For fiscal 2025, Maintenance Capital Expenditures within the Corporations Aircraft Sales &amp;Leasing business line reflects a more conservative charge based on the utilization of the assets within the aircraft and engine lease portfolio which will result in much less volatility then the prior determination of Maintenance Capital Expenditures which was based on cash outlays incurred to maintain the aircraft and engine lease portfolio. Maintenance Capital Expenditures within the Environmental Access Solutions business line reflects the depreciation of the mats and bridges as well as the maintenance or replacement of equipment. Other capital expenditures are classified as Growth Capital Expenditures as they will generate new cash flows and are not considered by management in determining the cash flows required to sustain the current operations of the Corporation. While there is no comparable IFRS measure for Maintenance Capital Expenditures or Growth Capital Expenditures, the total of Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Growth Capital Expenditures is equivalent to the total of capital asset and intangible asset purchases, net of disposals, on the Statement of Cash Flows. //st Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Aerospace &amp;Aviation Manufacturing Head Office Total Maintenance Capital Expenditures $ 73,751 $ 9,308 $ 219 $ 83,278 Growth Capital Expenditures 126,121 1,631 - 127,752 Total Net Capital Additions and Intangible Asset purchases, per Statement of Cash Flows $ 199,872 $ 10,939 $ 219 $ 211,030 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Aerospace &amp;Aviation Manufacturing Head Office Total Maintenance Capital Expenditures $ 45,043 $ 9,468 $ 404 $ 54,915 Growth Capital Expenditures 91,232 1,948 - 93,180 Total Net Capital Additions and Intangible Asset purchases, per Statement of Cash Flows $ 136,275 $ 11,416 $ 404 $ 148,095 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Aerospace &amp;Aviation Manufacturing Head Office Total Maintenance Capital Expenditures $ 181,038 $ 23,616 $ 545 $ 205,199 Growth Capital Expenditures 190,263 (1,850) - 188,413 Total Net Capital Additions and Intangible Asset purchases, per Statement of Cash Flows $ 371,301 $ 21,766 $ 545 $ 393,612 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Aerospace &amp;Aviation Manufacturing Head Office Total Maintenance Capital Expenditures $ 120,440 $ 21,307 $ 686 $ 142,433 Growth Capital Expenditures 174,922 2,374 10 177,306 Total Net Capital Additions and Intangible Asset purchases, per Statement of Cash Flows $ 295,362 $ 23,681 $ 696 $ 319,739</p><p>Investors are cautioned that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Earnings, Free Cash Flow, and Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Growth Capital Expenditures should not be viewed as an alternative to measures that are recognized under IFRS such as Net Earnings or cash from operating activities.

The same applies to the Kirkfield area fire (OFR001), which is currently listed as \"out of control.\"</p><p>Involving more than 33 hectares of wildland, the Kirkfield fire began Monday and is located just east of Prospect Road, and north of Eldon Station Road.</p><p>Five crews from the Ministry of Natural Resources are presently assigned to the Burnt River fire. Seven crews have been assigned to the Kirkfield fire. Both sites are also attended by Kawartha Lakes Fire and Rescue Service firefighters.</p><p>\"We sincerely thank all firefighters, fire rangers, flight crews, emergency responders, public works and support staff for your assistance over the past several days. It has been a challenging operation, and we continue to work to suppress within the 27-hectare boundary,\" commented deputy fire Chief Jeff Bignell in a press release.</p><p>Although efforts continue to progress positively, Elmslie cautioned the situation is not - literally and figuratively - \"out of the woods\" by any means.</p><p>\"We're probably one lightning strike away from being back in the soup again,\" said Elmslie, adding that, as hot weather conditions and lack of precipitation continue, risk remains high.</p><p>While evacuations are not being considered at this time, Elmslie said farmers - particularly those in the Kirkfield area - have moved their livestock to other locations as a precaution. He also encouraged everyone to ensure they have a 72-hour emergency kit on hand. </p><p>\"Unfortunately, I think, given climate change, there are going to be more situations like this coming the future, not fewer ... It's best to be prepared,\" said Elmslie. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2025081576331842</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH3-8X83-RWY6-F2JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

There's also no such thing as a bad pickup truck driver, nor a bad motorcyclist, nor a bad minivan driver etc. The bicycle, truck, motorbike or minivan didn't make a bad move in traffic, the person did. Blaming the mode of transportation for making a poor decision makes about as much sense as blaming trees for a forest fire. The level of aggression towards cyclists in the Comox Valley is alarmingly high. </p><p>I have cycled in major cities all over North America and overseas and the Comox Valley is amongst the least safe I've ever felt on a bicycle in traffic, largely due to the narrow high speed roads that connect our communities and neighbourhoods. But let's look at this from factual statistics, not just my opinion. Over the past three years there have been at least three cyclists killed in motor vehicle accidents in the Comox Valley, so we are averaging one death per year. According to the CAA, an average of 73 cyclists are killed every year in Canada. The population of Canada is approximately 41 million people and the population of the Comox Valley is approximately 77,000 people. That means the Comox Valley is roughly 0.2% of the population of Canada yet we account for nearly 1.4 per cent (1/73rd) of the cyclist deaths in Canada.. You are 7 times more likely to be killed on a bicycle in the Comox Valley than the Canadian national average. In the fall of 2024, I requested a meeting with Mayor Bob Wells to address my concerns of cycling safety in the valley which he gladly accepted. We began to have a good chat before the City Manager joined us late, took over the conversation and proceeded to tell me that the local government is doing a wonderful job at improving cycling infrastructure and safety. I left without my questions answered nor my recommendations heard. So I appeal to the community at large to be reminded that not only as a driver, cyclist, or pedestrian we all have a legal obligation to ensure the safety of those we share the road with as well as a moral obligation as humans and neighbours to let our families and friends get home safely.</p><p>Brian Chapman</p><p>Comox Valley</p><p>Copyright 2025 Comox Valley Record</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVRECO-news20250814PCV4753173</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVRECO2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH1-SY23-RSJ1-P39J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438259</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"365\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Here's CTV's Kathy Le with the latest on the wildfire battles.</p><p>KATHY LE (Reporter): The air is clear in the Kawartha Lakes region today. A dramatic shift from yesterday.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: You could literally look at the end of our driveway and see big plumes of dark smoke.</p><p>LE: Dozens of fire crews in the Ontario area working to contain an out-of-control wildfire. In Newfoundland, the Kingston wildfire growing to over 5,000 hectares overnight. The premier confirming damages to structures in various communities.</p><p>JOHN HOGAN (Nfld and Labrador Premier): Please know our hearts are with each and every one of you.</p><p>LE: And in BC, the Wesley Ridge Wildfire on Vancouver Island had minimal growth, but still remains out of control. Persistent hot and dry conditions into the week will further compromise air quality.</p><p>MADISON DAHL (BC Wildfire Service Information Officer): As the fire gets a little bit more heat and that direct sunlight, we can expect to see a lot more smoke.</p><p>LE: Experts say this year's wildfire season is the second worst on record, renewing calls for a national fire administration.</p><p>KEN MCMULLEN (Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs President): The benefit national administration is really around coordination and the reallocation of resources all across Canada in times when they need it the most.</p><p>LE: Others calling for a national wildfire agency, with more resources to deploy where they are needed during a surge.</p><p>MIKE FLANNIGAN (Wildfire Expert): There's just too many fires. There's not enough resources. We call on help from around the world, and from the Canadian Armed Forces. But that's, we should be able to handle this on our own.</p><p>LE: The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre plays a critical role in coordinating resources between provinces. But in the case of Newfoundland, there is a delay.</p><p>HOGAN: Two water bombers from Ontario have been advised, we've been advised that there is a delay as they deal with wildfires in their own province.</p><p>LE: The federal government says that work is underway to improve Canada's wildfire response capacity, including better coordination across jurisdictions, and building long-term resilience.

Gulaga explains, \u00a0\u201cSaskatchewan Public Safety Agency heads the provincial disaster response team. When they realize the resources they have won\u2019t handle a situation, they put a call out to Zone reps of Saskatchewan Volunteer Firefighters Association and that trickles down to Fire Chiefs to see if equipment and personnel can be sent. Chief Goldstein received a text and a few of us were in the room and started talking about it. The three of us said, \u2018sure, why not?\u2019 Within 48 hours we were on the road.\u201d Gulaga explained that they had to get approval from the local Fire Committee, the Town of Shaunavon who owns the truck that they took, the Chief must approve it and then the Province must accept the volunteers who step forward.\u00a0</p><p>Along with the small fire truck and wildland firefighting gear, the men packed tents and sleeping bags as they didn\u2019t know what or if sleeping arrangements were available. The tents came in handy their first three nights after arriving at what Greenlay describes as an \u2018apocalyptic\u2019 scene. \u201cWe were driving into the smoke and didn\u2019t know where we were. We were trying to find check-in locations in a smoky town (Beauval). At least an hour out from Beauval the visibility was already only twenty feet, and we thought we probably shouldn\u2019t have gone this far. We thought we were lost. There\u2019s no way they want us living here and operating in this. But it was exactly where they wanted us.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>One of the worst forest fire seasons in Saskatchewan drew volunteer firefighters from across the province and Canada and around the world.</p><p>Gulaga recalls, \u201cWe did some 16-hour days, then drove back to camp and had to put fire out around the camp in the dark so we didn\u2019t have to sleep next to an active fire.\u201d Firefighters joined the efforts from as far away as Mexico, Australia, and provinces throughout Canada. Military personnel also joined the efforts and were stationed at a separate camp. After three nights in tents in Beauval, the team was relocated an hour north to an outfitter camp that needed protecting.\u00a0</p><p>Each day brought its own challenges although the basic blueprint was similar: waking at 5 am, on the road by 5:30 am to get to the breakfast facility an hour away by 6:30 am, followed by morning briefings at 7:30 am. Gulaga says, \u201cThen we\u2019d get to work. Mornings were mostly patrolling and checking things out. It gets cool and damp overnight, so the fire settles down and doesn\u2019t move a lot. We try to get ahead of things before it heats up. On hot or windy days, things pick up by noon with full blown fires everywhere, so you try to contain them.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Gulaga served as a Team Leader in the Structural Protection Division where the job is to keep homes and buildings intact. \u201cEveryday we put out multiple fires and some were close to buildings, but we weren\u2019t involved with any actual loss of property.\u201d They estimate that their Division covered at least a 300km span of area.</p><p>The response follows the Incident Command System (ICS) which has become the standard for emergency management across the country. Gulaga says, \u201cWe\u2019ve taken training in ICS here but fighting forest fires was new. We train for what we do here; we fight fire on the ground. In that situation, you look up and there\u2019s fire above you, too. The first couple of days we learned how to do it better. The tools we took with us and how we did things changed because you adapt.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>There were many expected and unexpected hazards during their stay. Greenlay explains, \u201cTrees fall. That\u2019s one of the more dangerous things. You\u2019ve got 6-9 inches of peat moss and muskeg, and sand below that, so trees fall easily. And we work long, hard days. With grassfires, we go hard for 3 hours (for a big fire) and then it\u2019s out. It\u2019s totally different up there; you\u2019re fighting for days.\u201d They indicated there was only one 30-degree day during their time there during which they could see smoke appearing here and there, \u2018just like bombs going off\u2019, and it was spreading so much faster. Putting out hot spots can create steam bombs when you put water on them, another hazard they became aware of.</p><p>Brett Kronberg fighting fire in northern Saskatchewan.</p><p>Greenlay says, \u201cOn one particularly windy day, we were fighting a fire next to a big 2-lane highway, and they had cleared 100 feet on either side of the highway. We were trying to contain it on one side, but it jumped a full 400 ft and got into the unburned side. We went in there, hopped through the ditch and a big thatch pile. A helicopter dropped water directly on the fire. We got our hoses and hand tools, and another crew joined us, and we contained it. It\u2019s quite something to see a helicopter hovering 40 feet overhead dropping water\u2026we were drenched.\u201d</p><p>Gulaga adds, \u201cThe way weather works, the humidity tables change, and everything rises, so there were days when it was clear although you knew there was a massive fire 40 km away. There were also bad, hard to breathe days. You do what you can but when you\u2019re exerting yourself for 14 hours/day, you\u2019re obviously going to take in that smoke. Respirators aren\u2019t common there. Forest fires aren\u2019t as toxic as structure fires and having a mask on your face isn\u2019t feasible for the long hours of demanding work.\u201d</p><p>While the group did see black bears, it was stumbling into a wasp nest that created greater panic with Gulaga and Greenlay each receiving multiple stings as they tried to retreat.\u00a0</p><p>Despite the potential dangers and difficult conditions, they acknowledge that there was a lot of bonding through the experience, and it has created lasting memories and an impact on them. When asked if they would volunteer again if needed, there was no hesitation. \u201cYes, for sure. The three of us would definitely do it again.\u201d \u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-dbc6718523c246b8ab46238d21a7dfe9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GTM-1KT3-RRWM-X0N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1013\"/><timeReceived>02:33 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 23, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Company is well financed with no debt.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North Americas largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>On October 1st 2025, the Company announced that it has entered into agreement to option the Bonanza Gold Project, located in the Kenora Gold District. The Project consists of 114 mining claims and 1 patented Mining Claim totalling 2,191 hectares or 5,414 acres. The Project has multiple high-grade mineral occurrences with spectacular visible gold at surface along with excellent infrastructure including road access to all areas of the Project along with provincial grid power lines. The Kenora Gold District is known for its high-grade Archean lode-gold deposits, the district has supported mineral exploration and some mining for more than a century. Some of the active majors and mid-tier companies in the District are Agnico Eagle, Kinross, Centerra and New Gold. NAMs technical team is currently back in the field working on the 2nd phase of our Fall Program.</p><p>Management, with NAMs Technical Team, are also preparing the Bonanza Gold Projects Go-Forward Plan, Exploration Plan and budgets for the balance of 2025 and for the year 2026. Further announcements on the Bonanza Gold Project will be forth coming. During the visit, the Company filmed a due diligence site visit video which takes the viewer behind the scenes of a project acquisition. The second part of this corporate video is now released and can be accessed by clicking here.</p><p>Photographs of Selected Due Diligence High-Grade Samples Collected by NAM Technical Representatives</p><p>The Companys Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (MinRes), one of the worlds largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area.</p><p>New Age Metals Lithium division project map</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canadas critical metals sector, with New Age Metals portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Ages properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat LakeWinnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>On September 9th 2025, the Company announced the completion of the Summer 2025 Exploration Program on the 100% owned Alaskan PGM-Cu-Ni Genesis Project. The project is road-accessible and situated within 3 km of the all-season Richardson Highway and a high-capacity power line. Known mineralization covers a distance of 9 km across the prospect. The target areas have never been drilled. A Technical Report is available. The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>The Alaskan Gensis Project has ample surface showings of copper, nickel, platinum and palladium and has never been drilled.

(NAM or the Company) is pleased to announce that further to its news release of October 1, 2025, the Company has received TSX Venture Exchange approval for the Bonanza Gold Project (the Project) with arms-length parties, Mr. Doug Bundy, Mr. Dave Burt and Mr. Jon Burt (the Partners), who are all local Kenora Mining District Prospectors. The Partners granted the Company an option to acquire 100% of the Project. The Project consists of 114 mining claims and 1 patented Mining Claim totalling 2,191 hectares or 5,414 acres and is located ~25 km southeast of Kenora in northwestern Ontario (the Transaction). The Partners will also retain a 2% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty, of which NAM has the right to re-purchase 1% for $1 million.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights</p><p>Highlights of the Bonanza Gold Project are: //st * Multiple high-grade mineral occurrences of gold at surface; * Excellent infrastructure, including road access to all areas to the Project and provincial grid power lines; * Location 25 km southeast of City of Kenora, a major northwestern Ontario economic hub with a population of ~14,800; * Select due diligence surface grab sample assays include 1.1 g/t Au, 3.7 g/t Au, 8.9 g/t Au, 13.2 g/t Au, 22.2 g/t Au, 31.9 g/t Au and up to 127 g/t Au from five prospects on the Project (see Table 2 below); * Lack of modern-day exploration; and * Drill-ready with 3-year permits in place. * Our long-term goal is to assemble a district-scale gold asset in Kenora that can ultimately attract the attention of major gold producers that are now cash rich with significant new exploration funds.</p><p>In connection with the closing of the Transaction, the Company is issuing an aggregate 302,298 common shares, at a deemed price of $0.4135 per share, and is making a total cash payment of $40,000 to the Partners pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The remaining share payments under the terms of the agreement, will be calculated based on the 10-day trading average of NAM shares at the time of each issuance subject to a minimum deemed issue price of $0.2475 per share. The agreement also provides for contingent milestone payments of $250,000 in cash or shares, or combination thereof, on the completion of an NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource and Technical Report outlining more than one million ounces of gold, and an additional $250,000 in cash or shares, or combination thereof, for a compliant Mineral Resource exceeding 2.5 million ounces. If the Company issues any shares in connection with the contingent milestone payments, those shares remain subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval.</p><p>The shares issuable are subject to a four-month plus one-day hold period in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws. No finders fees were paid by the Company in connection with the Transaction.</p><p>With the gold price and demand at historic highs, parts of the Kenora District have seen limited application of modern exploration methods, which provides NAM with an opportunity to unlock significant value through the use of new techniques, advanced technologies and upgraded mineralization models. Our long-term goal is to assemble a district-scale gold asset in Kenora that can ultimately attract the attention of major gold producers that are now cash rich with significant new exploration funds, as a result of their recent enhanced profitability. Given the severe lack of funds in recent years for the junior mining industry, there has been little new modern-day exploration completed in this region.</p><p>Chairman and CEO Harry Barr states, We began our search for new gold assets in early 2024, leading to the establishment of our Gold-Antimony Division in Newfoundland in early 2025. Since then, our technical and management teams have been systematically reviewing projects on an international scale.</p><p>Always more comfortable with North American assets, the Directors, Management and Technical Team of NAM believe the Bonanza Gold Project and parts of the Kenora Mining District have been under-explored, under-appreciated, and under-funded in recent years. This new acquisition adds to our diversified mineral portfolio, and we believe it is a significant gold exploration project for the Company. This additional gold Project will allow our shareholders more exposure to what we believe is one of most significant gold rallies in recent history. Gold is not a new metal for the New Age Metals management team and board of directors; in fact, we collectively have over 150 years experience in the gold industry.</p><p>Currently, our Technical Team is working with the Prospectors Mr. Bundy and Mr. Burt and are completing a second phase of work on the Bonanza Project. Field work is expected to be concluded by the end of the month, and a number of assays will be sent to the lab. Additionally, the team will be completing desktop work to coordinate all the results from both phases of work and compile a tremendous amount of digital data that came from the property and Government sources over the years.</p><p>Lastly, the technical/prospecting team are re-boxing old core from historical drilling on the property and moving it to a new facility. Results are expected before year end and Management are working to complete the 2026 exploration budget for the Bonanza Gold Project.</p><p>From the onset, our corporate objective has been to acquire and develop critical metal projects. Today we are a well financed, multi-asset company that is aggressively expanding its project portfolio across gold, antimony, lithium, and platinum group metals. In my opinion, our flagship asset is still the River Valley Platinum Group Metal Project, in Sudbury, Ontario and both platinum and palladium have enjoyed major price increases in the last 3 months.</p><p>In June of this year, NAM upsized its equity position in MetalQuest Mining to ~12%. MetalQuest Mining inc. (TSXV:MQM | OTCQB: MQMIF | FRA:E7Q) who controls a 100% of a substantial, high-purity iron deposit project in the Labrador Trough, Quebec. Approximately $120 million has been spent to date, including a historical NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate and a 2015 Feasibility Study. For the Companys most recent press release please click here.</p><p>Farid Mammadov, VP Investor Relations states, In todays climate of global uncertainty, gold has once again proven itself to be one of the worlds most essential metals. Gold price has reached an all high and global demand continues to climb. These market conditions have opened the door for NAM to add to its already diversified and significant project portfolio and mineral inventory. The response to our recent private placement indicates that there is renewed investor interest in both our company and the broader junior mining industry. Proof that the industry is turning around was the recent upsizing of our private placement to $4,000,000. Mr. Eric Sprott indicated his intention to subscribe for $2,000,000 hard dollars for last weeks placement. Currently, the Company has approx. $6.5 Million in cash, marketable securities and restricted securities and no debt.</p><p>The Kenora Gold District</p><p>The Kenora Gold District, located in northwestern Ontario, has been recognized since the late-1800s as one of Canadas most prolific gold camps. Known for its high-grade Archean lode-gold deposits, the district has supported mineral exploration and some mining for more than a century. With established infrastructure, year-round access, and a highly skilled workforce, Kenora has potential to become a cornerstone of Ontarios mining industry. Some of the active majors and mid-tier companies in the District are Agnico Eagle, Kinross, Centerra and New Gold.</p><p>Due Diligence Site Visit and Sampling</p><p>A due diligence site visit and verification sampling program was successfully executed in early September, 2025. Twenty-five grab samples were taken from quartz veins, quartz-carbonate veins and sulphide zones at 5 prospects distributed along 4 km across the Property. The mineralized vein and zones are hosted in silicified, carbonated and sulphidized (mainly pyrite) mafic to intermediate volcanic and plutonic host rocks. The rocks are cut by a regional high-strain zone and property-scale and smaller scale structures and generally metamorphosed under greenschist conditions.</p><p>The mineral occurrences sampled and RUSH gold assay results are listed in Table 1. Photographs of selected high-grade samples are shown in Figure 1. The due diligence program successfully confirmed the presence of high-grade gold mineralization on the Project, particularly at the Triggs, Kite Lake, Stella and Blue Star Prospects.</p><p>Figure 1. Bonanza Gold Property Due Diligence Samples Map</p><p>Note: The red outline = the Bonanza Gold Property</p><p>Table1. Due Diligence Sample Assays</p><p>Figure 2. Photographs of Selected Due Diligence High-Grade Samples Collected by NAM Technical Representatives</p><p>Analytical Methods, Chain of Custody, and Quality Assurance/Quality Control</p><p>NAM maintained a rigorous QA/QC protocol for all the verification rock samples collected for due diligence purposes. Two certified reference materials (CRMs) were inserted into the sample batch. The CRMs were sourced from industry-certified providers and selected to match, as closely as possible, the expected mineralization style and grade ranges of the samples.</p><p>All samples were individually sealed in heavy-duty plastic bags, labelled with unique sample numbers, and placed into rice bags for transport. Continuous possession of the samples was maintained until they were dropped off at a courier service in Saskatoon for express delivery to SGS Canada Minerals laboratory facilities in Burnaby, British Columbia. At this facility, the samples were weighed and prepared into pulps in accordance with SGSs standard procedures before being analysed on a RUSH basis for gold.</p><p>The analytical work included: //st * Gold: Au exploration grade 50-g Fire Assay with Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) (reporting limits 5 to 10,000 ppb) ( GE_FAA</p><p>Internal laboratory QA/QC procedures at SGS included the insertion and analysis of certified reference materials, analytical blanks and sample duplicates with the submitted samples to monitor analytical accuracy and precision.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Dr. William Stone, P.Geo. and a Qualified Person for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and a consultant to NAM, has collected, reviewed and approved the scientific and technical disclosure in this press release.</p><p>The Qualified Person has not completed sufficient work to verify the historical information on the neighbouring and other properties in the Kenora region. Nevertheless, the Qualified Person considers that drilling and analytical results were completed to industry standard practices. The reader is cautioned that mineral occurrences, prospects and deposits on neighbouring properties are not necessarily indicative of mineralization on the Companys properties. This information may provide an indication of the exploration potential of the Properties, but might not be representative of exploration results.</p><p>About NAM</p><p>New Age Metals is a junior mineral exploration and development company focused on the discovery, exploration, and development of critical green and precious metal projects in North America. The Company has four divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, Gold Division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, an Antimony-Gold Division as well as an investment in MetalQuest Minings (TSXV:MQM | OTC:MQMIF) a high purity Lac Otelnuk Iron Project1.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North Americas largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska. The PGM Division is both an industrial and critical metal division.</p><p>On October 1st 2025, the Company announced that it has entered into agreement to option the Bonanza Gold Project, located in the Kenora Gold District. The Project consists of 114 mining claims and 1 patented Mining Claim totalling 2,191 hectares or 5,414 acres. The Project has multiple high-grade mineral occurrences with spectacular visible gold at surface along with excellent infrastructure including road access to all areas of the Project along with provincial grid power lines. The Kenora Gold District is known for its high-grade Archean lode-gold deposits and has supported mineral exploration and some mining- for more than a century. Some of the active majors and mid-tier companies in the District are Agnico Eagle, Kinross, Centerra and New Gold. NAMs technical team is currently working on the exploration plan and budget for the balance of 2025 and for 2026. Further announcements on the Bonanza Gold Project will be forth coming.</p><p>The Companys Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (MinRes), one of the worlds largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area.</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canadas critical metals sector, with New Age Metals portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Ages properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat LakeWinnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAMs Gold-Antimony division is in Newfoundland and spans roughly 20,000 hectares. The majority of these properties are in St. Albans area, along Canstars Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Golds Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 Exploration of the Project, Phase 2 has been initiated, and further news will follow. On July 30th, the Company was pleased to announce that it has received formal approval under Newfoundland and Labradors Junior Exploration Assistance (JEA) Program, including eligibility for the Critical Minerals Assistance (CMA) and Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (PCMA) streams. The potential rebate total for eligible exploration activities is $71,975.</p><p>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with todays issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron2 projects at Lac Otelnuk (Qubec), where approximately $120 million has been spent on the project. For more information, please visit MetalQuestMining.com. High-purity iron oxide became a critical metal Federally in Canada and in the Provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador in 2024. In the summer of 2025, MQM contracted AtkinsRealis, an international engineering company, to complete a GAP Analysis on the Lac Otelnuk Project and its 2015 Feasibility Study.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities on an international scale. Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of expending sufficient explorations and development expenditure to eventually option our projects with Major and Junior mining companies through to exploration and development phases on to production.</p><p>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>Investors are invited to visit the New Age Metals website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newagemetals.com\">www.newagemetals.com</url> where they can review the company and its corporate activities.

The Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation near Nelson House issued a full evacuation order Sunday as the flames threatened to cut off road access.</p><p>The number of wildfires burning in British Columbia has more than doubled in the past week after a stretch of hot, dry weather and thunderstorms that produced more than 67,000 lightning strikes.</p><p>Multiple wildfires are also burning in Newfoundland, prompting evacuation orders and destroying structures in a community in the eastern part of the province.</p><p>\u2014 With files from Lyndsay Armstrong</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 5, 2025.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-8830ad9570454d97934414707d18bc31</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GF5-FB83-RSX5-M09B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"360\"/><timeReceived>06:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 5, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
