Poor air quality may persist through the day today and possibly into Tuesday for some areas.</p><p>NOTICE OF HEAVY SMOKE</p><p>According to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, heavy smoke conditions are occurring in the Northeast Region due to a large number of fires in eastern Ontario and Quebec. Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.</p><p>Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.</p><p>See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.</p><p>Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour. For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.</p><p>Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.</p><p>People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.</p><p>Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.</p><p>Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.</p><p>If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.</p><p>Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.</p><p>If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.</p><p>Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.</p><p>Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.</p><p>If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA\">https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA</url>.</p><p>Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.airhealth.ca\">www.airhealth.ca</url> for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.</p><p>Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for the Town of Parry Sound - Rosseau - Killbear Park; and here for Bayfield Inlet - Dunchurch.</p><p>To report severe weather, send an email to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ONstorm@canada.ca\">ONstorm@canada.ca</email> or tweet reports using #ONStorm.</p><p>Lead</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20230605TMPC2023060568100394</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DB-DFC1-JDV5-F3B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.</p><p>Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.</p><p>See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.</p><p>Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour. For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.</p><p>Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.</p><p>People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.</p><p>Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.</p><p>Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.</p><p>If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.</p><p>Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.</p><p>If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.</p><p>Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.</p><p>Reduce sources of indoor air pollution.

Some 100 soldiers were set to arrive Sunday evening to lend a hand.</p><p>The number of forest fires in the province inched up to 141 Sunday from 134 on Saturday, including 35 actively being fought by teams from Quebec forest fire prevention organization SOPFEU.</p><p>\"We concentrate our battles on these fires because we want to protect human life, the houses and enterprises. And we want to protect our infrastructure, like Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's,\" Bonnardel said at the news conference held alongside other public officials.</p><p>Hundreds of soldiers will deploy across the province, joining 475 firefighters under SOPFEU's banner, he said.</p><p>Residents are barred from entering the forests of several vast regions, including Northern Quebec, Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and parts of the North Coast, Outaouais, Mauricie, Lanaudi\u00e8re and the Laurentians, V\u00e9zina noted.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-news20230605TNI2023060568090910</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68D2-4WX1-F197-52JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"311\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Some 100 soldiers were set to arrive Sunday evening to lend a hand.<br/><br/> The number of forest fires in the province inched up to 141 Sunday from 134 on Saturday, including 35 actively being fought by teams from Quebec forest fire prevention organization SOPFEU.<br/><br/> \"We concentrate our battles on these fires because we want to protect human life, the houses and enterprises. And we want to protect our infrastructure, like Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's,\" Bonnardel said at the news conference held alongside other public officials.<br/><br/> Hundreds of soldiers will deploy across the province, joining 475 firefighters under SOPFEU's banner, he said.<br/><br/> Residents are barred from entering the forests of several vast regions, including Northern Quebec, Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and parts of the North Coast, Outaouais, Mauricie, Lanaudi\u00e8re and the Laurentians, V\u00e9zina noted. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2023060568090910</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68D2-NCH1-JDV5-F1BS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"313\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Poor air quality may persist through the day today and possibly into Tuesday for some areas.<br/><br/> NOTICE OF HEAVY SMOKE<br/><br/> According to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, heavy smoke conditions are occurring in the Northeast Region due to a large number of fires in eastern Ontario and Quebec. Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.<br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.<br/><br/> See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.<br/><br/> Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour. For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.<br/><br/> Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.<br/><br/> People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.<br/><br/> Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.<br/><br/> Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.<br/><br/> If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.<br/><br/> If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.<br/><br/> Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.<br/><br/> Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.<br/><br/> If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA\">https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA</url>.<br/><br/> Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.airhealth.ca\">www.airhealth.ca</url> for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.<br/><br/> Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for the Town of Parry Sound - Rosseau - Killbear Park; and here for Bayfield Inlet - Dunchurch.<br/><br/> To report severe weather, send an email to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ONstorm@canada.ca\">ONstorm@canada.ca</email> or tweet reports using #ONStorm. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023060568100394</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68D8-MHT1-JDV5-F31M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"786\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

If visibility is reduced while driving, slow down, watch for tail lights ahead and be prepared to stop. Localized flooding in low-lying areas is possible. Heavy rainfall in combination with other weather factors, such as hail, wind and lightning will make outdoor activities unsafe.\"<br/><br/> Sunday's high was forecast to hit 27C, with an overnight low of 18C. There is a possibility of thunderstorms and widespread forest fire smoke.<br/><br/> It was the second day of rainfall advisories for the area, with two issued Saturday - one for heavy rains and one for funnel clouds. They were lifted as of Sunday morning.<br/><br/> Environment Canada predicts cloudy skies and rain Monday through Friday, with highs between 19C and 23C in the days ahead.<br/><br/> The weather agency advised Saturday afternoon that funnel clouds could form in the Peterborough area Saturday evening.<br/><br/> \"These types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado,\" the advisory states.<br/><br/> \"Landspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances. Treat any funnel cloud sighting seriously. Should a funnel cloud develop nearby, prepare to take shelter. These funnel clouds usually appear with little or no warning.\"<br/><br/> This came after rainfall warning for Peterborough and area, with 50-75 millimetres of rain possible Saturday.<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2023062468295822</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JC-WB61-JDV5-F4V0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"340\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario) Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 24, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOA4</classCode><className>WEATHER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001731</classCode><className>TORNADOES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001906</classCode><className>FLOOD ZONES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001906</classCode><className>FLOOD ZONES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He points out there are 1.4 million emergency calls to 911 a year, but does not say the majority of 911 calls do not involve violence and can be dealt with by community and social workers. He says that more officers equal less crime, but years of research has shown that the crime rate does not correlate to police spending in any consistent way.</p><p><br/><br/> Toronto is one of the safest cities in North America. The key to crime prevention is through reducing inequality. To reduce response times, we need better management of the 911 service, diversion of nonpolice calls and smarter deployment. But no, our police leadership doesn't want to follow evidence. If they truly cared about our safety and well-being, they would support investment in stronger community and social supports. That is how we'll get to a safer and thriving Toronto.<br/><br/> Anna Willats, Toronto<br/><br/> Rather than attempting to intimidate the residents of Toronto by writing of facts without nuance, our police chief Myron Demkiw should be looking for the means to make his force more efficient and effective. I suggest Premier Doug Ford, who can always be counted on to have an interest in city spending, be brought in to rout out the waste in the police budget.<br/><br/> Peter Pinch, Toronto<br/><br/> How can Myron Demkiw be permitted to tease about our safety if he doesn't get his way? The rest of us must live within our means and yet, this public servant sees fit to pressure tax payers for more money through the public media. This is a tactic of a dictator, not a police chief. We obviously need to find a replacement.<br/><br/> Dave De Sylva, Milton, Ont.<br/><br/> There was an interesting contrast of articles from columnist Edward Keenan and Police Chief Myron Demkiw regarding the police budget. What struck me was how the chief says how terrible things are in the service and somehow a loss of $12.6 million is a major threat to our safety. If the biggest city in the country is at risk of chaos due to the lack of $12.6 million it is time for the politicians to demand that a third-party independent forensic team review police service spending from top to bottom to see the truth of the matter. <br/><br/> Len Bulmer, Aurora, Ont.<br/><br/> Benched officers take too much budget<br/><br/> City budget spinning from police could be a big problem: Keenan, Jan. 31<br/><br/> Here we go again with all the ballyhoo about the police budget. What I would like to know is how much of the budget is slated to be paid to suspended officers who are sitting on their butts at home while collecting a full pay cheque? It is long overdue for the mayor to ask the powers to be to provide a complete breakdown of the monies paid out to suspended cops over the years and to ask how many inevitably had to leave the service yet walked away with thousands of unearned money from taxpayers.  The police act is long overdue for an overhaul especially in these trying times when citizens cannot afford the basics of life.<br/><br/> I have said it before: if an officer is on paid leave, put their earnings into an interest generating trust account. He or she gets the money if they return to service, and if not, those funds are redirected to the police force. It is a simple solution to a long-standing problem.<br/><br/> Larry Snow, Oakville, Ont.<br/><br/> Committing to a fix without an estimate is irresponsible<br/><br/>Ford government wants to refurbish Pickering nuclear reactors - but can't say how much it will cost, Jan. 30<br/><br/> It is difficult to understand the government's commitment to refurbishing four aging nuclear reactors in Pickering given that the design and engineering work for the project is at such a preliminary stage Energy Minister Todd Smith says it would be \"irresponsible\" to provide a cost estimate at this time. What is more irresponsible is the government making a multibillion dollar commitment without a good understanding of full cost, timing and feasibility. Ontario electricity consumers, who will be paying for this seemingly blank cheque approach, deserve better. <br/><br/> Jeffrey Levitt, Toronto<br/><br/> Toronto's climate fight in Chow's hands<br/><br/> Toronto is losing its fight against climate change amid budget squeeze, Jan. 30<br/><br/> This recent piece on Toronto's 2024 budget says that Toronto has fallen off track to reach its stated goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040. I would contend that the city was not really on this track to begin with. When the TransformTO Net Zero Strategy was voted on in 2021, the will was there, but the necessary money had not been allotted and has not been since. I deputed to this effect in the public budget consultations last year and the previous year, while I was living in Toronto. Nevertheless, this year's budget is far and away the most encouraging one that I have seen in recent years. I encourage Mayor Olivia Chow and all of council to keep the city's stated climate goals as a top priority, and to continue to work toward the laudable targets set forward in the TransformTO plan. All of Ontario needs to do a better job of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. I look to Chow and her team to be leaders on this front.<br/><br/> Mary Blake Rose, London, Ont.<br/><br/> It's one thing to set a target, but council needs to put their money where their mouth is. It's time to be proactive about climate change by funding it now. Climate change is literally and figuratively a forest fire. I can't think of many fires that become cheaper to put out the longer you ignore them.<br/><br/> Tori Slobodzian, Calgary, Alta.<br/><br/> Think outside the box for refugee housing<br/><br/> Trudeau government announces $362.4 million in new refugee supports, Jan. 31<br/><br/> An immediate solution to the refugee housing issue would be to encourage and promote safe and legal rooming houses. The inspection and approval process could be improved and it could be set up so that the interests of property owners would be protected through adequate insurance and financial incentives. Ideally these rooming houses would be close to public transit. Empty buildings (such as office towers with vacancies) should also be considered for housing. The $362.4 million from the federal government for shelter refugees could be used to support these initiatives.<br/><br/> Brian O'Sullivan, Stouffville, Ont. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2024020270492357</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B7N-SD61-F197-50RR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1049\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

He warned the blaze was far from out and embers could still hide deep in places where the rain doesn't penetrate, causing a risk of reignition.</p><p>\"We could be here for weeks, we could be here for a couple of months before the incident commander is comfortable in saying this fire is out,\" he said.</p><p>The wildfire that broke out Sunday in the Halifax area raced through a number of subdivisions, consuming about 200 structures - including 151 homes - and forcing the evacuation of more than 16,000 people. Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency Deputy Fire Chief Dave Meldrum says rain has brought relief, but also raises the risk that firefighters could be hurt from slips or falls and makes for difficult working conditions.</p><p>\"They're going to be very, very dirty, they're going to be wet, they're going to be cold,\" he said. \"So we welcome this rain but it's going to be a tough working day.\"</p><p>Despite the good news, he said it was unclear when the thousands of evacuated residents would be able to return home. The evacuation zone was lifted in some areas that were undamaged by fire late Friday, but Meldrum said there is still more work to do to ensure the remaining areas will be safe for residents.</p><p>Quebec wildfire rages</p><p>Meanwhile, in Quebec, another northern town was evacuated Saturday due to an out of control wildfire as the federal government confirmed that Canadian Forces personnel would be deployed to help combat forest fires in the province.</p><p>About 2,000 residents of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, about 620 km northwest of Montreal, were the latest to receive a mandatory evacuation notice on Friday evening due to forest fires nearby.</p><p>Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon Mayor Guy Lafreni\u00e8re said Saturday saying the fire continued to threaten the municipality even though its spread had slowed overnight. There was heavy smoke throughout the town and forest fire prevention teams were doing trenchwork in the area to protect it. Residents were relocated to Senneterre, about 90 km south of the community.</p><p>In the North Shore community of Sept-\u00celes, where a state of emergency was declared Friday morning, an evacuation order for residents of certain sectors of town remained in place. It was the same in the nearby Innu community of Mani-Utenam, where 1,500 residents belonging to the Uashat Mak Mani-utenam First Nation have been relocated.</p><p>The two wildfires threatening the area remained largely stable. Sept-\u00celes Mayor Steeve Beaupr\u00e9 said no new evacuations were planned, but residents of one sector remained on alert. About 5,000 people were forced from their homes as a precaution in the city about 890 km northeast of Montreal.</p><p>Meanwhile, members of the Anishinaabe community of Lac-Simon in the Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue region also had to evacuate on Saturday.

What is more irresponsible is the government making a multibillion-dollar commitment without a good understanding of full cost, timing and feasibility. Ontario electricity consumers, who will be paying for this seemingly blank cheque approach, deserve better. </p><p><br/><br/> Jeffrey Levitt, Toronto<br/><br/> Think outside<br/><br/> the box for refugee housing<br/><br/> Trudeau government announces $362.4 million in new refugee supports, Jan. 31<br/><br/> An immediate solution to the refugee housing issue would be to encourage and promote safe and legal rooming houses. The inspection and approval process could be improved and it could be set up so that the interests of property owners would be protected through adequate insurance and financial incentives. Ideally these rooming houses would be close to public transit. Empty buildings (such as office towers with vacancies) should also be considered for housing. The $362.4 million from the federal government for shelter refugees could be used to support these initiatives.<br/><br/> Brian O'Sullivan, Stouffville<br/><br/> Police chief budget spin misleading<br/><br/> Toronto police chief: Invest in front-line officers to keep Toronto safe, Feb. 1<br/><br/> Toronto police Chief Myron Demkiw is misleading us. He points out there are 1.4 million emergency calls to 911 a year, but does not say the majority of 911 calls do not involve violence and can be dealt with by community and social workers. He says that more officers equal less crime, but years of research has shown that the crime rate does not correlate to police spending in any consistent way.<br/><br/> Toronto is one of the safest cities in North America. The key to crime prevention is through reducing inequality. To reduce response times, we need better management of the 911 service, diversion of nonpolice calls and smarter deployment. But no, our police leadership doesn't want to follow evidence. If they truly cared about our safety and well-being, they would support investment in stronger community and social supports. That is how we'll get to a safer and thriving Toronto.<br/><br/> Anna Willats, Toronto<br/><br/> Rather than attempting to intimidate the residents of Toronto by writing of facts without nuance, our police chief Myron Demkiw should be looking for the means to make his force more efficient and effective. I suggest Premier Doug Ford, who can always be counted on to have an interest in city spending, be brought in to root out the waste in the police budget.<br/><br/> Peter Pinch, Toronto<br/><br/> How can Myron Demkiw be permitted to tease about our safety if he doesn't get his way? The rest of us must live within our means and yet, this public servant sees fit to pressure tax payers for more money through the public media. This is a tactic of a dictator, not a police chief. We obviously need to find a replacement.<br/><br/> Dave De Sylva, Milton<br/><br/> There was an interesting contrast of articles from columnist Edward Keenan and Toronto police Chief Myron Demkiw regarding the police budget. What struck me was how the chief says how terrible things are in the service and somehow a loss of $12.6 million is a major threat to our safety. If the biggest city in the country is at risk of chaos due to the lack of $12.6 million it is time for the politicians to demand that a third-party independent forensic team review police service spending from top to bottom to see the truth of the matter. <br/><br/> Len Bulmer, Aurora<br/><br/> Suspended officers take too much of budget<br/><br/> City budget spinning from police could be a big problem: Keenan, Jan. 31<br/><br/> Here we go again with all the ballyhoo about the police budget. What I would like to know is how much of the budget is slated to be paid to suspended officers who are sitting on their butts at home while collecting a full pay cheque? It is long overdue for the mayor to ask the powers to be to provide a complete breakdown of the monies paid out to suspended cops over the years and to ask how many inevitably had to leave the service yet walked away with thousands of unearned money from taxpayers. The Police Services Act is long overdue for an overhaul especially in these trying times when citizens cannot afford the basics of life.<br/><br/> I have said it before: if an officer is on paid leave, put their earnings into an interest generating trust account. He or she gets the money if they return to service, and if not, those funds are redirected to the police force. It is a simple solution to a long-standing problem.<br/><br/> Larry Snow, Oakville<br/><br/> Toronto's climate change fight in Chow's hands<br/><br/> Toronto is losing its fight against climate change amid budget squeeze, Jan. 30<br/><br/> This recent piece on Toronto's 2024 budget says that the city has fallen off track to reach its stated goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040. I would contend that it was not really on this track to begin with. When the TransformTO Net Zero Strategy was voted on in 2021, the will was there, but the necessary money had not been allotted and has not been since. I deputed to this effect in the public budget consultations last year and the previous year, while I was living in Toronto. Nevertheless, this year's budget is far and away the most encouraging one that I have seen in recent years. <br/><br/> I encourage Mayor Olivia Chow and all of council to keep the city's stated climate goals as a top priority, and to continue to work toward the laudable targets set forward in the TransformTO plan. All of Ontario needs to do a better job of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. I look to Chow and her team to be leaders on this front.<br/><br/> Mary Blake Rose, London, Ont.<br/><br/> It's one thing to set a target, but council needs to put their money where their mouth is. It's time to be proactive about climate change by funding it now. Climate change is literally and figuratively a forest fire. I can't think of many fires that become cheaper to put out the longer you ignore them.<br/><br/> Tori Slobodzian, Calgary <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2024020270489557</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B7N-SD61-F197-50PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1043\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

He warned the blaze was far from out and embers could still hide deep in places where the rain doesn't penetrate, causing a risk of reignition.<br/><br/> \"We could be here for weeks, we could be here for a couple of months before the incident commander is comfortable in saying this fire is out,\" he said.<br/><br/> The wildfire that broke out Sunday in the Halifax area raced through a number of subdivisions, consuming about 200 structures - including 151 homes - and forcing the evacuation of more than 16,000 people. Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency Deputy Fire Chief Dave Meldrum says rain has brought relief, but also raises the risk that firefighters could be hurt from slips or falls and makes for difficult working conditions.<br/><br/> \"They're going to be very, very dirty, they're going to be wet, they're going to be cold,\" he said. \"So we welcome this rain but it's going to be a tough working day.\"<br/><br/> Despite the good news, he said it was unclear when the thousands of evacuated residents would be able to return home. The evacuation zone was lifted in some areas that were undamaged by fire late Friday, but Meldrum said there is still more work to do to ensure the remaining areas will be safe for residents.<br/><br/>Quebec wildfire rages<br/><br/> Meanwhile, in Quebec, another northern town was evacuated Saturday due to an out of control wildfire as the federal government confirmed that Canadian Forces personnel would be deployed to help combat forest fires in the province.<br/><br/> About 2,000 residents of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, about 620 km northwest of Montreal, were the latest to receive a mandatory evacuation notice on Friday evening due to forest fires nearby.<br/><br/> Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon Mayor Guy Lafreni\u00e8re said Saturday saying the fire continued to threaten the municipality even though its spread had slowed overnight. There was heavy smoke throughout the town and forest fire prevention teams were doing trenchwork in the area to protect it. Residents were relocated to Senneterre, about 90 km south of the community.<br/><br/> In the North Shore community of Sept-\u00celes, where a state of emergency was declared Friday morning, an evacuation order for residents of certain sectors of town remained in place. It was the same in the nearby Innu community of Mani-Utenam, where 1,500 residents belonging to the Uashat Mak Mani-utenam First Nation have been relocated.<br/><br/> The two wildfires threatening the area remained largely stable. Sept-\u00celes Mayor Steeve Beaupr\u00e9 said no new evacuations were planned, but residents of one sector remained on alert. About 5,000 people were forced from their homes as a precaution in the city about 890 km northeast of Montreal.<br/><br/> Meanwhile, members of the Anishinaabe community of Lac-Simon in the Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue region also had to evacuate on Saturday. Community members relocated to Val-d'Or due to poor air quality in the community. <br/><br/>Quebec forest fire prevention organization SOPFEU reported there were 134 active fires in the province, including about 20 that rated as priorities because they threaten residences or infrastructure.<br/><br/> \"Our weather experts are announcing the same type of weather over the next few days,\" a SOPFEU spokesperson said. \"There may be some rain coming in on Tuesday or Wednesday, that's still pretty far away, we're taking it one day at a time, but that is when we may get a bit of a relief from Mother Nature.\"<br/><br/>Alberta state of emergency ends<br/><br/> A provincewide state of emergency that was declared nearly a month ago to deal with unprecedented wildfires ended early Sunday at midnight. Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Services Mike Ellis said Saturday that the wildfire situation in Alberta remains serious but, overall, things have improved significantly and it's anticipated they will continue to improve.<br/><br/> He said support will not stop for communities affected by active wildfires, including Fort Chipewyan, which remains evacuated due to a large fire burning about seven kilometres away. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023060468083452</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CV-P4F1-F197-50PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Then the kid steps on a platform and the ball goes even higher.<br/><br/> \"Think of climate change as putting a platform underneath those temperatures and raising them. When El Ni\u00f1o hits, those warm temperatures are warmer than usual.\" <br/><br/> Of course, less Great Lakes ice cover means more lake effect snow, as cold winds blow across open water, pick up moisture and produce mega-dumps in snow belt areas like Buffalo, N.Y., and Canadian counterparts. <br/><br/> \"Last winter was mild,\" says McLeman. \"This one is shaping up to be even milder. But that doesn't mean we won't get one of those polar vortex events that happen from time to time, where a big band of Arctic air comes pushing down.<br/><br/> He laughs. \"Expect extreme weather this winter. It's going to be up and down like a toilet seat.\"<br/><br/> The effect, he says, will be both positive and negative.<br/><br/> Positive:<br/><br/> \\x95 lower heating bills, less shovelling. <br/><br/> \"Obviously your heating bill isn't as high when it's milder, so nobody's complaining about that. And there's less snow to shovel. And with more ice you have more slips and falls.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 Extended commercial shipping season.<br/><br/> \"Obviously, the less ice that forms on the Great Lakes, the earlier they can open up to shipping in the springtime.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 More outdoor employment:<br/><br/> \"There are certain industries that benefit - folks who work outdoors, who do construction.\"<br/><br/> Negative:<br/><br/> \\x95 Shoreline erosion.<br/><br/> \"Think of ice as a protective skin over the water,\" says McLeman. \"When it's not there and winter storms blow, it just whips up waves, pounds the shoreline and causes a lot of beach erosion. People with cottages along the lake are going to be worried about that for sure.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 Ecological destruction.<br/><br/> \"The ice protects fish eggs and juvenile fish sheltering underneath. Where there's no ice cover, they're exposed. There are a lot of species, like perch in Lake Erie, whose populations tend to suffer.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 More algae blooms in summer, some of them toxic, and more invasive species.<br/><br/> \"Ecologically, we're seeing the spread of things like Lyme disease into Ontario along with invasive species, both plants and animals. All have impacts.\" <br/><br/> \\x95 Forest fire risks.<br/><br/> \"The fire season we had this past year was just off the charts. Unfortunately, another consequence of this mild winter is that we might be in for another bad fire season, especially if we get a dry spring.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 Dearth of ice fishing.<br/><br/> \"In a nice cold winter, there are a lot of ice fishing huts out on Lake Erie and the Bay of Quinte. There won't be any out there right now, that's for sure.\" <br/><br/> \\x95 Downsizing of winter sports.<br/><br/> \"They're an endangered species. If you want to ride snowmobile trails, you have to go north of Parry Sound. In cottage country, the folks who live there year round are buying ATVs, not putting their money into snow machines.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 precarious backyard rinks.<br/><br/> \"A few people have started to flood around here. But again, it's looking pretty bleak. They've been getting hammered one winter after another.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 Municipal road repairs:<br/><br/> \"A nice cold winter is actually easy on road budgets, because everything freezes solid,\" notes McLeman.<br/><br/> \"They run a few snow plows down the streets and that's it. But with these freeze/thaw cycles, the roadbeds break down after they salt and sand the heck out of things, and the budget tends to go up. Plus fixing all those potholes in the spring.\"<br/><br/> If there's one word that sums up the trend toward warmer winters, it's \"trade-offs.\"<br/><br/> \"The impacts are going to be complicated,\" says McLeman. \"There's going to be winners and losers.\" <br/><br/> The important thing, says fellow climate expert Grant Gunn, is to go with the flow. <br/><br/> \"We have to temper our expectations to the reality we're living in,\" says the assistant professor of geography and environmental management prof at the University of Waterloo. <br/><br/> \"It's all relative, right? We're all wearing shorts in five degree weather by March, and really big parkas in October when it gets to be two degrees.<br/><br/> \"It's all about living in the reality you're currently in.\"<br/><br/> Joel Rubinoff is a reporter and columnist at the Waterloo Region Record.

Then the kid steps on a platform and the ball goes even higher.<br/><br/> \"Think of climate change as putting a platform underneath those temperatures and raising them. When El Ni\u00f1o hits, those warm temperatures are warmer than usual.\" <br/><br/> Of course, less Great Lakes ice cover means more lake effect snow, as cold winds blow across open water, pick up moisture and produce mega-dumps in snow belt areas like Buffalo, N.Y., and Canadian counterparts. <br/><br/> \"Last winter was mild,\" says McLeman. \"This one is shaping up to be even milder. But that doesn't mean we won't get one of those polar vortex events that happen from time to time, where a big band of Arctic air comes pushing down.<br/><br/> He laughs. \"Expect extreme weather this winter. It's going to be up and down like a toilet seat.\"<br/><br/> The effect, he says, will be both positive and negative.<br/><br/> Positive:<br/><br/> \\x95 lower heating bills, less shovelling. <br/><br/> \"Obviously your heating bill isn't as high when it's milder, so nobody's complaining about that. And there's less snow to shovel. And with more ice you have more slips and falls.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 Extended commercial shipping season.<br/><br/> \"Obviously, the less ice that forms on the Great Lakes, the earlier they can open up to shipping in the springtime.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 More outdoor employment:<br/><br/> \"There are certain industries that benefit - folks who work outdoors, who do construction.\"<br/><br/> Negative:<br/><br/> \\x95 Shoreline erosion.<br/><br/> \"Think of ice as a protective skin over the water,\" says McLeman. \"When it's not there and winter storms blow, it just whips up waves, pounds the shoreline and causes a lot of beach erosion. People with cottages along the lake are going to be worried about that for sure.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 Ecological destruction.<br/><br/> \"The ice protects fish eggs and juvenile fish sheltering underneath. Where there's no ice cover, they're exposed. There are a lot of species, like perch in Lake Erie, whose populations tend to suffer.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 More algae blooms in summer, some of them toxic, and more invasive species.<br/><br/> \"Ecologically, we're seeing the spread of things like Lyme disease into Ontario along with invasive species, both plants and animals. All have impacts.\" <br/><br/> \\x95 Forest fire risks.<br/><br/> \"The fire season we had this past year was just off the charts. Unfortunately, another consequence of this mild winter is that we might be in for another bad fire season, especially if we get a dry spring.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 Dearth of ice fishing.<br/><br/> \"In a nice cold winter, there are a lot of ice fishing huts out on Lake Erie and the Bay of Quinte. There won't be any out there right now, that's for sure.\" <br/><br/> \\x95 Downsizing of winter sports.<br/><br/> \"They're an endangered species. If you want to ride snowmobile trails, you have to go north of Parry Sound. In cottage country, the folks who live there year round are buying ATVs, not putting their money into snow machines.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 precarious backyard rinks.<br/><br/> \"A few people have started to flood around here. But again, it's looking pretty bleak. They've been getting hammered one winter after another.\"<br/><br/> \\x95 Municipal road repairs:<br/><br/> \"A nice cold winter is actually easy on road budgets, because everything freezes solid,\" notes McLeman.<br/><br/> \"They run a few snow plows down the streets and that's it. But with these freeze/thaw cycles, the roadbeds break down after they salt and sand the heck out of things, and the budget tends to go up. Plus fixing all those potholes in the spring.\"<br/><br/> If there's one word that sums up the trend toward warmer winters, it's \"trade-offs.\"<br/><br/> \"The impacts are going to be complicated,\" says McLeman. \"There's going to be winners and losers.\" <br/><br/> The important thing, says fellow climate expert Grant Gunn, is to go with the flow. <br/><br/> \"We have to temper our expectations to the reality we're living in,\" says the assistant professor of geography and environmental management prof at the University of Waterloo. <br/><br/> \"It's all relative, right? We're all wearing shorts in five degree weather by March, and really big parkas in October when it gets to be two degrees.<br/><br/> \"It's all about living in the reality you're currently in.\"<br/><br/> Joel Rubinoff is a reporter and columnist at the Waterloo Region Record.

We need to have more resources available to react quickly and effectively.</p><p>And Canada's military has helicopters that are being used mostly to prepare for war. Although this is a necessary and difficult task, during heavy forest fire season, these resources could be better used for fighting the more dangerous and potentially immense forest fires.</p><p>Helicopters may be used with buckets or belly tanks and other uses. The skill to do these tasks is similar to military tasks.</p><p>A very experienced pilot who also flew water bombers in B.C. for 10 years, Peter Lauren, has tried to convince the federal and provincial government to implement this idea for many years. The governments have given him little or no response.</p><p>Understandably, it will not be easy to accomplish this. The military will be reluctant because they are heavily tasked, understaffed and underfunded.</p><p>The federal government will be reluctant because forests are a provincial responsibility. And the provinces are often reluctant to ask for support from the federal government. But perhaps this could be accomplished to work smoothly through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>In order to convince the governments to do this, the public has to contact many different politicians and officials to show support for an idea that is overdue for implementation.

It ends on Oct. 31. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">People who deem it necessary to burn grass must submit a written burn plan to the department, have an inspection beforehand, and receive a written permit. </p><p>Asked if he had advice for anyone setting a grass fire, Woodstock Fire Department Chief Harold McLellan offered a two-word response. </p><p>\"Don't burn.\" </p><p>The fire chief said grass fires generally do more harm than good, starting with burning nitrogen off the ground.  </p><p>Grass fires are generally more about appearance than practical benefits, he said.  </p><p>\"I guess green looks better on black than it does on brown,\" McLellan said.  </p><p>McLellan said DNR could issue substantial fines for burning without a permit, and the individual who started the fire could be held responsible for any damage. Those costs could prove significant.  </p><p>He said fires could spread quickly into the property owner's or neighbouring buildings, leaving the firestarter on the hook for damages.  </p><p>McLellan warned a calm, dry day with apparently good burning conditions could change quickly, allowing a blaze to get out of control quickly.  </p><p>\"A burning fire can create its own updraft,\" McLellan explained.  </p><p>He advised anyone planning any outdoor fire to contact the DNR beforehand, adding officials would, in many cases, visit the site and establish a plan.  </p><p>While he didn't have stats on hand, Chief McLellan said he and neighbouring departments respond to supposedly controlled burns that got out of control each spring.  </p><p>While most fire restrictions are provincial mandates, some cities, towns and villages have bylaws restricting burning. The Department of Natural Resources noted it is the responsibility of the public to understand and follow these bylaws. </p><p>Woodstock Mayor Trina Jones said fire regulations, like most regulations, remain unchanged by municipal reform. Even before amalgamation, she said, town restrictions closely followed provincial rules.  </p><p>Jones said provincial fire-ban restrictions encompass the entire province, including municipalities. </p><p>The Department of Natural Resources said the public could access information about fires or where and when they're permitted online or via phone by calling the toll-free burn line at 1-866-458-8080 or visiting the department's website. </p><p>The department said that anyone igniting a Category 1 fire (fires with a diameter of three metres or less) should ensure burning is allowed in that area.  </p><p>Category 2, 3, and 4 fires require a written permit. Applications are available at the department's district offices.  </p><p>The department's fire regulations also include anyone who conducts an industrial operation on forest land. They must possess a valid work permit that specifies the required fire equipment and the location of the operation.  </p><p>A work permit is available at no cost by phoning the appropriate district office. Officers will conduct inspections throughout the season to ensure compliance with industrial operations. </p><p>The department's release explained the liability of any fire lies on those responsible. </p><p>\"Under the Forest Fires Act, if you ignite a fire, you are responsible for it,\" the department said. \"If your fire gets out of control, you may be liable for the cost of fighting the fire and/or damage to another person's property. You may also face penalties and/or fines for violating burning regulations.\" </p><p>Provincial stats report that 214 fires burned 176 hectares of forest land in New Brunswick in 2022.  </p><p>Forest land includes any land outside the boundaries of a city or town, not cultivated for agricultural purposes,  </p><p>on which trees, shrubs, plants or grass are growing.

Then the kid steps on a platform and the ball goes even higher. \"Think of climate change as putting a platform underneath those temperatures and raising them. When El Ni\u00f1o hits, those warm temperatures are warmer than usual.\" <br/><br/> Of course, less Great Lakes ice cover means more lake effect snow, as cold winds blow across open water, pick up moisture and produce mega-dumps in snow belt areas like Buffalo, N.Y., and Canadian counterparts. <br/><br/> \"Last winter was mild,\" says McLeman. \"This one is shaping up to be even milder. But that doesn't mean we won't get one of those polar vortex events that happen from time to time, where a big band of Arctic air comes pushing down.<br/><br/> He laughs. \"Expect extreme weather this winter. It's going to be up and down like a toilet seat.\" The effect, he says, will be both positive and negative.<br/><br/> Positive<br/><br/> Lower heating bills, less shovelling<br/><br/> \"Obviously your heating bill isn't as high when it's milder, so nobody's complaining about that. And there's less snow to shovel. And with more ice you have more slips and falls.\"<br/><br/> Extended commercial shipping season<br/><br/> \"Obviously, the less ice that forms on the Great Lakes, the earlier they can open up to shipping in the springtime.\"<br/><br/> More outdoor employment<br/><br/> \"There are certain industries that benefit - folks who work outdoors, who do construction.\"<br/><br/> Negative<br/><br/> Shoreline erosion<br/><br/> \"Think of ice as a protective skin over the water,\" says McLeman. \"When it's not there and winter storms blow, it just whips up waves, pounds the shoreline and causes a lot of beach erosion. People with cottages along the lake are going to be worried about that for sure.\"<br/><br/> Ecological destruction<br/><br/> \"The ice protects fish eggs and juvenile fish sheltering underneath. Where there's no ice cover, they're exposed. There are a lot of species, like perch in Lake Erie, whose populations tend to suffer.\"<br/><br/>  More algae blooms in summer, some of them toxic, and more invasive species<br/><br/> \"Ecologically, we're seeingthe spread of things like Lyme disease into Ontario along with invasive species, both plants and animals. All have impacts.\" <br/><br/> Forest fire risks<br/><br/> \"The fire season we had this past year was just off the charts. Unfortunately, another consequence of this mild winter is that we might be in for another bad fire season, especially if we get a dry spring.\"<br/><br/> Dearth of ice fishing<br/><br/> \"In a nice cold winter, there are a lot of ice fishing huts out on Lake Erie and the Bay of Quinte. There won't be any out there right now, that's for sure.\" <br/><br/> Downsizing of winter sports<br/><br/> \"They're an endangered species. If you want to ride snowmobile trails, you have to go north of Parry Sound. In cottage country, the folks who live there year round are buying ATVs, not putting their money into snow machines.\"<br/><br/>  Precarious backyard rinks<br/><br/> \"A few people have started to flood around here. But again, it's looking pretty bleak. They've been getting hammered one winter after another.\"<br/><br/> Municipal road repairs:<br/><br/> \"A nice cold winter is actually easy on road budgets, because everything freezes solid,\" notes McLeman. <br/><br/> \"They run a few snow plows down the streets and that's it. But with these freeze/thaw cycles, the roadbeds break down after they salt and sand the heck out of things, and the budget tends to go up. Plus fixing all those potholes in the spring.\"<br/><br/> If there's one word that sums up the trend toward warmer winters, it's \"trade-offs.\"<br/><br/> \"The impacts are going to be complicated,\" says McLeman. \"There's going to be winners and losers.\" <br/><br/> The important thing, says fellow climate expert Grant Gunn, is to go with the flow. <br/><br/> \"We have to temper our expectations to the reality we're living in,\" says the assistant professor of geography and environmental management prof at the University of Waterloo. \"It's all relative, right? We're all wearing shorts in five degree weather by March, and really big parkas in October when it gets to be two degrees.<br/><br/> \"It's all about living in the reality you're currently in.\" <br/><br/> Joel Rubinoff is a reporter and columnist at the Record.

Premier Doug Ford promised not to privatize our health-care system and not to touch the Greenbelt. Both promises have now been thrown into the trash. <br/><br/> We know that hospital operating rooms sit idle frequently because the Ford gang won't provide the funding to operate them full-time. <br/><br/> Please explain, MPP Smith, why your government will fund private clinics to perform operations. Could this be related, in part, to union-busting? <br/><br/> Catherine Shadbolt, High Street <br/><br/> Most don't want <br/><br/> private health care<br/><br/> Referendum on private surgeries a 'stunt': Peterborough-Kawartha MPP Dave Smith, May 26 <br/><br/> A clear majority of Ontarians don't want an expansion of private, for-profit health care in their communities - ours included.<br/><br/> Private for-profit health care preys on the vulnerable when they are at their weakest. Sickness is no time for extracting funds from people. They need compassion and caring. Billing at such a time is monopolistic and cruel. <br/><br/> There is no room for for-profit health care at Peterborough Regional Health Centre. <br/><br/> Douglas MacIntosh, Peterborough<br/><br/> PRHC should weigh in on Ford move<br/><br/> A recent poll showed that an overwhelming majority of Ontarians don't want an expansion of private, for-profit health care in their communities - ours included. There is absolutely no room for for-profit health care at Peterborough Regional Health Centre. <br/><br/> I'm calling on Peterborough Regional Health Centre's CEO to publicly speak out against Premier Doug Ford's plan for for-profit health care and call for reinvestment in our public health-care system for all patients. <br/><br/> Carley Smale, Peterborough<br/><br/> Liberals missed their chance to win<br/><br/>Ontario's Liberals hit rock bottom. Could Bonnie Crombie be their saviour? March 7 <br/><br/> Both the Liberals and the NDP missed a golden opportunity to defeat Premier Doug Ford in the next election when Mike Schreiner (Green Party Leader) declined the Liberal invitation to join their party. <br/><br/> Schreiner is the sharpest knife in the drawer and he saw that being the leader of the Liberal party was not a path to victory. <br/><br/> After the last election, with both the Liberals and the NDP without a new leader, both parties gave into vanity and elected their own leaders rather than taking the opportunity to unite the left under one banner and challenge Ford's Conservative majority. <br/><br/> A unified party under the leadership of Schreiner would have been a formidable foe. As it stands now, both parties have doomed themselves to being also-rans despite Marit Stiles and potentially Bonnie Crombie. <br/><br/> Robert Bahlieda, Newmarket <br/><br/> Military can<br/><br/> fight forest fires<br/><br/> Due to climate change, forest fires are becoming more of a problem every year. We need to have more resources available to react quickly and effectively.<br/><br/> And Canada's military has helicopters that are being used mostly to prepare for war. Although this is a necessary and difficult task, during heavy forest fire season, these resources could be better used for fighting the more dangerous and potentially immense forest fires. <br/><br/> Helicopters may be used with buckets or belly tanks and other uses. The skill to do these tasks is similar to military tasks. <br/><br/> A very experienced pilot who also flew water bombers in B.C. for 10 years, Peter Lauren, has tried to convince the federal and provincial government to implement this idea for many years. The governments have given him little or no response. <br/><br/> Understandably, it will not be easy to accomplish this. The military will be reluctant because they are heavily tasked, understaffed and underfunded. <br/><br/> The federal government will be reluctant because forests are a provincial responsibility. And the provinces are often reluctant to ask for support from the federal government. But perhaps this could be accomplished to work smoothly through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. <br/><br/> In order to convince the governments to do this, the public has to contact many different politicians and officials to show support for an idea that is overdue for implementation. As many people as possible have to contact public servants such as the following and tell them to get this done. <br/><br/> Contact your MPP, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, Public Safety (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:communications@ps-sp.gc.ca\">communications@ps-sp.gc.ca</email>), federal Natural Resources (contact-contactez.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca), the Minister of National Defence (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:DND_MND@forces.gc.ca\">DND_MND@forces.gc.ca</email>) and the prime minister (pm.gc.ca/en/connect/contact).<br/><br/> If we all get together, we can convince our governments to work together a little more to be more efficient and effective. <br/><br/> Fred Trudell and Peter Lauren, Victoria, B.C.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2023060268062409</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CD-RRD1-JDV5-F1KB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 2, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLC5</classCode><className>PRIVATE HEALTH CARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp; COMMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001390</classCode><className>PRIVATIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CY</classCode><className>REFERENDUMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp; ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001812</classCode><className>VOTERS &amp; VOTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>STX001347</classCode><className>POLLS &amp; SURVEYS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX002149</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLC5</classCode><className>PRIVATE HEALTH CARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009T96</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N621400CC</classCode><className>CLINICS &amp; OUTPATIENT SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The evacuation alert stopped at Sparwood Heights Dr.and did not include Whiskey Jack Dr.</p><p>According to Sparwood mayor David Wilks, there were approximately 400 homes on evacuation alert. Forty volunteers went doorto-door in the affected area to deliver news of the alert.</p><p>Residents under alert should have a bag packed and be ready to leave at a moment\u2019s notice with essential items like a government-based ID, medications, money, clothing, personal care items, financial documents, valuables and keepsakes. Each household should have a designated meeting point outside the evacuation area and everyone living at the residence should be registered through the provincial Evacuee Registration and Assistance Tool at ess.gov.bc.ca. Pets and livestock should be moved to a safe area.</p><p>According to B.C Wildfire Service, a fire was discovered on Friday, July 21 in the early evening at high-elevation on a ridge-top. The cause of the fire was environmental, likely from lightening.</p><p>Strong winds pushed the fire downwards away from the ridge-top. On Monday, B.C Wildfire Service listed the span of the wildfire as 150 hectares, which was an increase from Sunday\u2019s 41 hectare estimate.</p><p>Ground crews and heavy equipment resources arrived Monday night. On Tuesday morning they started setting up a machine guard wetline at the bottom of the slope leading up to the ridge to prevent the fire from spreading towards the community. They also began preparing water delivery systems and establishing hoselay. Prior to this, crews were not able to work on the fire directly as the location of the fire made it difficult to access.</p><p>Aerial assistance made a come-back on Tuesday. Helicopters began fighting the fire from above while officers delivered instructions on how best to use aviation resources. Aircrafts were called off during the fire\u2019s initial spread, as there was concern that water-dropping planes would wash burning debris down the steep slope and that helicopters would spread burning embers.</p><p>Residents can expect to see more B.C Wildfire Service personnel and heavy equipment enter the community. Workers are easily identifiable by their red shirts.</p><p>Staff Writer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FREPRS-news20230727PQEA0003757628</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FREPRS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68T6-YNJ1-JD2C-J2R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438278</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"416\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

One room has paintings stacked several deep propped against the walls; dozens in all. Her latest work in progress, which will be displayed at the Ashcroft Fine Art Show and Sale in April, sits on an easel, a palette of richly-toned homemade paints beside it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Always keen to try new things, Petty has recently been working on wood panels using natural pigments that she mixes herself.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cI started buying paint in natural dry pigment form because I wanted to get rid of toxins,\u201d she explains. They have to be mixed with a carrier oil, and Petty\u2019s medium of choice is walnut oil, which was used by artists up until the Renaissance period.</p><p>\u201cAfter that artists began using other oils like linseed, but over time the paint cracks. Walnut oil doesn\u2019t crack. I\u2019ve got to know the colours and love the richness of them.\u201d</p><p>She also started using beeswax in her paints, after an experience in Vancouver that she believes was meant to be.</p><p>\u201cI went to a show in Vancouver that only had one day left in it, so I was meant to see it; it wasn\u2019t luck. The surfaces of the paintings were beautiful; I wanted to touch them. The artist was using beeswax, and for that you have to paint on wood, not canvas, because you need a substrate that doesn\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Petty ordered some wood canvases and began working with the new paints, which also prompted her to move away from brushes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t use them anymore. I use scrapers and sticks, dental tools; I finally found a use for an old credit card. I work in layers, and carve through the layers to see what\u2019s underneath, so it has to be on wood, otherwise I\u2019d poke holes through the canvas.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll think I\u2019m done, but I have to watch them while they dry as the paint is opaque at first, then becomes translucent. It\u2019s very subtle, but it can lose depth as it dries.</p><p>It\u2019s a wonderful way of painting, because I can create really quickly.\u201d</p><p>She demonstrates on the canvas that\u2019s on the easel, using a scraper to apply the pigment. A few strokes and a figure that looks like a birch tree emerges; fitting, as birch trees have been very much on Petty\u2019s mind lately, and figure in her latest solo show, \u201cThey Keep Showing Up,\u201d on at Gallery 635 in Kamloops through June.</p><p>The title comes from something Petty noticed about some of her recent abstract works. They were not meant to be of anything specific, but people who saw them kept saying that they saw birch trees in the paintings.</p><p>\u201cIt was the nature of the pigments and how they were applied; people thought they were birch trees. As an artist I go into shows with some sort of theme in mind, and I told Deb who runs the gallery that I wanted to do a deep dive into some bigger paintings of birch trees.\u201d</p><p>Petty thought the show was scheduled for September of this year, then found it was slated to start in February, which meant she had to work fast. She began reading about birch trees in preparation for her paintings, and became interested in what she learned.</p><p>\u201cThey showed up after the Ice Age, and if there\u2019s a forest fire and their seeds are around they\u2019re the first trees that will re-grow. They prefer soggy climates but they do grow around here; they adapt. And they\u2019re the only tree where you can use every part of it. They\u2019re fascinating.\u201d</p><p>There are 22 pieces on display in the show, most of them new. \u201cI brought a few older paintings where birch trees were showing up but weren\u2019t meant to, but most of them are intentional, and were painted on birch panels.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t use photos, I used my inspiration and childhood memories of Girl Guide camps amongst the birch trees. It\u2019s been a great journey.\u201d</p><p>Petty has been a lifelong artist, doing art all through school. She joined the Ashcroft Art Club in 1983, began showing works in 1984, and within 10 years was doing art almost full time. She and Phyllis Linklater had a gallery at Ashcroft Manor for several years, and Petty was involved in the Painted Ladies gallery in the former Masonic Lodge beside the Opera House in Ashcroft.</p><p>If you haven\u2019t seen Petty\u2019s work at any of those locations, or at the annual art show, you\u2019ll still be familiar with it via the many murals that she has had a hand in creating around Ashcroft and the surrounding communities. These include murals at the Ashcroft curling rink, in the Heritage Park on Railway Avenue, the bison mural created for the film An Unfinished Life, and the paintings on the side of the Ashcroft Legion building, which she did with her son Greg. They were unveiled several years ago on June 6 to commemorate D-Day, with veterans from all around the region in attendance.</p><p>\u201cI had never heard war stories from people who had been there, and hadn\u2019t understood the impact war had on people. In order to do those murals I did some deep dives into history books for images, and got the tiniest glimpse into what it was like.</p><p>\u201cIt was very humbling to have all these veterans in the front row. Then we went into the Legion for lunch and we went to different tables and they told us their stories, some for the first time.\u201d</p><p>An incident that happened during the painting of the bison mural was considerably lighter.</p><p>\u201cWe had been told to be friendly on set to anyone who came up, but I had got really deep into my work and was really concentrating on doing a bison\u2019s muscle. A man came up and I said hi, how are you doing, you\u2019re new in town, and he said yes. I asked if he was having a good time in Ashcroft, and he said he was. I didn\u2019t realize until I got home that I\u2019d been talking to [one of the movie\u2019s stars] Morgan Freeman.\u201d</p><p>Petty has also done murals at every school in the Gold Trail school district, and has worked extensively with children, youth, and teens over the years.</p><p>\u201cKids are wonderful. They\u2019re so excited when they make a mark. I have an affinity with kids, and they do with me. The best thing I\u2019ve done is work with kids and adults. That\u2019s what I love about where my art has taken me.\u201d</p><p>One of those places is Japan, where she has had several shows over the years.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I was invited to Japan it was to paint a mural. I was working on panels with high school students, and Royden\u2019s [teacher and artist Royden Josephson] art room was near where we were working. He said \u2018There are people here from Japan and they want me to go there, do you want to come?\u2019 I said sure, then asked \u2018Why are we going to Japan?\u2019 He said \u2018To paint a mural.\u2019</p><p>\u201cI did seven shows in Japan and have great memories from that. It wasn\u2019t so much taking the paintings and selling them, it was the way Japanese people responded. It\u2019s an ancient culture, and the way they honour and respond to art is different. I watched one lady who went and stood in front of each piece and waited until it \u2018got\u2019 her; then she bowed and tapped her heart.\u201d</p><p>Right now Petty is getting ready for this year\u2019s Ashcroft art show, and also preparing for a public \u201cTalk and Tour\u201d at Gallery 635 from 2 to 4 p.m. on Saturday, April 6, which is open to anyone. She\u2019ll be talking about the process, and individual paintings, but says she\u2019s not sure what it will morph into.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll keep diving into birch trees. I\u2019m still learning, which you always should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey Keep Showing Up\u201d will be at Gallery 635 (at 635 Victoria Street in Kamloops) through June.

While the flames didn\u2019t reach any of the province\u2019s nine Cree communities, cabins, traplines and hunting grounds have been lost, said Lee-Roy Blacksmith, the regional fire marshal for the Cree Nation Government.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of grieving because that\u2019s their land. They were born and raised in the land,\u201d Blacksmith said of the hunters and trappers. \u201cThe food that they gather won\u2019t be the same.\u201d For some, the loss of cabins will be painful, he said in a recent interview, because of \u201call the memories that they built throughout those years.\u201d</p><p>There will also be a financial loss for community members, Blacksmith said. For some, their cabins couldn\u2019t be insured because they\u2019re too old, while others have lost boats and ATVs. Many hunters had to leave so quickly they didn\u2019t have time to properly store geese killed during the recent hunting season, he said.</p><p>In hopes of reducing such losses in the future, Blacksmith is pushing to get more Cree trained as auxiliary forest firefighters.</p><p>This month,70 people have gone through the training \u2014 40 from inland communities where the fires are no longer a threat and 30 from the coastal communities near where fires continue to burn. The last group finished their training last week, he said, and were scheduled to be deployed within days.</p><p>He said it took years to get Quebec\u2019s forest fire prevention agency, SOPFEU, to agree to the training for his people. \u201cWe had to push them, we had to keep asking,\u201d he said. Now he wants to expand it to ensure necessary resources are available.</p><p>Jos\u00e9e Poitras, a spokeswoman for SOPFEU, said she didn\u2019t know why Blacksmith\u2019s earlier requests went unanswered. She said SOPFEU trains auxiliary firefighters in areas where it expects they\u2019ll be needed. For example, she said, this year in the Atikamekw community of Manawan to the south, Indigenous auxiliary received training before the start of this fire season.</p><p>But, she said, the collaboration with the Cree is going well.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230727RDA0003755043</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68T4-MRH1-F0HF-821B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"388\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

This highly anticipated event is held twice yearly and is always well-attended.</p><p>The goal of Reel on the River is to bring to Mission films that would otherwise not likely be seen in local theatres. Each series includes independent, Canadian, and foreign films, as well as a documentary.</p><p>The films are selections from the Toronto International Film Festival, which are then distributed by Film Circuit to small communities across Canada where organizations like Reel on the River host these special film events.</p><p>All films are screened at Mission Silvercity in the Junction Plaza on Mondays at 7 p.m. Series passes may be purchased for $35 at Shoppers Drug Mart in Mission, and at Jazz-Ma-Tazz in Abbotsford. Individual tickets for each film are also available for $10 at the door prior to the film. Please bring cash for your ticket purchases and arrive early for best seating.</p><p>The season opens on Sept. 25 with Past Lives, a Korean-made film and a heart-rending modern romance. Past Lives tells the story of two deeply connected childhood friends who are separated when one of their families emigrates to Canada. Two decades later, Nora and Hae Sung are reunited for a week in New York during which they confront the notions of love, choice and destiny.</p><p>Afire will be screened on Oct. 16 when the audience will meet two aspiring artists setting off on a working holiday on the shores of the Baltic Sea. The two men are forced to share their accommodations with a young woman whose free-spirited nature, along with the alarm of an encroaching forest fire, alter the experience and perspective of each of the new-found friends.</p><p>Blind Ambition comes to the theatre on Oct. 23. This is a delightful documentary about four Zimbabwean refugees who become South Africa\u2019s best and most unlikely sommeliers. Passionate about their craft, the four friends form Zimbabwe\u2019s first national team and set their sights on winning the coveted title of World Wine Blind Tasting Champions.</p><p>Nov. 6 brings to the screen North of Normal, a Canadian film based on the 2014 memoir by Cea Sunrise Person. The film revisits Person\u2019s tumultuous and unconventional childhood while growing up with her teenage mother in a Canadian wilderness commune. As Person becomes a teen herself, she moves to the city seeking a \u201cnormal\u201d life with her mother who is anything but normal.</p><p>The final film of the series will be Driving Madeleine on Nov. 20, when we will follow 92 year-old Madeleine across Paris with a down-on-hisluck taxi driver. As the pair\u2019s shared intimacies coalesce with warmth and humor, a tender bond develops that alters both of their lives.</p><p>Reel on the River is a local, not-for-profit group which donates any proceeds from the film series toward promoting the arts in Mission.</p><p>For further information about Reel on the River and to view film trailers, visit the website at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reelontheriver.ca\">www.reelontheriver.ca</url> or contact the group at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:reelontheriver@yahoo.ca\">reelontheriver@yahoo.ca</email></p><p>Mission Record</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MISREC-news20230922PQWA0003890714</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MISREC2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:697C-8NP1-JD2C-J273-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438231</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"522\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

(CSE: PHOS) (OTC: FRSPF) (FSE: KD0) (\"First Phosphate\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has entered into a partially binding letter of intent (\"LOI\") with Rapid Building Systems Pty Ltd (\"RBS\") of Adelaide, Australia for the development of a Rapidwall Manufacturing Plant in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean Region of Quebec, Canada. Upon acceptance of terms for the supply of a Rapidwall Manufacturing Plant by RBS, First Phosphate will be granted a license for the exclusive sales and marketing rights for Canada to RBS's Rapidwall and Rapidseal products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Rapidwall Manufacturing System would allow First Phosphate to upcycle the clean phosphogypsum produced from its proposed purified phosphoric acid (\"PPA\") plant into building material panels which could be used to support housing for rural and indigenous communities in North America. Rapidwall pilot video can be seen at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/oLw5ji4QWV\">https://www.firstphosphate.com/rapidwall</url> .</p><p>Rapidwall is a prefabricated load bearing walling panel manufactured in a moulding process using glass-fibre reinforced, water-resistant gypsum plaster suitable for use in single, double or multi-storey housing and for commercial and industrial development.</p><p>Rapidwall eliminates the need for bricks, timber wall frames and plasterboard as it serves as both the internal and external load bearing wall, and in turn, reduces the use of more greenhouse gas intensive construction materials relative to traditional building practices. For more details regarding Rapidwall product specifications, including construction details, sound transmission, fire resistance and thermal insulation properties and specifications, please see the rapidwall website at <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/O3ojKf4eKZ\">www.rapidwall.com.au/resources-downloads</url> .</p><p>The Rapidseal Manufacturing System would also allow First Phosphate to upcycle phosphogypsum from its proposed operations into a fire resistant spray plaster (gypsum) for solutions developed against spontaneous combustion and fire-prevention in mining, bio-organic landfill and forestry operations. This segment is especially of interest in northern Quebec and other northern Canadian and American rural areas and indigenous communities given the traditional forest fire dangers in these remote communities. Rapidseal pilot video can be seen at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/PLOvxiVeNB\">https://www.firstphosphate.com/rapidseal</url> .</p><p>\"We are pleased to have tested First Phosphate phosphogypsum and can confirm that it will be able to produce excellent quality Rapidwall building material,\" says RBS General Manager, Ben Lucas. \"This is some of the highest quality phosphogypsum feedstock that we have ever tested, material which does not require the additional purification or neutralization that do most other gypsums from around the world. First Phosphate gypsum can be directly calcined to produce Rapidwall or Rapidseal material to provide additional revenue streams for the Company with minimal processing steps.</p><p>\"Rapidwall and Rapidseal will help to valorise our clean phosphogypsum into products which are vital to rural and indigenous communities across North America,\" says First Phosphate CEO, John Passalacqua. \"This is an exceptional development in our commitment to a circular economy and to upcycling of our waste streams. First Phosphate and the LFP battery segment in North America will contribute to decarbonisation and to a cleaner economy in all ways possible.\"</p><p>Upon completion of its mine, First Phosphate expects to have access to clean igneous anorthosite phosphate-bearing rock in Quebec, Canada that it intends to purify into battery-grade purified phosphoric acid (\"PPA\") for making iron phosphate precursor to support the development of the lithium iron phosphate (\"LFP\") battery ecosystem in North America. The phosphogypsum bi-product produced from the purification of igneous phosphate rock into PPA is expected to produce low-contaminant gypsum bi-product which can be upcycled into Rapidwall or Rapidseal. These high-quality gypsum bi-products have been used broadly in Australia, Africa, Europe, Asia and South America for decades. Now North America will have access to the same approach to a circular economy (a model of production and consumption, which involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible, thereby injecting further revenue into the local economy).</p><p>It is projected that a 150,000 tonne PPA plant could produce roughly 700,000 tonnes of clean recyclable gypsum which, using Rapidwall technology, could be used to build approximately 25,000 stand-alone three bedroom homes every year or 50,000 two bedroom apartment units for rapid deployment into rural and indigenous communities across North America. The Company's access to clean phosphogypsum on a commercial scale is dependent on, among other things, the completion and operation of a mine on one of its properties in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec and the completion of its proposed PPA plant.</p><p>The Company has also granted 290,000 restricted share units of the Company (\"RSUs\") to two eligible consultants of the Company. The RSUs vest in 3 tranches (40% on August 31, 2024, and 30% on both November 30, 2024 and February 28, 2025). The RSUs are subject to the terms of the Company's Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan as approved by disinterested shareholders at the Company's annual and special meeting of shareholders held on August 25, 2023. All securities issued are subject to a hold period of four months plus one day from the date of issuance.</p><p>RapidWall</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/jp1G2c2e38\">https://www.firstphosphate.com/rapidwall</url></p><p>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/208251_da8fa75be44ee9c6_001full.jpg\">https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/208251_da8fa75be44ee9c6_001full.jpg</url></p><p>RapidSeal</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/v1Ypgcbr2v\">https://www.firstphosphate.com/rapidseal</url></p><p>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/208251_da8fa75be44ee9c6_002full.jpg\">https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/208251_da8fa75be44ee9c6_002full.jpg</url></p><p>About Rapidwall</p><p>Rapidwall is a cost effective building material manufactured using plaster produced from natural or by-product industrial waste gypsum which is transformed into durable, load bearing Rapidwall panels suitable for high-rise, residential, commercial and industrial building construction. Rapidwall homes and buildings are now being constructed around the globe. Rapidwall has been earthquake tested, is cyclone and fire resistant, water and rot resistant, load bearing, termite resistant, sound proof and 100% recyclable.</p><p>About Rapidseal</p><p>Rapidseal is a range of Gypsum Plaster products that are utilised in a variety of construction, civil and mining applications. These products replace dangerous PFAS chemical, with safe, inert and cost-effective sprayed solutions. Rapidseal products have been used to address spontaneous combustion in coal mines and stockpiles through the rapid coating of strata so as to seal off gases escaping from the coal while further preventing ongoing spontaneous combustion with negligible impact on the calorific value of the coal. Rapidseal products are also used as lightweight coatings which provide fire protection to structural steel elements used throughout construction industry.</p><p>About First Phosphate Corp.</p><p>First Phosphate is a mineral development company fully dedicated to extracting and purifying phosphate for the production of cathode active material for the Lithium Iron Phosphate (\"LFP\") battery industry. First Phosphate is committed to producing at high purity level, in responsible manner and with low anticipated carbon footprint.

Rapidseal pilot video can be seen at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.firstphosphate.com/rapidseal\">https://www.firstphosphate.com/rapidseal</url>.</p><p>\"We are pleased to have tested First Phosphate phosphogypsum and can confirm that it will be able to produce excellent quality Rapidwall building material,\" says RBS General Manager, Ben Lucas. \"This is some of the highest quality phosphogypsum feedstock that we have ever tested, material which does not require the additional purification or neutralization that do most other gypsums from around the world. First Phosphate gypsum can be directly calcined to produce Rapidwall or Rapidseal material to provide additional revenue streams for the Company with minimal processing steps.</p><p>\"Rapidwall and Rapidseal will help to valorise our clean phosphogypsum into products which are vital to rural and indigenous communities across North America,\" says First Phosphate CEO, John Passalacqua. \"This is an exceptional development in our commitment to a circular economy and to upcycling of our waste streams. First Phosphate and the LFP battery segment in North America will contribute to decarbonisation and to a cleaner economy in all ways possible.\"</p><p>Upon completion of its mine, First Phosphate expects to have access to clean igneous anorthosite phosphate-bearing rock in Quebec, Canada that it intends to purify into battery-grade purified phosphoric acid (\"PPA\") for making iron phosphate precursor to support the development of the lithium iron phosphate (\"LFP\") battery ecosystem in North America. The phosphogypsum bi-product produced from the purification of igneous phosphate rock into PPA is expected to produce low-contaminant gypsum bi-product which can be upcycled into Rapidwall or Rapidseal. These high-quality gypsum bi-products have been used broadly in Australia, Africa, Europe, Asia and South America for decades. Now North America will have access to the same approach to a circular economy (a model of production and consumption, which involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible, thereby injecting further revenue into the local economy).</p><p>It is projected that a 150,000 tonne PPA plant could produce roughly 700,000 tonnes of clean recyclable gypsum which, using Rapidwall technology, could be used to build approximately 25,000 stand-alone three bedroom homes every year or 50,000 two bedroom apartment units for rapid deployment into rural and indigenous communities across North America. The Company's access to clean phosphogypsum on a commercial scale is dependent on, among other things, the completion and operation of a mine on one of its properties in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec and the completion of its proposed PPA plant.</p><p>The Company has also granted 290,000 restricted share units of the Company (\"RSUs\") to two eligible consultants of the Company. The RSUs vest in 3 tranches (40% on August 31, 2024, and 30% on both November 30, 2024 and February 28, 2025). The RSUs are subject to the terms of the Company's Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan as approved by disinterested shareholders at the Company's annual and special meeting of shareholders held on August 25, 2023. All securities issued are subject to a hold period of four months plus one day from the date of issuance.</p><p>RapidWall</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.firstphosphate.com/rapidwall\">https://www.firstphosphate.com/rapidwall</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/208251_da\">https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/208251_da</url></p><p>RapidSeal</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.firstphosphate.com/rapidseal\">https://www.firstphosphate.com/rapidseal</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/208251_da\">https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/208251_da</url></p><p>About Rapidwall</p><p>Rapidwall is a cost effective building material manufactured using plaster produced from natural or by-product industrial waste gypsum which is transformed into durable, load bearing Rapidwall panels suitable for high-rise, residential, commercial and industrial building construction. Rapidwall homes and buildings are now being constructed around the globe. Rapidwall has been earthquake tested, is cyclone and fire resistant, water and rot resistant, load bearing, termite resistant, sound proof and 100% recyclable.</p><p>About Rapidseal</p><p>Rapidseal is a range of Gypsum Plaster products that are utilised in a variety of construction, civil and mining applications. These products replace dangerous PFAS chemical, with safe, inert and cost-effective sprayed solutions. Rapidseal products have been used to address spontaneous combustion in coal mines and stockpiles through the rapid coating of strata so as to seal off gases escaping from the coal while further preventing ongoing spontaneous combustion with negligible impact on the calorific value of the coal. Rapidseal products are also used as lightweight coatings which provide fire protection to structural steel elements used throughout construction industry.</p><p>About First Phosphate Corp.</p><p>First Phosphate is a mineral development company fully dedicated to extracting and purifying phosphate for the production of cathode active material for the Lithium Iron Phosphate (\"LFP\") battery industry. First Phosphate is committed to producing at high purity level, in responsible manner and with low anticipated carbon footprint. First Phosphate plans to vertically integrate from mine source directly into the supply chains of major North American LFP battery producers that require battery grade LFP cathode active material emanating from a consistent and secure supply source. First Phosphate holds over 1,500 sq. km of royalty-free district-scale land claims in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean Region of Quebec, Canada that it is actively developing. First Phosphate properties consist of rare anorthosite igneous phosphate rock that generally yields high purity phosphate material devoid of high concentrations of harmful elements.</p><p>For additional information, please contact:</p><p>Bennett Kurtz, CFO &amp;CAO</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bennett@firstphosphate.com\">bennett@firstphosphate.com</email></p><p>Tel: +1 (416) 200-0657</p><p>Investor Relations: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:investor@firstphosphate.com\">investor@firstphosphate.com</email></p><p>Media Relations: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:media@firstphosphate.com\">media@firstphosphate.com</email></p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.FirstPhosphate.com\">www.FirstPhosphate.com</url></p><p>Follow First Phosphate:</p><p>Twitter: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/FirstPhosphate\">https://twitter.com/FirstPhosphate</url></p><p>LinkedIn: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/first-phosphate/\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/first-phosphate/</url></p><p>-30-</p><p>Forward-Looking Information and Cautionary Statements</p><p>This news release contains certain statements and information that may be considered \"forward-looking statements\" and \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

This research will provide important information to understand how forests and grasslands are changing over long periods of time.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BARSTR-news20210624PRDA0001963764</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BARSTR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:630H-7451-JD2C-J2Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

I walk from the boat launch to the pier. What I see is neglect on the municipality\u2019s part.</p><p>Peach Orchard Trail is full of fallen trees for better than four years ago. Now that they are aged and dried, should a forest fire break out, it will burn out of control. It will no longer be a forested trail and it will have an impact on habitat and the environment.</p><p>The municipality should try working with BC Wildfire Service to prevent this possibility.</p><p>Then, when I get to the boat launch, I see that the municipality has added more lighting and they have done some planting around three memorial benches on the south side of the boat launch. When these plantings are established, these benches will not be accessible.</p><p>When you walk further along the pathway, it is covered in leaves from the fall and winter. Plant materials are impeding the pathway.</p><p>The memorial bench by the pier has junipers growing through it that need to be cut back.</p><p>These issues didn\u2019t happen overnight.</p><p>These benches are not free. They are paid for by individuals or groups and are not cheap. The cost is to cover the maintenance fee.</p><p>Private groups should not be responsible for raising money to restore the pier. It is a public space, paid for with tax dollars.</p><p>So now I ask myself, since the public raised the money to restore it, are we on the hook to maintain it or does it get neglected again? Thank you to everyone who helped to raise the funds to restore it.</p><p>Wayne Good Summerland</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUMREV-news20230504PSSA0003549262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUMREV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6859-DN31-JD2C-J05R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438276</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"267\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

This funding is an important step to support communities in their planning to prevent wildfires and be ready should a wildfire happen near their community,\" federal Indigenous Services Minister Patty Hajdu said in a press release.</p><p>The funding announcement comes on the heels of a Memorandum Of Understanding on wildland fire management that was agreed to last month between the Yukon government and Carcross/Tagish First Nation.

The funds will be allocated to 32 locally driven projects across the territory in 2023. The Yukon government will pony up $850,000 of the total as part of its annual budget for Community Services\u2019 Wildland Fire Management branch. Its funding is earmarked for local FireSmart projects that remove deadfall and other forest fire fuels from greenbelts and undeveloped natural spaces. Meanwhile, Indigenous Services Canada is supporting Yukon First Nations-led FireSmart projects by contributing $700,00 through the Emergency Management Assistance Program. The eight First Nations governments to receive additional FireSmart investments are Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, Kluane First Nation, Kwanlin D\u00fcn First Nation, Liard First Nation, Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation, Ross River Dena Council, Selkirk First Nation and Teslin Tlingit Council.</p><p>The FireSmart program strives to foster expertise in wildfire prevention and readiness within First suppression, fuel management and vegetation clearance techniques, effectively minimizing the severity and expansion of wildfires. \u201cWildfires pose a unique risk in remote and northern Indigenous communities where there are fewer emergency services. This funding is an important step to support communities in their planning to prevent wildfires and be ready should a wildfire happen near their community,\u201d federal Indigenous Services Minister Patty Hajdu said in a press release. The funding announcement comes on the heels of a Memorandum Of Understanding on wildland fire management that was agreed to last month between the Yukon government and Carcross/Tagish First Nation. The agreement promises increased financial and resource support to combat wildfires and more money for local FireSmart initiatives. This spring has seen a swift start to wildfire season, with forests ablaze from British Columbia to the Maritimes. In May, out-of-control fires raged across northern and central Alberta. Quebec is the latest fire hotspot in the country. As of June 13, there are two wildfires in the Yukon.

But then there's a whole host of other key decisions that are made after that that involve our transportation system,\" he said.</p><p>\"That includes the mode of transportation that we use, the route, departure time, where people decide to go and the host communities that might be involved as part of that.\"</p><p>He said the information collected can help figure out whether certain groups need more resources to evacuate, need different methods of communications to encourage them to evacuate or to use certain modes of transportation to leave a community.</p><p/><p>Fire vulnerabilities</p><p>Co-researcher Jen Beverly, who studies wildland fire at\u00a0the University of Alberta, is focusing on the biophysical environment around a community, such as where a fire may ignite and where it may spread.</p><p/><p>That information is then overlaid onto maps showing the road network.</p><p>\"If you have a community, for example, with really limited roads out and ... one of those escape roads happens to be a key pathway for a fire to move into the community, then you can imagine a scenario where you've got a fire moving into town, it's going to block one of the roads out ...

A lot of communities, either because of their size or their lack of time to be able to do it, don't have evacuation plans specifically for wildfires,\" Wong said.</p><p>The project will also look at how the built infrastructure and transportation system could change to help wildfire evacuations and other disasters.\u00a0</p><p/><p>Fire can happen anywhere</p><p>The research started last year and was slightly paused during the 2023 wildfire season to ensure field partners could focus on the real-time wildfire response.</p><p>Beverly said the research is important considering what Canadians saw in the spring and summer.</p><p>\"Fires can happen in places where maybe we haven't had a lot of fire and don't expect it to happen,\" she said. \"What we've learned from this past season is that fire can happen there.</p><p>\"If there's fuel and we're living in an uncertain climate situation, it's possible that any region of the country could experience extended drought, and we saw that in 2023, and when that happens, any fuel can burn.\"</p><p>The project is expected to be complete by early 2025.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadaedmontonresearchwildfireevacuations17031755</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69NN-W541-F03F-K1WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"705\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Forests Minister Bruce Ralston says 433 wildfires have burned 7,620 square kilometres of land since April, which eclipses the province's 20-year average for area burned.</p><p>Key wildfire on Vancouver Island now being held</p><p>An update from the BC Wildfire Service says the blaze that forced the closure of a stretch of a main Vancouver Island highway on June 6 is now classified as \u201cbeing held.\u201d</p><p>The service says that means the roughly two-square-kilometre fire is not likely to spread beyond predetermined boundaries under current conditions.</p><p>It says crews are working in steep, rocky terrain to establish control lines around the fire that sent rocks and trees tumbling onto the route east of Port Alberni.</p><p>Officials say safety concerns along Highway 4, which links Port Alberni, Tofino and Ucluelet with the rest of the region, will keep the route closed until at least June 24.</p><p>A lengthy and challenging detour is being used to allow people and supplies to reach the cut off communities, but it's meant to be used only for essential travel.</p><p>Wildlife an unseen casualty of historic wildfire season</p><p>Experts are sounding the alarm on the effects of this year\u2019s wildfires on wildlife, with large blazes possible reducing or even wiping out some animal populations. </p><p>University of B.C. Okanagan biology professor Karen Hodges says birds are an obvious casualty, with nests, eggs and baby animals unlikely to survive a forest fire.</p><p>Hodges says even if the adult birds escape, they are unlikely to reproduce elsewhere, resulting in many animals not breeding for the entire year.</p><p>UBC researcher Matthew Mitchell says in addition to breeding concerns, smoke from the fire can affect animals\u2019 lungs and change their immune responses and other behaviours.</p><p>Mitchell says while wildfires are part of an ecosystem\u2019s natural cycle, increased frequency and intensity of large blazes are making it harder for the environment to recover, which may lead to the loss of some species. </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 14, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-33dd4e5940994c3a87ce48765db09c5d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68G6-8SY1-JBVR-3052-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"857\"/><timeReceived>07:58 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 14, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

These trees have lived for thousands of years. They've survived dozens ofwildfires[2]already,' Christy Brigham, Chief of Resources Management and Science at Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, told the Visalia Times-Delta.[3] <br/><br/>That very same fire is also responsible for a sequoia that continued toburn and smolder throughout the winter[4]. Even though not all the trees lost were 3,000-year-old giants, even young trees going up in smoke is a huge blow to the health of sequoias going forward. <br/><br/> The Lake Fulmor day use area[5] features a small grove of giant sequoia trees (top center). Forest Service photo by Tania C. Parra, Public Domain. <br/><br/> Sequoias are a treasure from another time <br/><br/>Giant sequoia trees are the most massive individual trees in the world.[6] They grow to an average height of 50-85meters (164-279feet) with trunk diameters ranging from 6-8m (20-26ft). <br/><br/>For centuries, the giant sequoia was known only by the Native Americans and was not seen by European descendants until the mid-1800s. As of today, the oldest known giant sequoia is 3,200-3,266 years old, based on the dating of its tree rings. <br/><br/>Giant sequoias are in many ways adapted to forest fires. Their bark - in mature trees being 3-feet thick - is unusually fire resistant, and their cones will normally open immediately after a fire. <br/><br/>But global warming has changed the natural world in ways that are shocking and terribly destructive. The difference between fires of the past and what happened last year is one of intensity. <br/><br/>Rising carbon dioxide levels have created a much different climate, one that favors explosive fires that can leap between the crowns of trees. The warmer temperatures, along with drought have dried out vegetation - making the forest more flammable. <br/><br/>Last year's firestorm was particularly shocking since the state rarely sees widespread lightning[7] in the summer dry season. The flames also attacked coastal redwoods, another ancient and striking species of tree only found in a few locations in California. <br/><br/> SQF or sequoia complex fire near Cedar Slope.[8] Image - InciWeb, Public Domain <br/><br/> Will the ancient trees survive climate change? <br/><br/>The big question on many scientists' minds today is whether the giant sequoias will be able to survive in our new climate. After all, these ancient trees adapted to a climate of the past. <br/><br/>Thomas Swetnam, an emeritus tree ring researcher at the University of Arizona, said in an emailat the time of the firestorm last yearthat, 'Generally, coast redwoods and giant sequoias now occur in small, isolated groves. Very hot, large, high severity fires could kill many or all trees in some groves. In increasingly warm and dry climates we are not sure if they will regenerate.' <br/><br/>'The precise threshold of climate change (rising temperatures, increasing drought magnitude, etc.) that may cause large and frequent high severity fires burning over entire groves, and the inability of trees to recover, are not known for coast redwoods or giant sequoias,' he added. 'The fact that we are seeing some mortality of 1,000-plus year old trees now in some groves is a warning though that we may be approaching these thresholds.' <br/><br/>The National Park Service recently published new guidance[9] on how the park planners should be getting ready for climate change, including embracing change as part of resource management. <br/><br/>One paragraph stands out,[10] in particular: 'The scope, pace, and magnitude of climate-related changes will continue to present new challenges for the National Park Service, with an accompanying reality that it will not be possible to safeguard all park resources, processes, assets, and values in their current form or context over the long term.' <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> The post One forest fire killed off

In Ontario and Quebec, where lakes are plentiful, the bulk of the work is done with water, either mixed with foam and dropped from aircraft, or pumped from lakes and rivers into hoses that are manned by firefighters on the ground.</p><p>In drier places, such as British Columbia, there's a greater use of fire retardant \u2014 which is placed around the fire's edge \u2014 and preventive burning to strip an area of vegetation that acts as fuel, he said.</p><p>St\u00e9phane Caron, a spokesman for Quebec's forest fire prevention agency, known as SOPFEU, said that while tactics in fighting fires are consistent, the sheer number of fires in his province is forcing the agency to abandon its goal of extinguishing all fires below the 51st parallel.</p><p>\"There are far too many (fires) for us to do that, so at the moment our objective is really linked to the protection of communities, human lives and strategic infrastructure,\" he said in an interview this week. He said the agency's firefighting capacity is about 30 fires at a time. On Thursday, there were 133 fires in the province.</p><p>With resources in short supply, \"our goal isn't necessarily to go until the fire is extinguished, but to contain and hopefully control it to be able to go take care of another fire.\"</p><p>Caron said the first line of attack against a fire is the water bomber aircraft, which can carry about 6,000 litres of water and must pass every 10 to 12 minutes to be effective.</p><p>However, he said the aircraft can only help contain a fire. It's the firefighters on the ground who extinguish a blaze, not only above ground with hoses but underground as well. That is done using a tool known as a Pulaski, similar to an axe, to dig into spots where the fire is hiding beneath the surface.</p><p>The biggest challenge in the current situation, he said, is that fires are happening simultaneously in several provinces at once, straining resources that are usually shared between provinces and forcing agencies to look abroad for reinforcements.</p><p>Roger Collet, wildfire management officer with the New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources, says fire efforts start by finding a spot that provides a good escape route, and then attacking the fire on its flanks before moving to the head.</p><p>He said that while tactics haven't changed substantially in recent years, they're being constantly refined by improvements in the technology that helps predict and monitor fires. Drones, for example, offer a cheaper and easier way to keep tabs on a fire than helicopters. \"They're always tweaking the technology,\" he said.</p><p>The experts agree that when a fire is advancing, workers may have to fall back and focus on building defences to protect homes, businesses and critical infrastructure, such as communications towers. That can be done by using a bulldozer to raze a section of land and create a firebreak near the structures, or through a preventive burn of the vegetation.</p><p>Both Caron and Cowan say the main danger to firefighters is not being encircled by the fire, which is closely monitored, but rather injuries from falling trees, falls or heatstroke. The work is very demanding for firefighters, who have to contend with heat from the fires, mud and water, and difficult terrain.</p><p>\"You're walking through the bush, which is logs laying there and hills and rocks,\" he said. \"It's not like walking on a city block, I'll tell you, it's very demanding and it's hot.\"</p><p>He notes that a fire is not considered fully \"out\" until firefighters can walk all the way to the centre of a burned area and ensure there are no more hot spots that could reignite and start another fire.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 9, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-066dcdbfce904512a21e6f90564af83f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DX-G031-JBVR-33TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><timeReceived>04:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 9, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Assay results are reported herein for four of the deepest holes drilled to date in the Eagle Zone. The Property is road accessible and located 4 kilometres (\" km\") east of the village of Gold Bridge, and 10 km north of the historic Bralorne-Pioneer Gold Mining Camp which has produced over 4 million ounces of gold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Assay results reported in Table 1 are from the first four Eagle Zone drill holes completed in 2023. Highlight intersections are shown on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/YYYOXsnOr8\">longitudinal section on Figure 1</url> . This 2023 Eagle Zone drilling is testing for down-dip extensions of mineralization in the footwall of the Royal Shear fault that is blind to surface. Three of the four drill holes reported herein have intersected significant gold mineralization. Highlights include:</p><p>DDH23-069 drilled at -45 degrees returned four intersections. The most significant intersection was 15.68 gpt gold over 2.8 metres (\" m\") including 51.9 gpt gold over 0.5 m commencing at 168.6 m downhole depth.</p><p>DDH23-070 drilled at -45 degrees returned six intersections commencing at 194 m downhole depth. The most significant intersection was 7.91 gpt gold over 3.7 m including 11.73 gpt gold over 1.2 m. Mineralization was intersected to a downhole depth of 284 m which is one of the deepest confirmed intersections to date at the Eagle Zone.</p><p>DDH23-067 drilled at -45 degrees returned two intersections of 1.15 gpt gold over 19.8 m and 3.0 gpt gold over 11.2 m, commencing at 126.2 m and 190.7 m downhole, respectively.</p><p>Drilling has now been conducted at the Diplomat, Imperial and Eagle Zones with fourteen (14) holes completed in 2023 for over 4,000 m of the ongoing 15,000 m program.</p><p>\"We are pleased to see the Eagle Zone expand at depth as we continue to probe for blind mineralization in the footwall of the Royal Shear fault. The success of this initial drilling continues to demonstrate the strength of the Eagle Zone system. We look forward to continued expansion with the current planned drill program,\" stated Robert T. Boyd, CEO of Endurance Gold Corporation.</p><p>Recent drilling demonstrates that the Eagle Zone mineralization continues to significant depth, and remains open to extension at depth and along strike. The four reported drillholes successfully intersected Eagle Zone mineralization along a 150 m strike length and extended the down-dip plunge of Eagle by approximately 180 m. Preliminary results from these deeper drillholes indicate that two dominant mineralized structures exist down-dip of the Eagle Zone. Ongoing drilling is testing the importance and continuity of these two structures which appear to be sub-parallel and separated by 60 to 80 m. Drilling also continues to intersect wide zones of quartz veining with mineralized cataclastite breccias along the margins of these veins.</p><p>Since 2021, the Company has completed 70 diamond drill holes on the Reliance Property with 47 of these drill holes returning significant intersections of greater than 3 m width with grades exceeding 3.4 gpt gold, and fourteen (14) of these drill holes with excellent intersections as summarized on Table 2.</p><p>Forest Fire Update</p><p>A forest fire near the Company's crew house near Gun Lake has resulted in the required evacuation of drill crews and other residents from the area on August 1 st. As a result, drilling has been temporarily suspended at the project site, which is not subject to the evacuation order. Core samples have been submitted and assay results are pending. Drilling is expected to resume when the evacuation order is lifted and when it is deemed safe to return to work.</p><p>Endurance Gold Corporation is a company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of highly prospective North American mineral properties with the potential to develop world-class deposits.</p><p>ENDURANCE GOLD CORPORATION</p><p>Robert T.

Drilling was completed with HQ &amp; NQ size tools capable of collecting 4.76 centimetre diameter core. NQ drill core was cut using a diamond saw with one half of the core sent for analysis and the remaining kept for future studies. All drill core samples have been submitted to ALS Global in North Vancouver, BC, an ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accredited laboratory, where they are crushed to 70% &lt;2 mm then up to 250 gram pulverized to &lt;75 microns. Samples are then submitted for four-acid digestion and analyzed for 48 element ICP-MS (ME-MS61) and gold 30g FA ICP-AES finish (AU-ICP21). Over limit samples returning greater than 10 parts per million (\" ppm\") gold are re-analyzed by Au-GRA21 methodology and over limit antimony returning greater than 10,000 ppm Sb are re-analyzed by Sb-AA08 methodology. Endurance Gold monitors QA/QC by inserting blanks, certified standards and pulp duplicates into the sample stream.

Assay results are reported herein for four of the deepest holes drilled to date in the Eagle Zone. The Property is road accessible and located 4 kilometres (\"km\") east of the village of Gold Bridge, and 10 km north of the historic Bralorne-Pioneer Gold Mining Camp which has produced over 4 million ounces of gold.</p><p>Assay results reported in Table 1 are from the first four Eagle Zone drill holes completed in 2023. Highlight intersections are shown on the longitudinal section on Figure 1. This 2023 Eagle Zone drilling is testing for down-dip extensions of mineralization in the footwall of the Royal Shear fault that is blind to surface. Three of the four drill holes reported herein have intersected significant gold mineralization. Highlights include: //st * DDH23-069 drilled at -45 degrees returned four intersections. The most significant intersection was 15.68 gpt gold over 2.8 metres (\"m\") including 51.9 gpt gold over 0.5 m commencing at 168.6 m downhole depth. * DDH23-070 drilled at -45 degrees returned six intersections commencing at 194 m downhole depth. The most significant intersection was 7.91 gpt gold over 3.7 m including 11.73 gpt gold over 1.2 m. Mineralization was intersected to a downhole depth of 284 m which is one of the deepest confirmed intersections to date at the Eagle Zone. * DDH23-067 drilled at -45 degrees returned two intersections of 1.15 gpt gold over 19.8 m and 3.0 gpt gold over 11.2 m, commencing at 126.2 m and 190.7 m downhole, respectively.</p><p>Drilling has now been conducted at the Diplomat, Imperial and Eagle Zones with fourteen (14) holes completed in 2023 for over 4,000 m of the ongoing 15,000 m program.</p><p>\"We are pleased to see the Eagle Zone expand at depth as we continue to probe for blind mineralization in the footwall of the Royal Shear fault. The success of this initial drilling continues to demonstrate the strength of the Eagle Zone system. We look forward to continued expansion with the current planned drill program,\" stated Robert T. Boyd, CEO of Endurance Gold Corporation.</p><p>Recent drilling demonstrates that the Eagle Zone mineralization continues to significant depth, and remains open to extension at depth and along strike. The four reported drillholes successfully intersected Eagle Zone mineralization along a 150 m strike length and extended the down-dip plunge of Eagle by approximately 180 m. Preliminary results from these deeper drillholes indicate that two dominant mineralized structures exist down-dip of the Eagle Zone. Ongoing drilling is testing the importance and continuity of these two structures which appear to be sub-parallel and separated by 60 to 80 m. Drilling also continues to intersect wide zones of quartz veining with mineralized cataclastite breccias along the margins of these veins.</p><p>Since 2021, the Company has completed 70 diamond drill holes on the Reliance Property with 47 of these drill holes returning significant intersections of greater than 3 m width with grades exceeding 3.4 gpt gold, and fourteen (14) of these drill holes with excellent intersections as summarized on Table 2.</p><p>Forest Fire Update</p><p>A forest fire near the Company's crew house near Gun Lake has resulted in the required evacuation of drill crews and other residents from the area on August 1st. As a result, drilling has been temporarily suspended at the project site, which is not subject to the evacuation order. Core samples have been submitted and assay results are pending. Drilling is expected to resume when the evacuation order is lifted and when it is deemed safe to return to work.</p><p>Endurance Gold Corporation is a company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of highly prospective North American mineral properties with the potential to develop world-class deposits.</p><p>ENDURANCE GOLD CORPORATION</p><p>Robert T.

Drilling was completed with HQ &amp;NQ size tools capable of collecting 4.76 centimetre diameter core. NQ drill core was cut using a diamond saw with one half of the core sent for analysis and the remaining kept for future studies. All drill core samples have been submitted to ALS Global in North Vancouver, BC, an ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accredited laboratory, where they are crushed to 70% (2 mm then up to 250 gram pulverized to (75 microns. Samples are then submitted for four-acid digestion and analyzed for 48 element ICP-MS (ME-MS61) and gold 30g FA ICP-AES finish (AU-ICP21). Over limit samples returning greater than 10 parts per million (\"ppm\") gold are re-analyzed by Au-GRA21 methodology and over limit antimony returning greater than 10,000 ppm Sb are re-analyzed by Sb-AA08 methodology. Endurance Gold monitors QA/QC by inserting blanks, certified standards and pulp duplicates into the sample stream.

(AP) \u2014 A lightning strike likely ignited a 2020 wildfire in California's Sierra National Forest, but the U.S. Forest Service said Friday it could not determine an official cause of the fire.</p><p>September's Creek Fire burned 600 square miles (1,500 square kilometers) and spread so quickly that hundreds of Labor Day holiday campers had to be rescued by a series of harrowing helicopter flights. All 214 campers were delivered safely. </p><p>Investigators did not rule out arson and lit cigarettes as the cause, but said there were no illegal marijuana grow sites nearby that could have started the fire. Forest service officials said an \u201cundetermined\u201d status is not uncommon with a fire this complex. </p><p>\u201cInvestigators spent countless hours hiking rugged terrain to determine the cause, interviewed numerous leads, and eliminated multiple potential causes. In the end, lightning remains as the probable cause,\" said Dean Gould, forest supervisor of the Sierra National Forest. </p><p>Fresno County Supervisor Nathan Magsig expressed gratitude for the service completing its investigation but said an undetermined cause makes it \u201chard for the residents and those who lost so much to find closure.\u201d</p><p>The Creek Fire destroyed 853 structures. Fresno County estimates the cost of recovery and rebuilding to exceed $500 million. There were no fatalities. </p><p>Fire officials at the time said they\u2019d never seen a fire move so fast in forestland \u2014 15 miles (24 kilometers) in a day through drought- and beetle-killed timber. The Sept. 4 fire near Yosemite National Park cut off an access road to a popular campground at Mammoth Pool Reservoir where 214 people became trapped.</p><p>Two California National Guard helicopters loaded campers on to their aircraft well beyond normal safety limits given the rapidly deteriorating visibility. On one trip, 102 campers were packed into a CH-47 Chinook twin-rotor helicopter designed for 30 passengers. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-31a554ff33c183ebb7e2b889946f58e1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:635B-PPY1-DY9S-T31S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"319\"/><timeReceived>05:58 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 16, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It was 2.5 kilometres away from Bear Lane Forest Service Road.</p><p>When a forest fire is being held, that means it's not likely to spread under its current conditions. On BC Wildfire Service's website, it states the fire is zero hectares in size, meaning the blaze was smaller than 0.1 hectares.</p><p>Scattered thunderstorms hit the Central and Southern Okanagan on Thursday night. Despite rain from the storms, the recent hot weather and lightning can cause wildfires while high winds can spread the blaze. The fire danger rating in Kelowna is currently 4/5, which means there's a 'high danger' chance of fires starting.</p><p>Scattered thunderstorms are forecast across the Central &amp; Southern Interior today along with moderate winds and occasional gusts up to 60 km/hr. The amount of rainfall accompanying these thunderstorms will be highly variable and therefore difficult to predict. #BCWildfire pic.twitter.com/eh7PRX1tTb&amp;mdash; BC Wildfire Service (@BCGovFireInfo) May 19, 2023</p><p>The Okanagan isn't expecting any thunderstorms on Friday but there is a 60 per cent for them on Saturday afternoon (May 20). According to Environment Canada, many regions of the Interior and the Okanagan will be impacted by smoke in the next 24-48 hours. Because of that, a special air quality statement is in affect. On top of air quality, visibility will also be reduced because of the smoke.</p><p>With a shift in weather patterns, smoke conditions should begin to slowly improve throughout the day on Friday.</p><p>READ MORE: 'We need to be more water-wise': Okanagan chiefs, mayors encourage conservation</p><p>READ MORE: 5 decades of connecting with seniors in West Kelowna</p><p>@<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cunninghamjordyjordy.cunningham@kelownacapnews.comLike\">cunninghamjordyjordy.cunningham@kelownacapnews.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Vernon Morning Star</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VERNON-news20230519PMV4472644</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VERNON2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:688G-YT71-F0HF-841N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"316\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

You could fit about 30 of them across the width of a hair.<br/><br/> At this size, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/06/07/there-are-dangerous-particles-in-the-smoke-were-breathing-it-doesnt-seem-like-any-part-of-the-body-is-safe.html\">PM2.5 can easily sift down through air passages to the depths of the lungs</url>. At that size, it can also pass into the blood, causing a system-wide inflammation that can exacerbate heart conditions and potentially cause cancers.<br/><br/> Those particles are capable of infiltrating almost every organ in the body, said Matt Adams, director of the Centre for Urban Environments at the University of Toronto.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Air pollution harms cognition and mental health</emphasis><br/><br/> Scientists warn that even brief <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/06/27/what-is-smoke-brain-how-air-pollution-can-harm-our-cognition-and-mental-health.html?source=newsletter&amp;utm_source=ts_nl&amp;utm_medium=emailutm_email=6F56498859EB1E39E5CAC2627F7BC1D7&amp;utm_campaign=frst_\">exposure to forest fire smoke and air pollution also has the potential to harm brain function</url>. <br/><br/> Sarah Henderson, the scientific director of Environmental Health Services at British Columbia's Centre for Disease Control, told the Star that studies show wildfire smoke exposure generally lowers brain performance in the short term. People who breathe in more air pollution consistently perform worse on cognitive tests, research shows.<br/><br/> There are fewer studies on the long term impact, but the knowledge around air pollution can be applied to smoke, Dr. Samantha Green, a physician at Toronto's Unity Health, said.<br/><br/> \"We know that particulate matter and other components of air pollution can cause long-term neurological harm,\" Green said. \"For example, there's growing evidence associating long-term exposure to air pollution and an increased risk of dementia.<br/><br/> \"There is also similarly an increased risk of Parkinson's disease from long term exposure to air pollution, and increased risk even of ALS,\" Green continued.<br/><br/> Different risks - such as \"increased prevalence of ADHD, lower IQ scores, increased need for academic support\" - are associated with young children, she said.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How to protect yourself from forest fire smoke</emphasis><br/><br/> Environment Canada advises people to check the Air Quality Health Index and monitor symptoms. People should stop or reduce their activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or if they begin to feel unwell, it adds.<br/><br/> If they're experiencing mild irritation and discomfort, drinking lots of water can help.<br/><br/> Keeping doors and windows shut if the temperature inside a home is comfortable is best, along with avoiding smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming.<br/><br/> Jeff Brook, an associate professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health and Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, told the Star there are many steps people can take to clean the air inside, such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/06/08/this-diy-air-purifier-could-improve-your-homes-air-quality-and-protect-you-from-wildfire-smoke-heres-how-to-make-it.html\">building an air purifier</url> or using a \"state-of-the-art\" portable air cleaner or HVAC system.<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/06/07/wildfire-smoke-best-ways-to-protect-yourself-and-your-family-as-air-quality-worsens.html\">Other steps people can take include wearing a mask outdoors</url> and keeping children, who are considered by experts as being more susceptible to smoke because their lungs are still developing, indoors on particularly poor air quality days.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Considerations for buying a respirator to combat worsening air quality</emphasis><br/><br/> Those who have to spend time outside should wear a well-fitted mask, such as a NIOSH certified or N95 equivalent, Environment Canada says.<br/><br/> As air quality worsens due to climate change, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/06/26/as-air-quality-worsens-due-to-climate-change-is-now-the-time-to-buy-a-respirator.html\">some people have pointed to the use of elastomeric respirators as an alternative to regular pandemic-style masks</url>.<br/><br/> Respirators are \"gas mask\" sized and have \"disc shaped attachments\" on either side of the face that can be changed to clean the air differently, Brook explained.<br/><br/> \"You can have modules that just remove, say, the particles, or modules that remove particles plus some of the gases that can be harmful (and) create odours,\" he said.<br/><br/> While needing such masks and respirators is \"clearly not the way we want the world to go,\" Brook said \"they all provide a benefit in terms of protecting you from what you're breathing in.\"<br/><br/> Especially for people who need to be outside for long periods of time, wearing a really well-sealed mask for several hours can be onerous and may be tempting to remove for some time. In this case, Brook said it may be more beneficial to wear a mask with less of a tight fit as long as it's kept on for the entirety of time spent outside.<br/><br/> With files from Steve McKinley and Kevin Jiang<br/><br/> Manuela Vega is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star's Express Desk.
