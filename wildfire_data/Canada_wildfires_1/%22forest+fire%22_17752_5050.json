Spain and neighbouring Portugal have been particularly affected by forest fires fuelled by heatwaves and drought, blamed on climate change, that have hit southern Europe.  Two firefighters were killed on Sunday \u2014 one in each country, both in road accidents \u2014 taking the death toll to two in Portugal and four in Spain.  Spain\u2019s civil protection chief, Virginia Barcones told public television TVE that 23 blazes were classified as \u201coperational level two\u201d, meaning they pose a direct threat to nearby communities.  The fires, now entering their second week, are concentrated in the western regions of Castile and Leon, Galicia and Extremadura, where thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes.  Residents said they were frustrated with what they regarded as poor preparation and limited resources.  \u201cNo one\u2019s shown up here, nobody,\u201d Patricia Vila, 42, told AFPTV in the village of Vilamartin de Valdeorras in Ourense province of Galicia.  \u201cNot a single damn helicopter, not one plane, has come to drop water and cool things down a bit.\u201d  Signs of the fires were everywhere in the province, from ashen forests and blackened soil to destroyed homes, with thick smoke forcing people to wear masks.  Firefighters battled the flames as locals in just shorts and T-shirts used water from hoses and buckets to try to stop the spread.  More than 343,000 hectares (848,000 acres) of land \u2014 the equivalent of nearly half a million football pitches \u2014 have been destroyed this year in Spain, setting a new national record, according to the European Forest Fire Information System.  The previous record of 306,000 hectares was set in the same period three years ago.  Spain is being helped with firefighting aircraft from France, Italy, Slovakia and the Netherlands, while Portugal is receiving air support from Sweden and Morocco.  But the size and severity of the fires and the intensity of the smoke \u2014 visible from space \u2014 were making \u201cairborne action\u201d difficult,\u201d Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles told TVE.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult, very complicated situation,\u201d she added.  Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes since the wildfires began last week.  \u201cWe had to run away because the fire was coming in from everywhere\u2014everywhere, above us, below us, all around,\u201d said Isidoro, 83, in Vilamartin de Valdeorras.  Across the border in Portugal, some 2,000 firefighters were deployed across the north and centre of the country on Monday, with about half of them concentrated in the town of Arganil.  Some 216,000 hectares of land have been destroyed across Portugal since the start of the year.  Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said the country had endured 24 days of weather conditions of \u201cunprecedented severity\u201d with high temperatures and strong winds.  \u201cWe are at war, and we must triumph in this fight,\u201d he added.  Officials in both countries expressed hope that the weather would turn to help tackle the fires.  Spain\u2019s meteorological agency said the heatwave, which has seen temperatures hit 45 \u00b0C in parts of the country, was coming to an end.  Officials in Castile and Leon said a firefighter died on Sunday night when the water truck he was driving flipped over on a steep forest road and down a slope, days after two other volunteer firefighters were killed in the region.  A Romanian employee of a riding school north of Madrid lost his life trying to protect horses from the fire.  In Portugal, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said a firefighter died on Sunday in a traffic accident that left two colleagues seriously injured.  A former mayor in the eastern town of Guarda died on Friday while trying to tackle a fire. \u2013 AFP.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57484858478</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHW-42G3-RV0X-303N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"690\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CitizenNG.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 18, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Nigeria</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Western Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00097CP</classCode><className>DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D170</classCode><className>BOMBINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp;

Spain and neighboring Portugal have been particularly affected by forest fires fueled by heatwaves and drought blamed on climate change that have hit southern Europe.  Two firefighters were killed on Sunday -- one in each country, both in road accidents -- taking the death toll to two in Portugal and four in Spain.  Spain's civil protection chief Virginia Barcones told public television TVE that 23 blazes were classified as \"operational level two\", meaning they pose a direct threat to nearby communities.  The fires, now entering their second week, are concentrated in the western regions of Castile and Leon, Galicia and Extremadura, where thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes.  Residents said they were frustrated with what they regarded as poor preparation and limited resources.  \"No one\u2019s shown up here, nobody,\" Patricia Vila, 42, told AFPTV in the village of Vilamartin de Valdeorras in Ourense province of Galicia. \"Not a single damn helicopter, not one plane, has come to drop water and cool things down a bit.\u201d  Signs of the fires were everywhere in the province, from ashen forests and blackened soil to destroyed homes, with thick smoke forcing people to wear masks.  Firefighters battled the flames as locals in just shorts and T-shirts used water from hoses and buckets to try to stop the spread.  More than 343,000 hectares (848,000 acres) of land -- the equivalent of nearly half a million football pitches -- have been destroyed this year in Spain, setting a new national record, according to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).  The previous record of 306,000 hectares was set in the same period three years ago.  Spain is being helped with firefighting aircraft from France, Italy, Slovakia and the Netherlands, while Portugal is receiving air support from Sweden and Morocco.  But the size and severity of the fires and the intensity of the smoke -- visible from space -- were making \"airborne action\" difficult,\" Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles told TVE.  \"It's a very difficult, very complicated situation,\" she added.  Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes since the wildfires began last week.  \"We had to run away because the fire was coming in from everywhere\u2014everywhere, above us, below us, all around,\" said Isidoro, 83, in Vilamartin de Valdeorras.  Across the border in Portugal, some 2,000 firefighters were deployed across the north and centre of the country on Monday, with about half of them concentrated in the town of Arganil.  Some 216,000 hectares of land have been destroyed across Portugal since the start of the year.  Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said the country had endured 24 days of weather conditions of \"unprecedented severity\" with high temperature and strong winds.  \"We are at war, and we must triumph in this fight,\" he added.  Officials in both countries expressed hope that the weather would turn to help tackle the fires.  Spain's meteorological agency said the heatwave, which has seen temperatures hit 45C in parts of the country, was coming to an end.  Officials in Castile and Leon said a firefighter died on Sunday night when the water truck he was driving flipped over on a steep forest road and down a slope, days after two other volunteer firefighters were killed in the region.  A Romanian employee of a riding school north of Madrid lost his life trying to protect horses from the fire.  In Portugal, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said a firefighter died on Sunday in a traffic accident that left two colleagues seriously injured.  A former mayor in the eastern town of Guarda died on Friday while trying to tackle a fire.  \u00a9 2025 AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57484514759</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHS-X913-RS9N-S44X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"692\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Japan Today</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 18, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Japan</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00097CP</classCode><className>DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D170</classCode><className>BOMBINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp;

Some 400 residents returned home Friday after being forced from their homes by a forest fire that threatened the city.</p><p>Miller said there have been 85 forest fires in the province's northwest so far this year, only two of which have been caused by lightning, which typically causes more than 60 per cent of forest fires.</p><p>\"We're dealing with human-caused fires,'' he said. Investigators believe the fire near Kenora was started by a passing train and two fires in Nipigon were caused by logging in the area.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199706010037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4706-36D0-01G6-8553-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"340\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>June 1, 1997 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>CANADIAN PACIFIC HOTELS\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFTB</classCode><className>STATES OF EMERGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CA1V</classCode><className>TRAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS169</classCode><className>MANITOBA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS176</classCode><className>QUEBEC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Here are a few observations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">fletcher mug</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00b7 The closure of Highway 97 through the South Cariboo forced northbound traffic to the Coquihalla and up Highway 5 to Little Fort, then west on Highway 24 to rejoin 97 just south of 100 Mile House. Blackened tree trunks are still visible near Barriere and McLure, north of Kamloops, where fires burned for 75 days in 2003, forcing the evacuation of 3,800 people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The one visible roadside scar on the open route from this year's fires was near Williams Lake, where a brush fire ran up to one of the many widening and paving projects underway this summer. The broad construction area acted as a firebreak and only a small spot burned on the other side before the fire was put out.</p><p>\u00b7 Smoke was visible in the Prince George area, but it wasn't until south of Quesnel that the brown haze and strong smell settled in. Air conditions were worst at Kamloops and Merritt, where smoke followed river valleys while trapped in an extended high-pressure system. A haze was still visible when I returned to Victoria, and when I started my car the next day, the smell from the air vents was a reminder of conditions in the Interior.</p><p>\u00b7 Vancouver media went from bad to worse as they grew bored with the struggles of far-off towns and farms. Among many errors by drama-seeking urban outlets, the CBC announced the rescinding of an evacuation order for Princeton, which was never evacuated. Then for days the people's network flogged the story of a back-burn gone wrong on Hart Ridge Mountain south of Clinton, after the wind shifted suddenly.</p><p>The tone of the coverage suggested a reckless, inept effort by the B.C. Wildfire Service, with sound-bites from an angry rancher who went to media instead of filing his damage claim with the province. The unfairness to exhausted firefighting crews seemed lost on them, or unimportant next to the media craving for conflict.</p><p>Worst of all was TV coverage of a family's return to the burned-out mobile home park near Ashcroft. Zoom in on the crying, that's gold for a jaded urban audience. If that's what they put their effort into, they should stay home and do another bike lane story instead.</p><p>\u00b7 Speaking of disaster porn, Al Gore cited the B.C. fires during the Toronto stop of the promotional tour for his latest movie, An Inconvenient Sequel . That's the follow-up to his 2006 docu-drama that predicted an ice-free Arctic by 2014, the breakup of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and other dire events that have not materialized.</p><p>\u00b7 B.C. statistics aren't complete yet, but measuring by area burned province-wide, this year likely won't match the record in 1958. Nationally, Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre statistics show so far in 2017, area burned across Canada is far below 1989, 1994, 1995 and 2014.</p><p>\u00b7 On the NDP government's second political tour of the fire zone, Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth, Forests Minister Doug Donaldson and North Coast MLA Jennifer Rice posed for pictures wearing the red uniform of the B.C. Forest Service.

And we in Castlegar should certainly take heed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Somehow we were missed during the intense heat, the thousands of lightning strikes, and the fires breaking out everywhere. Be very clear about this point - we were simply missed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Certainly, there were fair-sized fires in our Columbia Valley region, one past Nelson and another along the U.S. border. But we in Castlegar came through unharmed by fire. With the relentless rains of the past few days, it doesn't seem possible that Castlegar was on the verge of disaster. Truly, we were absolutely lucky.</p><p>We obviously had horseshoes in all the right places. Our situation vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis the forests is not much different than that of the towns and cities threatened by a fire. Given a different set of clouds and a different array of winds, we might have been faced with flames ready to engulf our homes and businesses. We might have had to evacuate.</p><p>\"That can't be true,\" one friend commented recently. And I replied that our forests come right down to the backyards of many of our homes. If lightning struck to the west of Castlegar and the winds were blowing eastward, the resulting fire would quickly endanger many of our homes. The heavy fuel load beneath the trees would carry the fire into our residential areas so fast we might not have time to protect our properties or even to escape.</p><p>Clearly, large areas of the surrounding forest are laden with debris, much of it tinder dry in summer. Some of this surrounding forest fuel load is on crown land, but a lot of it is private property. While the government occasionally works at cleaning up bits of crown land such as occurred here in Castlegar in 2007 or 2008, it never provides enough funding. At that time, some mitigation happened in the Merry Creek area, but the project ran out of money before all of the work was done.</p><p>I need not remind Castlegarians that the Kelowna fire a few years ago spread across the mountainsides mainly because of the heavy underbrush. On the day that fire started, I was across the lake near Peachland tasting wine and watching small columns of smoke spiralling upward on the eastern side of the lake. Helicopters with buckets of water were being used to attack this small fire because the water bombers were needed elsewhere. Later in the day, the whole mountainside was aflame with the fire moving northward.</p><p>So the fuel load under our nearby forests at Castlegar combined with the excessive heat of the past summer could have been deadly. If the same hot weather without rain continues next summer, it represents a forest fire waiting to happen. One lightning strike and we're goners.</p><p>One barbershop patron I talked with recently emphasized the extreme danger surrounding Castlegar. His idea about prevention was that the City and Regional Districts should build a gigantic fireguard around our city. At the very least, he said, we need some back-burning and clearing out of the undergrowth. This is reiterated by Sarah Breen, Columbia Basin Rural Development Institute spokesperson, who stated that communities need to develop fuel management programs to protect our homes and businesses before the fires start (See West Kootenay Advertiser, Oct. 19, 2017, A17).</p><p>Burned-out homes, stripped-off properties, and shattered lives are features of various B.C. municipalities year after year. Money put into prevention and contingency plans would likely save a lot of anguish in the lives of our citizens. We need to have a safe, protected community - and right now, it's not.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CASNWS-3461547</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CASNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PTP-PT51-JDH3-G475-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"600\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Castlegar News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 26, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Former FBI director James Comey's memoir, \"A Higher Loyalty,\" is to be released next week.The following are excerpts from the 304-page book, which Agence France-Presse obtained ahead of its public sale on Tuesday.President Donald Trump fired Comey as head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in May 2017:- Mob boss -\"As I found myself thrust into the Trump orbit, I once again was having flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob. The silent circle of assent. </p><p>The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth.\"- Hillary Clinton emails -\"I have replayed the Clinton email case hundreds of times in my mind. Other than mistakes in the way I presented myself in the July 5 public statement in front of the television cameras, I am convinced that if I could do it all again, I would do the same thing, given my role and what I knew at the time. But I also think reasonable people might well have handled it different... I have read (Hillary Clinton) has felt anger toward me personally, and I'm sorry for that. I'm sorry that I couldn't do a better job explaining to her and her supporters why I made the decisions I made.\"- The 'kiss' -\"I thwarted the hug, but I got something worse in exchange. The president leaned in and put his mouth near my right ear. 'I'm really looking forward to working with you,' he said. Unfortunately, because of the vantage point of the TV cameras, what many in the world, including my children, thought they saw was a kiss. The whole world 'saw' Donald Trump kiss the man who some believed got him elected.\"- 'Close inspection' -\"His face appeared slightly orange, with bright white half-moons under his eyes where I assumed he placed small tanning goggles, and impressively coifed, bright blond hair, which upon close inspection looked to be all his... As he extended his hand, I made a mental note to check its size. It was smaller than mine, but did not seem unusually so.\"- 'I expect loyalty' -\"With a serious look on his face, he said, 'I need loyalty. I expect loyalty.' During the silence that followed, I didn't move, speak or change my facial expression in any way. The president of the United States just demanded the FBI director's loyalty. This was surreal.... To my mind, the demand was like Sammy the Bull's Cosa Nostra induction ceremony -- with Trump, in the role of the family, asking me if I have what it takes to be a 'made man.'... 'You will always get honesty from me,' I said. He paused. 'That's what I want, honest loyalty,' he said. This appeared to satisfy him as some sort of 'deal' in which we were both winners.\" - Where's the humor? -\"I don't recall seeing him laugh, ever. Not during small talk before meetings. Not in a conversation... There is a risk I'm overinterpreting this... but I don't know of another elected leader who doesn't laugh with some regularity in public. I suspect his apparent inability to do so is rooted in deep insecurity, his inability to be vulnerable or to risk himself by appreciating the humor of others, which, on reflection, is really very sad in a leader, and a little scary in a president.\"- The 'golden showers thing' -\"Unprompted, and in another zag in the conversation, (Trump) brought up what he called the 'golden showers thing,' repeating much of what he had said to me previously adding that it bothered him if there was 'even a one percent chance' his wife, Melania, thought it was true... He just rolled on, unprompted, explaining why it couldn't possibly be true, ending by saying he was thinking of asking me to investigate the allegation to prove it was a lie. I said it was up to him.\"\"That distracted me slightly because I immediately began wondering why his wife would think there was any chance, even a small one, that he had been with prostitutes urinating on each other in Moscow.\"- 'Effective immediately' -\"I was fired, effective immediately, by the president who had repeatedly praised me and asked me to stay... I felt sick to my stomach and slightly dazed.\"\"I took an emotional call from General John Kelly, then the secretary of Homeland Security. He said he was sick about my firing and that he intended to quit in protest. He said he didn't want to work for dishonorable people who would treat someone like me in such a manner. I urged Kelly not to do that, arguing that the country needed principled people around this president. Especially this president.\"- Obstruction of justice? -\"One of the pivotal questions I presume that Bob Mueller's team is investigating is whether or not in urging me to back the FBI off our investigation of his national security advisor and in firing me, President Trump was attempting to obstruct justice, which is a federal crime. It's certainly possible... I do know that, as of this writing, Special Counsel Mueller and his team are hard at work and the American people can have confidence that, unless their investigation is blocked in some fashion, they will get to the truth, whatever that is.\"- Forest fire -\"Donald Trump's presidency threatens much of what is good in this nation. We all bear responsibility for the deeply flawed choices put before voters during the 2016 election, and our country is paying a high price: this president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values. His leadership is transactional, ego driven, and about personal loyalty. We are fortunate some ethical leaders have chosen to serve and to stay at senior levels of government, but they cannot prevent all of the damage from the forest fire that is the Trump presidency. Their task is to try to contain it.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO100903152364359291425176100161</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3J-5YF1-F03R-N3TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1009\"/><timeReceived>6:19 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 13, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00052GB</classCode><className>AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7375 INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000926</classCode><className>INSPECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DJX1</classCode><className>FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922120CC</classCode><className>LAW ENFORCEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001266</classCode><className>ORGANIZED CRIME</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X5W</classCode><className>SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N922130TM</classCode><className>PUBLIC PROSECUTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000CP8E</classCode><className>OPHTHALMIC GOODS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N922130TM</classCode><className>PUBLIC PROSECUTORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>PE000DKTQ</classCode><className>JAMES COMEY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>PE0009THX</classCode><className>DONALD TRUMP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>PE0009TJO</classCode><className>HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Spain is currently fighting 14 major fires, according to Virginia Barcones, general director of emergency services.  \u201cToday will once again be a very tough day, with an extreme risk of new fires,\u201d Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez wrote on X.  Three people have died in Spain as a result of the fires, including two volunteer firefighters. S\u00e1nchez expressed support for the family of the second volunteer, who died in a hospital in Le\u00f3n on Thursday after suffering severe burns. The national weather agency AEMET warned of extreme fire risk in most of the country, including where the largest blazes were burning in the north and west. A heatwave which brought temperatures exceeding 40C on several days this month is expected to last through Monday.  Fires in the Galicia region forced the closure of several highways. The high speed rail line connecting it to Spain's capital Madrid remained suspended.  The fires in Spain this year have burned 158,000 hectares of land, according to the European Union\u2019s European Forest Fire Information System. That is an area roughly as big as metropolitan London.  First death from fires in Portugal  In Portugal, nearly 4,000 firefighters were battling fires on Friday. Seven major fires were active. Authorities extended the state of alert until Sunday as high temperatures are expected to last through the weekend.  In the Guarda district, a lack of resources is hampering efforts to subdue the flames. Fires have spread to the neighbouring municipalities of Pinhel and Trancoso.  In the village of Alverca da Beira, the flames reached an abandoned house. Concern for other neighbouring houses led dozens of people to try to extinguish the fire with their own means. On Saturday, the charred body of the former mayor of Vila Franca do De\u00e3o was found, making him the first fatality of the forest fires ravaging the country this summer.  The Portuguese government had on Friday requested assistance from the EU\u2019s civil protection mechanism, a firefighting force that European countries in need can call upon. A day earlier, Spain received two Canadair water bomber aircraft after requesting EU help to tackle blazes for the first time ever.  In the past week, Greece, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Albania have also requested help from the EU\u2019s firefighting force to deal with forest fires. The force has already been activated as many times this year as the entirety of last year's fire season.  New evacuation orders issued in Greece  On Friday, a wildfire in Greece burned out of control for a fourth day on the island of Chios, prompting several more overnight evacuations.  Two water-dropping planes and two helicopters were operating in the north of the island in the eastern Aegean Sea, where local authorities said a lull in high winds was helping firefighters early Friday.  Following a series of large fires in western Greece earlier this week, the fire service was on alert outside Athens and nearby areas in the south of the country where adverse weather conditions elevated the fire risk. Firefighters in Turkey also continued to tackle fires across several provinces, and many appeared to be largely contained by Saturday.  Scientists say that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness in parts of Europe, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires.  The burning of fossil fuels like coal and gas releases heat-trapping gases, which are the primary driver of climate change.  Europe has been warming twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s, according to the EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service.  The EU monitoring agency says that 2024 was the hottest year on record both globally and in Europe, which experienced its second-highest number of  \"heat stress  \" days.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57468904416</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH9-N683-RSNV-P04S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"702\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>MSN South Africa</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 16, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001TJO</classCode><className>BOMBARDIER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS336411 AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>SIC3721 AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>BBD.A (TSX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>South Africa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEBQ</classCode><className>BURN INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp;

<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com\">http://www.digitaljournal.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  Huge fires are raging across vast swathes of Indonesia's rainforests -- some of the world's biggest -- with toxic smog shutting hundreds of schools across Southeast Asia, officials said Tuesday.Massive jungle areas in Sumatra and Borneo island are ablaze as thousands of personnel battle to quell the fires, frequently started to clear land for crop plantations.Burning forests to make way for farming is also thought to be behind the enormous fires currently ripping through the Amazon in South America, and experts believe they could have a serious impact on the global climate.In Indonesia the number of hotspots -- areas at risk of fires -- has soared in parts, including on Borneo which the country shares with Malaysia and Brunei.Air quality has dropped to \"unhealthy\" levels in and around Kuala Lumpur, according to the government's air pollutant index, and the skyline has been shrouded in thick smog, while haze also hung over Singapore.The smell of burning foliage filled the air, and residents were suffering respiratory problems and complaining of itchy and sore eyes.Around 400 schools were closed Tuesday in nine districts of Sarawak state on Borneo, with more than 150,000 students affected, according to the local education department.In neighbouring Indonesia's Jambi province, on Sumatra, some kindergartens will be closed until Friday, while elementary and junior high schools are also temporarily shut, according to local authorities, who did not give exact numbers.Jambi mayor Syarif Fasha urged residents to wear face masks while Malaysia's national disaster management agency said it has secured half a million masks, which will be sent to the Sarawak state disaster committee.On Monday, Malaysia said it was preparing to carry out cloud seeding to induce rain and clear the air by releasing certain chemicals into the clouds -- although some experts have questioned its efficacy.Indonesian authorities have deployed thousands of extra personnel since last month to prevent a repeat of 2015 fires, which were the worst for two decades, choking the region in haze for weeks and setting off a diplomatic spat.Under pressure from neighbours, Indonesian leader Joko Widodo last month warned that officials would be sacked if they failed to stamp out forest fires.The number of hotspots with medium-to-high potential to break out in blazes soared nearly sevenfold to 6,312 over a four-day period this month, according to Indonesia's national disaster agency.burs-pb/je/kaf </p><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

On Facebook, residents in Labrador City eagerly offered up spare beds, couches and floor space for displaced families.</p><p>Wabush Mayor Ron Barron warned residents they could be away from their homes for some time. The wind forecast for Saturday was not expected to be favourable in terms of speed and direction.</p><p>\"Once you have left, you will not be allowed to return to your property until the state of emergency is officially declared to be over,\" Barron said in a statement.</p><p>\"That could be several days.\"</p><p>Officials issued a precautionary evacuation notice late Thursday after the fire shifted closer to the town. Residents were told at that time to prepare a kit with any medication, extra clothing, cash, bank cards and a cellphone.</p><p>Chuck Porter, a conservation officer with Natural Resources, said residents were complying with the evacuation order without complaint.</p><p>\"We're being very proactive here and putting in a precautionary measure to make sure we can suppress this fire as effectively as possible and, at the same time, protect the residents of Wabush,\" he said in an interview.</p><p>\"We can only predict so much. If there's even a chance of air quality being insufficient in Wabush tomorrow or the smoke or fire coming closer, then that's why we're recommending the measures we are. We certainly don't want to put anyone's safety at risk here.\" </p><p>A fourth water bomber and additional ground help were dispatched early Friday to the area to help fight the blaze. Porter said suppression efforts focused on the part of the fire burning closest to the community. He said the smell of smoke was wafting through the air and soot could be seen settling on vehicles.</p><p>Heavy machinery was also being used to move earth and create a 300-metre barrier known as a firebreak in hopes of keeping the flames away from the community. About 40 firefighters were attacking the fire on the ground.</p><p>\"If the winds are the wrong way tomorrow, then that's when you would get the fire approaching town further,\" said Porter. \"There is potential that it could move, so that's what we're preparing for.\"</p><p>Barron urged curious residents to remain safe and allow firefighters to do their work.</p><p>\"Again citizens must not congregate on vantage points to look at the fire, as roads must be kept clear,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>The fire, which had consumed about 60 square kilometres since Sunday, was prompting intermittent partial closures of the Trans-Labrador Highway. Canada Day festivities planned for Monday in Labrador City were postponed.</p><p>The town said the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary was working with Bell Aliant to repair the phone problem. On its Facebook page, the communications company blamed the issue on a fibre break due to the forest fire. Residents were being provided with alternate phone numbers to report emergencies instead of dialing 911.</p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro was also warning of potential power outages as a result of the fire.</p><p>\"To ensure the safety of customers and the public, electricity service may be temporarily suspended in Labrador West,\" the utility said in a news release.</p><p>\"Our customers are advised to take necessary precautions to prepare for a possible extended outage.\"</p><p>The provincial government also expanded its ban on outdoor fires for forest land in all areas of Labrador because of ongoing hot and dry conditions.</p><p>- By Melanie Patten in Halifax</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-CBBEFF8185C2491886442036495E058F</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58S6-G3K1-JBVR-33P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><timeReceived>09:54 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>June 28, 2013 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The decision to add to the more than 1,400 troops already on wildfire duty came as authorities struggled to contain forest blazes, especially in the northwestern Galicia region, and awaited the arrival of promised aircraft reinforcements from other European countries.  Firefighters are tackling 12 major wildfires in Galicia, all of them near the city of Ourense, the head of the Galician regional government Alfonso Rueda told a press conference with S\u00e1nchez.  \u201cHomes are still under threat so we have lockdowns in place and are carrying out evacuations,\u201d Rueda said. Galicia has been battling the spreading flames for more than a week.  Temperatures in Spain could reach 45 Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some areas Sunday, the Spanish national weather agency AEMET said. On Saturday, the maximum temperature was 44.7 C (112.46 F) in the southern city of Cordoba, it said.  \u201cThis Sunday, when extraordinarily high temperatures are expected, the danger of wildfires is extreme in most of the country,\u201d AEMET said on the social platform X.  The fires in Spain this year have burned 158,000 hectares (390,000 acres), according to the European Union's European Forest Fire Information System. That is an area roughly as big as metropolitan London.  Europe has been warming twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service. Scientists say that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness in parts of Europe, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires.  Spain awaits European firefighters, more planes  Spain was expecting the arrival of two Dutch water-dumping planes that were to join aircraft from France and Italy already helping Spanish authorities under a European cooperation agreement.  Firefighters from other countries are also expected to arrive in the region in coming days, Spain's Civil Protection Agency chief Virginia Barcones told public broadcaster RTVE.  National rail operator Renfe said it suspended Madrid-Galicia high-speed train services scheduled for Sunday due to the fires.  Galician authorities advised people to wear face masks and limit their time spent outdoors to avoid inhaling smoke and ash.  Portugal heads into cooler days  Portugal is set for cooler weather in coming days after a spate of severe woodland fires. A national state of alert due to wildfires was enacted Aug. 2 and was due to end Sunday, a day before two Swedish firefighting planes were to arrive.  As in Spain, Portugal's resources have been stretched. On Sunday, more than 4,000 firefighters and more than 1,300 vehicles were deployed, as well as 17 aircraft, the country's Civil Protection Agency said.  The scorched area of forest in Portugal so far this year is 17 times higher than in 2024, at around 139,000 hectares, according to preliminary calculations by the Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests, a government body.  Greece, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Albania have also requested help from the EU's firefighting force in recent days to deal with forest fires. The force has already been activated as many times this year as in all of last year's summer fire season.  Turkish fires threaten area of Gallipoli memorials  In Turkey, where recent wildfires have killed 19 people, parts of the historic region that includes memorials to World War I's Gallipoli campaign were evacuated Sunday as blazes threatened homes in the country's northwest.  Six villages were evacuated as a precautionary measure, the governor of Canakkale province, Omer Toraman, said.  Some 1,300 firefighting personnel backed by 30 aircraft were battling the blaze, according to the General Directorate of Forestry.  A wildfire on the peninsula to the north of the Dardanelles Strait led to the closure of visitor facilities at Gallipoli, the site's management said. The area is dotted with cemeteries, memorials and other remnants of battles waged between Ottoman and Allied troops in 1915.  Turkey has been struck by hundreds of fires since late June, fueled by record-breaking temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds.

A severe 16-day-long heatwave has fuelled around 20 wildfires, burning more than 115,000 hectares in the regions of Galicia and Castile and Leon over the past week. Flames have spread to the southern slopes of the Picos de Europa mountain range and the famous Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route.  A firefighter died when his truck crashed near the village of Espinoso de Compludo, raising the death toll to four from the recent wave of fires.  In neighbouring Portugal, wildfires have burned about 216,200 hectares so far this year, according to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) - more than four times the 2006-2024 average for this period - and two people have died.  Southern Europe is experiencing one of its worst wildfire seasons in two decades, with Spain and Portugal among the hardest-hit countries.  So far this year, an estimated 344,400 hectares (851,000 acres) have burned in Spain - an area equivalent to the size of the island of Mallorca - according to the EFFIS. It's the largest area on records that go back to 2006 and more than four times the 2006-2024 average.  Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez cut his holiday to the Canary Islands short to visit areas devastated by the wildfires, proposing a \u201cgrand state pact\u201d to prepare the country for climate-related events such as wildfires and hurricanes.  \u201cWe need to do a thorough analysis of how we can resize our prevention and response capabilities to the climate emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must leave this issue outside of partisan strife. We are all part of the same state, and we must all work in the same direction.\u201d  Defence minister Margarita Robles told radio station Cadena SER that the country hadn\u2019t experienced such a fire situation this severe in 20 years: \u201cThe fires have special characteristics as a result of climate change and this huge heatwave.\u201d  She said thick smoke was affecting the work of helicopters and aircraft carrying water to extinguish the flames.  Spain\u2019s Ministry of the Interior says 27 people have been arrested and 92 are under investigation for suspected arson since June.  Wildfires in southern Europe have grown so devastating that 155,000 hectares of land have been burnt in Portugal, according to the ICNF forestry protection institute. This is three times the average for this period between 2006 to 2024. About half of that area burned in the past three days.  While Portugal is set for cooler weather in the coming days after several woodland fires, the country\u2019s resources have been stretched after more than 4,000 firefighters and 1,300 vehicles were deployed on Sunday, as well as 17 aircraft, according to the Civil Protection Agency.  Europe has been warming twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s, according to the EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Scientists say that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness in parts of Europe, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires.

The decision to add to the more than 1,400 troops already on wildfire duty came as authorities struggled to contain forest blazes, especially in the northwestern Galicia region, and awaited the arrival of promised aircraft reinforcements from other European countries.  Firefighters are tackling 12 major wildfires in Galicia, all of them near the city of Ourense, the head of the Galician regional government Alfonso Rueda told a press conference with S\u00e1nchez.  \u201cHomes are still under threat so we have lockdowns in place and are carrying out evacuations,\u201d Rueda said. Galicia has been battling the spreading flames for more than a week.  Temperatures in Spain could reach 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas on Sunday, the Spanish national weather agency AEMET said. On Saturday, the maximum temperature was 44.7 degrees Celsius (112.46 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southern city of Cordoba, it said.  \u201cThis Sunday, when extraordinarily high temperatures are expected, the danger of wildfires is extreme in most of the country,\u201d AEMET said on the social platform X.  The fires in Spain this year have burned 158,000 hectares (390,000 acres), according to the European Union\u2019s European Forest Fire Information System. That is an area roughly as big as metropolitan London.  Europe has been warming twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s, according to the EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Scientists say that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness in parts of Europe, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires.  Spain awaits European firefighters, more planes  Spain was expecting the arrival of two Dutch water-dumping planes that were to join aircraft from France and Italy already helping Spanish authorities under a European cooperation agreement.  Firefighters from other countries are also expected to arrive in the region in coming days, Spain\u2019s Civil Protection Agency chief Virginia Barcones told public broadcaster RTVE.  National rail operator Renfe said it suspended Madrid-Galicia high-speed train services scheduled for Sunday due to the fires.  Galician authorities advised people to wear face masks and limit their time spent outdoors to avoid inhaling smoke and ash.  Portugal heads into cooler days  Portugal is set for cooler weather in coming days after a spate of severe woodland fires. A national state of alert due to wildfires was enacted Aug. 2 and was due to end Sunday, a day before two Swedish firefighting planes were to arrive.  As in Spain, Portugal\u2019s resources have been stretched. On Sunday, more than 4,000 firefighters and more than 1,300 vehicles were deployed, as well as 17 aircraft, the country\u2019s Civil Protection Agency said.  The scorched area of forest in Portugal so far this year is 17 times higher than in 2024, at around 139,000 hectares, according to preliminary calculations by the Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests, a government body.  Greece, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Albania have also requested help from the EU\u2019s firefighting force in recent days to deal with forest fires. The force has already been activated as many times this year as in all of last year\u2019s summer fire season.  Turkish fires threaten area of Gallipoli memorials  In Turkey, where recent wildfires have killed 19 people, parts of the historic region that includes memorials to World War I's Gallipoli campaign were evacuated Sunday as blazes threatened homes in the country\u2019s northwest.  Six villages were evacuated as a precautionary measure, the governor of Canakkale province, Omer Toraman, said.  Some 1,300 firefighting personnel backed by 30 aircraft were battling the blaze, according to the General Directorate of Forestry.  A wildfire on the peninsula to the north of the Dardanelles Strait led to the closure of visitor facilities at Gallipoli, the site\u2019s management said. The area is dotted with cemeteries, memorials and other remnants of battles waged between Ottoman and Allied troops in 1915.  Turkey has been struck by hundreds of fires since late June, fueled by record-breaking temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds.

A dozen properties have so far been razed by the blaze.He has also been charged with threatening neighbors -- one of whom lost his cabin in the fire -- and resisting arrest. He faces sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.He had been scheduled to appear before the court on Thursday but refused to leave his jail cell. The hearing was postponed for a day.The head of the Orange Country team fighting the Holy fire said the blaze started near Clark's cabin in Jim Canyon.  Before his arrest, Clark told a reporter he had been asleep at the time and had nothing to with the fire.The blaze forced more people to evacuate their properties on Friday and prompted the closure of schools. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031533924533158251762900065</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T0X-PYJ1-JCMN-Y0YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"227\"/><timeReceived>6:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 10, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Greens leader Andrew Weaver didn't disappoint. Shortly after 100 Mile House was evacuated, he seized on a comment from an unnamed B.C.Red Cross official who opined that disasters are happening more frequently in B.C.</p><p>\"Sadly, as the effects of climate change take hold, events like the wildfires displacing so many British Columbians are becoming increasingly common,\" Weaver announced from his leafy Oak Bay constituency.</p><p>It's understandable that the Red Cross is feeling stretched. After relentless cold this past winter, B.C. has barely finished coping with floods due to unusually high snowpack that continued to grow through May and still hasn't melted entirely.</p><p>And now fires, presented once again as a new, unprecedented threat. I've been chronicling provincial fire seasons for many years, and I'm no longer surprised by this sort of brazen political falsehood.</p><p>No worries, politicians say, we'll just ramp up that carbon tax and start diverting the revenue to subsidize pet projects like electric cars, and those forest fires will subside.</p><p>The first thing to remember about this year's fires is that they are clearly not a result of increasingly hot and dry conditions. It was only a few weeks ago that the usual jokes about \"June-uary\" were circulating as rain carried on into summer throughout the province.</p><p>Has there been an extraordinary stretch of hot weather in the first couple of weeks of July? No. Are conditions in the Southern Interior drier than usual? No. Is it unusual for these areas to dry quickly in summer? No. Take a walk through the sagebrush some time. Watch for rattlesnakes.</p><p>Here's some context you won't hear from grandstanding politicians and drama-seeking Vancouver media as communities in the fire-based forest ecosystems of the B.C. Interior face their biggest threat since 2003.</p><p>This season's crisis began when a dry lightning storm passing through the arid B.C. Interior on July 6, resulting in 56 reports of new fire starts.

Greens leader Andrew Weaver didn't disappoint. Shortly after 100 Mile House was evacuated, he seized on a comment from an unnamed B.C.Red Cross official who opined that disasters are happening more frequently in B.C.</p><p>\"Sadly, as the effects of climate change take hold, events like the wildfires displacing so many British Columbians are becoming increasingly common,\" Weaver announced from his leafy Oak Bay constituency.</p><p>It's understandable that the Red Cross is feeling stretched. After relentless cold this past winter, B.C. has barely finished coping with floods due to unusually high snowpack that continued to grow through May and still hasn't melted entirely.</p><p>And now fires, presented once again as a new, unprecedented threat. I've been chronicling provincial fire seasons for many years, and I'm no longer surprised by this sort of brazen political falsehood.</p><p>No worries, politicians say, we'll just ramp up that carbon tax and start diverting the revenue to subsidize pet projects like electric cars, and those forest fires will subside.</p><p>RELATED: $90 million spent fighting B.C. wildfires since April 1</p><p>The first thing to remember about this year's fires is that they are clearly not a result of increasingly hot and dry conditions. It was only a few weeks ago that the usual jokes about \"June-uary\" were circulating as rain carried on into summer throughout the province.</p><p>Has there been an extraordinary stretch of hot weather in the first couple of weeks of July? No. Are conditions in the Southern Interior drier than usual? No. Is it unusual for these areas to dry quickly in summer? No. Take a walk through the sagebrush some time. Watch for rattlesnakes.</p><p>Here's some context you won't hear from grandstanding politicians and drama-seeking Vancouver media as communities in the fire-based forest ecosystems of the B.C. Interior face their biggest threat since 2003.</p><p>This season's crisis began with a dry lightning storm passing through the arid B.C. Interior on July 7, resulting in 56 reports of new fire starts. By the weekend, there were 140 starts reported in a day and a provincial state of emergency had been declared, due to the proximity of communities.</p><p>There were similar dry lightning events in 2015 and previous years, but fortunately they did not strike along the populated Highway 97 corridor, and got little attention. To cite one of many examples, Williams Lake was almost evacuated in 2010, when the Meldrum Creek fire complex approached 500 square kilometres and looked ready to jump the Fraser River from the west. Smoke was drifting into Manitoba.</p><p>By last week, the total since April 1 passed 600 new fire starts, compared to just under 500 at the same time in 2016. But the area burned last year was almost twice as big, due to April grass fires that spread into boreal forest in the Peace region and into Alberta where the Fort McMurray fire was closing in.

Greens leader Andrew Weaver didn't disappoint. Shortly after 100 Mile House was evacuated, he seized on a comment from an unnamed B.C.Red Cross official who opined that disasters are happening more frequently in B.C.</p><p>\"Sadly, as the effects of climate change take hold, events like the wildfires displacing so many British Columbians are becoming increasingly common,\" Weaver announced from his leafy Oak Bay constituency.</p><p>It's understandable that the Red Cross is feeling stretched. After relentless cold this past winter, B.C. has barely finished coping with floods due to unusually high snowpack that continued to grow through May and still hasn't melted entirely.</p><p>And now fires, presented once again as a new, unprecedented threat. I've been chronicling provincial fire seasons for many years, and I'm no longer surprised by this sort of brazen political falsehood.</p><p>No worries, politicians say, we'll just ramp up that carbon tax and start diverting the revenue to subsidize pet projects like electric cars, and those forest fires will subside.</p><p>The first thing to remember about this year's fires is that they are clearly not a result of increasingly hot and dry conditions. It was only a few weeks ago that the usual jokes about \"June-uary\" were circulating as rain carried on into summer throughout the province.</p><p>Has there been an extraordinary stretch of hot weather in the first couple of weeks of July? No. Are conditions in the Southern Interior drier than usual? No. Is it unusual for these areas to dry quickly in summer? No. Take a walk through the sagebrush some time. Watch for rattlesnakes.</p><p>Here's some context you won't hear from grandstanding politicians and drama-seeking Vancouver media as communities in the fire-based forest ecosystems of the B.C. Interior face their biggest threat since 2003.</p><p>This season's crisis began when a dry lightning storm passing through the arid B.C. Interior on July 6, resulting in 56 reports of new fire starts. By the weekend, there were 140 starts reported in a day and a provincial state of emergency had been declared, due to the proximity of communities.</p><p>There were similar dry lightning events in 2015 and previous years, but fortunately they did not strike along the populated Highway 97 corridor, and got little attention. To cite one of many examples, Williams Lake was almost evacuated in 2010, when the Meldrum Creek fire complex approached 500 square kilometres and looked ready to jump the Fraser River from the west. Smoke was drifting into Manitoba.</p><p>By last week, the total since April 1 passed 600 new fire starts, compared to just under 500 at the same time in 2016. But the area burned last year was almost twice as big, due to April grass fires that spread into boreal forest in the Peace region and into Alberta where the Fort McMurray fire was closing in.</p><p>An average B.C. forest fire season is around 2,000 reported fires.</p><p>Foresters don't generally cite climate change, however one defines that slippery term, unless prompted by reporters. They talk about decades of fire suppression that artificially built up fuel loads across vast areas, and the huge costs to mitigate that situation. They talk about bark beetle infestations that add to the fuel load from decadent forests that must burn and always have burned to regenerate themselves.</p><p>Tom Fletcher is B.C. legislature reporter and columnist for Black Press.

(CP) - A large forest fire north of Thunder Bay was still classified as out of control Saturday.</p><p>However, Mitch Miller, of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, said crews were making progress setting controlled burns to remove fuel from the main blaze.</p><p>The fire, which began Thursday, is in an unpopulated area, but several roads have been closed because of heavy smoke.</p><p>The ministry has declared a large portion of northwestern Ontario, including Thunder Bay, a restricted fire zone and are watching northeastern Ontario closely.</p><p>The ban was issued because of extremely dry forest conditions and a lack of rain in the area. No rain is expected for at least four days. Under the restriction, all open fires are prohibited. Portable stoves are permitted but users are asked to exercise caution.</p><p>So far this year, there have been 110 forest fires in Ontario's west fire region. Almost all have been caused by humans.</p><p>The largest fire covers about 2,000 hectares and is about 130 kilometres north of Thunder Bay.</p><p>Ministry officials say the dry weather conditions have meant an early start to the forest fire season this year and that human carelessness continues to be a serious threat.</p><p>\"We're monitoring the situations closely and asking people to hold off burning if at all possible because it only takes one spark to ignite a fire,'' Fred Hampton, a ministry prevention and compliance specialist in Dryden, said Saturday.</p><p>\"Right now the (ministry's) eastern region is trying to heighten public awareness about the conditions and the continuing drying trends,'' he said.

(\"Claude\" and or the \"Company\") reported that as a result of the proximity of a forest fire, it is temporarily suspending underground mining operations at the Seabee Gold Operation in northern Saskatchewan. The Company is taking steps to remove non-essential personnel from the site. The temporary suspension is due to the risk of high winds potentially bringing heavy smoke and ash from a forest fire located approximately 8 kilometres south of the Seabee Gold Mine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Production from the mill has not been affected and the facility will continue to operate. The Company currently has a stockpile of approximately 10,000 tonnes of ore available on surface, representing 12 days of production. At this time, the Company expects to meet its production guidance for the year.</p><p>Brian Skanderbeg, President and CEO commented, \"Our number one priority is the safety and well being of our employees. As a precautionary measure, we have moved non-essential personnel and have temporarily suspended underground mining operations. Additionally, we have measures in place to protect the health and safety of our employees and facilities. The Company will continue to monitor the situation and once the risk has been mitigated, we will resume operations. An update on the operation will be provided once more information becomes available.\"</p><p>Claude Resources Inc. is a publicly traded gold exploration and mining company based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, whose shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: CRJ) and the OTCQB (OTCQB: CLGRF). Its asset base is located entirely in Canada and since 1991, Claude has produced over 1,000,000 ounces of gold from its Seabee Gold Operation in northeastern Saskatchewan.

Forest fire season has started early in Canada and it's already shaping up to be one of the worst on record. The danger is especially high tonight in British Columbia, Alberta and the Northwest Territories, where extreme drought has created tinderbox conditions. There are so many fires burning in the north, the smoke can be seen as far as South Dakota. Air quality advisories have also been issued across Saskatchewan. Overall, about 2,400 wildfires are burning in Canada right now, devouring more than a million hectares of forest. In BC and Alberta, a scorching heat wave is hindering the firefight. Even the pristine wilderness around Banff National Park is under threat tonight. CTV's Katie Simpson has the details.</p><p>KATIE SIMPSON (Reporter): For an Alberta wildfire to be this big, this smoky, this early in the summer is unusual. Fire season doesn't typically start until August. So when water bombers are needed in July, it's something authorities worry about.</p><p>JANE PARK (Fire Specialist, Banff National Park): In the forests around here, given a little bit of wind, fire can move about 25 metres per minute, so it's quite fast.</p><p>SIMPSON: Thousands of hectares have already been scorched and that's just Alberta. In the Northwest Territories, conditions are so bad, firefighting effort cost about a million dollars a day. There are more than three dozen fires on the go in British Columbia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED BOY: Me and my friend were swimming, and then a guy came down and he's like, you need to evacuate the swimming area. And then we had to run out.</p><p>SIMPSON: Some will take days to contain, causing anxiety for those in homes in hot spots.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Just coming right into my backyard, so, I'm kind of like, wow.</p><p>SIMPSON: Here inside Banff National Park, you can see the haze from the smoke through the mountains. It isn't expected to clear anytime soon, as hot dry weather is in the forecast for much of the west.</p><p>PARK: So every day that we have really hot weather and really low relative humidity, the fuels, so the grass and the trees and the needles all dry out further.</p><p>SIMPSON: Not ideal conditions for the hundreds of firefighters trying to stop the spread or for residents protecting their property.</p><p>JOHN DENBOER (Resident): A small spark will engulf the forests, and we live in the forest up at this area, and it's a very great concern.</p><p>SIMPSON: A worry shared by the incident commander dealing with the situation in Banff. He says fire patterns in the national park are on track to possibly set a record this year. Katie Simpson, CTV News, Banff, Alberta.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CND-6WK1-DYX2-93J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"433\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 CTV Televisions, Inc.

It is pearl of wisdom universally and invariably true. This year\u2019s wildfires, including two catastrophic fires in Rio Blanco County, are no exception. Like last spring\u2019s heartbreaking fires in California, there are plenty of people standing around pointing fingers \u2014 all of whom should remember the old adage that when you point your finger at anyone, there are three fingers pointing back at you.  Possibly the most uncalled-for finger pointing in the annals of forest fire history was a recent post in a liberal online mouthpiece called Colorado Newsline, blaming the Meeker area fires on Congressman Jeff Hurd, who was visiting first responders in the area to offer help. The thanks he got, at least from that corner, was a demand that he apologize for the fire \u2014 because he supports American energy independence. As if those fires have anything to do with whether American energy comes from the U.S. or Saudi Arabia.  The piece was written by a former Boulder Daily Camera reporter who now edits the online site, part of a national chain of similar sites called States Newsroom. That\u2019s a $22 million group funded by the Wyss Foundation, Rockefeller Family Fund, Google, Pew Charitable Trusts, National Public Radio, New York Times, environmental activists, and others. The same writer thinks there is \u201cno right way or wrong way to immigrate.\u201d He thinks opponents of the new transgender law are \u201cschoolyard bullies,\u201d says the Taxpayers Bill of Rights \u201ccomes from the same place as MAGA,\u201d and calls the Trump administration \u201clawless,\u201d Energy Secretary Chris Wright a \u201cclimate arsonist,\u201d and Gov. Jared Polis an extension of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.  OK, so the website is biased, no surprise. But this piece about the West Slope fires is beyond one-sided. It is irrational, suggesting that Rep. Hurd is to blame for wildfires \u2014 including the two in Rio Blanco County that were started by lightning \u2014 because he doesn\u2019t think the U.S. should rely on imported energy.  The accusatory article says domestic energy production policies \u201ccrank up the greenhouse gas emissions that guarantee more megafires in Colorado.\u201d There is, of course, no shred of evidence linking those two issues, for several reasons. First, it is poor management, not energy production, that leaves the national forests so massively overgrown that they are vulnerable to catastrophic fires. Second, the policies advocated by Rep. Hurd \u2014 and most of his constituents \u2014 have not been implemented. Despite the administration\u2019s intent to ramp up energy production on public lands, that has yet to happen in Colorado, so Hurd\u2019s support clearly hasn\u2019t caused anything. Third, there is no evidence that importing oil from unfriendly countries is any better for the climate. Finally, wildfires are not measurably worse than before the entire argument about global warming even began.  On the contrary, such fires were far worse a century ago. In the 1920s, wildfires burned 25-50 million acres annually, but declined to about 15 million acres annually by the end of World War II. By the 1950s the number of acres burned each year had settled below 10 million acres because of a regular program of timber harvesting and prescribed-fire thinning. That number has remained relatively flat ever since, putting the lie to the theory that mankind\u2019s recent use of energy makes forest fires worse.  It is the same dishonesty that claims hurricanes are worse these days, when in fact tropical storms have remained fairly constant, within a range of 40-100 storms annually, for over 50 years, with no measurable long-term trend since the 1850s. Eight major hurricanes struck the U.S. in the 1890s, 1930s and 1950s; 10 in the 1940s; six in the 2000s; two in the 2010s; and seven since 2020.  The Hurd-blaming writer claims the Southwest is being transformed by the worst drought in 1,200 years, citing of course a government funded study by three college professors. \u201cThere is no scientific doubt that the primary cause of climate change is the combustion of fossil fuels,\u201d he writes. But even if one accepts that conclusion, as many reasonable people do, there is simply no way to get from there to blaming one Congressman who thinks we should get that energy from one part of the world instead of another.  The people who blame forest fires on global warming are often the same ones who oppose active management of the national forests. That\u2019s just pointing one finger without looking at the other three.

Over  the last 30 years forest cover has significantly developed so as the growing stock has  increased by 50 %. Forests have many functions and play a key role in mitigating and  adapting to climate change, preserving, and restoring biodiversity, ensuring a strong  forest-based bioeconomy and prosperous rural areas, preserving cultural heritage, as  well as providing recreational and educational opportunities for the wellbeing of  Union citizens. In addition to their intrinsic value, forests provide vital ecosystem  services such as climate regulation, air purification, water supply and regulation,  provision of raw materials (wood and non-wood products, such as food or medical  plants), flood and erosion control, habitat for biodiversity, genetic resources and thus  hold a high importance for local populations. Sustainably managed, healthy forest  ecosystems support a significant part of the bioeconomy in the Union, providing the  raw material (wood and non-wood such as food and medical plants) for a variety of  sectors, with the extended forest-based value chains currently supporting 4.5 million  jobs in the Union. Forested land is the main contributor to the Union carbon sink and  should play an essential role in meeting the commitments of Regulation (EU)  3 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (\u2018European Climate Law\u2019) ,  including the Union\u2019s objective to reach climate neutrality by 2050, and of the Fit for  55 legislative package, in particular the new monitoring obligations introduced by the  4 revised Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council  with regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the  3 Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June  2021 establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality and amending  Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (\u2018European Climate Law\u2019) (OJ L  243, 9.7.2021, p. 1, ELI: <url normalizedValue=\"http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2021/1119/oj\">http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2021/1119/oj</url>). 4 Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11  December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action,  amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European  Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC,  2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament  and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing  Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L  328 21.12.2018, p. 1, ELI: <url normalizedValue=\"http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1999/oj\">http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1999/oj</url>).

The frequency  and severity of climate and weather extremes is projected to further increase. A large  share of Union forests is vulnerable to their effects, with adverse consequences for  forest owners, forest-based industries and value chains, for rural livelihoods and for  forest biodiversity, negatively affecting the capacity of forests to provide vital  ecosystem services that the wellbeing of Union citizens and bioeconomy in the Union  depend on. Risks like wildfires and pest outbreaks are transboundary in nature and are  increasing with climate change. That leads to higher costs for their suppression and  contributes to wood market volatility. European forests are already suffering economic  impacts from forest fires of around 1.5 billion euros annually, while increasing  temperatures are predicted to reduce the value of forest land by several hundred billion  euros by the end of the century due to changes in species composition.  (3) Addressing those negative trends and threats, ensuring that forests in the Union can  continue delivering on their multiple functions under a changing climate, and  preserving forest ecosystems as natural heritage requires active forest management  and adaptation measures, an enhanced forest disaster prevention, preparedness,  response and post-disaster recovery, efforts to improve forest resilience and  biodiversity, a stronger capacity to manage risks and climate change, and adaptive  forest management approaches.

To that end, a  European-wide forest monitoring system should be set up to collect and share forest  information that will support informed decision-making, for example by allowing to  identify, assess, and address forest hazards, risks and damages in a timely manner, in  line with relevant data protection standards in place to prevent unauthorised access  or potential data breaches. Against that background, the new EU Forest Strategy for  2030 announced a legislative proposal on EU Forest Observation, Reporting and Data  Collection including on Strategic Plans for Forests and the forest-based sector.  (5) Thanks to the constellation of Copernicus satellites and other space assets,  complemented by periodic airborne imaging campaigns, the Union is equipped with  reliable, cost-efficient, and readily operational Earth observation technologies. These  allow for the detection and monitoring of, among other things, forest fires, forest  disturbances caused by factors other than fires, such as droughts, storms, and pest  outbreaks as well as wildfire risk assessment and to coordinate the policy responses,  especially to events with cross-border effects. AM\\P10_AMA(2025)0176(007-007)_EN.docx 5/61 PE778.767v01-00 EN United in diversity EN (6) Furthermore, it is necessary to obtain a better understanding of European forests in  the Union to support the implementation and enforcement of the European  legislation and to assess forest ecosystems vulnerability and resilience to climate  change, and the effectiveness of the measures to help them adapt to climate change.  That requires the collection of relevant data on forest health, biodiversity and forest  structures. (7) Most of the data on forests on the national level has been collected through national  forest inventories. Historically, national monitoring has focused on factors relating  to long term supply of timber resources. In the last decades the monitoring systems  have evolved, diversifying their focus to also include other forest functions. This  development should be encouraged. Moreover, no comprehensive system currently  exists at the Union level that can ensure availability of comparable quality  information across all relevant policy areas, including forest resilience and  biodiversity as not all Member States have well-established systems for forest  monitoring. In addition, there is potential to further develop the use of remote  sensing data as a complement to ground-based data, to increase the accuracy of both.  Overall, the current forest monitoring in the Union needs to be further developed  towards a more harmonised system, based on a step-wise bottom up approach.  AM\\P10_AMA(2025)0176(007-007)_EN.docx 6/61 PE778.767v01-00 EN United in diversity EN (8) The fast developments in monitoring tools and technologies, in particular in Earth  observation through space-borne or aerial means, and in Global Navigation Satellite  Systems, provide an opportunity to further modernise, digitalise and standardise the  monitoring of forests, providing a service to policy-makers and authorities . To date  rapid changes to forest cover, such as through forest disturbances, can be detected by  Earth observation and can improve the efficiency of forest monitoring. However,  ground measurements are necessary to develop, verify, and calibrate Earth observation  data products. Also, Earth Observation is unable to detect many features connected to  forest disturbances or biodiversity (e.g. attribution of the forest disturbance causes,  quantity of deadwood, forest naturalness, or presence of old-growth forests) .  AM\\P10_AMA(2025)0176(007-007)_EN.docx 7/61 PE778.767v01-00 EN United in diversity EN (9) There are several Union policy instruments that directly or indirectly affect forests in  the fields of environment and biodiversity, climate, energy, bioeconomy and civil  protection. A high-quality forest monitoring system combining ground-based  observations with data and products from Earth observation will help tracking  progress towards Union policy objectives and targets, enabling their successful  implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Moreover, tracking tree cover changes  and extent of forest disturbances can support Member States monitoring and reporting  of carbon stock changes for the purposes of the LULUCF Regulation. This approach is  in line with other Union instruments such as the EU Observatory on Deforestation,  Forest degradation and Associated Drivers, as anchored in the 2019 Communication  12 on Stepping up EU action to protect and restore the world\u2019s forest , which aims to  monitor changes in the world\u2019s forest and related drivers by providing global forest  maps, information on supply chains and Earth Observation tools for regional to global  analysis. 12 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the  European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions  \u201cStepping up EU Action to Protect and Restore the World\u2019s Forests\u201d of 23.7.2019  (COM(2019) 352 final).

High resolution and high accuracy estimate on carbon and its changes  are essential to policy makers and to forest managers, and will allow the adoption  and large-scale deployment of sustainable and credible carbon farming and carbon  storage practices across the Union . (11) Against that background a forest monitoring system should be established by the  Commission in cooperation with Member States and their national forest inventories,  based on three elements that should be gradually made operational: a geographical  information system for forest , a collection framework for forest data and forest  information and a forest information sharing framework. The forest monitoring  system should make use of harmonisation initiatives that are already well- established among national forest inventory experts and should allow the collection  of forest data and forest information data based on Earth observation and  georeferenced ground observation and should ensure interoperability with other  existing electronic databases and geographic information systems, including those  relevant for the monitoring of LULUCF activities and for the tracking of  deforestation-free commodities in accordance with the Deforestation Regulation. The  forest monitoring system should respect the principles laid down by the latest  14 European Interoperability Framework . 13 Regulation (EU) 2024/3012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27  November 2024 establishing a Union certification framework for permanent carbon  removals, carbon farming and carbon storage in products.  14  Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the  European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of  23.3.2017 - European Interoperability Framework \u2013 Implementation Strategy  (COM(2017)134 final).

To ensure a sufficient level of accuracy, the system should comply with  a minimum standard in terms of scale and be developed around a standardised  approach. (13) Forest data and forest information to be collected under this Regulation are collected  to calculate the needed indicators for underpinning Union policies in the areas of  bioeconomy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, civil protection and disaster  risk prevention and management, biodiversity and forest health. The Collection  framework for forest information should be based on different datasets: standardised  data on forest fires and other rapid changes due to natural disasters, to be operated  by the Commission and primarily collected via Earth observation through Copernicus  satellites and subject to technical protocols and calibration with ground level data,  and harmonised data, which Member States should collect by systematically using  their own surveys based on a grid of sampling plots, such as National Forest  Inventories or other networks of monitoring sites, and complementing them with Earth  Observation tools, where available and applicable.

Member States that have monitoring systems in place to contribute with their  nationally applicable datasets such as in situ data or airborne campaigns that are not  available wall-to-wall across the Union, without creating an additional resource  burden, ensuring full recognition of existing national forest inventories, in line with  the subsidiarity principle.  (15) With a view to reducing costs and facilitating access to forest information, the forest  information sharing framework should ensure for such information to be made  publicly accessible by the Commission, including in the Forest Information System for  Europe. Member States should be able to continue using their existing data collection  systems and collect information of national interest. For the purposes of  harmonisation they should share the information in accordance with the technical  specifications included in the Regulation, which are based on existing reference  descriptions and methods. With regard to data relating to the geo-referenced location  of monitoring sites, which are currently treated as confidential by most national forest  inventories, their sharing should be voluntary and subject to the development of  safeguards, in line with the relevant EU requirements, that ensure that the  confidentiality of such data is not compromised in accordance with Regulation (EC)  No 223/2009.

The  main principle of that Directive is that government data should be \u2018open by design and  16 default\u2019. Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council is  aimed at guaranteeing the right of access to environmental information in the Member  States in line with the 1998 Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public  Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters  (\u2018Aarhus Convention\u2019). The Aarhus Convention encompasses broad obligations  related both to making environmental information available upon request and actively  disseminating such information. Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and  17 of the Council also covers the sharing of spatial information, including data sets on  different environmental topics. The provisions of this Regulation related to access to  information and for the collection and sharing of forest data and forest information  should complement those Directives, in order not to create a separate legal regime and  should therefore be without prejudice to Directives (EU) 2019/1024, 2003/4/EC and  2007/2/EC. In accordance with those Directives, the sharing of forest data under this  Regulation should not adversely affect national security and defence. 15 Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June  2019 on open data and the re-use of public sector information (recast) (OJ L 172,  26.6.2019, p. 56, ELI: <url normalizedValue=\"http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/1024/oj\">http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/1024/oj</url>). 16 Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January  2003 on public access to environmental information and repealing Council Directive  90/313/EEC (OJ L 41, 14.2.2003, p. 26, ELI: <url normalizedValue=\"http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2003/4/oj\">http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2003/4/oj</url>). 17 Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2007  establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community  (INSPIRE) (OJ L 108, 25.4.2007, p. 1, ELI: <url normalizedValue=\"http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2007/2/oj\">http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2007/2/oj</url>).

Several thousand schools in the capital and three other cities and districts have been closed since Tuesday.</p><p>He said nearly 300,000 people in the province have suffered respiratory illnesses since January, when it and the five other provinces declared states of emergency due to the forest fires.</p><p>The fires burned parts of the Tesso Nilo National Park in Riau, home to about 140 endangered wild elephants, according to Edward Sanger, the local disaster agency spokesman.</p><p>Thousands of Muslims, many wearing face masks to protest themselves from the smoke, joined mass prayers for rain in Pekanbaru.</p><p>Authorities in Jambi, another province on Sumatra island, also ordered several thousand schools to close.</p><p>About 8,000 people have suffered respiratory problems in the past week alone, according to Jambi's health office.</p><p>Poor visibility caused delays at several airports on Wednesday.</p><p>The Disaster Mitigation Agency said satellites have detected about 5,062 hotspots nationwide on Wednesday morning, with the largest number in Central Kalimantan on Borneo island. It said 37 helicopters have dropped nearly 240 million litres (63 million gallons) of water as part of the firefighting efforts.</p><p>The number of hotspots declined significantly to 2,388 on Wednesday afternoon, the agency said.</p><p>The haze is an annual problem for Southeast Asia. Record Indonesian forest fires in 2015 spread haze across a swath of Southeast Asia, and according to a study by Harvard and Columbia universities, hastened 100,000 deaths.</p><p>The fires are often started by smallholders and plantation owners to clear land for planting. Many areas of Indonesia are prone to rapid burning because of the draining of swampy peatland forests for pulp wood and palm oil plantations.</p><p>In neighbouring Malaysia, the largest city, Kuala Lumpur, and the government administrative centre of Putrajaya were among the areas shrouded in thick smog Wednesday. On Tuesday, hundreds of schools in eastern Sarawak state bordering Indonesia's Kalimantan province were closed for a day after air quality spiked to unhealthy levels.</p><p>Malaysian authorities plan to conduct cloud-seeding activities to induce rain to ease the haze. The government has said it will press Jakarta to take immediate action to put out the burning forests and ensure the fires won't occur again.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Eileen Ng in Hong Kong contributed to this report.</p><p>Niniek Karmini, The Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-3866229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1M-YWM1-JDH1-C1HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"570\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Red Deer Advocate</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

It was fuelled by dry conditions in grass, bushes and trees.</p><p>\"We had consistent 20 km/h winds, very high temperatures and low humidities. We had what we would consider rank five, which is the highest severity of fire behaviour all day (Wednesday),\" said Steve Roberts, the province's executive director of wildfire management.</p><p>The northern flank of the fire was burning at the southernmost edge of the communities - the high school property. That was the control point where firefighters were holding the line, said Roberts.</p><p>\"Our focus is around the town - a small point on a big fire, but it's also our critical priority.\"</p><p>Roberts said the fire was expanding eastward, away from the communities, and wind was keeping smoke out.</p><p>It was good news for Ed Benoanie, acting chief of Hatchet Lake. He was one of about 15 residents who stayed to help with firefighting efforts after everyone else was airlifted out.</p><p>\"The worst has pretty much passed us now, I think,\" he said. \"The fire was kind of around us on the reserve and it continued to the north. It's still blazing in the north, but right now the smoke is almost clear.\"</p><p>Benoanie said there had been fears that homes would be lost.</p><p>\"(Wednesday) was like a war zone here.

The decision to add to the more than 1,400 troops already on wildfire duty came as authorities struggled to contain forest blazes, especially in the northwestern Galicia region, and awaited the arrival of promised aircraft reinforcements from other European countries.  The government\u2019s move also came amid dramatic scenes of residents armed with garden hoses and buckets joining forces to try and save their homes from encroaching blazes.  1:52  Europe suffocates in record-breaking heat dome  Firefighters are tackling 12 major wildfires in Galicia, all of them near the city of Ourense, the head of the Galician regional government Alfonso Rueda told a press conference with S\u00e1nchez.  \u201cHomes are still under threat so we have lockdowns in place and are carrying out evacuations,\u201d Rueda said. Galicia has been battling the spreading flames for more than a week.  Temperatures in Spain could reach 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas on Sunday, the Spanish national weather agency AEMET said.  On Saturday, the maximum temperature was 44.7 degrees Celsius (112.46 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southern city of Cordoba, it said.  \u201cThis Sunday, when extraordinarily high temperatures are expected, the danger of wildfires is extreme in most of the country,\u201d AEMET said on the social platform X.  The fires in Spain this year have burned 158,000 hectares (390,000 acres), according to the European Union\u2019s European Forest Fire Information System. That is an area roughly as big as metropolitan London.  Europe has been warming twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s, according to the EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Scientists say that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness in parts of Europe, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires.  Spain awaits European firefighters, more planes  Spain was expecting the arrival of two Dutch water-dumping planes that were to join aircraft from France and Italy already helping Spanish authorities under a European cooperation agreement.  Firefighters from other countries are also expected to arrive in the region in coming days, Spain\u2019s Civil Protection Agency chief Virginia Barcones told public broadcaster RTVE.  National rail operator Renfe said it suspended Madrid-Galicia high-speed train services scheduled for Sunday due to the fires.  Galician authorities advised people to wear face masks and limit their time spent outdoors to avoid inhaling smoke and ash.  Portugal heads into cooler days  Portugal is set for cooler weather in coming days after a spate of severe woodland fires. A national state of alert due to wildfires was enacted Aug. 2 and was due to end Sunday, a day before two Swedish firefighting planes were to arrive.  As in Spain, Portugal\u2019s resources have been stretched. On Sunday, more than 4,000 firefighters and more than 1,300 vehicles were deployed, as well as 17 aircraft, the country\u2019s Civil Protection Agency said.  0:49  Portugal is using goats to prevent wildfires, but there\u2019s a catch  The scorched area of forest in Portugal so far this year is 17 times higher than in 2024, at around 139,000 hectares, according to preliminary calculations by the Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests, a government body.  Greece, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Albania have also requested help from the EU\u2019s firefighting force in recent days to deal with forest fires. The force has already been activated as many times this year as in all of last year\u2019s summer fire season.  Turkish fires threaten area of Gallipoli memorials  In Turkey, where recent wildfires have killed 19 people, parts of the historic region that includes memorials to World War I\u2019s Gallipoli campaign were evacuated Sunday as blazes threatened homes in the country\u2019s northwest.  Six villages were evacuated as a precautionary measure, the governor of Canakkale province, Omer Toraman, said.  1:50  Flames threaten Turkey\u2019s 4th largest city as southern Europe deals with wildfires  Some 1,300 firefighting personnel backed by 30 aircraft were battling the blaze, according to the General Directorate of Forestry.  A wildfire on the peninsula to the north of the Dardanelles Strait led to the closure of visitor facilities at Gallipoli, the site\u2019s management said. The area is dotted with cemeteries, memorials and other remnants of battles waged between Ottoman and Allied troops in 1915.  Turkey has been struck by hundreds of fires since late June, fueled by record-breaking temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds.  ___</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57475438996</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHH-T2H3-RWBX-G0MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Global News Canada</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 17, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp;

The area is dotted with cemeteries, memorials and other remnants of battles waged between Ottoman and Allied troops in 1915.  Turkey has been struck by hundreds of fires since late June, fueled by record-breaking temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds.
