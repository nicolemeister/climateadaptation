Reports Refinancing of Credit Facilities and 2023 Third Quarter Results</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HALIFAX, NS, Nov. 10, 2023 /CNW/ - Clarke Inc. (\"Clarke\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: CKI) today announced refinancing of credit facilities and its results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Refinancing of Credit Facilities</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In October 2023, the Company refinanced two of its major credit facilities resulting in incremental borrowing availability of more than $36.0 million. This borrowing availability will be used to fund working capital and operations, to finance accretive renovations and other initiatives and to fund the Company's ongoing construction projects   in particular, the second phase of the Company's Carling Avenue development in Ottawa, ON.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Company amended an existing revolving line of credit, increasing the maximum borrowing capacity from $40.0 million to $55.0 million. The Company pledged an additional hotel property and its ferry operations, both previously unencumbered as part of this amendment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Company renewed an existing credit facility that matured on October 1, 2023. The new $55.0 million credit facility is comprised of a $25.0 million term loan and a $30.0 million revolving line of credit.</p><p>Tom Casey, Clarke's Chief Financial Officer, stated \"We are very pleased to renew and expand our existing credit facilities. Both expanded facilities remain with lending partners who we have long-term and strong relationships with. We wish to thank our lenders for the continued confidence they have shown in the Company and our upcoming projects.\"</p><p>Third Quarter Results1</p><p>Hotel operations produced strong third quarter results and achieved net operating income of $8.2 million for the quarter and $18.2 million year to date, compared to $7.2 million and $15.2 million respectively in 2022. The improved year-over-year results are mainly due to continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which was still having a significant negative impact in early 2022, the acquisition of the Stanford Inn &amp; Suites in Grande Prairie, AB in June 2022, and the results of the newly renovated Sternwheeler Hotel and Conference Center in Whitehorse, YT, which was still undergoing renovations in the first two quarters of 2022. Our four hotels in Grande Prairie, AB had a particularly strong quarter due to strong economic activity in the region and from unanticipated business from forest fire evacuees.</p><p>The Company's net loss was $1.9 million and $4.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to net income of $3.9 million and $1.9 million for the same periods in 2022. The subdued earnings year-over-year are primarily because the Company recorded $4.2 million of net fair value adjustment losses within earnings in the third quarter. This $4.2 million was the aggregate of $7.0 million of fair value losses on its investment properties, offset by $2.8 million of fair value gains on certain hotel properties. The Company also recorded an additional $7.2 million of fair value gains on certain hotel properties within other comprehensive income.</p><p>Comprehensive income was $0.8 million and $4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Comprehensive income was $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a comprehensive loss of $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the aforementioned revaluation gains on certain hotel properties, partially offset by remeasurement losses on the Company's defined benefit pension plans.</p><p>During the third quarter of 2023, the Company's book value per common share increased by $0.06, or 0.4%. The change can be attributed primarily to (i) hotel net operating income of $8.2 million or $0.58 per share and (ii) revaluation gains, net of tax on property and equipment of $7.6 million or $0.54 per share offset by (iii) fair value adjustments on investment properties of $7.0 million or $0.50 per share, (iv) after-tax remeasurement losses and the effect of changes to the asset ceiling on the Company's pension plans of $2.9 million or $0.21 per share, (v) depreciation of $2.8 million or $0.20 per share and (vi) interest and accretion of $1.9 million or $0.13 per share.</p><p>The Company's book value per common share at the end of the quarter was $15.37 while our common share price was $13.90.</p><p>Additional commentary on our third quarter results can be found in our Management's Discussion &amp; Analysis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.</p><p>Other Information</p><p>Highlights of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 are as follows:</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">(in millions, except per share amounts)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Three months ended September 30, 2023 $</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Three months ended September 30, 2022 $</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Nine months ended September 30, 2023 $</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Nine months ended September 30, 2022 $</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hotel and rental revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">19.6.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">17.2.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">50.5.</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">39.4.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Provision of services revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.3.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4.5.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">6.8.</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">6.7.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Investment and other income (loss)*</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(4.8)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.5.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(4.9)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">1.4.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net income (loss)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(1.9)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3.9.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(4.1)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">1.9.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Comprehensive income (loss)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.8.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4.5.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.0.</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">(10.3)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Basic earnings (loss) per share (\"EPS\")</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(0.13)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.27.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(0.29)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.13.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Diluted EPS</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(0.13)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.25.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(0.29)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.13.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total assets</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">452.5.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">389.6.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">452.5.</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">389.6.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total liabilities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">237.7.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">194.7.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">237.7.</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">194.7.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Long-term financial liabilities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">117.1.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">87.6.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">117.1.</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">87.6.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Book value per share</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">15.37.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">13.83.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">15.37.</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">13.83.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">*Investment and other income (loss) includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on assets and liabilities, interest income, fair value changes of property and equipment presented in the statement of earnings, fair value changes of investment properties, pension expense and/or recovery, and foreign exchange gains and losses.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Further information about Clarke, including Clarke's Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion &amp;

Book value per share and net operating income are not financial measures or ratios calculated and presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute to any financial measures or ratios of performance calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. These non-IFRS financial measures and ratios are presented in this press release because management of Clarke believes that such measures and ratios enhance the user's understanding of our historical and current financial performance.</p><p>Book value per share is measured by dividing shareholders' equity of the Company at the date of the statement of financial position by the number of common shares outstanding at that date. Net operating income is defined as revenue less expenses. Net operating income measures operating results before interest, depreciation, and amortization. Clarke's method of determining these amounts may differ from other companies' methods and, accordingly, these amounts may not be comparable to measures used by other companies.</p><p>Note on Forward-Looking Statements and Risks</p><p>This press release may contain or refer to certain forward-looking statements relating, but not limited, to the Company's expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs with respect to the Company. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"plans\", \"expects\", \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"budgets\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\", \"believes\", or equivalents or variations of such words and phrases, or state that certain actions, events or results, \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"should\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, those with respect to the future or expected performance of the Company's investee companies, the future price and value of securities held by the Company, changes in these securities holdings, the future price of oil, changes to the Company's hedging practices, currency fluctuations and requirements for additional capital. Forward-looking statements rely on certain underlying assumptions that, if not realized, can result in such forward-looking statements not being achieved. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of the Company to be materially different from the historical results or from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, the Company's investment strategy, legal and regulatory risks, general market risk, potential lack of diversification in the Company's investments, interest rates, foreign currency fluctuations, the sale of Company investments, the fact that dividends from investee companies are not guaranteed, reliance on key executives, commodity market risk, risks associated with investment in derivative instruments and other factors. With respect to the Company's investment in hotel, real estate and ferry operations, such risks and uncertainties include, among others, weather conditions, safety, claims and insurance, uninsured losses, changes in levels of business and commercial travel and tourism, increases in the supply of accommodations in local markets, the recurring need for renovation and improvement of hotel properties, labour relations, and other factors.</p><p>Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actions, events or results not to be as estimated or intended, there can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Other than as required by applicable Canadian securities laws, the Company does not update or revise any such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">________________</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1 Book value per share and hotel net operating income are non-IFRS measures and ratios.

(TSXV:CCW) (OTC:CCWOF) (Frankfurt:4T9B) (the \"Company\" or \"Canada Silver Cobalt\") is pleased to provide a significant update on the ongoing lithogeochemical mapping and exploration efforts in the St. Denis and Sangster claims located in Ontario directly south of James Bay near the Quebec border contiguous to Power Metals' Case Lake Lithium properties and accessible by roads from Cochrane (38 km) and Timmins (85 km).</p><p>The St-Denis Project area is 26,373 hectares (including 24,036 hectares in the St-Denis Main block and 2,337 hectares in the Sangster block) and is one of the largest land holdings in the emerging Case Lake LCT (lithium-cesium-tantalum) pegmatite district of Northeastern Ontario. The property is strategically positioned over an ideal geological environment for pegmatite mineralization, as demonstrated by a number of observations of pegmatite in outcrop and drill core in the historic assessment work files and government mapping. The Project is supported by year-round ease of access, proximity to services and suppliers in the mining communities of Timmins and Cochrane, and location along strike to a known LCT (lithium-cesium-tantalum) pegmatite occurrence (Case Lake LCT pegmatite swarm).</p><p>At the St. Denis claims, Canada Silver Cobalt has discovered multiple pegmatites in the Circle Lake Road area. Many individual outcrops contain multiple pegmatites. In this phase, instead of sampling each pegmatite individually, sample spacing was prioritized due to time constraints imposed by the weather and a late start to the 2023 field season due to forest fire activity in the area. Maximizing sample spacing allows us to build a representative Lithogeochemical map which will enhance our ability to vector further exploration towards more fertile ground.</p><p>The Company has taken 36 samples from the Circle Lake Road area of the St. Denis claims, a key area of interest for our exploration activities. Of these 36 samples, 21 are channel samples, and 12 samples were extracted from identified pegmatite formations. Canada Silver Cobalt has further utilized portable XRF (X-ray fluorescence) analyses on these samples to correlate with lab values, thereby evaluating XRF as an in-field vectoring tool, demonstrating a commitment to adopting advanced technologies to enhance exploration accuracy. Two main sample areas have been targeted on Circle Lake Road, area 1 circle lake south where 15 samples were collected in an area approximately 2km by 1km and area 2 circle lake north where 18 samples were collected in a 1.5km by 200m area.</p><p>The Circle Lake Road area has proven to be highly advantageous for the Company, with excellent outcrop exposure in numerous locations. Notably, the presence of xenoliths identified in the granite is an additional encouraging sign, suggesting proximity to the granite dome, a geological feature often associated with valuable mineralization. This discovery underscores the potential for significant mineral deposits within the area. Furthermore, the identification of indicator minerals, such as garnet and muscovite, is a promising sign.</p><p>The latest developments at the St. Denis property (see map below) build on the recent successes at the Sangster West property including the identification and sampling of expanses of numerous pegmatites up to 20 metres wide and 70 metres long along with identification of pathfinder metals (see <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canadasilvercobaltworks.com/news/pegmatites-confirmed-up-to-20-meters-wide-and-70-meters-long-at-sangster/\">https://www.canadasilvercobaltworks.com/news/pegmatites-confirmed-up-to-20-meters-wide-and-70-meters-long-at-sangster/</url>).</p><p>Matthew Halliday, President and COO of Canada Silver Cobalt, expressed his enthusiasm for these developments, stating, \"Our progress is encouraging. We want to get a balance between the number of samples and the distance between them in the area, for both the granite and the pegmatites. This will allow our Lithogeochemical map to provide vectors for the next phase of exploration. It is encouraging to see pegmatite dykes in outcrop and some of the main indications that we are in the right area.\"</p><p>Canada Silver Cobalt remains dedicated to advancing its exploration efforts and unlocking the full potential of the St. Denis and Sangster claims. The Company's commitment to utilizing cutting-edge technologies, such as portable XRF analysis, underlines its commitment to efficient and effective resource assessment.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/28085b544f4ce9a34d21dcfd8ad2cd08.pngClick\">https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/28085b544f4ce9a34d21dcfd8ad2cd08.pngClick</url> Image To View Full Size</p><p>Figure 1: Channel Sample with Pegmatite - Circle Lake Road</p><p>Figure 2: Map showing Sangster and St. Denis Projects in relation to James Bay and Timmins</p><p>Figure 3: Map of Sangster and St. Denis Projects</p><p>The Company remains committed to responsible resource development and continues to engage with local communities, Indigenous groups, and stakeholders to ensure transparent and collaborative communication throughout our exploration activities.</p><p>Investors, media, and stakeholders are invited to stay updated on the latest developments by visiting the Company's website at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canadasilvercobaltworks.com/\">https://www.canadasilvercobaltworks.com/</url>.</p><p>Qualified person</p><p>The technical information in this news release was approved by and prepared under the supervision of Mr. Matthew Halliday, P.Geo., (PGO), President and COO of Canada Silver Cobalt Works Inc., a qualified person in accordance with National Instrument 43-101.</p><p>About Canada Silver Cobalt Works Inc.</p><p>Canada Silver Cobalt Works Inc. recently discovered a major high-grade silver vein system at Castle East located 1.5 km from its 100%-owned, past-producing Castle Mine near Gowganda in the prolific and world-class silver-cobalt mining district of Northern Ontario. The Company has completed a 60,000m drill program aimed at expanding the size of the deposit with an update to the resource estimate underway.</p><p>In May 2020, based on a small initial drill program, the Company published the region's first 43-101 resource estimate that contained a total of 7.56 million ounces of silver in Inferred resources, comprising very high-grade silver (8,582 grams per tonne un-cut or 250.2 oz/ton) in 27,400 tonnes of material from two sections (1A and 1B) of the Castle East Robinson Zone, beginning at a vertical depth of approximately 400 meters. Note that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Please refer to Canada Silver Cobalt Works Press Release May 28, 2020, for the resource estimate. Report reference: Rachidi, M. 2020, NI 43-101 Technical Report Mineral Resource Estimate for Castle East, Robinson Zone, Ontario, Canada, with an effective date of May 28, 2020, and a signature date of July 13, 2020.</p><p>The Company also has: (1) 14 battery metals properties in Northern Quebec where it has recently completed a nearly 16,000-metre drill program on the Graal property; and (2) the prospective 1,000-hectare Eby-Otto gold property close to Agnico Eagle's high-grade Macassa Mine near Kirkland Lake, Ontario where it is exploring. (3) lithium property - 230 square kilometers of greenfield exploration ground focussed along a significant volcanic sedimentary rock - Archean granite contact near Cochrane, Ontario contiguous to Power Metals' Case Lake Lithium properties.</p><p>Canada Silver Cobalt's flagship silver-cobalt Castle mine and 78 sq. km Castle Property feature strong exploration upside for silver, cobalt, nickel, gold, and copper. With underground access at the fully owned Castle Mine, an exceptional high-grade silver discovery at Castle East, a pilot plant to produce cobalt-rich gravity concentrates, a processing facility (TTL Laboratories) in the town of Cobalt, and a proprietary hydrometallurgical process known as Re-2Ox (for the creation of technical-grade cobalt sulphate as well as nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) formulations), Canada Silver Cobalt is strategically positioned to become a Canadian leader in the silver-cobalt space.

(FESBC) board members were able to see the effectiveness of forest fuel management in action on July 11.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During a day-long tour of different funding projects by FESBC, John Walker, Williams Lake First Nation (WLFN) stewardship forester, brought the group to the site of a forest fire which had been sparked by lightning only a few days before.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThis is proof that these things work,\u201d said Walker.</p><p>Right next to the Williams Lake Sportsmen\u2019s Association property, where work had been done the year before by WLFN for fuel management, lightning had struck.</p><p>The lightning had started a wildfire, which was discovered and responded to by firefighters on July 7, 2023.</p><p>Thanks to the work done the year before, the forest in that location had been spaced out, reducing the fuel available for a wildfire to burn, reducing its intensity and the ladder fuels had been removed. Ladder fuels are the low branches and underbrush which allow a fire to move from the ground up into the crowns of trees.</p><p>The spacing had opened up the crowns of the trees to provide space between trees as well, so if a fire did climb up and \u201cgo aerial\u201d it would be harder for it to go from one tree to another.</p><p>While some might wonder why it isn\u2019t better to remove all the trees in these \u201cfuel breaks\u201d around communities and structures, Steve Kozuki, executive director of FESBC, explained the shading of the remaining forest is also an asset, reducing the relative humidity, reducing the grass undergrowth and reducing temperatures, all of which slow fire spread.</p><p>While the understory burn to remove more of the fuel still on the ground had not yet been done, the spacing, thinning and removal of ladder fuels still ensured the fire did not grow quickly or burn as intensely and stayed on the ground.</p><p>The firefighters were able to relatively easily control and extinguish the fire, reducing the amount of time it would have taken to fight the fire and preventing what could have been a much more volatile fire situation.</p><p>It was just one of the locations the group toured that day, taking in another similar fuel reduction project near Felker Lake, where WLFN was able to treat an area for a fuel break alongside another project they were doing work on and combine efforts to reduce costs and increase the effectiveness of both projects.</p><p>In one PhD.project in the Williams Lake Community Forest, a study of tree rings revealed the historic cycle was for the area to experience a fire on the landscape every two to 15 years. Most of those fires were low-intensity fires, with the occasional high-intensity burn. But for over the last 100 years, fire has been excluded from the landscape, allowing the forest fuels to build up and the forest to become much more dense.</p><p>WLFN Kukpi7 (Chief) Willie Sellars vis-ited two of the projects with the group and spoke about how important it is to mitigate the risk of wildfires and the concerns in the community after 2017 every time there is smoke or fire in the area.</p><p>\u201cHistorically we were much better stewards of our lands in our traditional territories,\u201d he said, noting how this began to change when forests began being viewed as a commodity. He celebrated the progress which has been made in the recent decades in terms of integrating the knowledge of elders and a more holistic approach.</p><p>He said it is a big step forward now as industry, different levels of government and First Nations are now all taking part in the discussion and he celebrated the work which has been done together to make the community safer.</p><p>\u201cWe do have some great people that are really leading the charge on behalf of our community,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kozuki said the goal of the landscape fuel break is also largely to restore a more resilient forest, closer to what would have existed historically.</p><p>\u201cI believe timber is the by-product of doing forest management,\u201d said Walker, as he explained other benefits to the project, including habitat enhancement, noting how much he has learned along the way. An elder tour the day before had shown him the value the community puts on the other byproducts of opening up the forest like more traditional plants.</p><p>\u201cWhen a Saskatoon bush was there, the tour stopped,\u201d he laughed, noting they need a more open forest for those.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about finding that balance,\u201d said Sellars, between stewardship and economic benefits.</p><p>Ken Day, a retired forester and board member of FESBC said the success they are seeing now in these projects he attributes to the \u201creally good collaboration in the Cariboo where everybody in this plan area has been gathering for years to discuss priorities.\u201d</p><p>The fuel treatment in the Felker Lake area is planned for a large-scale burn in the fall and will include some treated areas and some which will just be burned, conditions permitting.</p><p>Kozuki noted how in the southern part of the province where timber values are higher due to longer growing season and bigger timber, the same type of projects can pay for themselves, but in areas like the Cariboo, government has a role in supporting these projects in order to protect communities.</p><p>One challenge mentioned by FESBC was with these plans looking 20 to 40 years out, shorter political cycles can impact long-term funding and planning.</p><p>Kozuki mentioned stocking standards can impact this type of project as well, but overall, the group was very positive about what they saw, with Day pointing out the thinned trees were well-selected as good timber stock for future harvest moving forward.</p><p>\u201cThis is a win and a win and a win and we don\u2019t get to score that way very often, not in this business,\u201d said Day. \u201cWe will grow more timber on fewer trees.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-news20230720PTDA0003742407</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68RR-5TD1-JD2C-J23J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"954\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

With fires approaching the roads and smoke reducing visibility to almost zero, some returning to the territory were forced to turn back.   </p><p>While emergency teams were able to organize convoys for those heading north, the visibility was soon too bad to allow any road access. Emergency shelters were established in Matagami, Pikogan and a service centre at km 381 of the Billy Diamond Highway.  </p><p>\u201cIt was a scary experience,\u201d said Betty Tomatuk. \u201cAt km 66 to 68 in Eastmain access road, we drove through a very big thick black smoke and at one point it looked like it was nighttime.\u201d  </p><p>Eastmain declared a state of emergency July 13 and prepared for a full evacuation. Radisson also declared a local state of emergency on that day while Nemaska, Waskaganish and Wemindji evacuated their most vulnerable residents. Canadian Rangers were deployed to support departures as various levels of government worked to establish an \u201cair bridge\u201d for delivering essential goods and medical supplies.  </p><p>Four Chinook helicopters transported 344 Eastmain residents to Matagami on July 14, the most they had ever moved in one day, with more transported the following days. Eastmain animal control weren\u2019t able to airlift the community\u2019s pets as planned after military helicopters were called away for an urgent evacuation in Wemindji but kept them safely centralized in the arena.   </p><p>As the Billy Diamond Highway and several community access roads were restricted, an operational committee composed of regional stakeholders was established to ensure the safety and basic needs of impacted citizens. Chisasibi\u2019s grocery shelves emptied, and gas was rationed while community members awaited a Hercules military plane to deliver necessary supplies.  </p><p>Smoky conditions that brought darkness at 5pm some days prompted the installation of safe air shelters at Chisasibi\u2019s community banquet hall, auditorium and youth centre. With Air Creebec involved in several evacuations and supply deliveries, President Tanya Pash commended crews for their \u201cphenomenal effort\u201d and volunteering overtime.   </p><p>On July 16, the first cohort of auxiliary firefighters from Waswanipi and Ouje-Bougoumou completed basic training in Mont-Tremblant to be integrated with SOPFEU ground crews inland. A second group of 30 began a session in Chisasibi a few days later with a trainer who flew up from Maniwaki.  </p><p>Rains and humidity in the following days helped stall the fire\u2019s progress, providing a brief window for the Billy Diamond Highway to reopen for essential services, humanitarian reasons and residents returning home. As fires were still present on both sides of the road, this status was to be regularly reassessed according to the latest conditions.  </p><p>\u201cWe have local fire departments who are \u2018boots on the ground\u2019 to do daily checks on the access roads and give information to SOPFEU,\u201d added regional fire marshal Lee-Roy Blacksmith. \u201cThey put checkpoints on some access roads so community members can reach their local PSO as they get closer to the community.\u201d </p><p>The heavy rains had yet to extinguish the fires as hoped and hot spots remained on access roads where the flames had crossed. Firefighting reinforcements from the US had arrived in Radisson and water bombers were waiting for better visibility to conduct operations. Blacksmith said decisions were coordinated through daily meetings with deputy executive director Melissa Saganash, local PSOs, community leaders and provincial agencies. </p><p>Eastmain was planning internally for a gradual return according to step-by-step guidelines from the health board and other authorities, however, essential services such as the health clinic and grocery availability needed to first be in place.  </p><p>Bush access remained prohibited from Matagami up to the Trans-Taiga Road, where a fire had grown to become the biggest in Canada. It was one of 11 fires out of control in the province\u2019s northern zone at press time, as blazes had consumed over 2.8 million hectares of forest. </p><p>While news outlets report the wildfires haven\u2019t touched any homes, Cree land users may have a different story. Keith Bearskin\u2019s large cabin went up in flames along with the family\u2019s boats, ATV and other gear. Like many others, the Chisasibi Cree Trappers\u2019 Association (CTA) president was uninsured.  </p><p>Only 262 cabins were insured under CTA\u2019s program, which is hindered by the challenges of gathering building details in the deep bush. Cree Board of Compensation chairman Derrick Neeposh suggested the fires will likely increase premiums or even prevent insurance coverage. </p><p>Waswanipi forestry consultant Allan Saganash is aware of some traplines that have been completely lost. Evacuated multiple times, Saganash has struggled with asthma exacerbated by the wildfire smoke and sickness from being away from traditional food. However, that doesn\u2019t compare to the heartbreak of witnessing the forest fire\u2019s devastating aftermath.  </p><p>\u201cAs I stood towards the charred land along the highway, sadness and a deathly silence fell upon me,\u201d Saganash shared. \u201cWhat was once a forest bustling of wildlife, the foliage making familiar sounds that only a hunter can understand, was all gone. Not only our traplines are lost but many of our camps which many of us consider our real homes.\u201d </p><p>Gull-Masty said that she\u2019s in discussions with the CTA to determine the impacts and next steps for securing potential recovery resources. She said this season has brought hard lessons for both governments and land users that will inform fire prevention strategies.   </p><p>\u201cIt is absolutely necessary to address the concerns of the land users,\u201d Gull-Masty told the Nation. \u201cWe\u2019re basically almost in a refugee status from the impact of climate, which creates obligations for government to respond to our needs. This isn\u2019t just empty forests catching on fire \u2013 one tallyman told me this is cultural infrastructure.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-5c751a5703cf4a889e602cdd8811c094</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VV-TXJ1-JBVR-323G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1087\"/><timeReceived>11:02 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 3, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Monday, Dec. 11 2023, 17 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022 the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Cedar Creek, between Runningbrook Drive and Lexicon Drive in Ward 3.

(\"Champion Electric\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that the Company completed an airborne Time-Domain Electromagnetic (TDEM) survey prior to the forest fire related team evacuation. The TDEM survey was flown over base metals targets identified by the 2022 VLF-EM survey and the recent historical data review undertaken at the Champion Electric Lithium Project (the \"Project\") located in the pegmatite-rich Eeyou Istchee James Bay territory of Quebec.</p><p>The TDEM high-resolution airborne survey was completed by Prospectair Geosurveys and data was collected over 351-line kilometres (\"km\") over interpreted areas of interest within the 2022 airborne geophysical survey coverage. The TDEM survey aimed to follow-up on a selection of shallow VLF-EM conductive anomalies spatially correlated with mapped ultramafic rocks of the Lac Guyer Greenstone Belt which are anomalous in Ni (Nickel), Co (Cobalt) and Cr (Chromium) and deemed prospective for base metals mineralisation (see Figure 1).</p><p>\"Although lithium is our primary focus in Quebec, we cannot neglect the fact that our 100% owned 500 km2 project in James Bay is also highly prospective for base and precious metals. These preliminary targets are very encouraging, and we are looking forward to finalising the interpretation. I am delighted to see that the thorough work done by the technical team results in high-quality targets being generated. The early and systematic campaigns of data collection have already strengthened our exploration portfolio and are a testimony to our drive and ambition to make a significant discovery in the region,\" commented President and CEO Jonathan Buick.</p><p>Figure 1: Interpreted conductive units from the 2022 VLF-EM survey <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8681/170081_\">https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8681/170081_</url></p><p>A preliminary review of the TDEM data reveals that discrete late-time conductive anomalies possibly indicative of bedrock massive sulphide mineralisation are present within the interpreted ultramafic horizons (Figure 2). An update will be provided when ongoing processing, modelling, and interpretation of the final TDEM data is completed. Targets generated will be evaluated on the ground concurrent with the planned exploration efforts for lithium-bearing pegmatites once fieldwork resumes.</p><p>Figure 2.

Just a year ago, \u201cit was always dark, even if the sun was shining, because of all the trees that were here,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez said of the grove near his town of San Miguel Topilejo \u2014 on the edge of the encroaching urban sprawl.</p><p>While most people associate Mexico City with traffic jams and polluted air, actually about one-half of the city\u2019s territory is rural, almost all of it in the southern boroughs of Milpa Alta and Tlalpan. About 20% are protected nature areas, like the mountains covered with pine and fir forests that adjoin the neighboring state of Morelos.</p><p>Those trees guarantee the recharge of aquifers that supply nearly 20 million people living in the city \u2014 and its suburbs. They also help clean the polluted air of the city and serve to contain high temperatures.</p><p>Why the illegal tree cutting has gotten so bad so fast is a matter of debate.</p><p>Local farm communities \u2014 many of whose members are paid as park rangers or soil conservation workers by the city government \u2014 think that organized crime gangs have moved into the illegal logging business.</p><p>It would not be a far stretch: Such gangs have long used the rural communities on the city\u2019s edge to set up safehouses to hold kidnapping victims and its forests as dumping ground for the bodies of their victims.</p><p>Some of the villagers suggest the federal government\u2019s crackdown on the sale of contraband gasoline and diesel stolen from government pipelines may also play a role, saying those who used to make a living selling fuel at roadside stands may now have turned to logging.</p><p>Mexico City authorities say they have identified criminal groups behind illegal logging, and in the past few months they have struck back, mounting operations involving hundreds of police officers and soldiers who raided clandestine sawmills in the mountains.</p><p>The city also sponsors reforestation efforts, but it is a race against time. Many of the tiny saplings won\u2019t survive, and it would take decades to replace the majestic mature forests being cut.</p><p>In 2010, forests covered about 100,000 acres (40,500 hectares) of the city\u2019s total area of 370,000 acres (150,000 hectares), according to the activist group Global Forest Watch.</p><p>The group says the city lost 121 acres (49 hectares) of forest in 2022 \u2014 as much as in all of the four previous years together.</p><p>The problem is particularly acute in San Miguel Topilejo, which \u2014 because it has forests and is crossed by highways \u2014 makes it an attractive place for gangs to cut logs and move them to sawmills.</p><p>Pablo Amezcua, a natural resources engineer who works in San Miguel Topilejo, said that before 2020, only about 500 acres (200 hectares) had been affected by logging. Amezcua says that by mid-2023, a total of about 6,000 acres (2,400 hectares) had been fully or partially cut.</p><p>Combating illegal loggers is a Sisyphean task.</p><p>According to data from the country's attorney general for environmental protection, there have been 122 illegal logging complaints since 2013 in Mexico City, with more than half of those so far in 2023.</p><p>On a recent day, a group of forest rangers and volunteers set out on a reforestation mission in trucks from San Miguel Topilejo, going down narrow dirt tracks in the forest that are barely wide enough for the small trucks to pass.</p><p>They were escorted by soldiers and armed officers of the National Guard.</p><p>At the wheel of one of the trucks, a 24-year-old looked nervously from side to side as he piloted the vehicle. Like many of the rangers interviewed for this story, he asked not be named citing security reasons.</p><p>He said that when he passed the same spot two days before, there were trees where now there are felled branches and heaps of pine boughs, which could be dangerous fuel in the next forest fire season.</p><p>Riding next to him is a 58-year-old ranger who says he was shot in his abdomen by illegal loggers he tried to stop in November. A year before he says he was forced to flee his community after his family received threats.</p><p>Sadly, his situation is not unusual. Mexico is the world's deadliest place for environmental and land defense activists, according to a 2022 report by the nongovernmental group Global Witness. Mexico saw 54 activists killed in 2021, the highest number in the world.</p><p>The fact the forests have survived is itself a feat.</p><p>As Mexico City\u2019s population exploded between the 1950s and 1970s, urban sprawl crept steadily up the forested mountain slopes on the city\u2019s southern boroughs. All kinds of logging had already been prohibited but some believe the prohibition fueled illegality.</p><p>Marina Robles, the head of Mexico City\u2019s environment department, said the causes behind illegal logging are many, from real estate interests to organized crime.</p><p>For starters, organized crime gangs that were once content to use the forests as a hide-out and body-dumping ground, now want to control every activity, licit and illicit, that occurs on what they consider \u201ctheir\u201d turf. That includes illegal logging.</p><p>A couple of months ago, local residents \u2014 left to their fate against the gangs \u2014 protested by blocking highways leading out of the forest.</p><p>In response, authorities started the raids in June, with the help of 500 soldiers.</p><p>By early August, acting Mayor Mart\u00ed Batres said authorities have identified al least five organized criminal logging groups in the city and had seized 32 lumber yards and 28 illegal sawmills within city limits. A dozen more sites were found in the neighboring state of Morelos.</p><p>Most were semi-portable, fly-by-night operations.</p><p>\u201cThey find a place that has the right conditions, they set up the sawmills, cut down trees, all very rapidly, from one day to the next; they start milling the logs and then pack up the sawmill,\u201d Batres said.</p><p>He hopes to pass tougher penalties for illegal logging but, at present, it is hard to even arrest illegal loggers, who have attacked rangers and even soldiers, at one point dousing an army patrol with gasoline.</p><p>In return, some local residents set fire to logging trucks.</p><p>But it is an unequal battle.</p><p>\u201cThey have high-powered rifles,\u201d said the ranger who was wounded in November. \u201cThese criminals completely out-gun us.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s climate coverage at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-39586451a563b4732da11304aae0b8f3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6920-41S1-DY9S-T0FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1122\"/><timeReceived>01:02 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 28, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

With fires approaching the roads and smoke reducing visibility to almost zero, some returning to the territory were forced to turn back.   </p><p>While emergency teams were able to organize convoys for those heading north, the visibility was soon too bad to allow any road access. Emergency shelters were established in Matagami, Pikogan and a service centre at km 381 of the Billy Diamond Highway.  </p><p>\u201cIt was a scary experience,\u201d said Betty Tomatuk. \u201cAt km 66 to 68 in Eastmain access road, we drove through a very big thick black smoke and at one point it looked like it was nighttime.\u201d  </p><p>Eastmain declared a state of emergency July 13 and prepared for a full evacuation. Radisson also declared a local state of emergency on that day while Nemaska, Waskaganish and Wemindji evacuated their most vulnerable residents. Canadian Rangers were deployed to support departures as various levels of government worked to establish an \u201cair bridge\u201d for delivering essential goods and medical supplies.  </p><p>Four Chinook helicopters transported 344 Eastmain residents to Matagami on July 14, the most they had ever moved in one day, with more transported the following days. Eastmain animal control weren\u2019t able to airlift the community\u2019s pets as planned after military helicopters were called away for an urgent evacuation in Wemindji but kept them safely centralized in the arena.   </p><p>As the Billy Diamond Highway and several community access roads were restricted, an operational committee composed of regional stakeholders was established to ensure the safety and basic needs of impacted citizens. Chisasibi\u2019s grocery shelves emptied, and gas was rationed while community members awaited a Hercules military plane to deliver necessary supplies.  </p><p>Smoky conditions that brought darkness at 5pm some days prompted the installation of safe air shelters at Chisasibi\u2019s community banquet hall, auditorium and youth centre. With Air Creebec involved in several evacuations and supply deliveries, President Tanya Pash commended crews for their \u201cphenomenal effort\u201d and volunteering overtime.   </p><p>On July 16, the first cohort of auxiliary firefighters from Waswanipi and Ouje-Bougoumou completed basic training in Mont-Tremblant to be integrated with SOPFEU ground crews inland. A second group of 30 began a session in Chisasibi a few days later with a trainer who flew up from Maniwaki.  </p><p>Rains and humidity in the following days helped stall the fire\u2019s progress, providing a brief window for the Billy Diamond Highway to reopen for essential services, humanitarian reasons and residents returning home. As fires were still present on both sides of the road, this status was to be regularly reassessed according to the latest conditions.  </p><p>\u201cWe have local fire departments who are \u2018boots on the ground\u2019 to do daily checks on the access roads and give information to SOPFEU,\u201d added regional fire marshal Lee-Roy Blacksmith. \u201cThey put checkpoints on some access roads so community members can reach their local PSO as they get closer to the community.\u201d </p><p>The heavy rains had yet to extinguish the fires as hoped and hot spots remained on access roads where the flames had crossed. Firefighting reinforcements from the US had arrived in Radisson and water bombers were waiting for better visibility to conduct operations. Blacksmith said decisions were coordinated through daily meetings with deputy executive director Melissa Saganash, local PSOs, community leaders and provincial agencies. </p><p>Eastmain was planning internally for a gradual return according to step-by-step guidelines from the health board and other authorities, however, essential services such as the health clinic and grocery availability needed to first be in place.  </p><p>Bush access remained prohibited from Matagami up to the Trans-Taiga Road, where a fire had grown to become the biggest in Canada. It was one of 11 fires out of control in the province\u2019s northern zone at press time, as blazes had consumed over 2.8 million hectares of forest. </p><p>While news outlets report the wildfires haven\u2019t touched any homes, Cree land users may have a different story. Keith Bearskin\u2019s large cabin went up in flames along with the family\u2019s boats, ATV and other gear. Like many others, the Chisasibi Cree Trappers\u2019 Association (CTA) president was uninsured.  </p><p>Only 262 cabins were insured under CTA\u2019s program, which is hindered by the challenges of gathering building details in the deep bush. Cree Board of Compensation chairman Derrick Neeposh suggested the fires will likely increase premiums or even prevent insurance coverage. </p><p>Waswanipi forestry consultant Allan Saganash is aware of some traplines that have been completely lost. Evacuated multiple times, Saganash has struggled with asthma exacerbated by the wildfire smoke and sickness from being away from traditional food. However, that doesn\u2019t compare to the heartbreak of witnessing the forest fire\u2019s devastating aftermath.  </p><p>\u201cAs I stood towards the charred land along the highway, sadness and a deathly silence fell upon me,\u201d Saganash shared. \u201cWhat was once a forest bustling of wildlife, the foliage making familiar sounds that only a hunter can understand, was all gone. Not only our traplines are lost but many of our camps which many of us consider our real homes.\u201d </p><p>Gull-Masty said that she\u2019s in discussions with the CTA to determine the impacts and next steps for securing potential recovery resources.

In order to dispose of yard waste and wood debris, it encourages using methods such as composting or using the local landfill. If you must burn, follow Ontario's outdoor burning regulations. Fires are to be ignited no sooner than two hours before sunset and extinguished no later than two hours after sunrise, and you should always have tools/water adequate to contain the fire at the site.</p><p>Know the rules for safe outdoor burning.

Her fear is based on a recently released report by the World Health Organization - the same group that has shown themselves incompetent (or worse) in the current pandemic situation - a group that has appeared to be helping cover for the Chinese government.</p><p>She uses catch phrases like \"according to the best available science,\"but she must be aware that scien- tific groups often are in error which is why the narrative around the pandemic keeps changing. Even the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) was caught red-handed in the past fudging the numbers of this \"best available science\"to fit their particular agenda.</p><p>She then expresses how \"shocked and frightened\"she was on a recent trip to Kelowna by the forest fire situation - by insinuation attributing it to climate change and demanding immediate action.</p><p>Neither Ms. Shafir nor I are scientists so we have to rely on others.</p><p>I would direct her attention to a trained scientist with a proven track record.</p><p>Patrick Moore, environmental activist and co- founder of Greenpeace, in his book, 'Fake Invisible Catastrophes and Threats of Doom', debunks the false claims that climate change is the cause of forest fires.</p><p>He produces data showing that in the early 1900s the forest fire situation in the U.S.was far worse than it is now.</p><p>So, to use this as an argument for increased government action is just nonsense. The real danger in all this is the effect this fear-mongering is having on our society and particularly on our youth.</p><p>Finally, I hope Ms. Shafir walked or rode a bike to B.C. - wouldn't flying just add to the problem she is demanding the rest of us take action on?

OF THAT<br/>TODAY WITH MELANIE JOLY TALKING<br/>ABOUT THEY HAVE TO CLARIFY AND<br/>THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS TO I<br/>GOER IF OUT BUT TRY AND CLARIFY<br/>WHAT THEY MEAN NOW IN TERMS OF<br/>EXCHANGE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT<br/>WITH ISRAEL.<br/>IF THEY TRIED THE CANADIANE SO<br/>OF MUSLIMS HAD THEM ACCEPT IT<br/>RATHER THAN AS IT IS, IT IS<br/>BECAUSE OF THAT PART ABOUT THE<br/>ARMS TRADE.<br/>THERE HAS BEEN PROTESTS ABOUT<br/>THAT IN THE LAST MONTHS.<br/>AND THAT IS SOMETHING IN THE<br/>MOTION THAT DOES CHANGE CANADIAN<br/>POLICY.<br/>THE REST, I AGREE WITH A LOT OF<br/>WHAT THE OTHERS HAVE SAID.<br/>UNCLEAR WHAT IT ACTUALLY<br/>CHANGES.<br/>BUT THAT PART WE COULD ALREADY<br/>SAY THAT IT CHANGE SOMETHING.<br/>NOW THE ISRAELI DEFENCE MINISTER<br/>WAS ALSO CALLING DIRECTLY THE<br/>PRIME MINISTER YESTERDAY AHEAD<br/>OF THAT VOTE TRYING TO PUSH THE<br/>LIBERALS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT<br/>THE MOTION THAT WAS JUST ASKED.<br/>I DON'T REMEMBER A TIME WHERE<br/>YOU HAD A FOREIGN MINISTER<br/>CALLING THE PRIME MINISTER ABOUT<br/>A MOTION ON OPPOSITION DAY.<br/>THERE IS A LEVEL OF POLITICAL<br/>TENSION IN THE HOUSE YESTERDAY<br/>IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THAT WE<br/>HAVE NEVER REALLY FELT BEFORE.<br/>AND YES, YOU HAVE THE SENSE OF<br/>BETRAYAL THAT HOUSEFATHER WAS<br/>JUST DESCRIBING, BUT THERE IS<br/>ALSO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WANTED<br/>CANADA TO RECOGNIZE THE<br/>PALESTINIAN STATE.<br/>THERE IS ALREADY 140 COUNTRIES<br/>IN THE WORLD WHO RECOGNIZE THE<br/>PALESTINIAN STATE.<br/>AND WANTED CANADA TO JOIN WHO<br/>ALSO FEEL BETRAYED BY THE<br/>ACCOMMODATION THAT THE NDP DID<br/>YESTERDAY AND DO NOT SEE THAT<br/>THE COMPROMISE THAT WAS REACHED<br/>WAS WORTH IT.<br/>AND SO THERE IS PEOPLE WHO FEEL<br/>DIVIDED AND WITHIN THE LIBERALS<br/>THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT<br/>NECESSARILY NDP MPS THEMSELVES<br/>BUT NDP SUPPORTERS WHO FEEL<br/>DISAPPOINTED WITH THE NDP, AND<br/>THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY ALSO PEOPLE<br/>WHO ARE VERY PROISRAEL WITHIN<br/>THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY BUT ALSO<br/>IN ISRAEL ITSELF WHO ALSO FEEL<br/>DISAPPOINTED BY WHAT HAPPENED<br/>LAST NIGHT.<br/>AND SO NOBODY IS HAPPY.<br/>AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN<br/>CANADA HAS BEEN HAPPY ON THIS<br/>ISSUE FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTH.<br/>AND IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME<br/>BEFORE THE DIVISIONS THAT WE<br/>HAVE BEEN SEEING IN THIS SOCIETY<br/>REACHED THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN<br/>A WAY THAT IT HAS REACHED THE<br/>HOUSE OF COMMONS LAST NIGHT.<br/>BUT REALLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT<br/>IS DIVIDING LINES ACROSS CANADA.<br/>OF COURSE IT IS ALSO HAPPENING<br/>ACROSS PARTY LINES IN THE HOUSE<br/>OF COMMONS.<br/>AND IT'S NOT JUST THE LIBERAL<br/>POLICY THAT HAS CHANGED.<br/>IT'S GAZA THAT HAS CHANGED.<br/>THERE HAVE BEEN 30,000 PEOPLE<br/>DEAD, THAT UNIVERSITY DESTROYED.<br/>OF COURSE THAT EARTHQUAKE THAT<br/>HAPPENED IN GAZA IN THE LAST<br/>FIVE MONTHS IS BOUND TO HAVE AN<br/>IMPACT ON HOW CANADIANS SEE THIS<br/>AND THEREFORE ALSO HOW THE HOUSE<br/>OF COMMONS REACTS TO THIS.<br/>   David: THOSE ARE ALL VERY<br/>GOOD POINTS.<br/>AND, MICHELE, I WONDER WHEN YOU<br/>LOOK AT THAT ANALYSIS THAT<br/>SUPPORTERS OF ISRAEL ARE ANGRY<br/>ABOUT THIS.<br/>BUT YET THE MOTION IN MANY WAYS<br/>HAS CHANGED TO THE POINT WHERE<br/>IT IS UNCLEAR OR THEY MOVED AWAY<br/>FROM THAT OFFICIAL RECOGNITION<br/>OF THE PALESTINIAN STATE.<br/>AND SORT OFFERERS OF THAT ARE<br/>UNDERSTANDABLY DISAPPOINTED IN<br/>THIS COMPROMISE.<br/>WHAT WAS THE VALUE OF THIS OWNER<br/>INFLATING THIS AND CREATING<br/>ANOTHER FAULT POINT WITHIN<br/>CANADIAN SOCIETY ON THIS ISSUE<br/>AND IN PARLIAMENT AND INSIDE THE<br/>LIBERAL CAUCUS?<br/>   YOU KNOWR ANY OTHER ISSUE I<br/>WOULD MAKE A GLIB COMMENT.<br/>BUT I AM GOING, I CAN'T ON THIS<br/>ONE.<br/>I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR T DOESN'T<br/>CHANGE THE LIBERALS' POSITION ON<br/>ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST AND<br/>DEFEND ITSELF AND A NEGOTIATED<br/>TWO-STATE SOLUTION.<br/>IT ALSO CALLS UPON HAMAS TO LAY<br/>DOWN ITS ARMS AND RELEASE ALL<br/>THE PRISONERS.<br/>NONE OF THAT HAS CHANGED.<br/>THAT REMAINS TRUE TO WHAT THE<br/>LIBERALS HAVE STOOD FOR.<br/>THAT HAVE REMAINS TRUE TO WHAT<br/>CANADA HAS STOOD FOR ON THE<br/>WORLD STAGE FOR A VERY LONG<br/>TIME.<br/>NOW, ALL THAT BEING SAID, THERE<br/>IS A LOT OF LANGUAGE IN THERE<br/>THAT IS UNCOMPREHENSIBLE RIGHT<br/>NOW AND NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED.<br/>IT IS NOT GREAT THAT, YOU KNOW,<br/>OTHER COUNTRIES ARE CALLING IN<br/>AND TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS<br/>IS.<br/>AND IT'S ALSO AN INCREDIBLY ODD<br/>WAY TO CHANGE GOVERNMENT POLICY<br/>IF THAT INDEED IS WHAT THE<br/>GOVERNMENT IS DOING.<br/>FOR THE LIFE OF ME, I DON'T<br/>UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE HOPING<br/>TO GAIN OUT OF THIS.<br/>AND NOW I THINK THAT THEY HAVE<br/>GOT, YOU KNOW, A WHOLE LOT OF<br/>WORK TO DO TO TRY AND IRON THIS<br/>UP.<br/>NOW, IF THEIR INTENT IN THE<br/>FIRST PLACE WAS TO MOVE DOWN A<br/>PATH TO CHANGE SOME PART OF<br/>GOVERNMENT POLICY, AGAIN THIS IS<br/>A BIZARRE WAY TO ROLL THAT OUT.<br/>I THINK THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE<br/>IT IN A MUCH CLEANER WAY AND<br/>BRIEFING A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS<br/>AND CAUCUS AHEAD OF TIME.<br/>SO, YOU KNOW, I AM SKEPTICAL.<br/>   David: YEAH, THAT'S A VERY<br/>GOOD POINT BECAUSE, KATE, WE<br/>HAVE THE NDP FOREIGN AFFAIRS<br/>CRITIC WHO INTERPRETS IT ONE<br/>WAY.<br/>ANTHONY HOUSEFATHER INTERPRETS<br/>IT THE OTHER WAY SAYING IT WAS<br/>EXPLAINED TO HIM DIFFERENTLY<br/>FROM THE DEFENCE MINISTER BILL<br/>BLAIR.<br/>I HAVE ONE READING OF THE<br/>LANGUAGE.<br/>I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOURS IS WHEN<br/>IT COMES TO THE ARMS ISSUE.<br/>IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE THE NDP HAD<br/>THAT PART OF THE RESOLUTION ALSO<br/>WATERED DOWN LAST NIGHT.<br/>BUT THEY ARE NOW CLAIMING IT AS<br/>A VICTORY BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY<br/>HAVE BEEN TOLD, HOW IT WILL BE<br/>IMPLEMENTED BY THE FOREIGN<br/>AFFAIRS MINISTER.<br/>AND THAT IS A WEIRD SET FOR THE<br/>CABINET MINISTER TO ANNOUNCE<br/>POLICY.<br/>   AND TO NOT CONCEIVABLY BRIEF<br/>HER COLLEAGUES WHO ARE MOST<br/>LIKELY TO TAKE UMBRAGE WITH THE<br/>MOTION AND EXPLAIN TO THEM IN<br/>PAINSTAKING DETAIL WHAT IT<br/>MEANS.<br/>I THINK MELANIE JOLY OWES THAT<br/>TO HER CAUCUS COLLEAGUES RATHER<br/>THAN TO HEATHER MCPHERSON.<br/>I AM LEFT TO MICHELE'S POINT<br/>WONDERING WHO IS WINNING OUT OF<br/>THIS ARRANGEMENT BECAUSE THE<br/>LIBERALS HAVE CREATED THAT<br/>DIVISION WITHIN THEIR CAUCUS<br/>COLLEAGUES LIKE WE SAW THROUGH<br/>THOSE TORTURED COMMENTS I THINK<br/>YOU SAID THROUGH ANTHONY<br/>HOUSEFATHER.<br/>I THINK THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO<br/>DESCRIBE IT.<br/>BUT FOR THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE<br/>OF THIS ISSUE, IT IS A WATERED<br/>DOWN MOTION.<br/>IT IS NOT GOING AS FAR AS THE<br/>INITIAL NDP MOTION DID.<br/>SO I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE<br/>LIBERALS WILL BE ABLE TO CLAIM<br/>VICTORY OR CLAIM CREDIT.<br/>I THINK THIS WAS MORE ABOUT<br/>SATISFYING IMMEDIATE POLITICAL<br/>NEEDS THAT THEY HAD TO AROUND<br/>THE CAUCUS TABLE AS OPPOSED TO<br/>TAKING A LONG-TERM DEAL.<br/>   David: SO FRANCOISE, I HAVE<br/>TEXTED MELANIE JOLY'S OFFICE<br/>SEEKING CLARIFICATION.<br/>YOU CAN'T SEE IT, BUT THERE IS A<br/>SERIES OF SCREENS UP THERE ONE<br/>OF WHICH IS A CAMERA OUTSIDE THE<br/>CABINET ROOM WHERE THEY ARE<br/>MEETING RIGHT NOW.<br/>WHAT IF SHE SAYS IT'S NOT WHAT<br/>HEATHER MCPHERSON THINKS?<br/>THAT IS IT EXISTING ARMS<br/>CONTRACTS.<br/>THERE IS SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY<br/>HERE.<br/>CAN ANYBODY SAY THEY<br/>ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING WITH THIS?<br/>BECAUSE IT ALL DEPENDS ON AN<br/>UNENFORCEABLE MOTION BEING<br/>ADHERED TO BY A CABINET THAT IS<br/>NOT TECHNICALLY BEHOLD TON THE<br/>NDP ON THIS?<br/>   I SUSPECT THAT MELANIE JOLY<br/>WITH THE EXPERIENCE SHE HAS<br/>RIGHT NOW IS STARTING TO REALLY,<br/>REALLY TALK LIKE A DIPLOMAT<br/>WHICH MEANS SAYING LOTS OF WORDS<br/>THAT MOST OF THE TIME WE'RE NOT<br/>SO SURE OF WHAT EXACTLY SHE IS<br/>SAYING.<br/>AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF ANSWER<br/>YOU WILL PROBABLY GET ON THE<br/>VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION.<br/>IS WHAT SHE SAID, DO YOU AGREE<br/>OR NOT?<br/>WE WILL HAVE SOME LONG LININGS<br/>LIKE I DO ALL THE TIME JUST TO<br/>SAY, YOU KNOW, PRETTY MUCH<br/>NOTHING AND EVERYTHING BECAUSE<br/>THE LIBERALS CANNOT SAY NOT AT<br/>ALL BECAUSE THEN WE RESTART THE<br/>DRAMA.<br/>AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THE<br/>LIBERALS WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS<br/>IS TO GET OUT OF IT AS QUICKLY<br/>AS POSSIBLE.<br/>I AM SURE THEY ARE HAPPY TODAY<br/>TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE CARBON<br/>TAX.<br/>WHAT A RELIEF.<br/>   David: WELL, MAYBE.<br/>WE'RE GHG TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN<br/>JUST A SECOND, BUT EMILIEISH ONE<br/>THOUGHT FROM YOU BECAUSE I WENT<br/>OVERTIME ON THIS AND I APOLOGIZE<br/>TO THE CONTROL ROOM.<br/>WE NEED THIS CLARITY FROM THE<br/>CABINET AND THE GOVERNMENT IN<br/>TERMS OF HOW THEY WILL ENFORCE<br/>THIS.<br/>THIS IS TO GO UNRESOLVED FOR TOO<br/>LONG.<br/>   NO.<br/>BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT CANNOT<br/>BE RESOLVED AS LONG AS THE<br/>CONFLICT ISN'T RESOLVED ITSELF<br/>BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN THE POSITIONS<br/>HAVE BEEN SHIFTING FROM<br/>DEMANDING NO CEASEFIRE TO<br/>DEMANDING A CEASEFIRE TO<br/>CREATING A PROGRAM THAT WAS<br/>CAPPED AT 1,000 PEOPLE, AND<br/>THERE HAVE BEEN CRITICISM<br/>BECAUSE NOBODY HAS ACTUALLY BEEN<br/>ABLE TO ENTER THE COUNTRY WITH<br/>THAT PROGRAM FOR PALESTINIANS TO<br/>BE IN GAZA WITH FAMILY IN<br/>CANADA.<br/>THERE IS SOME LANGUAGE IN THAT<br/>MOTION ABOUT INCREASING THAT<br/>CAP.<br/>THERE IS A LOT OF ISSUES, A LOT<br/>OF THINGS THAT ARE EVOLVING AS<br/>THE SITUATION IN GAZA IS<br/>EVOLVING.<br/>SO WHEN I HEAR WE WANT TO PUT<br/>THE ISSUE ASIDE, THE U.N. IS NOW<br/>WARNING THAT A MILLION PEOPLE<br/>NOW ARE AT SEVERE RISK OF<br/>STARVATION.<br/>SO IF WE'RE STARTING TO SEE<br/>IMAGES, AND WE'RE ALREADY<br/>STARTING TO SEE IMAGES OF PEOPLE<br/>STARVING TO DEATH, CHILDREN<br/>STARVING TO DEATH.<br/>BUT IF WE'RE -- OF CHILDREN<br/>STARVING TO DEATH, FAMILIES<br/>STARVING TO DEATH, THAT IS ALSO<br/>ANOTHER POLITICAL SHOCK WAVE<br/>THAT IS GOING TO COME.<br/>SO NOT JUST CANADA BUHARI ALSO<br/>THE UNITED STATES AND ALSO HAVE<br/>A CHANGE ON POLICY.<br/>SO IT MAY BE CHANGE FOR A COUPLE<br/>OF DAYS BUT AS SOON AS THERE IS<br/>SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS OVER<br/>THERE THAT SHOCKS PEOPLE'S<br/>IMAGINATION, IT IS BOUND TO HAVE<br/>THAT FILE COME UP AGAIN IN A WAY<br/>THAT'S YET GOING TO BE VERY,<br/>VERY EMOTIONAL.<br/>SO AS LONG AS THE ISSUE ISN'T<br/>SOLVED OVER THERET WILL KEEP<br/>IMPACTING CANADIANS IN CANADA,<br/>AND THERE IS NO WAY FOR THAT TO<br/>JUST BE OFF THE RADAR AND USE IT<br/>AS DOMESTIC ISSUE TO, YOU KNOW,<br/>BURY THAT FIRE.<br/>THAT IS NOT SUCH AN ISSUE.<br/>THIS IS NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL.<br/>   David: NO.<br/>I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND JUST<br/>TO LET YOU KNOW WE ARE WATCHING<br/>CABINET AND BRING YOU ANY<br/>CLARITY WHEN IT BREAKS UP.<br/>WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK<br/>BECAUSE WE WILL CHANGE TOPICS.<br/>THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION IS<br/>CALLING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO<br/>SCRAP THE APRIL 1 CARBON TAX<br/>INCREASE.<br/>STOP ME IF YOU HEARD THAT ONE<br/>BEFORE.<br/>THE POWER PANEL NEXT ON WHETHER<br/>THE GOVERNMENT CAN BRING BACK<br/>CANADIANS WITH REBATES ANNOUNCED<br/>TODAY.<br/>PLUS HOW DOES INFLATION FACTOR<br/>INTO THIS?<br/>STAY WITH US.<br/>   David: THE FEDERAL CARBON<br/>TAX GOES UP IN LESS THAN TWO<br/>WEEKS, AND THE PRESSURE<br/>CONTINUES ON THE LIBERAL<br/>GOVERNMENT TO CANCEL IT GIVEN<br/>THE HIGH COST OF LIVING.<br/>   THE PARLIAMENTARY BUDGET<br/>OFFICER CONFIRMS THAT IN EVERY<br/>SINGLE PROVINCE, CANADIANS PAY<br/>FAR MORE IN TAXES THAN THEY GET<br/>BACK IN REBATES, A TAX THAT WILL<br/>GO UP 23 PERCENT.<br/>TODAY COMMON SENSE CONSERVATIVES<br/>ARE CALLING FOR THE PRIME<br/>MINISTER TO GRANT HIS CAUCUS A<br/>FREE VOTE ON OUR MOTION TO SPIKE<br/>THE HIKE.<br/>   Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau:<br/>THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION<br/>WANTS TO TAKE AWAY A CANADA<br/>CARBON REBATE CHEQUE THAT LANDS<br/>IN THE POCKETS OF FAMILIES<br/>ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHERE THE<br/>PRICE ON POLLUTION IS IN PLACE<br/>BECAUSE 8 OUT OF 10 OF THEM DO<br/>BETTER WITH THE PRICE ON<br/>POLLUTION AND THE CANADA CARBON<br/>REBATE THAN THEY WOULD.<br/>   David: SO THIS DEBATE IS<br/>RAGING IN CANADA JUST AS ALARMS<br/>RING OUT OVER THE PACE OF<br/>CLIMATE CHANGE.<br/>THE UNITED NATIONS WEATHER<br/>AGENCY SAID TODAY THAT EVERY<br/>MAJOR GLOBAL CLIMATE RECORD WAS<br/>BROKEN LAST YEAR.<br/>NEAR CANADA THIS PAST WINTER WAS<br/>THE WARMEST EVER.<br/>SO HOW WILL CANADIANS SEE THIS<br/>DEBATE?<br/>GOING TO BRING BACK THE POWER<br/>PANEL ON THAT.<br/>EMILIE NICOLAS, MICHELE CADARIO,<br/>FRANCOISE BOIVIN, AND KATE<br/>HARRISON.<br/>KATE, I WANT TO START WITH YOU.<br/>IT'S VERY CLEAR WHAT PIERRE<br/>POILIEVRE WON'T DO.<br/>AT SOME POINT HE HAS TO TELL<br/>CANADIANS WHAT HE WILL DO WHEN<br/>IT COMES TO CLIMATE, DOESN'T HE?<br/>   YEAH.<br/>STILL POLLS TOP FOUR, FIVE<br/>ISSUES WITH CANADIANS.<br/>THERE WAS A TIME IT WAS A LOT<br/>HIGHER THAN THAT WHEN THE CARBON<br/>TAX WAS INTRODUCED.<br/>NOW THAT THINGS HAVE SHIFTED<br/>TOWARDS AFFORDABILITY AND THE<br/>ECONOMY, THAT HAS UNDERSTANDABLY<br/>FALLEN.<br/>I DO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT<br/>THERE IS SURVIVABILITY TO A<br/>CONSUMER CARBON TAX.<br/>YOU SEE NOW LIBERAL LEADER<br/>BONNIE CROMBIE IN ONTARIO SAYING<br/>IT IS NOT SOMETHING SHE WOULD<br/>SUPPORT.<br/>OBVIOUSLY CONSERVATIVE PREMIERES<br/>AND LIBERAL PREMIER IN<br/>NEWFOUNDLAND HAS SAID IT'S NOT<br/>SOMETHING HE SUPPORTS EITHER<br/>JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T SUPPORT A<br/>CARBON TAX DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN<br/>HAVE NO POSITION ON THE<br/>ENVIRONMENT.<br/>I THINK THAT WILL BE AN<br/>EXPECTATION AT SOME POINT.<br/>THE BUT I ALSO THINK<br/>CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN READYING<br/>FOR THIS AS WELL.<br/>YOU HAVE SEEN IT AT THE<br/>PROVINCIAL LEVEL WITH<br/>ALTERNATIVES THAT WERE PROPOSED<br/>AND SHOT DOWN BY OTTAWA IN TERMS<br/>OF MEETING EMISSIONS REDUCTION<br/>TARGETS WITHOUT A CARBON TAX.<br/>   David: THEY DIDN'T MEET THE<br/>STRINTENT REQUIREMENTS.<br/>THIS HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THE<br/>JOB BASICALLY.<br/>   INDEED.<br/>BUT WE ALSO HAVEN'T HIT OUR OWN<br/>EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS<br/>DESPITE THAT STRINGENT<br/>APPLICATION BS FROM OTTAWA.<br/>IT'S NOT AS THOUGH CONSERVATIVES<br/>AREN'T READY TO TALK ABOUT THESE<br/>THINGS.<br/>THEY HAVE HAD YEARS AND YEARS TO<br/>PREPARE FOR AN EVENTUALITY<br/>WITHOUT A CARBON TAX.<br/>BUT FOR NOW, IT'S BEEN A<br/>SUCCESSFUL WEDGE IN TERMS OF<br/>TRYING TO DRAW CONTRAST ON THIS<br/>POLICY AT A TIME WHEN<br/>AFFORDABILITY IS THE TOP ISSUE.<br/>   David: AND, MICHELE, LOOK.<br/>THE COUNTRY HASN'T YET HIT THE<br/>TARGETS BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE<br/>FUTURE.<br/>BUT THEY'RE ON TRACK TO HIT THE<br/>2026 INTERIM TARGET AS I<br/>UNDERSTAND IT AND 2030 STILL OUT<br/>OF REACH BUT WITHIN STRIKING<br/>DISTANCE IS HOW THEY DESCRIBE<br/>IT.<br/>SO YOU CAN DO THIS WITHOUT A<br/>CARBON TAX.<br/>CHRIS REGAN FROM THE ECOFISCAL<br/>COMMISSION WAS ON THE SHOW<br/>SAYING THAT LAST WEEK, BUT YOU<br/>HAVE TO DO OTHER THINGS IF YOU<br/>DON'T DO THAT.<br/>THAT'S WHERE YOU GET INTO<br/>INDUSTRIAL AND REGULATION RULES<br/>THAT MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE AND<br/>COSTLY.<br/>SO HOW DO YOU THINK -- BACK TO<br/>MY QUESTION ON WE KNOW WHAT THE<br/>CONSERVATIVES WON'T DO.<br/>HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THEY CAN<br/>GO WITHOUT SAYING WHAT THEY WILL<br/>DO?<br/>AND WILL IT MATTER WITH<br/>CANADIANS?<br/>   RCHTS YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW<br/>HE'S GONNA RIDE THIS FOR AS LONG<br/>AS HE POSSIBLY CAN.<br/>HE'S GOT AN EASY MESSAGE TO<br/>SPIKE THE HIKE.<br/>YOU KNOW, IT RHYMES,S AND, YOU<br/>KNOW, WHY NOT.<br/>IT GOES ON A LAWN SIGN VERY<br/>EASILY.<br/>AND IT'S SIMPLE.<br/>CANADIANS BELIEVE RIGHTLY THAT<br/>WHEN YOU ARE TAXED, YOU PAY<br/>MORE.<br/>AND NO MATTER HOW THE LIBERALS<br/>HAVE TRIED TO REFRAME IT, THEY<br/>DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO BREAK<br/>THAT BARRIER THAT, YOU KNOW, THE<br/>IDEA THAT IF YOU'RE GETTING A<br/>REBATE THAT IT IS ACTUALLY MORE<br/>THAN COMPENSATING FOR THE TAX<br/>YOU'RE PAYING.<br/>THEY HAVE LOST THAT BATTLE.<br/>AND NOW THEY'RE GONNA FACE NOT<br/>JUST ONE BUT ANOTHER, A SECOND,<br/>YOU KNOW, TAX INCREASE ON THE<br/>CARBON TAX BEFORE THE ELECTION<br/>CAMPAIGN.<br/>   David: M-HM.<br/>   SO THEY HAVE GOT TO THIRG<br/>THIS OUT.<br/>AND I THINK THAT UNTIL THEY MAKE<br/>A DECISION.<br/>YOU KNOW, THERE'S THIS INCREASE<br/>AND THEN THERE'S THE NEXT ONE TO<br/>FIGHT.<br/>WE'RE GIVING POILIEVRE AN EXTRA<br/>BATTLE TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON<br/>WHICH ALLOWS HIM TO DEVIATE AND<br/>DANCE AND NOT ACTUALLY HAVE TO<br/>TALK ABOUT WHAT HE'S GOING TO<br/>DO.<br/>I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO BE<br/>PUT ON THE SPOT FOR QUITE SOME<br/>TIME BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE HAS<br/>THE FIRST OF ALL, WE'RE ALMOST,<br/>YOU KNOW, A YEAR AND A HALF FROM<br/>AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN, SO THERE'S<br/>STILL QUITE SOME TIME.<br/>FAIR ENOUGH.<br/>BUT ALSO THERE'S NO KIND OF<br/>PINPOINTING HIM ON ANYTHING WHEN<br/>THE TOPICAL ISSUE AND THE ISSUE<br/>THAT CANADIANS ARE KIND OF<br/>AGGRIEVED ABOUT RIGHT NOW AND<br/>DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS<br/>ACTUALLY BENEFITING THEM IS KIND<br/>OF UNEXPLAINABLE, AND IT'S STILL<br/>OUT THERE.<br/>SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT HE'S<br/>KIND OF GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF<br/>A FREE PASS RIGHT NOW.<br/>   David: YEAH.<br/>AND SOME OF THAT LOOK IS YOU<br/>DON'T DO INTERVIEWS.<br/>YOU TAKE FIVE QUESTIONS WITHOUT<br/>FOLLOW-UPS IN PRESS CONFERENCES.<br/>IT'S HARD TO GET THAT SORT OF<br/>PRECISION.<br/>BUT, YOU KNOW, EMILIE WE GOT NEW<br/>INFLATION NUMBERS TODAY.<br/>IT'S DOWN TO 2.8 PERCENT, AND FOOD<br/>INFLATION WAS EVEN LOWER AT 2.4 PERCENT<br/>SO, FOOD PRICES ARE STILL GOING<br/>UP BUT DEACCELERATING AT A RATE<br/>WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE 2021, AND<br/>THAT'S WITH THE CARBON TAX STILL<br/>IN PLACE BECAUSE LARGELY IT IS<br/>ACTUALLY GLOBAL FACTORS NOT<br/>CARBON POLICY THAT AFFECTS FOOD<br/>PRICES.<br/>IT IS ANYWHERE FROM 15 TO 30<br/>CENTS ON A HUNDRED DOLLARS<br/>DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU USE<br/>DIRECT OR KNOCK-ON EFFECTS OF<br/>CARBON PRICING.<br/>SO AT A CERTAIN POINT THIS<br/>CONVERSATION HAS TO REALLY BE<br/>ABOUT THOSE FACTS AND THE<br/>ALTERNATIVES RATHER THAN JUST<br/>SORT OF THE NARRATIVE AROUND<br/>RHYMING CUPLETS OF POLICY.<br/>   IT HAS TO BE ABOUT THE FACTS,<br/>BUT AT THE SAME TIME THOSE<br/>POLICIES ARE ALWAYS ABOUT THE<br/>FEELINGS AND THE PERCEPTION OF<br/>WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE FEEL LIKE<br/>THEY ARE DOING WELL ENOUGH IN<br/>TERMS  OF HOW THEY EXPECT TO DO<br/>WELL AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY<br/>FEEL LIKE GOVERNMENT IS GIVING<br/>THEM WHAT THEY DESERVE.<br/>THE AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT<br/>PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE A<br/>VERY DIFFERENT IDEA OF WHAT THEY<br/>THINK THEY DESERVE.<br/>BUT RIGHT NOW THE FOCUS IS ON<br/>AFFORDABILITY.<br/>ITS ALSO BECAUSE THE WINTER HAS<br/>BEEN INCREDIBLY WARM AND<br/>CANADIANS ARE NOT COMPLAINING<br/>ABOUT THAT ON AVERAGE.<br/>WHEN THE SUMMER IS GONNA HIT,<br/>WHEN WE LOOK AT THE GRAPH, WE<br/>ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WARMEST<br/>YEAR EVER.<br/>IT'S 2024 LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING<br/>TO MAKE 2023 AND THE FOREST FIRE<br/>THAT WERE HISTORIC AND MADE<br/>FRONT PAGES IN GLOBAL NEWSPAPER<br/>AND MEDIA OUTLETS AROUND THE<br/>WORLD.<br/>WE'RE ON TRACK TO HAVE A 2024<br/>YEAR THAT IS OFF THE CHARTS EVEN<br/>COMPARED TO LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF<br/>THE EL NINO PHENOMENON.<br/>AND SO PEOPLE'S SENSIBILITY<br/>AROUND ARE WE DOING TOO MUCH OR<br/>NOT ENOUGH ON CLIMATE CHANGE<br/>ALSO DEPENDS ON THAT.<br/>THE ELECTION IS NOT TOMORROW.<br/>IF YOU DO HAVE EXTREME WEATHER<br/>EVENTS COMING THIS YEAR AS IT<br/>LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE<br/>THEM,ICS IT DOES IMPACT HOW<br/>PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THEN BE<br/>CONSIDERING WHAT IS A GOOD<br/>CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY OR NOT.<br/>NOW, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE<br/>LIBERALS DO NOT HAVE TO EXPLAIN<br/>WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN A<br/>CARBON TAX AND ACTUALLY REACHING<br/>OUR TARGET FOR CARBON EMISSION<br/>AND WHAT IS IT THAT A CARBON TAX<br/>ACTUALLY DOES FOR THE EARTH.<br/>THAT IS STILL UNCLEAR FOR A LOT<br/>OF CANADIANS.<br/>BUT AS, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE<br/>THINKING THAT THIS IS TOO MUCH<br/>BECAUSE WE'RE NOT, THEY'RE<br/>THINKING ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AS<br/>SOMETHING THAT IS RANKING HIGHER<br/>THAN CLIMATE CHANGE, THE ONLY<br/>THING THAT CAN CHANGE THAT, IT'S<br/>NOT NECESSARILY JUST THE<br/>INFLATION RATES GOING DOWN.<br/>IT'S ALSO THE CLIMATE GOING<br/>BONKERS IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE<br/>WILL HAVE TO KNOW THIS THAT THIS<br/>IS NOT SOMETHING THE LIBERALS<br/>ARE MAKING UP.<br/>   David: YEAH.<br/>AND FRANCOISE, EMILIE IS RIGHT<br/>WHEN SHE SAYS THE LIBERALS HAVE<br/>TO EXPLAIN THEMSELVES BETTER.<br/>WE HAD CATHERINE MCKENNA ON THE<br/>SHOW SAYING THEY HAVE TO STAND<br/>UP FOR THEMSELVES, RIGHT.<br/>NO ONE IS GOING TO DO IT FOR<br/>THEM.<br/>WE SAW A LITTLE BIT OF THAT<br/>TODAY WHERE A BUNCH OF MINISTERS<br/>AND MPS CAME UP TO THE<br/>MICROPHONE TO DEFEND THE REBATE,<br/>AND THEY'RE JUST FLAT OUT<br/>CALLING PIERRE POILIEVRE A LIAR<br/>RIGHT NOW.<br/>THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T<br/>SEEN FROM THE LIBERALS.<br/>THEY ARE USING IT IN ADS ONLINE,<br/>IN VIDEOS THEY DO.<br/>AND THEY'RE JUST FLAT OUT<br/>CALLING HIM DISHONEST.<br/>   WELL, GET OUT OF MY HEAD,<br/>DAVID, BECAUSE I WAS GONNA<br/>START --<br/>   David: SORRY.<br/>   FINALLY THEY GOT BLOODY WELL<br/>OUT TO EXPLAIN, TO EXPLAIN HOW<br/>CARBON REBATES ARE AFFORDABILITY<br/>MEASURES.<br/>I WAS LISTENING TO THEM TODAY,<br/>AND, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF WHAT I<br/>WAS THINKING ONE THING.<br/>I WAS THINKING THERE'S SUCH A<br/>THING THAT.<br/>TOO CAN BE NOT ENOUGH.<br/>AS BAD AS NOT ENOUGH.<br/>AND WITH THE CONSERVATIVES<br/>HAMMERING AND HAMMERING ON AXE<br/>THE TAX, AXE THE TAX, THINGS<br/>THAT I SHALL INLY PEOPLE JUST<br/>SAY I AGREE WITH THEM, I AGREE<br/>WITH THEM.<br/>THEN START THE DETAIL.<br/>THE INFORMATION AND SO ON AND SO<br/>FORTH.<br/>NOW EVEN MYSELF CAN SAY HEY,<br/>THERE'S EIGHT FAMILIES OUT OF<br/>TEN WHO GETS MORE MONEY.<br/>NOW THE PHRASE IS RESONATING IS<br/>OUR COLLECTIVE HEAD.<br/>THAT'S THE REBATE THAT PEOPLE<br/>ARE GETTING.<br/>I'M WITH EMILIE, THOUGH.<br/>THEY STILL CAN'T ANSWER THE<br/>QUESTION, THE FUNDAMENTAL<br/>QUESTION HOW DOES A TAX OR AN<br/>AMOUNT ON POLLUTION REDUCE IT.<br/>IF YOU PAY BACK THE PEOPLE THAT<br/>ARE USING THE STUFF?<br/>THEY HAVE TO BE A BIT CLEARER<br/>BECAUSE I KNOW HOW IT WORKS, AND<br/>I KNOW WHY MINISTER GUILBEAULT<br/>SAYS IT DOES.<br/>BUT TELL US PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT<br/>HAVE WORKED 50 YEARS ON THE FILE<br/>LIKE YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN<br/>BASICALLY THE IMPACT OF WHAT<br/>YOU'RE DOING.<br/>SO THEY'RE STARTING, AND THANK<br/>YOU CONSERVATIVES.<br/>THAT'S WHAT THE LIBERALS SHOULD<br/>SAY EVEN TODAY.<br/>I DO HOPE THEY ARE TAKING THE<br/>FULL DAY TO DEAL WITH THE<br/>FALSEHOODS THAT ARE BEING SAID,<br/>TO SHOW THEY HAVE A BIT MORE<br/>MEAT AROUND THE BONE AND SO SHOW<br/>THE EMPTINESS AND END UP ON THE<br/>PHRASE THAT TRUDEAU SAID DURING<br/>QP TODAY WHEN HE SAID THE<br/>CONSERVATIVES, THEY HAVE NO PLAN<br/>FOR THE FUTURE AND NO MONEY FOR<br/>CANADIANS.<br/>I AM THINKING, WOW, WHAT A NICE<br/>SLOGAN TO PUT IN THEIR FACE.<br/>THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT SIX<br/>MONTHS AGO, MAYBE A YEAR AGO<br/>WHEN PIERRE POILIEVRE GOT<br/>ELECTED AS LEADER.<br/>THEY'RE FINALLY CLUEING IN IT<br/>TAKES PEOPLE LIKE CATHERINE<br/>MCKENNA ON YOUR SHOW TO TELL<br/>THEM WHAT TO DO.<br/>BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.<br/>   David: I DON'T KNOW IF WHAT<br/>THEY DID TODAY WAS BECAUSE OF<br/>WHAT CATHERINE K MANY KENNA<br/>SAID.<br/>THERE IS A RECOGNITION, YOU<br/>KNOW, EVEN AMONGST LIBERAL<br/>STAFFERS IN OTTAWA THAT THEY<br/>NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB ON THIS.<br/>I JUST WONDER THIS AGGRESSION.<br/>IT'S NEGATIVE POLITICS THAT THEY<br/>KIND OF SHIED AWAY FROM EARLIER.<br/>LIKE YOU WILL CAN AING THE GUY A<br/>LIER WAS NOT SOMETHING I THINK<br/>THEY WOULD HAVE CONTEMPLATED A<br/>YEAR AGO.<br/>   YEAH.<br/>IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE LOSING THE<br/>COMMUNICATIONS BATTLE ON THIS.<br/>WE HAVE HAD NINE YEARS TO DEBATE<br/>THE EFFICACY AND TO EXPLAIN AS<br/>CATHERINE MCKENNA WAS URGING HER<br/>FORMER COLLEAGUESED TO, AND IT<br/>HASN'T WORKED.<br/>THEY HAVE EITHER NOT TAKEN THE<br/>OPPORTUNITY OR THE EXPLANATIONS<br/>ACTUALLY AREN'T ALL THAT GOOD.<br/>AND TO MICHELE'S POINT, THIS IS<br/>A BATTLE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO<br/>HAVE TO FIGHT YET AGAIN NEXT<br/>YEAR AHEAD OF THE NEXT ELECTION.<br/>I AM FASCINATED TO SEE HOW THIS<br/>MIGHT PLAY AT ALL IN THE B.C.<br/>ELECTION.<br/>YOU HEARD PREMIER DAVID EBY COME<br/>OUT PRETTY STAUNCHLY.<br/>   David: POILIEVRE BARGING<br/>INTO THAT JURISDICTION WITH A<br/>BIG STICK.<br/>   AND BACK AGAIN TODAY RUNNING<br/>ADVERTISEMENTS AGAINST PREMIER<br/>EBY OR PUTTING THINGS OUT ON<br/>SOCIAL MEDIA AS A BIG FAVOUR TO<br/>JOHN RUSTAD.<br/>BUT VERY CURIOUS TO SEE HOW<br/>THERE MIGHT BE SOME MOVEMENT ON<br/>THIS ISSUE BASED ON WHAT HAPPENS<br/>IN B.C. THIS FALL.<br/>   David: I WANT TO SHOW YOU<br/>WHAT YOU ARE SEEING THERE ON THE<br/>CORNER OF THE SCREEN.<br/>THAT IS THE MULRONEY FAMILY<br/>LEAVING THE SIR JOHN A.<br/>MACDONALD  BUILDING.<br/>THAT IS WHERE BRIAN MULRONEY,<br/>CANADA'S 18th PRIME MINISTER,<br/>HAS BEEN LYING IN STATE AS WE<br/>BEGIN THE FORMAL PROCESS OF THE<br/>COUNTRY AND THE FAMILY SAYING<br/>FAREWELL TO THE MAN WHO WAS THE<br/>PRIME MINISTER OF THIS COUNTRY<br/>FOR NINE YEARS FROM 1994 TO<br/>1993.<br/>THAT IS I BELIEVE NICHOLAS<br/>MULRONEY IF MY EYES ARE NOT<br/>DISIEFING ME WOULD BE THE<br/>YOUNGEST OF THE FOUR CHILDREN<br/>GETTING READY TO GET INTO THE<br/>SUV.<br/>WE SAW HIS MOTHER MILA.<br/>WE SAW BEN.<br/>WE SAW MARK AND CAROLINE<br/>MULRONEY ALL LEAVING.<br/>AND THERE WILL BE VISITATION<br/>TOMORROW BETWEEN 9 AND 1.<br/>I HAD TO SAY THE MULRONEY FAMILY<br/>WERE THERE ALL DAY.<br/>THEY STAYED.<br/>THEY TOOK SHIFTS BECAUSE<br/>STANDING AND SHAKING THAT MANY<br/>HANDS IN THAT EMOTIONAL CONTEXT<br/>IS A DIFFICULT THING TO DO.<br/>BUT THEY STAYED THERE ALL DAY.<br/>WHEN I WAS ON HERE EARLIER WITH<br/>ROSEMARY BARTON AND BONNIE<br/>BROWNLY WHO WAS A CLOSE FAMILY<br/>FRIEND AND ASSISTANT, SHE TALKED<br/>ABOUT THEM WANTING TO DO THAT<br/>FOR THE FATHER BECAUSE OF THE<br/>SENSE OF PRIDE AND HIM AS THE<br/>FATHER, THE HUSBAND, BUT ALSO<br/>THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE<br/>SERVICE HE PROVIDED TO COUNTRY<br/>DURING HIS NINE YEARS AS PRIME<br/>MINISTER OF CANADA.<br/>AGAIN VISITATION AT THE SIR JOHN<br/>A. MACDONALD  WILL BE FROM 9 TO<br/>1 TOMORROW.<br/>THEN HIS BODY WILL MOVE TO<br/>MONTREAL TOMORROW WHERE HE WILL<br/>LIE IN REPOSE TOMORROW.<br/>THEN SATURDAY THE OFFICIAL STATE<br/>FUNERAL AT NOTRE DAME.<br/>WE WILL CARRY THAT LIVE ON CBC<br/>TELEVISION.<br/>WE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.<br/>I WANT TO THANK THE POWER PANEL<br/>FOR JOINING ME TODAY.<br/>EMILIE NICOLAS, FRANCOISE<br/>BOIVIN, KATE HARRISON.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCBCT-PP2403195</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCBCT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BKR-6CT1-F0BD-C01K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487018</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

But some Indigenous and remote communities, like Bloodvein First Nation in Manitoba, are forced to flee wildfires without this lifeline. Leaving home in a rush with no sense of when you can return, unable to call or text loved ones to plan your escape or check on them in the event of a sudden emergency is a reality for so many Indigenous communities, said NDP MP Niki Ashton \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t have to be. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The NDP is calling on the federal government to invest in emergency preparedness for Indigenous communities in the midst of a devastating wildfire season. This is a continuation of the federal NDP\u2019s efforts to shine a spotlight on the climate crisis and emergency preparedness last week. </p><p>On July 27, Nunavut MP Lori Idlout and Manitoba MP Ashton sent a letter to Minister of Indigenous Services Patty Hajdu pointing out the federal government\u2019s chronic underfunding of emergency preparedness services in First Nations communities. A 2022 report by the auditor general found Indigenous Services Canada did not provide the support First Nations communities needed to manage emergencies like increasingly frequent and intense wildfires and floods. </p><p>\u201cThere's been so many First Nations communities that have been neglected for so long,\u201d Idlout told Canada\u2019s National Observer in a phone interview. \u201cIt's the First Nations, M\u00e9tis, Inuit communities that know their areas, and they are the ones that know what the solutions are, and even when they provide their solutions, they're not being heard.\u201d </p><p>This wildfire season has been the worst in Canada\u2019s history: more than 12.5 million hectares of land have burned. On the date the letter was sent, a little more than 1,000 fires were burning across the country, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre website. Of those, 619 were classified as out of control. The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires can be attributed in part to climate change driven by human activity, mainly the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. </p><p>\u201cWhile Conservatives continue to deny the realities of climate change, we have seen unprecedented wildfires and flooding in recent months,\u201d Hajdu said in an emailed statement to Canada\u2019s National Observer. \u201cThese emergencies have taken a horrific toll on First Nations communities that have been disproportionately impacted.\u201d </p><p>Emergency management must be led by and for First Nations consistent with principles of self-determination, the statement reads. It also pointed out that after the auditor general released their report, the federal government reformed the Emergency Management Assistance Program to \u201cbe more flexible and respond to emergencies in a way that is best for individual communities.\u201d </p><p>First Nations communities are 18 times more likely to be evacuated because of an emergency event compared to non-First Nations communities, according to the Assembly of First Nations\u2019 emergency response sector, Idlout and Ashton\u2019s letter pointed out. </p><p>\u201cFor instance, communities like Leaf Rapids, Cross Lake, Pukatawagan, Little Grand Rapids, Paungassi, and Bloodvein were evacuated in the last couple of years due to wildfires,\u201d the letter reads.  </p><p>Fires are not the only threat Canadians are facing this summer. Nova Scotia experienced historic rainfall and catastrophic flooding last weekend, causing the province to declare a state of emergency that was lifted on July 26. Communities like the Kashechewan First Nation regularly face serious flooding, and this year, the Cree community in northern Ontario had to evacuate more than 450 people when annual floods hit in April. </p><p>\u201cThe reality is that these evacuations can be very traumatic for communities that are already on the margins,\u201d Ashton told Canada\u2019s National Observer in a phone interview. She pointed to the northern Manitoba community Cross Lake, which evacuated more than 7,000 people in May when a wildfire threatened the community. </p><p>\u201cIt was a very, very difficult operation for the community,\u201d said Ashton, who represents northern Manitoba. \u201cAnd many have said that \u2026 while the community was safe from wildfires, that the interaction was deeply traumatic.\u201d </p><p>She recounted the story of one family with an elderly grandmother who was \u201calready ill and frail\u201d who passed away a couple days after being evacuated. </p><p>When people from the town of Leaf Rapids, about 1,000 kilometres north of Winnipeg, were evacuated, the province provided cheques of varying amounts so they could purchase necessities. Ashton noted that Leaf Rapids is not a First Nation but said the town has a large Indigenous population. </p><p>However, Ashton said, \u201cbecause many of them didn't have \u2026 access to identification, they weren't able to cash them in and many of these families live in and around the poverty line. </p><p>\u201cWhat we're doing is not working for these communities, and what many are calling for is resources to be able to keep their community safe and resilient in the face of climate change.\u201d </p><p>The letter to Hajdu says the government isn\u2019t doing enough to fund projects that prevent or lessen the impacts of extreme weather events. \u201cCommunities need flood protection, increased cellphone coverage, funding and training of local wildfire firefighting crews and investment in infrastructure, including all-weather roads,\u201d the two NDP MPs write. </p><p>For example, Idlout says the community of Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, is a \u201cregional hub\u201d for many communities. However, some airlines won\u2019t fly to its airport because the runway is not paved.  </p><p>\u201cI think as an emergency preparedness measure, that airport in Cambridge Bay needs to be paved so that during search and rescues or other emergencies, Cambridge Bay can serve the other communities, including its own residents,\u201d said Idlout. </p><p>The letter said the federal government turned down Bloodvein First Nation's request for a fire truck. </p><p>\u201cThe climate emergency is upon us, and we know that Indigenous communities are facing it with the least amount of resources and are being dealt the greatest impacts,\u201d said Ashton. </p><p>Better emergency response is important, \u201cbut by far the most important piece needs to be prevention,\u201d said Ashton, noting that prevention \u2014 like investments in infrastructure and programs \u2014 falls under the purview of Indigenous Services Canada. </p><p>On July 31 at 6 p.m. this story was updated to include written comment from Minister of Indigenous Services Patty Hajdu, sent after publication.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a1b3ba907bbb401b8a742506852ff87a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68V6-X8V1-DY9S-T308-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1075\"/><timeReceived>06:09 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 31, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Even the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) was caught red-handed in the past fudging the numbers of this \"best available science\"to fit their particular agenda.</p><p>She then expresses how \"shocked and frightened\"she was on a recent trip to Kelowna by the forest fire situation - by insinuation attributing it to climate change and demanding immediate action.</p><p>Neither Ms. Shafir nor I are scientists so we have to rely on others.</p><p>I would direct her attention to a trained scientist with a proven track record.</p><p>Patrick Moore, environmental activist and co- founder of Greenpeace, in his book, 'Fake Invisible Catastrophes and Threats of Doom', debunks the false claims that climate change is the cause of forest fires.</p><p>He produces data showing that in the early 1900s the forest fire situation in the U.S.was far worse than it is now.</p><p>So, to use this as an argument for increased government action is just nonsense.

By ensuring community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response, these airports contribute to keeping Canadians safe and connected from coast to coast to coast.</p><p>Today, the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at local and regional airports in the Northwest Territories. Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program, four airports in the Northwest Territories will receive over $1.5 million for the purchase of critical safety equipment that will assist in the removal and control of ice and snow from airside surfaces such as runways, taxiways, and the apron.</p><p>The airports receiving funding are:</p><p>Fort Simpson </p><p> to purchase a 4x4 snowplow truck - $420,000</p><p>Hay River</p><p> to purchase a 4x4 snowplow truck - $420,000</p><p>Inuvik </p><p> to purchase a 4x4 snowplow truck - $420,000</p><p>Yellowknife </p><p> to purchase a 4x4 snowplow truck - $420,000</p><p>These investments are in addition to the more than $19.8 million in funding provided through the program in May 2021 for safety-related projects at the Fort Simpson, Fort Smith, and Yellowknife airports.</p><p> Quote</p><p>\"The pandemic highlighted the important role Canada's local and regional airports play in our country's economy, and in sustaining the social and economic well-being of our communities. In addition to supporting personal travel, local and regional airports are key connectors for business, health care, social services, and emerging resource development sectors. Investing in our airports will improve access to safe, reliable, and efficient air transportation options, and will help us deliver on our commitment to build safer, healthier, and stronger communities as Canada recovers from the pandemic.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar AlghabraMinister of Transport</p><p>\"The airports in Fort Simpson, Inuvik, Hay River, and Yellowknife are all critically important for residents and businesses in their regions.

(QNI or the Company) is pleased to report the results from an Artificial Intelligence (AI) nickel-sulphide-focused targeting exercise at the Companys Ducros claims which has recently been completed by ALS GoldSpot Discoveries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights: //st * AI-driven targeting algorithms have been trained using the unique geophysical, geological and geochemical fingerprint of the Ni-Cu-PGE Fortin Sill Zone; * Numerous new nickel sulphide targets generated through the work across the Ducros property, including several that occur adjacent to the Fortin Sill Zone, the recently discovered Q-Zone and along strike from the Ducros Sill Trend; * The geological interpretation of the Ducros Property has been updated to help guide future exploration.</p><p>In April 2023, QNI retained ALS GoldSpot Discoveries (ALS GoldSpot) to undertake a comprehensive review and synthesis of the vast amount of exploration data collected at the Ducros Property to date, enhancing ongoing exploration efforts. The objectives of the study were two-fold: firstly, to generate meaningful nickel-sulphide-focused targets across the property using its proprietary SmartTARGETTM AI technology, and secondly, to use the new exploration data to reinterpret the geology underlying the Ducros claims.</p><p>The unique fingerprint of the Ni-Cu-PGE Fortin Sill Zone was used to train the SmartTARGETTM targeting algorithms. This involved the integration and synthesis of multiple exploration datasets including the recently completed VTEMTM, airborne gravity, high-resolution drone magnetics and Lidar surveys, along with the data from two seasons worth of surface biogeochemical surveys and the Ducros diamond drilling assay, lithogeochemical and geotechnical databases. ALS GoldSpot used its Supervised Learning (SL) and Semisupervised Learning (SSL) algorithms on 25-metre and 10-metre datastacks during its study.</p><p>More than a dozen new nickel-sulphide targets have been generated by the study, the locations of which can be seen in Figure 1. Of note, several of the new nickel-sulphide targets, which are characterized as having a geophysical conductive response comparable to that of the Fortin Sill Zone, lie along strike of the Fortin Sill Zone, immediately adjacent to the recently discovered Q-Zone, within the southern portion of the Ducros Ultramafic Sill Complex and along strike to the south of the Ducros Sill Trend (Figure 1). As part of the targeting exercise, several new non-conductive large-tonnage nickel-cobalt anomalies were also generated (Figure 1), similar in character to the Q-Zone and Ducros Sill Trend.</p><p>In parallel with the AI targeting project, ALS GoldSpot also completed a litho-structural reinterpretation of the Ducros Property. Due to the relatively thick and consistent blanket of surface cover at the property, the new geological interpretation leans heavily on short wavelength airborne magnetic data in combination with the growing Ducros drillhole database. The results of this new geological interpretation can be seen in Figure 1 and are highlighted by a better understanding of the primary geological structural framework of the Ducros property and how this affects the interpreted location and extent of some key mafic-ultramafic intrusive bodies. It is expected this new geological interpretation will greatly enhance the Companys exploration efforts going forward by allowing future work programs to focus on the most prospective Ni-Cu-PGE targets within the large )15,000-hectare Ducros property.</p><p>Ducros Property Exploration Update</p><p>As announced on August 9, 2023, the Company reports the program of exploration drilling and down-hole geophysics at the Fortin Sill target area continues as planned. The new drilling at Fortin Sill is focused on exploring for additional Ni-Cu-PGE sulphides down-plunge and along strike of the main outcropping mineralized showing. Up to 5,000 metres of drilling is planned for this phase of work, which will explore at depth beneath the Ni-Cu-PGE Zone as well as more than two kilometers of strike length of prospective geology. This work will also test the geological model discussed in the Companys December 15, 2022 news release. Downhole electromagnetic geophysical surveys are being used to identify and target accumulations of conductive Ni-Cu-PGE sulphides during this phase of drilling. Since the restart of drilling in August, a total of five deep holes have been completed and are currently being logged and sampled, three of which have been surveyed with down-hole geophysics to date. This phase of drilling is expected to continue until later this fall and possibly into the winter months, depending on local ground conditions.</p><p>Corporate Update</p><p>The Company is happy to announce that David Patterson, Executive Chairman of QNI, has returned to his role as QNIs Chief Executive Officer effective October 1, 2023. Richard Dufresne has stepped down from the role and has resumed his duties as a Director of QNI. The Company wishes to thank Mr. Dufresne for taking the helm of the Company in April 2023 (see April 19, 2023 News Release) on short notice and successfully leading QNI through a challenging forest fire-shortened summer exploration season.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Gary DeSchutter, M.Sc., P.Geo., Vice-President of Exploration for Qubec Nickel Corp., and a Qualified Person (QP) as defined under National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101), has reviewed, and approved the scientific and technical content of this press release.</p><p>About ALS GoldSpot Discoveries</p><p>ALS GoldSpot is a Canada-based group of expert geoscientists and data scientists who utilize computational methods (such as Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and numerical modelling) to assist mining and exploration clients. ALS GoldSpot offers unique processes to focus exploration efforts, minimize client risk related to exploration targeting, and optimize aspects of conventional resource exploration workflows. Its diverse geoscience and data science technical teams combine proprietary technology with in-depth expertise in mineral exploration, mineral resources, and mining to offer robust and actionable solutions to its clients and partners. While mineral exploration and mining have become data-rich environments, the value of data is lost when datasets become so large that they cannot effectively be integrated into decision making. Its expertise and solutions target such big data problems, processing or integrating underutilized data to better comprehend resource property potential.</p><p>About Qubec Nickel Corp.</p><p>Qubec Nickel Corp. is a mineral exploration company focused on acquiring, exploring, and developing critical metals (Ni-Cu-Co-PGE) projects in Qubec, Canada.

levels in 36 provinces, particularly in northern Thailand, while Bangkok and surrounding provinces will remain suffocated for another two days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment's permanent secretary, Jatuporn Buruspat, stated on Monday that ultra-fine dust particles (PM2.5) have remained at critical levels in the North and Northeast for the past week as a result of slash-and-burn activities in forests and farms, with over 2,500 hotspots found on both sides of the border.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He added that officials from the Department of Natural Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation, the Royal Forest Department, and local officials are battling the blazes.</p><p>Mr. Jatuporn stated that the Asean Secretariat had notified the bloc's members of the hotspots in their respective countries in an attempt to enlist their assistance in dealing with the problem.</p><p>He stated that the National Environment Board would meet on March 15 to discuss measures to control forest fires as soon as possible.</p><p>haze northern thailand</p><p>Suomi NPP satellite images showed 6,701 hotspots in Myanmar, 2,583 in northern Thailand, 2,125 in Cambodia, 1,434 in Laos, 147 in Vietnam, and two in Malaysia on Saturday alone, according to the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (Gistda).</p><p>A forest fire was detected in the Mae Ping National Park in Lamphun's Li district at around 2 a.m. on Monday, according to Thawatchai Sanyakit, a member of a wildfire fighting unit in northern Thailand's Phitsanulok province.</p><p>When the team arrived to control the fire, they discovered that approximately 70 rai of forested land had been razed in the fire, which was believed to have been caused by human activity.</p><p>As part of measures to prevent potential wildfires, Atthapol Charoenchansa, acting director-general of the Department of Natural Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation, announced the closure of 38 national parks, eight areas ready to be designated as national parks, 11 forest parks, 20 wildlife conservation parks, and two non-hunting areas on Monday.</p><p>According to Pollution Control Department (PCD) Director-General Pinsak Suraswadi, joint checkpoints in Bangkok inspected 109,696 vehicles between October last year and February 28.</p><p>He claimed that 23,707 of them were emitting exhaust fumes that violated toxicity regulations.</p><p>Haze, PM2.5 dust particles, northern Thailand</p><p>Traffic police, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, and the Department of Land Transport have set up additional checkpoints to inspect trucks, public buses, and other vehicles for excess black smoke emissions, he said.</p><p>'Vehicles emitting pollutants at levels that fail standard emissions tests will be suspended from use, and their owners will be asked to fix the problem before they are allowed back on the road,' he said.</p><p>According to the Centre for Air Pollution Mitigation, PM2.5 pollution exceeded safe levels in 36 provinces on Monday, with dust levels exceeding the government's safe limit of 50 microgrammes per cubic metre (g/m3).</p><p>As of 7 a.m., PM2.5 levels in most areas of the North ranged from 53-132g/m3, 32-78g/m3 in three areas of the Northeast, 32-68g/m3 in six areas of the Central Plains and West, 40-57g/m3 in four areas of the East, and 16-33ug/m3 in the South.</p><p>PM2.5 levels in Bangkok and surrounding areas ranged from 41 to 77 g/m3.</p><p>The PCD's air management division predicts that PM2.5 levels will rise in some areas of Bangkok and surrounding provinces today and tomorrow, but that the situation will improve by Thursday as the wind from the south blows the dust away.</p><p>According to the PCD's air management division, PM2.5 levels are expected to rise in 17 provinces in the upper and lower North over the next week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/06/09/our-new-normal-as-climate-change-exacerbates-wildfires-canada-faces-a-fiery-future.html\">emergency on the forest-fire front </url>could well stretch over the entire summer season.<br/><br/> As the parties start to figure out their strategies for a general election that may come as early as next spring, what impact, if any, could this latest crisis have on Canada's political dynamics?<br/><br/> The past week has seen Prime Minister <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2023/06/07/as-wildfires-rage-across-canada-debates-about-anything-but-dominate-parliament.html\">Justin Trudeau once again deliver briefings </url>along the lines of those that were a regular feature of the management of the pandemic.<br/><br/> The wildfires have also fostered the kind of federal-provincial co-operation that blunted party lines over the public health emergency.<br/><br/> Even as the NDP and eventually the Conservatives took to calling for a national firefighting strategy, the premiers of the afflicted provinces seemed to have few complaints about the timeliness of the federal response to date.<br/><br/> What we do know from recent experience is that crisis management tends to favour incumbents at the expense of their opposition critics.<br/><br/> Absent the wildfires and the smoke that expanded their reach, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/business/2023/06/07/canadians-could-face-another-rate-hike-wednesday-with-banks-decision-expected-at-10-am.html\">decision by the Bank of Canada</url>to again hike its prime rate would have seen the affordability issue take top billing in the political conversation. Now <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/climate-change.html\">climate change</url> is back on the centre of the radar.<br/><br/> Both main parties have cause to ask themselves: for how long?<br/><br/> The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2023/06/08/pierre-poilievres-plan-for-tackling-climate-change-remains-hazy.html\">CPC has spent three campaigns prosecuting </url>the climate change agenda of the Trudeau government. But while its mantra has kept the party's base mobilized, it has also, by the account of some of its own candidates, driven away a critical number of suburban and urban voters. <br/><br/> Can the party afford to risk another election bid on a lesser climate plan than that of its Liberal rivals?<br/><br/> On that score, the signals from voters themselves are decisively mixed.<br/><br/> The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/05/29/hitler-hockey-slavery-and-a-street-preacher-heres-whats-heated-up-albertas-election.html\">recent Alberta campaign </url>took place against a backdrop of severe wildfires. In the end, the party least committed to climate change mitigation prevailed. And the recently re-elected Ontario and Quebec governments did not secure their second consecutive victories based on strong environmental records.<br/><br/> One way or another, the economy and the government's fiscal course will have more pride of place in the next campaign than in the three previous ones.<br/><br/> That presents the CPC with both an opportunity and a challenge.<br/><br/> Pierre Poilievre's signature promise to eliminate the carbon tax is hardly a panacea to the affordability crisis. Moreover, it is a solution in search of a problem in the many provinces - starting with Quebec and British Columbia - that have their own carbon pricing schemes in place.<br/><br/> Poilievre has already signalled <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2023/02/08/pierre-poilievre-says-he-would-honour-trudeaus-health-care-offer-to-provinces.html\">he would maintain the health funding arrangements </url>negotiated by the prime minister with the premiers earlier this year. But <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/02/07/ontario-seeks-to-add-50k-child-care-spots-focusing-on-underserved-areas.html\">what about the child-care agreements </url>all provinces have struck with the federal government or the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2023/03/14/ottawa-will-expand-dental-care-in-next-federal-budget-its-a-big-number-source-says.html\">dental-care program </url>that has just been put in place? <br/><br/> And what, if anything, is the Conservative alternative to the Liberal plan to accelerate the greening of the Canadian economy and ensure some of its key sectors remain competitive with the U.S.?<br/><br/> At some point, the CPC will have to square the circle of its bid to balance the books with the measures required to achieve that goal.<br/><br/> In the real world, no government, regardless of political stripe, is likely to balance the books in the near- to midterm.

The lyricist is celebrated musician and au-thor Tomson Highway. The four performers, who sing in English and Cree, play abstractions of Bear, Moose, Beaver, Skunk, Snake, Wolf, Crow, and Fox.</p><p>Anyone working in healthcare or education who would like a complimentary ticket is invited to call the box office from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesday to Friday.</p><p>The Capitol has always been a place for community to gather. For the past two years, the team at the theatre has needed to draw on their creativity to find new ways to connect with their audiences. But this fall has seen a return to a full roster of in-person, live events and with this return, so has the opportunity to re-emerge as a hub for locals been restored.</p><p>\u201cWe want to nurture the sense of commonality with our friends and neighbours that comes with sharing in an evening that provides entertainment, or that invites us to think about something and debrief and discuss with others after it is over,\u201d says the Capitol\u2019s engagement manager Allison Girvan.</p><p>\u201cThis is an experience that the theatre wishes to extend to those in the community who have been, and continue to be, at the vanguard of safe-keeping our population \u2014 healthcare workers and teachers.\u201d</p><p>Tickets can be purchased through the box office or online at capitoltheatre.ca.</p><p>Submitted by the Capitol Theatre</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20221020PRAA0003071836</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66NH-4WB1-JD2C-J1G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"357\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

The emergency on the forest-fire front could well stretch over the entire summer season.</p><p>As the parties start to figure out their strategies for a general election that may come as early as next spring, what impact, if any, could this latest crisis have on Canada's political dynamics?</p><p>The past week has seen Prime Minister Justin Trudeau once again deliver briefings along the lines of those that were a regular feature of the management of the pandemic.</p><p>The wildfires have also fostered the kind of federal-provincial co-operation that blunted party lines over the public health emergency.</p><p>Even as the NDP and eventually the Conservatives took to calling for a national firefighting strategy, the premiers of the afflicted provinces seemed to have few complaints about the timeliness of the federal response to date.</p><p>What we do know from recent experience is that crisis management tends to favour incumbents at the expense of their opposition critics.</p><p>Absent the wildfires and the smoke that expanded their reach, the decision by the Bank of Canada to again hike its prime rate would have seen the affordability issue take top billing in the political conversation. Now climate change is back on the centre of the radar.</p><p>Both main parties have cause to ask themselves: for how long?</p><p>The CPC has spent three campaigns prosecuting the climate change agenda of the Trudeau government. But while its mantra has kept the party's base mobilized, it has also, by the account of some of its own candidates, driven away a critical number of suburban and urban voters.</p><p>Can the party afford to risk another election bid on a lesser climate plan than that of its Liberal rivals?</p><p>On that score, the signals from voters themselves are decisively mixed.</p><p>The recent Alberta campaign took place against a backdrop of severe wildfires. In the end, the party least committed to climate change mitigation prevailed. And the recently re-elected Ontario and Quebec governments did not secure their second consecutive victories based on strong environmental records.</p><p>One way or another, the economy and the government's fiscal course will have more pride of place in the next campaign than in the three previous ones.</p><p>That presents the CPC with both an opportunity and a challenge.</p><p>Pierre Poilievre's signature promise to eliminate the carbon tax is hardly a panacea to the affordability crisis. Moreover, it is a solution in search of a problem in the many provinces - starting with Quebec and British Columbia - that have their own carbon pricing schemes in place.</p><p>Poilievre has already signalled he would maintain the health funding arrangements negotiated by the prime minister with the premiers earlier this year. But what about the child-care agreements all provinces have struck with the federal government or the dental-care program that has just been put in place?</p><p>And what, if anything, is the Conservative alternative to the Liberal plan to accelerate the greening of the Canadian economy and ensure some of its key sectors remain competitive with the U.S.?</p><p>At some point, the CPC will have to square the circle of its bid to balance the books with the measures required to achieve that goal.</p><p>In the real world, no government, regardless of political stripe, is likely to balance the books in the near- to midterm. But that does not mean the next Liberal budget will not need - if only to blunt CPC attacks - to strike a different balance between spending and reining in the deficit than the previous ones.</p><p>Finally, is the current Liberal economic team necessarily the one Trudeau will take in the next campaign?</p><p>With Finance Deputy Minister Michael Sabia leaving for the corner office at Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, there is a critical vacancy to be filled in the top ranks of the federal civil service.</p><p>At the same time, there is more speculation these days about Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's plans for her political future than about the strength of Trudeau's commitment to lead the party in a fourth campaign.</p><p>If Freeland were to move on to other challenges rather than staying put for the potentially make-or-break next budget, she would have to make that move sooner rather than later.

Salt Spring Island Fire Rescue (SSIFR) responded Sunday to an illegal fire up Mount Maxwell Road that officials say could have been a lot worse.</p><p>Assistant Fire Chief Mitchell Sherrin said three firefighters and two apparatus were dispatched up toward the provincial park after a passing cyclist reported an unattended campfire still smouldering in a meadow off the road. The cyclist rode quickly back to his truck, Sherrin said, grabbed a water can and sprayed it on the fire, before racing to a nearby house to call the fire department.</p><p>In a stroke of luck, according to Sherrin, it was the home of Greg Bellavance, who took his bobcat machine to the location and began turning the earth in search of embers that could have restarted the fire. When SSIFR arrived, they doused the ground with additional water and thoroughly extinguished the fire.</p><p>\"It was really fortunate for us to have Greg there and his machine,\"said Sherrin. \"And I want to commend that cyclist for acting quickly and notifying us.\"</p><p>Sherrin said since the fire was on North Salt Spring Waterworks District (NSSWD) property, they were notified and inspected the site, roughly in the 1200 block of Mount Maxwell Road. Sherrin also implored the public to exercise extreme caution in the woods while the fire danger is so high.</p><p>\"People need to be extra safe,\"said Sherrin. \"We probably have another week of this weather before any hope of moisture.\"</p><p>As of Monday the forest fire danger rating is at extreme. Campfires are banned as part of the regulations.</p><p>The NSSWD has been vocal in recent years about asking people to not trespass on their Mount Maxwell watershed property, with concerns about fire damaging the watershed and the potential for degrading drinking water quality.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUDFWD-news20220824PGWA0002924185</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUDFWD2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:677F-XV51-JD2C-J105-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484148</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"297\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

On the world market it is estimated that trafficking may account up to $150 billion dollars a year and as much as $100 million on Forest Service lands in the USA. Laws have existed for over a hundred years and fines are up to $250,000 but en-forcement and conviction has been difficult because it is hard to prove where the confiscated wood originated.</p><p>This is about to change as scientists gather genetic information on forest stands around the world. It turns out that trees have \u201csome degree of local history\u201d recorded in their DNA which offers clues to where a tree grew before it was harvested. Law enforcement officers were able to show that samples taken from the seized lumber closely matched the trees tested in the Olympic National Forest where the theft was expected to have taken place.</p><p>It did cost $30,000 to collect the samples in this case but there was an incentive because the accused were also implicated in a forest fire in the same area which consumed 3,000 acres of pristine forest. While the defenders were unable to prove who started the fire the jury did hand out a twenty month sentence for unlawful harvesting of timber based on the DNA evidence. The success of this case no doubt influenced some volunteer groups like the Adventure Scientists to collect samples for a wide variety of endangered plants which will help with potential cases in the future. While big leaf maple was the tree that was poached in the trial discussed above there is concern for western red cedar, Alaska yellow cedar, coast redwood and black walnut which are often stolen.</p><p>Is there a problem in B.C. with tree poaching? According to Lyndsie Bourgon there is. CBC radio The Current, interviewed her last June about her new book. Tree Thieves:Crime and Survival in North America\u2019s Woods. According to the author tree poaching accounts for an estimated $20 million per year in B.C. but at precise figures are hard to establish as it\u2019s difficult to identify poached wood once it\u2019s entered the supply chain.</p><p>As is the case in the USA we have the laws and can apply stiff penalties but fines are often only a few hundred dollars.</p><p>While many are calling for stiffer penalties Bourgon provides an interesting historical perspective on poaching. In the past poaching (of all kinds) was a type of protest against the rich land owners which to some is similar to the increasing gap between the rich and poor today.</p><p>The debate will no doubt continue as forest industry take overs increase and protecting our old growth is a major issue for many residents.</p><p>FOREST INK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COASTM-news20230202PPWA0003320719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COASTM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67G0-8N31-F0HF-83MB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Her husband and 18-year-old son stayed behind to help fight the blaze.</p><p>\"It was kind of hard for me to leave the community under those circumstances, not knowing what was gonna happen,\" said Bosum. \"Ashes were already falling, and the sky was turning orange. It was just scary.\"</p><p>Three of the province's nine Cree communities are threatened by wildfires, including Waswanipi and Mistissini. But only Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou, about 500 kilometres north of Montreal, has been evacuated completely.</p><p>With about 800 residents, Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou is the province's newest Cree community. Its people had spent decades moving around their traditional lands, displaced by mining projects, before winning a fight with the federal and provincial governments to have a permanent settlement, which was built in the early 1990s. It was recognized by the United Nations in 1995 as one of 50 outstanding examples of community development.</p><p>Bosum remembers when community members lived in cabins and shacks along the highway outside the town of Chibougamau.</p><p>\"So I've seen my community being built from the ground up to what it is today,\" she said. \"That's why for me it's really hard to think of the possibility that the fire could get to our community. It's just all our memories \u2014 we didn't have a community before; we were the forgotten Cree.\"</p><p>Isabelle Moquin-Cuny, a nurse from Montreal who has lived in Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou since 2016, fled the community Tuesday with her husband, daughters and several pets.</p><p>Moquin-Cuny said her essentials bag had been packed for some time and in the days before the evacuation, the air had been orange and the moon red amid dense smoke.</p><p>\u201cWe were certainly trying to stay calm. There was a lot of smoke in Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou and ash that was landing on us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe air was difficult, I still have problems with my breathing.\u201d</p><p>Their entire life was left behind in that community and their departure was harrowing, she said, adding she was fearful they would run into a fire that would block their departure.</p><p>Moquin-Cuny said she hopes to return soon. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe adore the people who live there, and we\u2019re hopeful we will find our community again.\u201d   </p><p>When Bosum and her children drove off Tuesday, remaining residents thought they had about 48 hours before the fire could reach a point triggering an evacuation. But high winds propelled the flames towards the community, giving them just five hours to clear out.</p><p>Bosum was on the road without cell reception and only found out about the evacuation a few hours after the fact. Her thoughts turned to her parents and other relatives back home, but she couldn't turn back. She slept little while awaiting news.</p><p>\"My 14-year-old said, 'This can't be happening. This is our home, this is where I grew up, this is where all our memories are',\" Bosum recalled. \"And the only thing that I could tell her was, 'You know, those are material things, like those can be replaced as long as we have each other, as a family.'\"</p><p>Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou deputy Chief Lance Cooper said locals had never seen the sky turning orange the way it did in the 24 hours preceding the evacuation. By the end of the week, the prognosis had improved: the fire had hit a swamp area that slowed its progress. An additional 150 firefighters were also expected on the scene, though there was no timetable for a possible return for evacuees.</p><p>\"We have never been evacuated like this before,\" Cooper said from a shelter in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region. \"We've had wildfires in the surrounding areas, and our neighbours have been evacuated to our community once, but we have never had a mass evacuation like this due to a forest fire.\"</p><p>Cooper described Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou as a safe space for a Cree community that was frequently uprooted over the course of 50 years. Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic and the mental health toll it took, the community had been looking for a sense of normalcy before being thrust back into trauma.</p><p>\"As I speak with my members here at the shelter, a lot of them are hopeful,\" Cooper said, adding that the community knows how to work together through tough times and it has received top-notch care in the Saguenay region. \"Even through this, we're going to come out stronger, we're going to come out better,\" Cooper said.</p><p>Bosum said being forced to flee has put things into perspective. \"You know, with this type of thing happening, you realize where your real home is,\" she said, \"and you know that's where you want to be.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 10, 2023.</p><p>\u2014 With files from Jacob Serebrin.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-de4ca5d5176c45aab8c3881c49433194</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68F4-FDJ1-DY9S-T4GT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><timeReceived>07:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 10, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On the world market it is estimated that trafficking may account up to $150 billion a year and as much as $100 million on Forest Service lands in the USA. Laws have existed for over 100 years and fines are up to $250,000 but enforcement and conviction has been difficult because it is hard to prove where the confiscated wood originated.</p><p>This is about to change as scientists gather genetic information on forest stands around the world. It turns out that trees have \u201csome degree of local history\u201d recorded in their DNA which offers clues to where a tree grew before it was harvested. Law enforcement officers were able to show that samples taken from the seized lumber closely matched the trees tested in the Olympic National Forest where the theft was expected to have taken place.</p><p>It did cost $30,000 to collect the samples in this case but there was an incentive because the accused were also implicated in a forest fire in the same area which consumed 3,000 acres of pristine forest.</p><p>While the prosecutors were unable to prove who started the fire, the jury did hand out a 20-month sentence for unlawful harvesting of timber based on the DNA evidence.</p><p>The success of this case no doubt influenced some volunteer groups like the Adventure Scientists to col-lect samples for a wide variety of endangered plants which will help with potential cases in the future. While big leaf maple was the tree that was poached in the trial discussed above there is concern for western red cedar, Alaska yellow cedar, coast redwood and black walnut, all of which are often stolen.</p><p>Is there a problem in B.C. with tree poaching? According to Lyndsie Bourgon there is. On the CBC Radio show The Current, Bourgon was interviewed last June about her new book called Tree Thieves:Crime and Survival in North America\u2019s Woods. According to the author, tree poaching accounts for an estimated $20 million per year in B.C. but precise fig-ures are hard to establish as it\u2019s difficult to identify poached wood once it has entered the supply chain.</p><p>As is the case in the USA, we have the laws and can apply stiff penalties but fines are often only a few hundred dollars.</p><p>While many are calling for stiffer penalties, Bourgon provides an interesting historical perspective on poaching. In the past poaching (of all kinds) was a type of protest against the rich land owners which, to some, is similar to the increasing gap between the rich and poor today.</p><p>The debate will no doubt continue as forest industry takeovers increase and protecting our old growth is a major issue for many residents.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20230201PSCA0003316212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67FS-8WK1-JD2C-J189-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

There is a significant urban forest, in South Hills, so the work was substantial but so is the constant concern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The British Columbia FireSmart and FireSmart Canada organizations work with local governments and community associations to evaluate the threat of fire, in an area of interest, and work on subtracting the problems or adding the deterrents. South Hills took on the challenge and earned the designation after months of neighbourhood cleanups and individual homeowners taking steps to cut down - literally, in many instances - the risk of an interface fire.</p><p>\"To achieve this designation, homeowners performed activities around their homes to reduce the risk of wildfire. Through their efforts, they not only made their own property more defensible, but their street, neighbourhood, and ultimately the city, more resilient as a whole,\" said a statement of congratulations issued by the City of Quesnel.</p><p>Forestry initiatives manager Erin Robinson said \"The South Hills neighbourhood is the first, and we are targeting other neighbourhoods in the coming years; out on the Quesnel-Hixon highway in 2023 and then the neighbourhood around Sugar Loaf in 2024. All of the neighbourhoods that we are targeting are next to fuel management areas that are part of our Community Wildfire Protection Plan.\"</p><p>Carrying out the neighbourhood liaising and much of the fieldwork is retired forestry professional Ted Traer, who guided the South Hills people through the process. He pointed out that some popular landscaping techniques have been shown to actually invite fire damage. Decorative cedar trees against a house, bark mulch along the edge of your deck, overhanging evergreen branches, and so much more can turn well-intentioned aesthetics into gasoline in the event of a fire.</p><p>\"It's not a massive wall of flame, like some people imagine, it is a blizzard of embers. It's an ember storm. That's what ignites the fuels around people's homes,\" Traer said.</p><p>Sadly, there has been a lot of available science coming from incidents like Slave Lake, Kelowna, Fort McMurray, Lytton, Cache Creek, Monte Lake, and scads of smaller communities that have stared into the hungry red eyes of wildfire. Williams Lake had to be entirely evacuated, in 2017; Prince George had two mills inside city limits burn to the ground (Canfor's North Central Plywood in 2008 and Lakeland Mills in 2012), and in 2021 Quesnel had the log-yard fire to remind everyone it can happen right here and it often comes from a sudden incident with, not necessarily a forest fire that eventually arrives.</p><p>\"What's this year going to be like? You can spin the wheel and flip the coin as well as I can,\" he said, as to how much danger all our communities and neighbourhoods will be in, just by virtue of it being summertime. \"The concept is: strength in numbers. You can do all the preventative things on your house but if your neighbour has everything possible that'll burn on theirs, then where are we collectively, right? FireSmart recognizes that the more we can do as a neighbourhood, the more resilient we are as a neighbourhood.\"</p><p>Your neighbourhood, subdivision or community can get FireSmart recognition status by meeting the following criteria:</p><p>- Enlisting a local FireSmart representative to complete an assessment and create a plan that identifies locally agreed-upon solutions that the neighbourhood can implement.</p><p>- Striking a Neighbourhood FireSmart Committee which maintains the FireSmart Plan and tracks progress.</p><p>- Conducting FireSmart events each year that are dedicated to a local FireSmart project.</p><p>- Investing a minimum of $2 per capita annually in local FireSmart efforts.</p><p>- Submitting an annual report to FireSmart Canada that documents continuing compliance with the program.</p><p>\"Getting FireSmart recognition status not only ensures that your neighbourhood is prepared for wildfire, it can also be a great way to spend time with others in your community,\" said Robinson.

Smoke from forest fires burning through Indigenous communities and across Northern Ontario contaminated the air throughout the province.</p><p>We know from previous severe forest fire seasons that exposure to forest fire smoke leads to an immediate increase in asthma exacerbations and COPD exacerbations. We also see an increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations, particularly for children.</p><p>In one Canadian study of the Yellowknife fires of 2014, asthma cases doubled during the fires and salbutamol inhaler prescriptions went up by about 50 per cent. Studies have also linked exposure to air pollutants with adverse pregnancy outcomes including low birth weight.</p><p>The World Health Organization and The Lancet have both declared climate change the number one health threat of this century. Toronto's air quality this week highlights that we are not immune from the health impacts of the climate crisis.</p><p>The poor air quality has also highlighted that, as we have seen over the course of the pandemic, those who are most marginalized are most at risk of adverse outcomes and least able to cope and adapt to health threats. Remote Indigenous communities are suffering most of all from these fires, and in Toronto, people experiencing homelessness, people who work outdoors, and people living in poverty are most at risk.</p><p>We heard many times over the past few days and weeks that \"what we are seeing is the new normal,\" whether in response to the heat dome on the West Coast, the forest fires in British Columbia and Northern Ontario, or the flooding across western Europe. Yet we are seeing these extreme weather events at just 1.1 C of warming. This is not the new normal; things will only get worse.</p><p>We must immediately take measures to prepare our communities for the decades to come.</p><p>We must prepare for more forest fires seasons and heat waves, as well as droughts, floods, vector borne diseases, food insecurity, and migration. We must improve our forest fire management plans, mandate air filtration on buildings, and we need a national adaptation strategy.</p><p>We must also immediately stop subsidizing fossil fuels and stop building fossil fuel infrastructure. We need to decarbonize our transportation and our built infrastructure. We need to begin a just transition for fossil fuel workers to a new low carbon economy. And we'll actually reap some immediate health co-benefits from a decrease in other air pollutants, an increase in active travel, and a move toward a plant-rich diet.</p><p>The pandemic has demonstrated that people are capable of doing so much to support each other's health. We can and must take immediate action now to avert climate disaster.</p><p>Dr. Samantha Green is a CAPE Board Member and a family physician in Toronto, and faculty lead in climate change and health at the University of Toronto's Department of Family and Community Medicine.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-news20210726TTAWcca065c1a7804dc49634c0e1ac8bfd18</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637M-WY11-JDV5-F1N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"490\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

(MAX Power or the Company) has identified multiple radiometric anomalies from preliminary airborne survey data covering approximately two-thirds of its Corvette Lake North Lithium Property to date. Corvette Lake North is adjacent to Patriot Battery Metals Corvette Property, 5 km south of PMETs CV-5 discovery, in Quebecs James Bay Lithium Camp (refer to Figure 1).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first high resolution heliborne radiometric and magnetic survey ever flown over the 67 sq. km Corvette Lake North Property was launched last week and a total of 1,017 line kilometers has been completed. Interruptions can be expected due to the forest fire situation in the region.</p><p>Preliminary Geophysical Anomalies at Corvette North: //st * Preliminary radiometric and magnetic survey results at Corvette Lake North show a strong radiometric anomaly located at the ridge at the shoreline of Lac Corvette (Shoreline Zone); * Additional anomalies have been identified to the west and north of the Shoreline Zone, most coincident with locally higher topography; * Several anomalies have been identified at breaks in the magnetic signal or in magnetic lows, a type of signature that has been observed over known pegmatite dykes elsewhere in the James Bay Lithium Camp.</p><p>Prospectair Geosurveys of Gatineau, Quebec, is carrying out the airborne survey which is acquiring detailed information on Corvette Lake North using 50-metre line spacing. The tight line spacing is an important factor in interpreting structures and rock formations, especially where rocks are not outcropping.</p><p>The airborne survey is also scheduled to be carried out at Corvette Lake South for a total of 2,257-line-kilometers over both properties.</p><p>Figure 1: Location Map</p><p>Management cautions that mineralization hosted on adjacent and/or nearby properties is not necessarily indicative of the presence of similar mineralization or geology on the Company's properties.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>The technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Peter Lauder, P.Geo., Member of the Order of Geologists of Quebec and Senior Geologist and Exploration Manager for MAX Power Mining Corp.

The Government of Canada is committed to helping Canadians whose lives are affected when emergencies happen, helping communities deal with the realities of increased climate-related risks and disasters, and, ultimately, increasing our resiliency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada, concluded a visit to Manitoba where he met with his counterpart the Honourable Lisa Naylor, Manitoba's Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, and Minister of Consumer Protection and Government Services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his first of several roundtables, the Minister met with stakeholders and key emergency management partners, including local governments, non-governmental organizations and Indigenous organizations, to discuss lessons learned from recent emergencies, with the goal to collectively better prepare for future events and the range of hazards faced in Canada. While in Winnipeg, he toured Manitoba's Emergency Management Organization Centre and visited the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC), which played a key role in the coordination of this year's historic wildfire season.</p><p>During his visit, the Minister also announced five payments totaling $193,720,186 to Manitoba through the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA) program, to assist with response and recovery costs associated with the 2022 spring flood, 2020 June rainstorm, 2019 October storm, 2016 June flood, and the 2014 spring flood.</p><p>Through these arrangements, the Government of Canada continues to support the province of Manitoba to respond and recover from disasters.</p><p> Quotes</p><p>\"As the effects of climate change increase the frequency of disasters like flooding, we are committed to supporting Canadians, and keeping them safe. These payments will help support the province of Manitoba with their recovery and rebuilding efforts, as we work together to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Prioritizing our resiliency towards recurring extreme weather events will help strengthen our adaptability and our ability to better recover.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada</p><p>\"Keeping Manitobans safe and responding quickly and effectively to emergencies when they happen is a priority for our government, and partnering with the Federal Government is important to ensure this goal is met. I was pleased to welcome Minister Sajjan to Winnipeg, and I look forward to continue working together on increasingly critical issues such as protecting Manitobans in the context of a changing climate.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Lisa Naylor, Manitoba's Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, Minister of Consumer Protection and Government Services</p><p> Quick FactsIn Canada, emergencies are managed first at the municipal level and if assistance is needed, the municipality requests it from the province or territory. If the emergency escalates further, provinces or territories can get help from the federal government.In the event of a large-scale disaster, the Government of Canada provides financial assistance through theDFAA program to provinces and territories, at their request, for eligible disaster response and recovery expenses that exceed what they could reasonably be expected to bear on their own.Provincial or territorial governments design, develop and deliver disaster financial assistance, deciding the amounts and types of assistance that will be provided to those who have experienced losses.The DFAA provides assistance when response and recovery costs exceed what individual provinces or territories could be expected to bear on their own.

This will affect between 500 to 600 accounts in the Yukon alone and perhaps 1000\u2019s of accounts across NWT and Nunavut. In most cases multiple people use 1 account so thousands of northerners will be affected. </p><p>A shutdown of this same service was slated to occur Dec. 31, 2020 but because of the diligence and hard work of all of you and your predecessors, Xplornet continued the service for 2 years. Currently, there are no reasonable alternatives. One Yukon company does provide an alternative but the cheapest package is in excess of $1500 a month not including installation costs. This is out of reach for most people. The Starlink system which might be a reasonable alternative was slated to be operational at this latitude for 2022 but now has been postponed. We use internet for all our communication needs ie health, banking, safety, forest fire and flooding info and much more. Losing internet communication will be devastating as we will lose our communication with the outside world. Just last week, I assisted in a Search and Rescue operation coordinated by the Dawson, Yukon centre to locate lost canoeists. The internet was vital to communicate during this emergency. I am once again asking all above to please look at extending our internet service here to at least when there will be reasonable alternatives available. Being our current satellite will still be operational after Dec. 31, 2022, it appears the solution is to find out why our service is being cancelled and determine what steps are needed to continue it. Please contact me for further information.

Using nothing more than two air filters, a portable fan, some duct tape and cardboard, Iorio was able to assemble a makeshift purifier in less than 30 minutes.</p><p><br/><br/> After turning it on, the impact was noticeable. <br/><br/> \"I can just say anecdotally, I coughed and wheezed less,\" said Iorio. \"It's certainly worth the effort to build it.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Homemade air purifiers making a comeback as wildfires rage</emphasis><br/><br/> These DIY air purifiers were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/life/homes/2022/01/12/the-quest-for-cleaner-purer-indoor-air.html\">popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic</url>, when people sought to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/coronavirus.html\">mitigate COVID-19 transmission</url> in indoor settings. Now, however, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/06/08/toronto-to-see-its-worst-air-quality-levels-so-far-today-heres-how-long-its-expected-to-last.html\">wildfire smoke envelops large swaths of southern Ontario</url>and the U.S. eastern seaboard, the devices have been thrust in the spotlight once again.<br/><br/> Iorio, who is also a chemical engineering PhD student at the University of Toronto studying air quality, said these homemade purifiers are a simple and effective tool to improve air quality and remove pollutants. <br/><br/> \"The one that I made is very ugly,\" she said with a chuckle. \"I've seen much nicer looking ones ... but it doesn't need to be pretty to work.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Corsi-Rosenthal box purifier effective for wildfire smoke</emphasis><br/><br/> The efficiency of these DIY devices vary based on, among various factors, the type of fan and filters used, along with the size of the room. Iorio's improvised purifier reduced the particle concentration inside the house by about 70 per cent, she said after measuring it with her particle monitor. <br/><br/> Perhaps the most well-known version of the DIY air purifier is the Corsi-Rosenthal box, cocreated during the pandemic by environmental engineer Richard Corsi and filter manufacturer Jim Rosenthal. <br/><br/> Informal tests conducted by Rosenthal found the device removed about 60 per cent of one-micron particles out of the air, and nearly 90 per cent of the 10-micron ones. For context, much of the air pollution produced by the forest fires are 2.5 microns or smaller. <br/><br/> But no matter the device, the mechanics are the same, explained Iorio: \"It's similar to how a mask would work ... You're forcing air through the filter, and that stops particles of varying different sizes.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How to assemble a Corsi-Rosenthal box</emphasis><br/><br/> To build the popular Corsi-Rosenthal box, here's what you need: a box fan, the cardboard box for the fan, duct tape and four filters with a MERV (minimum efficiency reporting value) rating of 13 or higher. <br/><br/> First, build the four vertical walls of the DIY purifier using the four air filters, connecting them together using duct tape. Ensure the seals between the filters are air tight, as you want all the air flowing into the fan to pass through the filters. <br/><br/> Next, place the filters on the floor, on top of the cardboard box which contained the fan. Again, tape all four edges to create an airtight seal. <br/><br/> Finally, install the box fan at the top of the contraption and tape the corners to the filters. <br/><br/> \"It's just a square, flat box fan and you attach a filter to the side of it so that as the air is drawn through, and pushed out by the fan, it's cleaned,\" explained Jeff Brook, an associate professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health and Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry. \"It's sort of that simple.\"<br/><br/> While the device is safe to use - tests have shown it is very unlikely to cause a fire - Iorio recommends checking on the device regularly while in use to ensure the fan does not overheat.<br/><br/> If you don't have an air purifier or are unable to assemble one, experts recommend turning on your air conditioner or fan. Ensure it's set to recirculate indoor air and not pulling in smoke from outside. This air circulation can also help improve air quality. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate change increasing severity and frequency of forest fires</emphasis><br/><br/> Currently, there are 432 active forest fires burning across the country, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. This year, to date, there have been 2,358 fires, resulting in roughly 4.2 million hectares of area burned. <br/><br/> As of 11 a.m. on Thursday, the air quality health index for Toronto was a level 4, indicating a \"moderate risk\" to health, according to Environment Canada. That value was expected to peak later in the day at a level 7, which poses a \"high risk\" to health.<br/><br/> Due to climate change, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/06/07/the-new-reality-canadian-wildfires-become-the-global-face-of-unfolding-ecological-disaster.html\">these wildfires are becoming more severe and frequent</url>, experts warn. <br/><br/> While it's rare for large amounts of wildfire smoke to reach Toronto, as has happened this week, it's going to \"absolutely\" happen more frequently, said Brook. <br/><br/> \"We're drying out and heating up our forests and our ecosystems,\" he said. \"That's what climate change is doing and this is the result.\"<br/><br/> Joshua Chong is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star's Express Desk.

They were followed closely by the eastern Ontario cities of Kingston, Cornwall and Belleville.</p><p>Residents in those cities were encouraged to limit outdoor activities, and those most vulnerable to the smoke were told to avoid them altogether.</p><p>By late afternoon, the risk had eased somewhat in eastern Ontario as winds shifted the smoke closer to the Greater Toronto Area and Hamilton.</p><p>Forecasts suggest that the GTA, the Niagara region and southwestern Ontario are due to see the highest risks because of bad air quality on Thursday and Friday, while the risk level in Ottawa will drop.</p><p>The eastern United States is also seeing devastating effects from wildfire smoke drifting south from Canada, with cities like New York and Washington, D.C., issuing air quality warnings of their own.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre database showed Wednesday afternoon that 440 fires were burning in nine provinces and two territories. More than half were considered out of control.</p><p>The amount of land burned surpassed the 40,000-square-kilometre mark Wednesday, making the 2023 fire season Canada\u2019s fourth-worst on record before the summer has even officially begun.</p><p>At the current pace of burning, the all-time record is expected to be surpassed by next week.</p><p>\u201cBy all measures, this is perhaps the worst year we have experienced with wildfires,\u201d Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said.</p><p>He said it is a blessing there has been no loss of life, but property damage has been significant, and major infrastructure is being hit, too. For example, Blair said that in Quebec, some hydro towers are in jeopardy.</p><p>On Vancouver Island, a small wildfire cut off the only major highway linking Port Alberni, Tofino and Ucluelet to the rest of British Columbia.</p><p>Alberta has lifted its state of emer-gency following a very difficult May, during which 314 fires burned more than 12,000 square kilometres of forest and prompted thousands of people to flee their homes. Still, 65 fires remain burning in that province, 17 of them out of control.</p><p>In Nova Scotia, the Tantallon fire that destroyed 151 homes has been contained, but the Barrington Lake fire, which has damaged or destroyed at least 60 homes and cottages, remains out of control.</p><p>Quebec is now facing the toughest challenge, with 163 fires burning, 117 of them out of control. The Quebec fire situation flared up extremely fast. Just a week ago, there were only 16 fires in the province, and they had burned about 215 square kilometres.</p><p>In the last week, another 6,500 square kilometres have burned.</p><p>Wednesday\u2019s air quality warnings prompted school boards in Ottawa and the Toronto area to hold recess indoors and some sports leagues cancelled outdoor games and practices.</p><p>Individuals were also changing their plans to enjoy the great outdoors and donning face masks when they were outside.</p><p>Yili Ma, 31, said a hiking group she belongs to has cancelled its plan to hike near the Toronto Zoo this week because of the air quality in Toronto.</p><p>\u201cAnd also I\u2019m not considering going to any patio. I put my mask away for over a year, and now I\u2019m putting on my mask since yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Others are worrying about what this extreme fire season says about the future.</p><p>Oksana Perekhidouk said she initially thought it was fog marring the view from her 31st-floor apartment in Ottawa.</p><p>\u201cIt turns out it is smoke, and it\u2019s not good. So, I\u2019m really worried, not even about the air condition, but about the forest,\u201d said Perkhidouk.</p><p>Brendan Lyver, 25, said it\u2019s frustrating that it is unhealthy to be outside.</p><p>\u201cForest fires, especially out east in Nova Scotia, that\u2019s not a common occurrence,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s definitely something we need to address and look at what\u2019s going on in the environment right now.\u201d</p><p>The federal government is focused on battling the fires for now, but Trudeau acknowledged Wednesday his government is discussing the idea of creating some kind of national disaster response agency.</p><p>\u201cWe need to continue to make sure we are doing everything possible to keep Canadians safe when these extreme weather events happen, but also make sure we\u2019re doing everything we can to predict, protect, and act ahead of more of these events coming,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo we continue to discuss and look at new mechanisms and new ways of doing that.\u201d</p><p>A senior government source told The Canadian Press that those discussions include analyzing models like the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the United States.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230608RDA0003636355</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DS-DJP1-JD2C-J1WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Using nothing more than two air filters, a portable fan, some duct tape and cardboard, Iorio was able to assemble a makeshift purifier in less than 30 minutes.</p><p><br/><br/> After turning it on, the impact was noticeable. <br/><br/> \"I can just say anecdotally, I coughed and wheezed less,\" said Iorio. \"It's certainly worth the effort to build it.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Homemade air purifiers making a comeback as wildfires rage</emphasis><br/><br/> These DIY air purifiers were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/life/homes/2022/01/12/the-quest-for-cleaner-purer-indoor-air.html\">popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic</url>, when people sought to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/coronavirus.html\">mitigate COVID-19 transmission</url> in indoor settings. Now, however, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/06/08/toronto-to-see-its-worst-air-quality-levels-so-far-today-heres-how-long-its-expected-to-last.html\">wildfire smoke envelops large swaths of southern Ontario</url>and the U.S. eastern seaboard, the devices have been thrust in the spotlight once again.<br/><br/> Iorio, who is also a chemical engineering PhD student at the University of Toronto studying air quality, said these homemade purifiers are a simple and effective tool to improve air quality and remove pollutants. <br/><br/> \"The one that I made is very ugly,\" she said with a chuckle. \"I've seen much nicer looking ones ... but it doesn't need to be pretty to work.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Corsi-Rosenthal box purifier effective for wildfire smoke</emphasis><br/><br/> The efficiency of these DIY devices vary based on, among various factors, the type of fan and filters used, along with the size of the room. Iorio's improvised purifier reduced the particle concentration inside the house by about 70 per cent, she said after measuring it with her particle monitor. <br/><br/> Perhaps the most well-known version of the DIY air purifier is the Corsi-Rosenthal box, cocreated during the pandemic by environmental engineer Richard Corsi and filter manufacturer Jim Rosenthal. <br/><br/> Informal tests conducted by Rosenthal found the device removed about 60 per cent of one-micron particles out of the air, and nearly 90 per cent of the 10-micron ones. For context, much of the air pollution produced by the forest fires are 2.5 microns or smaller. <br/><br/> But no matter the device, the mechanics are the same, explained Iorio: \"It's similar to how a mask would work ... You're forcing air through the filter, and that stops particles of varying different sizes.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How to assemble a Corsi-Rosenthal box</emphasis><br/><br/> To build the popular Corsi-Rosenthal box, here's what you need: a box fan, the cardboard box for the fan, duct tape and four filters with a MERV (minimum efficiency reporting value) rating of 13 or higher. <br/><br/> First, build the four vertical walls of the DIY purifier using the four air filters, connecting them together using duct tape. Ensure the seals between the filters are air tight, as you want all the air flowing into the fan to pass through the filters. <br/><br/> Next, place the filters on the floor, on top of the cardboard box which contained the fan. Again, tape all four edges to create an airtight seal. <br/><br/> Finally, install the box fan at the top of the contraption and tape the corners to the filters. <br/><br/> \"It's just a square, flat box fan and you attach a filter to the side of it so that as the air is drawn through, and pushed out by the fan, it's cleaned,\" explained Jeff Brook, an associate professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health and Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry. \"It's sort of that simple.\"<br/><br/> While the device is safe to use - tests have shown it is very unlikely to cause a fire - Iorio recommends checking on the device regularly while in use to ensure the fan does not overheat.<br/><br/> If you don't have an air purifier or are unable to assemble one, experts recommend turning on your air conditioner or fan. Ensure it's set to recirculate indoor air and not pulling in smoke from outside. This air circulation can also help improve air quality. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate change increasing severity and frequency of forest fires</emphasis><br/><br/> Currently, there are 432 active forest fires burning across the country, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. This year, to date, there have been 2,358 fires, resulting in roughly 4.2 million hectares of area burned. <br/><br/> As of 11 a.m. on Thursday, the air quality health index for Toronto was a level 4, indicating a \"moderate risk\" to health, according to Environment Canada. That value was expected to peak later in the day at a level 7, which poses a \"high risk\" to health.<br/><br/> Due to climate change, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/06/07/the-new-reality-canadian-wildfires-become-the-global-face-of-unfolding-ecological-disaster.html\">these wildfires are becoming more severe and frequent</url>, experts warn. <br/><br/> While it's rare for large amounts of wildfire smoke to reach Toronto, as has happened this week, it's going to \"absolutely\" happen more frequently, said Brook. <br/><br/> \"We're drying out and heating up our forests and our ecosystems,\" he said. \"That's what climate change is doing and this is the result.\"<br/><br/> Joshua Chong is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star's Express Desk.

Using nothing more than two air filters, a portable fan, some duct tape and cardboard, Iorio was able to assemble a makeshift purifier in less than 30 minutes.</p><p><br/><br/> After turning it on, the impact was noticeable. <br/><br/> \"I can just say anecdotally, I coughed and wheezed less,\" said Iorio. \"It's certainly worth the effort to build it.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Homemade air purifiers making a comeback as wildfires rage</emphasis><br/><br/> These DIY air purifiers were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/life/homes/2022/01/12/the-quest-for-cleaner-purer-indoor-air.html\">popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic</url>, when people sought to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/coronavirus.html\">mitigate COVID-19 transmission</url> in indoor settings. Now, however, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/06/08/toronto-to-see-its-worst-air-quality-levels-so-far-today-heres-how-long-its-expected-to-last.html\">wildfire smoke envelops large swaths of southern Ontario</url>and the U.S. eastern seaboard, the devices have been thrust in the spotlight once again.<br/><br/> Iorio, who is also a chemical engineering PhD student at the University of Toronto studying air quality, said these homemade purifiers are a simple and effective tool to improve air quality and remove pollutants. <br/><br/> \"The one that I made is very ugly,\" she said with a chuckle. \"I've seen much nicer looking ones ... but it doesn't need to be pretty to work.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Corsi-Rosenthal box purifier effective for wildfire smoke</emphasis><br/><br/> The efficiency of these DIY devices vary based on, among various factors, the type of fan and filters used, along with the size of the room. Iorio's improvised purifier reduced the particle concentration inside the house by about 70 per cent, she said after measuring it with her particle monitor. <br/><br/> Perhaps the most well-known version of the DIY air purifier is the Corsi-Rosenthal box, cocreated during the pandemic by environmental engineer Richard Corsi and filter manufacturer Jim Rosenthal. <br/><br/> Informal tests conducted by Rosenthal found the device removed about 60 per cent of one-micron particles out of the air, and nearly 90 per cent of the 10-micron ones. For context, much of the air pollution produced by the forest fires are 2.5 microns or smaller. <br/><br/> But no matter the device, the mechanics are the same, explained Iorio: \"It's similar to how a mask would work ... You're forcing air through the filter, and that stops particles of varying different sizes.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How to assemble a Corsi-Rosenthal box</emphasis><br/><br/> To build the popular Corsi-Rosenthal box, here's what you need: a box fan, the cardboard box for the fan, duct tape and four filters with a MERV (minimum efficiency reporting value) rating of 13 or higher. <br/><br/> First, build the four vertical walls of the DIY purifier using the four air filters, connecting them together using duct tape. Ensure the seals between the filters are air tight, as you want all the air flowing into the fan to pass through the filters. <br/><br/> Next, place the filters on the floor, on top of the cardboard box which contained the fan. Again, tape all four edges to create an airtight seal. <br/><br/> Finally, install the box fan at the top of the contraption and tape the corners to the filters. <br/><br/> \"It's just a square, flat box fan and you attach a filter to the side of it so that as the air is drawn through, and pushed out by the fan, it's cleaned,\" explained Jeff Brook, an associate professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health and Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry. \"It's sort of that simple.\"<br/><br/> While the device is safe to use - tests have shown it is very unlikely to cause a fire - Iorio recommends checking on the device regularly while in use to ensure the fan does not overheat.<br/><br/> If you don't have an air purifier or are unable to assemble one, experts recommend turning on your air conditioner or fan. Ensure it's set to recirculate indoor air and not pulling in smoke from outside. This air circulation can also help improve air quality. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate change increasing severity and frequency of forest fires</emphasis><br/><br/> Currently, there are 432 active forest fires burning across the country, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. This year, to date, there have been 2,358 fires, resulting in roughly 4.2 million hectares of area burned. <br/><br/> As of 11 a.m. on Thursday, the air quality health index for Toronto was a level 4, indicating a \"moderate risk\" to health, according to Environment Canada. That value was expected to peak later in the day at a level 7, which poses a \"high risk\" to health.<br/><br/> Due to climate change, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/06/07/the-new-reality-canadian-wildfires-become-the-global-face-of-unfolding-ecological-disaster.html\">these wildfires are becoming more severe and frequent</url>, experts warn. <br/><br/> While it's rare for large amounts of wildfire smoke to reach Toronto, as has happened this week, it's going to \"absolutely\" happen more frequently, said Brook. <br/><br/> \"We're drying out and heating up our forests and our ecosystems,\" he said. \"That's what climate change is doing and this is the result.\"<br/><br/> Joshua Chong is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star's Express Desk.

Authorities said a wildfire was within 500 metres of Norm\u00e9tal, Que., located 720 kilometres northwest of Montreal, in the Abitibi region.</p><p>The province's forest fire prevention agency \u2014 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de protection des for\u00eats contre le feu (SOPFEU) \u2014 said it was confident the small community could be protected, with winds less strong than first feared. </p><p>Seven aircraft had been working in the area to reduce the pace of that fire.</p><p>\"As of yesterday, it was at about 1,500 metres from the community and it has gotten closer very slowly all the day,\" said Sylvain Tremblay, a SOPFEU official. \"But it was a slow burn and we managed to to make some drops with the bombers to slow the fire even more so.\" </p><p>Tremblay said although some parts of the fire are close to the community, it remained stable.</p><p>The government was also focusing efforts on Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, Que., a northern municipality where 2,100 people were evacuated and where two separate large fires risked merging. A wildfire was located about 15 kilometres outside of town.</p><p>Meanwhile in a pair of Cree communities, authorities were monitoring the situation closely. </p><p>The Cree community of Mistissini, population 4,000, remained on alert but had not been evacuated. Legault said there was a risk the only road out of that community, located 550 kilometres north of Montreal, could be cut off, but said a threshold to evacuate had not been met, as previously thought. </p><p>Legault said there was a misunderstanding over the situation a day earlier, which led to a refusal from the community to evacuate. The premier said he accepted the local chief's decision not to evacuate and the situation is under surveillance.</p><p>In another nearby Cree community of Waswanipi, west of Chibougamau, some people were relocated to the Quebec City area as a precaution, primarily due to fears over road access and heavy smoke.</p><p>About 15 kilometres outside of Chibougamau, a wildfire had stabilized, authorities said. Authorities were building 40-metre wide trenches to stop the fire from reaching residences in the community, which was evacuated on Tuesday at the same time as Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou, a Cree community of 800.</p><p>Earlier, Quebec's public security minister preached patience.</p><p>There have been no reports of injuries or deaths, or damage to homes from the 146 wildfires burning across the province, Public Security Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bonnardel told reporters in Roberval, Que., about 250 kilometres north of Quebec City. He did not have a count of how many hunting cabins or forestry equipment were engulfed.</p><p>There were also no additional evacuations on the horizon, but no rain was expected until next week and temperatures across the province were expected to rise, he said. </p><p>\"Some fires are under control, some not,\" Bonnardel said. \"We're looking at these fires every hour, we're hoping to tell Quebecers they will be able to go back home, but in the short term, it won't be possible.\"</p><p>Chibougamau Mayor Manon Cyr thanked the city of Roberval for offering shelter to residents from her town. Many evacuees from various Quebec communities have been sent there and to neighbouring municipalities.</p><p>Cyr said she has told Chibougamau residents to be calm despite the uncertainty.</p><p>\"I tell them to be like me \u2014 Zen and patient. That's the most important,\" Cyr said, joking that she had done a type of rain dance to bring about much-needed precipitation to the region.</p><p>\"But seriously, that's what we are (hoping) for, you know, until we have good quantity of rain \u2026 that's going to be the solution.\"</p><p>Quebec was expecting reinforcements from abroad to help the 620 firefighters on the ground -- a combination of SOPFEU staff and Canadian Forces soldiers.</p><p>Firefighters from France and the province of New Brunswick are being brought in and authorities expect other firefighters from Portugal, Spain, and Mexico to join them. </p><p>Authorities weren't able to say Thursday whether any of the firefighters coming from the United States, announced Wednesday, would be deployed to Quebec as well. </p><p>On Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that his country was ready to help Canada accelerate its wildfire fight, as fires in Quebec and Ontario send plumes of smoke towards U.S. cities.</p><p>So far more than 645,000 hectares have burned in the province, representing the worst fire season on record.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 8, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-77e93f24e4f142ae9175c6de9977d8e7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DX-G031-JBVR-346W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>05:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 8, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Using nothing more than two air filters, a portable fan, some duct tape and cardboard, Iorio was able to assemble a makeshift purifier in less than 30 minutes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After turning it on, the impact was noticeable.</p><p>\"I can just say anecdotally, I coughed and wheezed less,\" said Iorio. \"It's certainly worth the effort to build it.\"</p><p>Homemade air purifiers making a comeback as wildfires rage</p><p>These DIY air purifiers were popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people sought to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in indoor settings. Now, however, as wildfire smoke envelops large swaths of southern Ontario and the U.S. eastern seaboard, the devices have been thrust in the spotlight once again.</p><p>Iorio, who is also a chemical engineering PhD student at the University of Toronto studying air quality, said these homemade purifiers are a simple and effective tool to improve air quality and remove pollutants.</p><p>\"The one that I made is very ugly,\" she said with a chuckle. \"I've seen much nicer looking ones ... but it doesn't need to be pretty to work.\"</p><p>Corsi-Rosenthal box purifier effective for wildfire smoke</p><p>The efficiency of these DIY devices vary based on, among various factors, the type of fan and filters used, along with the size of the room. Iorio's improvised purifier reduced the particle concentration inside the house by about 70 per cent, she said after measuring it with her particle monitor.</p><p>Perhaps the most well-known version of the DIY air purifier is the Corsi-Rosenthal box, cocreated during the pandemic by environmental engineer Richard Corsi and filter manufacturer Jim Rosenthal.</p><p>Informal tests conducted by Rosenthal found the device removed about 60 per cent of one-micron particles out of the air, and nearly 90 per cent of the 10-micron ones. For context, much of the air pollution produced by the forest fires are 2.5 microns or smaller.</p><p>But no matter the device, the mechanics are the same, explained Iorio: \"It's similar to how a mask would work ... You're forcing air through the filter, and that stops particles of varying different sizes.\"</p><p>How to assemble a Corsi-Rosenthal box</p><p>To build the popular Corsi-Rosenthal box, here's what you need: a box fan, the cardboard box for the fan, duct tape and four filters with a MERV (minimum efficiency reporting value) rating of 13 or higher.</p><p>First, build the four vertical walls of the DIY purifier using the four air filters, connecting them together using duct tape. Ensure the seals between the filters are air tight, as you want all the air flowing into the fan to pass through the filters.</p><p>Next, place the filters on the floor, on top of the cardboard box which contained the fan. Again, tape all four edges to create an airtight seal.</p><p>Finally, install the box fan at the top of the contraption and tape the corners to the filters.</p><p>\"It's just a square, flat box fan and you attach a filter to the side of it so that as the air is drawn through, and pushed out by the fan, it's cleaned,\" explained Jeff Brook, an associate professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health and Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry. \"It's sort of that simple.\"</p><p>While the device is safe to use - tests have shown it is very unlikely to cause a fire - Iorio recommends checking on the device regularly while in use to ensure the fan does not overheat.</p><p>If you don't have an air purifier or are unable to assemble one, experts recommend turning on your air conditioner or fan. Ensure it's set to recirculate indoor air and not pulling in smoke from outside. This air circulation can also help improve air quality.</p><p>Climate change increasing severity and frequency of forest fires</p><p>Currently, there are 432 active forest fires burning across the country, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. This year, to date, there have been 2,358 fires, resulting in roughly 4.2 million hectares of area burned.</p><p>As of 11 a.m. on Thursday, the air quality health index for Toronto was a level 4, indicating a \"moderate risk\" to health, according to Environment Canada. That value was expected to peak later in the day at a level 7, which poses a \"high risk\" to health.</p><p>Due to climate change, these wildfires are becoming more severe and frequent, experts warn.</p><p>While it's rare for large amounts of wildfire smoke to reach Toronto, as has happened this week, it's going to \"absolutely\" happen more frequently, said Brook.</p><p>\"We're drying out and heating up our forests and our ecosystems,\" he said. \"That's what climate change is doing and this is the result.\"</p><p>Joshua Chong is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star's Express Desk.

There is a significant urban forest, in South Hills, so the work was substantial but so is the constant concern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The British Columbia FireSmart and FireSmart Canada organizations work with local governments and community associations to evaluate the threat of fire, in an area of interest, and work on subtracting the problems or adding the deterrents. South Hills took on the challenge and earned the designation after months of neighbourhood cleanups and individual homeowners taking steps to cut down-literally, in many instances-the risk of an interface fire.</p><p>\u201cTo achieve this designation, homeowners performed activities around their homes to reduce the risk of wildfire. Through their efforts, they not only made their own property more defensible, but their street, neighbourhood, and ultimately the city, more resilient as a whole,\u201d said a statement of congratulations issued by the City of Quesnel.</p><p>Forestry initiatives manager Erin Robinson said \u201cThe South Hills neighbourhood is the first, and we are targeting other neighbourhoods in the coming years; out on the Quesnel-Hixon highway in 2023 and then the neighbourhood around Sugar Loaf in 2024. All of the neighbourhoods that we are targeting are next to fuel management areas that are part of our Community Wildfire Protection Plan.\u201d</p><p>Carrying out the neighbourhood liaising and much of the fieldwork is retired forestry professional Ted Traer, who guided the South Hills people through the process. He pointed out that some popular landscaping techniques have been shown to actually invite fire damage. Decorative cedar trees against a house, bark mulch along the edge of your deck, overhanging evergreen branches, and so much more can turn well-inten-tioned aesthetics into gasoline in the event of a fire.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a massive wall of flame, like some people imagine, it is a blizzard of embers. It\u2019s an ember storm. That\u2019s what ignites the fuels around people\u2019s homes,\u201d Traer said.</p><p>Sadly, there has been a lot of available science coming from incidents like Slave Lake, Kelowna, Fort McMurray, Lytton, Cache Creek, Monte Lake, and scads of smaller communities that have stared into the hungry red eyes of wildfire. Williams Lake had to be en-tirely evacuated, in 2017; Prince George had two mills inside city limits burn to the ground (Canfor\u2019s North Central Plywood in 2008 and Lakeland Mills in 2012), and in 2021 Quesnel had the logyard fire to remind everyone it can happen right here and it often comes from a sudden incident with, not necessarily a forest fire that eventually arrives.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this year going to be like? You can spin the wheel and flip the coin as well as I can,\u201d he said, as to how much danger all our communities and neighbourhoods will be in, just by virtue of it being summertime. \u201cThe concept is:strength in numbers. You can do all the preventative things on your house but if your neighbour has everything possible that\u2019ll burn on theirs, then where are we collectively, right? FireSmart recognizes that the more we can do as a neighbourhood, the more resilient we are as a neighbourhood.\u201d</p><p>Your neighbourhood, subdivision or community can get FireSmart recognition status by meeting the following criteria:-Enlisting a local FireSmart representative to complete an assessment and create a plan that identifies locally agreed-upon solutions that the neighbourhood can implement.</p><p>-Striking a Neighbourhood FireSmart Committee which maintains the FireSmart Plan and tracks progress.</p><p>-Conducting FireSmart events each year that are dedicated to a local FireSmart project.</p><p>-Investing a minimum of $2 per capita annually in local FireSmart efforts.</p><p>-Submitting an annual report to FireSmart Canada that documents continuing compliance with the program.</p><p>\u201cGetting FireSmart recognition status not only ensures that your neighbourhood is prepared for wildfire, it can also be a great way to spend time with others in your community,\u201d said Robinson.

(TSXV: LONE) (FSE: H490) (the \" Company\" or \" LONE\") is pleased to announce the details of a multiphase work program planned to commence immediately in Ontario and Quebec. The Company has acquired a dominant land package in both lithium districts and will use a strategic approach to advance the projects rapidly through grassroots exploration to drill ready targets. In light of the current forest fire conditions in Quebec, the Company is dedicated to ensuring the safety of its teams and mitigating any potential environmental impacts, and therefore will adapt its operations as necessary. The extensive field program will be aided by detailed outcrop maps developed by LONE earlier this year, which have identified the most prospective areas for ground follow up. Of note, each project is proximal to an existing discovery.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Program Highlights</p><p>Phase 1: Extensive Field Activities. LONE will initiate an intensive Phase 1 program aimed at covering all 12 lithium project areas within a 12-week timeframe. Experienced, dedicated teams will conduct mapping, prospecting and channel sampling of the pegmatites across the expansive 45,000 hectares of property. Additionally, handheld Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) will be used for infield lithium analysis. LIBS provides quantitative data regarding lithium content that will be used for immediate prioritization of pegmatite target areas.</p><p>Phase 2: Targeted Exploration Activities. LONE's expert technical team will assess field observations and laboratory results as the program progresses and will proceed with outcrop stripping of the most prospective targets and drilling top priority target areas.</p><p>Program Details</p><p>Phase 1 of the program will focus on rapidly building a geological understanding of the Company's properties and identifying the highest priority target areas for Phase 2. This will be achieved by collecting a large database of consistent surface exploration data from which to define target areas. Multiple exploration teams will be deployed over the 45,000 ha land package which is made up of 12 claim groups. The teams will collect mapping, prospecting and channel sampling data aided by handheld LIBS for in the field lithium analysis. Samples will be submitted to AGAT Laboratories for geochemical analysis.</p><p>Phase 2 of the program will consist of outcrop stripping and drilling. To accelerate the work programs, comprehensive outcrop detection analysis has already been completed at the Company's lithium properties using advanced satellite imagery and high-resolution elevation modeling techniques. After training on regional pegmatite data, the outcrops most closely matching pegmatites have been prioritized for exploration.</p><p>The Company recognizes the importance of early engagement and ongoing consultation with First Nation's communities. The Company is committed to establishing meaningful relationships and actively involving community perspectives in its project areas.</p><p>Figure 1. \u00a0 Location of the Company's properties in Ontario and Quebec.</p><p>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8381/169011_5b8b96d83466a8b6_001full.jpg\">https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8381/169011_5b8b96d83466a8b6_001full.jpg</url></p><p>The technical content of this news release has been reviewed and approved by Carl Ginn, P.Geo., a director of the Company and a Qualified Person pursuant to National Instrument 43-101.</p><p>About Lithium One</p><p>Lithium One Metals is a Canadian exploration company specializing in the acquisition and development of high-potential lithium properties in Ontario and Qubec.

(the \"Company\" or \"LONE\") is pleased to announce the details of a multiphase work program planned to commence immediately in Ontario and Quebec. The Company has acquired a dominant land package in both lithium districts and will use a strategic approach to advance the projects rapidly through grassroots exploration to drill ready targets. In light of the current forest fire conditions in Quebec, the Company is dedicated to ensuring the safety of its teams and mitigating any potential environmental impacts, and therefore will adapt its operations as necessary. The extensive field program will be aided by detailed outcrop maps developed by LONE earlier this year, which have identified the most prospective areas for ground follow up. Of note, each project is proximal to an existing discovery.</p><p>Program Highlights //st * Phase 1: Extensive Field Activities. LONE will initiate an intensive Phase 1 program aimed at covering all 12 lithium project areas within a 12-week timeframe. Experienced, dedicated teams will conduct mapping, prospecting and channel sampling of the pegmatites across the expansive 45,000 hectares of property. Additionally, handheld Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) will be used for infield lithium analysis. LIBS provides quantitative data regarding lithium content that will be used for immediate prioritization of pegmatite target areas. * Phase 2: Targeted Exploration Activities. LONE's expert technical team will assess field observations and laboratory results as the program progresses and will proceed with outcrop stripping of the most prospective targets and drilling top priority target areas.</p><p>Program Details</p><p>Phase 1 of the program will focus on rapidly building a geological understanding of the Company's properties and identifying the highest priority target areas for Phase 2. This will be achieved by collecting a large database of consistent surface exploration data from which to define target areas. Multiple exploration teams will be deployed over the 45,000 ha land package which is made up of 12 claim groups. The teams will collect mapping, prospecting and channel sampling data aided by handheld LIBS for in the field lithium analysis. Samples will be submitted to AGAT Laboratories for geochemical analysis.</p><p>Phase 2 of the program will consist of outcrop stripping and drilling. To accelerate the work programs, comprehensive outcrop detection analysis has already been completed at the Company's lithium properties using advanced satellite imagery and high-resolution elevation modeling techniques. After training on regional pegmatite data, the outcrops most closely matching pegmatites have been prioritized for exploration.</p><p>The Company recognizes the importance of early engagement and ongoing consultation with First Nation's communities. The Company is committed to establishing meaningful relationships and actively involving community perspectives in its project areas.</p><p>Figure 1.Location of the Company's properties in Ontario and Quebec. <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8381/169011_\">https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8381/169011_</url></p><p>The technical content of this news release has been reviewed and approved by Carl Ginn, P.Geo., a director of the Company and a Qualified Person pursuant to National Instrument 43-101.</p><p>About Lithium One</p><p>Lithium One Metals is a Canadian exploration company specializing in the acquisition and development of high-potential lithium properties in Ontario and Qubec.

On the world market it is estimated that trafficking may account up to $150 billion dollars a year and as much as $100 million on Forest Service lands in the USA. Laws have existed for over a hundred years and fines are up to $250,000 but enforcement and conviction has been difficult because it is hard to prove where the confiscated wood originated.</p><p>This is about to change as scientists gather genetic information on forest stands around the world. It turns out that trees have \"some degree of local history\" recorded in their DNA which offers clues to where a tree grew before it was harvested. Law enforcement officers were able to show that samples taken from the seized lumber closely matched the trees tested in the Olympic National Forest where the theft was expected to have taken place.</p><p>It did cost $30,000 to collect the samples in this case but there was an incentive because the accused were also implicated in a forest fire in the same area which consumed 3,000 acres of pristine forest. While the defenders were unable to prove who started the fire the jury did hand out a twenty month sentence for unlawful harvesting of timber based on the DNA evidence. The success of this case no doubt influenced some volunteer groups like the Adventure Scientists to collect samples for a wide variety of endangered plants which will help with potential cases in the future. While big leaf maple was the tree that was poached in the trial discussed above there is concern for western red cedar, Alaska yellow cedar, coast redwood and black walnut which are often stolen.</p><p>Is there a problem in B.C. with tree poaching? According to Lyndsie Bourgon there is. CBC radio The Current, interviewed her last June about her new book. Tree Thieves: Crime and Survival in North America's Woods. According to the author tree poaching accounts for an estimated $20 million per year in B.C. but at precise figures are hard to establish as it's difficult to identify poached wood once it's entered the supply chain.</p><p>As is the case in the USA we have the laws and can apply stiff penalties but fines are often only a few hundred dollars.</p><p>While many are calling for stiffer penalties Bourgon provides an interesting historical perspective on poaching. In the past poaching (of all kinds) was a type of protest against the rich land owners which to some is similar to the increasing gap between the rich and poor today.</p><p>The debate will no doubt continue as forest industry take overs increase and protecting our old growth is a major issue for many residents.</p><p>READ MORE:Oldest DNA reveals life in Greenland 2 million years ago</p><p>Do you have a comment about this story? email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editor@wltribune.comLike\">editor@wltribune.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Williams Lake Tribune</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-news20230128PWL4425051</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67DX-CJF1-F0HF-82FN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"523\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.
