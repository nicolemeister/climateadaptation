He said crews responding to fires that are burning down through the roots \u2013 which makes finding the source and extinguishing it much harder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe could use about three days of rain,\u201d he said.\u00a0</p><p>Theriault said it is important not to start outdoor fires, including camp fires or pit fires. When discarding cigarettes, make sure they are fully extinguished before and don\u2019t throw them on the ground.\u00a0</p><p>He said to use extreme caution in wooded areas. Theriault also recommends homeowners check out the FireSmart website on how to prepare their properties \u2013 like removing trees and creating a buffer between the woods and the home.\u00a0</p><p>Provincial staff on \u2018high alert\u2019</p><p>Tony Cole, the provincial wildfire operations supervisor, said much of the department is on high alert.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte County is one of the drier parts of the province,\u201d he said in an interview with The Courier. \u201cIt seems the two opposite corners [of the province] are choosing to be very dry at the same time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cole said the drier the conditions means more fuel is available for a wildfire \u2013 which could lead to greater spread and intensity.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEven the surface of the ground itself and all of that fuel is currently available should we have a start undetected for a little while [and] get the momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would have our hands full.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He added that if the fire were to start in the duff \u2013 a layer of decomposed organic matter that accumulates on the forest floor \u2013 it can burn for an extended period of time before reaching back up to the surface.\u00a0</p><p>Cole explains the hot and dry conditions are one thing but there are few things working in the province's favour \u2013 including low wind speed and high humidity.\u00a0</p><p>Higher humidity levels mean more moisture in the air, which can limit ignition and spread.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf the humidity were to drop, that would be concerning,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had a day with strong wings, that would also be concerning for us.</p><p>\u201cA lot of pieces are starting to line up, but they are not aligned just yet.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>It also comes as Nova Scotia has banned all activities in wooded areas.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEffective 4 p.m. today, we\u2019re telling Nova Scotians to stay out of the woods,\u201d Premier Tim Houston said during a public briefing. \u201cWe are restricting travel and activities that really aren\u2019t necessary for most of us. Hiking, camping, fishing and the use of vehicles in the woods are not permitted.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Violations of the ban carry a $25,000 fine.\u00a0</p><p>Two years ago, it experienced a devastating wildfire that destroyed dozens of homes and caused millions of dollars in damage in a suburb outside Halifax.\u00a0</p><p>One person was charged and pled guilty to leaving a fire unattended when it was not completely extinguished.\u00a0</p><p>Cole said the department is keeping a watchful eye on things, adding it is considering similar action as the forecast continues to predict no rain until the weekend.\u00a0</p><p>Fire in Musquash</p><p>The Musquash Fire Department was dispatched to a gravel pit around 4 a.m. on Tuesday. Upon arrival, crews discovered a large pile of stored blasting mats was fully engulfed by fire. The department estimated the pile was roughly 9 metres high and about 15 metres wide.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe fire had spread to the surrounding woods, but was quickly extinguished by the responding firefighters,\u201d it said in a statement on social media. \u201cThere was minimal loss to the surrounding wooded area.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development (DNRED) was alerted to the fire and also responded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe fire is currently under control but it is estimated that it will be a few more hours before the fire is completely extinguished and clean up procedures completed,\u201d the statement said.\u00a0</p><p>An excavator has been brought in by Coastal Transport, according to the fire department, to break down the pile of mats while firefighters work to extinguish fire within the pile.\u00a0</p><p>The Musquash Fire Department responded with a dozen firefighters, two engines, a side-by-side, two rescue support vehicles, and forestry trailers with equipment to battle the fire.\u00a0</p><p>It said the cause of the fire is unknown.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMusquash Fire would like to remind the public to be aware of the extremely dry conditions currently in our communities and to be extra careful with all ignition sources,\u201d it said.\u00a0</p><p>The Saint John Fire Department also said it continues to respond to outdoor fires despite the ban in place.\u00a0</p><p>Cole said individuals must be vigilant, watching for signs of smoke or fire, especially in rural and wooded areas.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe have all our staff on high alert, we have our aircraft on high alert,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sooner we can respond to something small, the sooner we can get it under control.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e004c6f860bc41cb8bce45eb71718497</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GFK-CJJ3-RSP7-X4TB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><timeReceived>09:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 7, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That is more than double the 10-year average of the area burned by mid-July.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There were 561 fires burning as of Friday, including 69 that were considered out of control. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre says almost 3,300 fires have been recorded this year so far.</p><p>The record was set in 2023, when more than 6,000 fires burned more than 150,000 square km of land - an area larger than all three Maritime provinces put together.</p><p>That devastating season, where wildfires raged from Newfoundland to B.C. for months on end, sparked significant public pressure for the federal government to create a new kind of disaster response agency. </p><p>Former emergency management ministers Bill Blair and Harjit Sajjan both mulled the idea of such an agency during their time in office, with both ministers acknowledging the strain natural disasters have put on the Canadian Armed Forces and the provinces and territories. </p><p>The government said it was looking to the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency and Australia's National Emergency Management Agency as potential examples.</p><p>Final decisions on that front still have not been made.</p><p>During a Friday afternoon briefing with several of her cabinet colleagues, Emergency Management Minister Eleanor Olszewski said her department will be making changes to how it responds to wildfire seasons, which are becoming longer and more severe.</p><p>\"We think that the formation of such an agency could have a very positive impact on our ability to co-ordinate how we respond to national disasters across the country,\" Olszewski said. </p><p>That could mean having regional water bombers to respond more quickly to fires in areas that have fewer resources, she said, or leaning on a \"humanitarian task force\" to ensure people can be deployed where they're needed.</p><p>Matthew Godsoe, a senior director of the government operations centre at Public Safety Canada, said natural disasters are outpacing the capacity of the country's emergency management system. </p><p>\"In that current context, maintaining the status quo is equivalent to doing less,\" he told reporters at a technical briefing Friday, adding that all levels of government and individual Canadians must work together \"to slow or stop this nearly exponential growth in disaster losses that we're experiencing as a country.\"</p><p>The federal government has been called in to provide help five times this wildfire season, including last week, when the Armed Forces and the Red Cross helped to evacuate more than 2,800 people from Garden Hill First Nation in Manitoba. </p><p>Olszewski said she expects to have an update on a federal emergency agency in the fall.</p><p>In the meantime, communities in high-risk areas are bracing for things to get worse in the next two months, which are typically the most active of the fire season. </p><p>Saskatchewan has already seen one of the worst fire seasons ever in terms of the total area burned, and a record number of people have been forced out of their homes in that province.</p><p>Indigenous Services Minister Mandy Gull-Masty said 39,000 people have been forced to evacuate from 66 First Nations, mostly on the Prairies, calling the fire season unprecedented. </p><p>\"It is, I hope, not the new reality that we have to live with, but I'm asking myself what this looks like,\" she said. </p><p>The Canadian Press </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2025072076132569</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G9J-1WR3-S639-R1NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"595\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

They had spotted warnings in local Facebook groups.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThey asked how were we doing with the wildfires, and I was like \u2018what wildfires?\u2019,\u201d she tells The Pointer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Within the first two weeks of August, following multiple weeks under a heat dome and extended high temperature warnings across the province, four wildfires broke out in Kawartha Lakes.\u00a0</p><p>The first ignited near Moore\u2019s cottage on August 9 in the Burnt River area, with approximately 27 hectares still actively burning as of August 14.</p><p>\u201cThe fire is burning in a heavily wooded area, where ice storm damage has left hazardous terrain that makes hose deployment especially challenging,\u201d local officials reported in a press release.</p><p>A second fire began on August 11 in the Kirkfield area. Initially a grass fire covering five hectares, it quickly spread to 33.5 hectares by August 12.</p><p>Several southern Ontario municipalities, including Caledon, St. Catharines, Oshawa, Aurora and Newmarket, declared total burn bans the same week, \u201cgiven the hot and dry conditions which can cause fire to spread fast\u201d. People were also asked not to fly their drones within nine kilometres of any fire for safety reasons.</p><p>\u201cGiven the current weather conditions and the lack of significant rain, we need to take precautions to prevent large fires and protect the health, safety and air quality of our communities,\u201d Central York Fire Services (CYFS) Fire Chief Rocco Volpe said in a statement on August 11.</p><p>On August 13, rain and cooler temperatures brought some relief. By the next day, the fire in the Burnt River area was classified as \u201cbeing held\u201d. The Head Lake fire, which began on August 8 and affected 4.5 hectares, was declared \u201cunder control\u201d by Kawartha Lakes Fire and Rescue.\u00a0</p><p>The Kirkfield fire, however, remained \u201cout of control\u201d as firefighters and water bombers continued efforts to contain it, and was only classified as \u201cbeing held\u201d on August 15.</p><p>\u201cIt has been a challenging operation, and we continue to work to suppress within the 27 hectare boundary,\u201d Kawartha Lakes Fire Service deputy chief Jeff Bignell said in a statement.</p><p>Moore says her neighbours, who have lived in the Burnt River area for over 30 years, \u201cdon\u2019t recall anything like this\u201d.</p><p>The City of Kawartha Lakes asked residents to \u201chave an emergency plan and a 72-hour emergency kit\u201d ready.</p><p>\"Packing a go-bag looks different for them. We might just be up for a few days, but for them, it\u2019s about more than clothes, they might need to grab things like important documents and other personal valuables they can\u2019t leave behind.\"</p><p>Wildfires are no longer limited to northern parts of Ontario or more remote parts of other provinces; they\u2019re now starting closer to major cities more often, posing a threat to communities closer to the southern border of the country.</p><p>On August 14, a new wildfire was reported near the Rosseau area in Muskoka, close to Highway 141, covering 0.3 hectares and was classified as under control by the next day.</p><p>Going into the weekend, Ontario faces wildfire risk ranging from low in the north to moderate and high across much of the south, with some southern and eastern areas at very high danger.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is only going to continue. This is the new normal,\u201d Ontario Nature conservation director Tony Morris told The Pointer.</p><p>\u201cClimate change is making things like this more intense, more likely and more frequent.\u201d</p><p>Canada\u2019s 2025 wildfire season is already the second-worst on record, surpassed only by the catastrophic 2023 season, when more than 17.2 million hectares of land were scorched, an area larger than the United Kingdom, more than 230,000 people were forced to evacuate, and the insured damages from wildfires approached $1 billion.\u00a0</p><p>This year, by August 2 alone, wildfires had already burned over 7.3 million hectares nationally, an area larger than the entire Greater Toronto Area. That\u2019s more than double the 10-year average for this time of year, according to the latest data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) and Natural Resources Canada.</p><p>Manitoba and Saskatchewan account for more than half the area burned so far, but British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario are all also well above their 25-year averages.</p><p>United Nations experts have pointed to \u201ca warm, dry winter and spring, with temperatures more than 2.5 degrees Celsius above average.\u201d</p><p>By early June, more than 2.7 million hectares had already burned, an area roughly 150 times larger than the 2025 Los Angeles fires, where blazes devastated residential neighbourhoods.</p><p>The fires triggered widespread social disruption, forcing the evacuation of more than 33,000 people, including the entire community of Flin Flon, Manitoba, with two civilian lives lost.</p><p>The scale of the disaster extended far beyond Canada\u2019s borders. On a single day, wildfire smoke exposed over 117 million people in the United States and two million in Canada to hazardous air quality.</p><p>By August 13, there were 708 active wildfires across Canada, with 158 classified as out of control. Manitoba alone had the highest number, with 157 active fires.\u00a0</p><p>In June, provincial leaders including Ontario premier Doug Ford called on the federal government for more national support, warning that provinces can no longer manage wildfire season alone.\u00a0</p><p>\"We do need that national strategy to make sure that when issues like this happen, we have the resources, we have the water bombers,\" Ford said during a press conference.</p><p>He noted Ontario had ordered six new water bombers, but due to global backlogs, they likely won\u2019t arrive until 2029 or 2031.</p><p>\"Ontario has about 11 bombers. We ordered another six more water bombers \u2026 the problem is right now they're backlogged,\" he added.</p><p>That same month, the union representing Ontario\u2019s wildfire pilots criticized the Ford government for offering low wages and failing to address staffing shortages. Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU/SEFPO) said the government\u2019s promises of new planes gave the \u201cappearance of investment with no substance.\u201d</p><p>A few days after OPSEU/SEFPO's statement, the PC government slashed emergency wildfire funding by $42 million, with a $3.8 million cut from the budget for emergency preparedness and response.</p><p>By mid-August, Ontario reported 68 active fires, bringing its total to 467 for the year, already far surpassing the 275 fires recorded in all of 2024.</p><p>\u201cWhat we are witnessing is not just a series of isolated incidents, but a glimpse into a new, fire-prone reality shaped by human activities and climate change,\u201d United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH) director Kaveh Madani said at the launch of a new report titled \u2018The 2025 Central Canada Fires as of June 8: National Challenges of a Warming Climate and Cascading International Impacts.\u2019\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe scale of these fires and their transboundary impacts are a wake-up call. We must recognize this as the increasing trend of large-scale burning in Canada requires a fundamental shift in our preparedness, response, and, most critically, our global commitment to deal with climate change.\u201d</p><p>The UN report draws a direct line between the fire\u2019s ferocity and the unmistakable imprint of climate change, a force that is stretching fire seasons longer and sharpening the dry, volatile conditions that turn forests into tinderboxes and ordinary flames into unstoppable infernos.</p><p>As previously reported by The Pointer, by the end of May, more than half of Canada was experiencing abnormal dryness or moderate to extreme drought, with 38 percent of the Central Region, which includes Ontario and Quebec, affected and one percent of its farmland directly impacted, a recent Canadian Drought Report from the federal Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Food found.</p><p>\u201cExceptionally low spring precipitation, above normal temperatures and drying conditions have resulted in poor soil moisture, poor pasture and crop conditions and well above normal wildfire activity,\u201d the report highlights.</p><p>Those conditions created the perfect environment for wildfire activity, and they persisted through the end of July and into August.</p><p>Entomologist Sandy Smith told The Pointer that, on the whole, Ontario's forests are relatively healthy, which is why the province has experienced fewer wildfires compared to the West, East, and the Prairies.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s (wildfires) increasing partly because of climatic changes that put stress on those landscapes, kill trees, cause them or cause them to decline slowly. It doesn't usually kill them outright. It's just slow die back which creates more fuel,\u201d Smith explained.</p><p>In Ontario, there have been some localized outbreaks, like the Jack Pine budworm in the northwest and budworm in the northeast, but \"these have been relatively minor and haven't caused widespread mortality like the mountain pine beetle in BC.\"\u00a0</p><p>She notes some areas are more vulnerable to fire due to other factors like \"blowdowns from winter storms, severe hail, or flooding, which can weaken trees and make them more susceptible to burning.\"</p><p>In the Kawartha Lakes region, which was hit hard by an ice storm in March, downed trees, fallen branches, and piles of wood chips from debris cleanup have combined with ongoing drought and recent thunderstorms to create ideal conditions for ignition, turning the area into a landscape filled with kindling.</p><p>Ontario Forest Fire notes roughly half of all wildland fires in the province are sparked by lightning, with the other half resulting from human activity.</p><p>Wildfires have long been a natural part of the Canadian boreal forest\u2019s life cycle, but climate change is driving hotter, drier conditions that are making them more frequent, more severe, and extending the fire season.</p><p>Adding fuel to the fire is declining forest health, largely due to industrial logging, which leaves ecosystems more vulnerable to fire.</p><p>Canada often presents itself as a global leader in sustainable forestry, citing its membership in the Montr\u00e9al Process Working Group, an international coalition that oversees 90 percent of the world\u2019s temperate and boreal forests and sets standards for transparent forest health measurement and reporting.</p><p>But the country\u2019s own forest reporting falls short of these standards. Experts say the federal government\u2019s The State of Canada\u2019s Forests (SOF) report presents an overly optimistic view of forest conditions by relying on selective data that masks widespread degradation.</p><p>A critical analysis of the report titled \u2018Advertising or Accountability? A Critical Review of Canada\u2019s State of the Forests Report,\u2019 the SOF counts all tree-covered land, including clearcuts and monoculture plantations, as \u201cforest.\u201d This approach ignores key ecological differences such as forest age, species diversity, and ecological function.</p><p>\u201cIt mainly just tracks forest area, which basically makes it seem as if clear cuts and old growth are the same,\u201d Ontario Nature\u2019s Tony Morris explained.\u00a0</p><p>Morris says the report\u2019s focus on surface-level metrics, like the number of trees planted, overshadows deeper concerns such as biodiversity loss, caribou habitat destruction, violations of Indigenous rights, and the considerable carbon emissions associated with logging.</p><p>The SOF report also tends to emphasize \u201cnatural\u201d disturbances like wildfires and downplays the role of logging in forest degradation, \u201ceven though logging itself drives changes in forest structure and composition and can reduce a forests\u2019 resilience to climate change.\u201d</p><p>Experts have noted logging disrupts ecosystems, fragments wildlife habitats, and replaces complex, biodiverse forests with fragile monocultures, conditions that increase wildfire risk and slow post-fire recovery.</p><p>Logging in Ontario\u2019s boreal forests is already unsustainable.</p><p>A recent peer-reviewed study found forest degradation in northeastern Ontario far exceeds what would occur naturally. Forest management is legally required to emulate natural disturbance patterns, but research shows a system driven more by timber priorities than ecological sustainability; a trend likely to intensify as Mark Carney pushes to bolster Canada\u2019s economy in response to mounting trade and tariff challenges.</p><p>Disturbance rates are higher than natural fire regimes, old-growth forests are dwindling, only 22 percent remain compared to 54 percent in intact landscapes, and habitat for species like the boreal caribou and American marten is rapidly disappearing, even in areas designated for their protection.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat emerges is a picture of forest degradation \u2014 not deforestation, but the gradual breakdown of ecological systems in managed forests,\u201d Wildlife Conservation SocietyCanada senior scientist and president Justina Ray said.</p><p>Logging has replaced complex, biodiverse systems with simplified monocultures that burn more easily and recover more slowly after wildfires.</p><p>Forest ecologist Sanghyun Kim says heavy herbicide spraying, including glyphosate, is commonly used after logging to protect valuable trees like spruce and pine.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is profitable for forestry companies but causes enormous side effects, ecosystem pollution, killing insects and understory plants, and contaminating food chains and water,\u201d Kim told The Pointer.</p><p>\u201cHerbicides also reduce biomass, drying out forests and making them more flammable, increasing wildfire risk, which then impacts Southern Ontario\u2019s population. Everything is connected.\u201d</p><p>In Southern Ontario, fragmented forests are also threatened by invasive, flammable plants like boxthorn, making them especially vulnerable.</p><p>Kim stresses the need for herbicide-free, full-scale reforestation.</p><p>In January, the federal government announced nearly $1 million in funding for reforestation in Ontario\u2019s wildfire-impacted areas. Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Jonathan Wilkinson unveiled a $900,000 investment focused on restoring the Ogoki Forest region in northern Ontario with the aim of planting 800,000 native trees and rehabilitating ecosystems damaged by 2023 wildfires.</p><p>The project was announced as part of the broader 2 Billion Trees Program, a nationwide effort to restore forests from coast to coast. Restoration work in Ogoki is being led by Ontario-based Integrity Reforestation, with a focus on the areas most severely affected.</p><p>With the last three years ranking among the ten worst fire seasons on record, Morris warns that \"it's questionable whether the forest can regenerate sufficiently\" given the intensity and scale of destruction.</p><p>His fears are not in vain. Replanting after wildfires is challenging.\u00a0</p><p>Recovery is driven not only by how much time has passed since the burn, but also by site-specific environmental conditions, particularly soil moisture, which strongly affect which species can return and at what rate, a 2023 study notes.</p><p>High-severity fires in dry areas often burn away the entire soil organic layer, leaving exposed mineral soil that favours only certain fast-colonizing plants, while slowing or even preventing the return of slow-growing species like spruce or reindeer lichen, which may take decades to re-establish.\u00a0</p><p>In wetter areas, surviving roots and residual vegetation patches can help some species recover more quickly, but moisture differences can still alter competition, nutrient availability, and temperature, influencing long-term plant community composition. Because species respond differently to these conditions, postfire regeneration is highly variable and often unpredictable, making replanting efforts complex and requiring careful alignment of chosen species with the site\u2019s microenvironmental characteristics.</p><p>Therefore, even well-meaning reforestation efforts face major challenges, especially when recovery is hindered by poor data, failing forest regeneration, and unchecked industrial logging, all of which undermine effective policy and ecological restoration.</p><p>At the same time, recent provincial legislation like Bill 5 threatens to push Ontario\u2019s forests toward an even more uncertain and fragile future.</p><p>\u201cWhile Bill 5 isn\u2019t forestry-specific, its Special Economic Zones Act provision could create vast areas where laws don\u2019t apply. This might lead to cumulative impacts on forests compounding unchecked,\u201d Morris noted.</p><p>\u201cForestry companies are expected to manage forests sustainably, but with the recent surge in mining, often overlapping forestry lands, the combined stress on forests is significant. Unfortunately, the government doesn\u2019t seem to be assessing forest health through a cumulative impact lens. Both industries greatly affect forests, yet their overlapping impacts aren\u2019t being properly considered in how land use and resource allocations are managed.\u201d</p><p>The other challenge is: As Canada\u2019s population grows, more communities are sprawling into fire-prone wildland-urban interface zones, leaving about 12 percent of the population highly exposed to wildfire risks, a 2021 study noted.</p><p>Can wildfires occur in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA)?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Canadian Forest Service research scientist Mike Wotton told The Pointer.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at full-scale urban wildfires like we see in more remote areas. But you can certainly have fires in places like grasslands or in wooded areas on the outskirts of cities. In the GTA, for example, we get grass fires in the spring, particularly in dry fields. These can definitely spread, but they aren\u2019t the kind of intense fires we see in the north.\u201d</p><p>Urban infrastructure, such as roads and buildings, naturally disrupts the spread of fires, making them less likely to escalate. Wotton also notes that ravine systems like the Don Valley have vegetation that could fuel fires, but they\u2019re not typically large enough to cause widespread destruction.</p><p>Smith adds that dry weather, human activity, and invasive species do elevate fire risks, but the region's green spaces like the ravine systems help retain moisture, making them less prone to major fires. Still, human negligence, like ignoring fire warnings or causing sparks, remains a key risk factor, she notes.</p><p>Both Smith and Wotton agree the GTA may not face severe fire threats like other regions, smaller fires could still affect residential areas. Plus, quicker response times in urban settings help manage these outbreaks before they spread.</p><p>Firefighters in municipalities are typically better equipped to handle residential fires, not wildfires. In areas like Kawartha Lakes, much of the firefighting force is made up of volunteers rather than full-time professionals.\u00a0</p><p>\"While volunteer firefighters are essential and know their communities well, we need more full-time staff to handle the growing threats,\" Former Brampton councillor Elaine Moore said.</p><p>Over the past decade, Ontario has seen a dramatic decline in wildland firefighters, down by more than 100. There is a 40 percent turnover rate in aviation and emergency services, leaving the province heavily dependent on inexperienced workers in high-risk roles, a National Union of Public and General Employees (NUPGE) statement highlighted.\u00a0</p><p>Nearly a third of Ontario\u2019s fire aviation fleet is grounded due to a shortage of pilots and aircraft maintenance engineers. Frontline wildland firefighter positions are 14 percent unfilled, and Ontario is short 27 percent of its fire ranger crews.</p><p>\u201cWe are in an incredible crisis due to climate change, but also due to underfunding and understaffing,\u201d OPSEU/SEFPO president JP Hornick said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost firefighters at the same time that the need for them has increased.\u201d</p><p>The Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs (CAFC) has been calling on Ottawa to establish a national forest fire coordination agency to ensure that personnel and resources can be efficiently deployed across regions experiencing severe fires.\u00a0</p><p>The CAFC also stresses the importance of involving fire chiefs in the development of national policies but progress has stalled at the planning stage.</p><p>Moore also expressed frustration that residents in cottage country, like those in her area, didn\u2019t receive any alerts or notifications from authorities during the recent crisis. With limited internet access in these rural areas, many residents remain unaware of growing threats until it's too late.</p><p>She suggested using notification systems like Ontario Hydro\u2019s, which sends text updates for power outages, or Peel Region\u2019s weekly waste reminders. \u201cThese systems should be extended to alert residents about floods and wildfires,\u201d she said, noting the need for a registry where cottage associations, which already manage local issues like road maintenance, could serve as points of contact for municipalities.</p><p>Further complicating the situation is the lack of clarity regarding government responsibility. Cottage country is often caught between federal, provincial, and municipal agencies, leading to fragmented communication.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's a clumsy baton exchange between governments at different levels. When we need information, it\u2019s often only available on a website, and by then, it\u2019s too late,\" she added.</p><p>As wildfires become an increasingly common part of Canadian summers, experts agree that the science is clear, but a more coordinated government response is crucial.\u00a0</p><p>Morris says what\u2019s happening in the Kawartha Lakes area should be \u201cwake-up call\u201d for Canadians as well as the governments.</p><p>A Canadian Climate Institute report notes a shift from reactive to proactive strategies is needed including restricting development in high-risk areas, promoting fire-resistant building practices, improving forest management, enhancing firefighting capacity, and, most importantly, reducing carbon emissions to mitigate the escalating impacts of climate change, including more frequent and intense wildfires.</p><p>\u201cIt's a wake-up call that climate change is real and could become a more regular occurrence here,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt just takes one event for everyone to realize, 'Wow, it can happen to us too.' It's not just something that happens in Manitoba or Northern Ontario; this is a very real issue.\u201d</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:anushka.yadav@thepointer.com\">anushka.yadav@thepointer.com</email></p><p>At a time when vital public information is needed by everyone, The Pointer has taken down our paywall on all stories to ensure every resident of Brampton, Mississauga and Niagara has access to the facts.

Earlier Wednesday, Natural Resources\u00a0estimated the fire to be\u00a0about 15 hectares in size.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A mandatory evacuation of all businesses in the plaza on the west side of Chain Lake Drive remains in place, and all\u00a0 access points to the plaza west of Chain Lake Drive from Julius Boulevard to the Kent store remain closed and secured by police, the alert said.</p><p>The fire broke out around\u00a02:30 p.m. AT on Tuesday in the Susies Lake area near\u00a0the north entrance\u00a0to\u00a0Bayers Lake Business Park,\u00a0about 10 kilometres west of downtown Halifax. The province confirmed in an update Wednesday afternoon that the fire was <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/bayers-lake-fire-was-human-caused-dnr-confirms-1.7608117\">caused by human activity</url>.</p><p>In social media posts earlier Wednesday, the provincial Natural Resources Department\u00a0said 30 of its firefighters were on scene at first light. They were soon joined by six firefighters with Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency.</p><p>Natural Resources\u00a0said there was a short window of favourable foggy, misty conditions for ground crews working Wednesday morning. The fog initially prevented aircraft from being used to fight the fire, but in the afternoon helicopters began\u00a0dropping water.</p><p>The fire was initially estimated to be\u00a025 to 30 hectares, but Natural Resources later said it decreased in size on Wednesday to 15 hectares.</p><p>A forest fire alert was issued for\u00a0part of Annapolis County on Wednesday night due to a fire in the Godfrey Lake area. Some residents have been asked to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/forest-fire-alert-annapolis-county-west-dalhousie-1.7608530\">prepare to evacuate if the fire behaviour changes.</url></p><p>Natural Resources said Wednesday afternoon there were also two small wildfires burning near\u00a0Lake Paul, in Kings County, estimated at 0.9 hectares and 1.9 hectares. The smaller fire is under control while the larger one remains out of control.</p><p>It said 15 Natural Resources firefighters and 30 local firefighters were on scene along with\u00a0two\u00a0helicopters dropping water.</p><p>An alert issued by the Halifax municipality at\u00a010:45 a.m. Wednesday\u00a0said there was a mandatory evacuation of a number of stores and restaurants along the west side of Chain Lake Drive, the main thoroughfare in\u00a0the business park.</p><p>It said the evacuation was required to manage traffic issues and \"protect residents and workers,\" as officials urged people to stay away from the area.</p><p>Roy Hollett, deputy chief with Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency, said earlier Wednesday that no homes have been evacuated.</p><p>However, Nova Scotia Health's Bayers Lake Community Outpatient Centre, which was evacuated on Tuesday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/outpatient-centre-in-bayers-lake-business-park-closed-wednesday-due-to-fire-1.7607575\">will\u00a0remain closed Thursday</url>.</p><p>\"We do encourage people, if you do not need to be in that area, don't go there,\" Hollett told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Information Morning Nova Scotia</emphasis>.</p><p/><p>On Tuesday, planes could be seen circling around large plumes of smoke, dipping down into a nearby lake as spectators looked on from docks and\u00a0balconies in the suburb of Timberlea.</p><p>One Natural Resources helicopter\u00a0was dropping water, as were several planes sent from New Brunswick, where there are two major wildfires burning. The planes were later sent back\u00a0but could return if needed.</p><p>Bill Knowlton, an owner at B.A.D. Dog Cycles in Timberlea, said he had\u00a0a front-row seat to\u00a0planes scooping up water in Governor\u00a0Lake.</p><p>He said a colleague had spotted smoke rising from a nearby wooded area Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>\"And then it was a whole lot of activity in a hurry,\" Knowlton said in an interview on Wednesday outside the motorcycle shop.</p><p>\"We heard that air support was coming in, and that air support turned out to be two great big water bombers from Quebec. Big yellow guys.\"</p><p>Knowlton said there were still kayakers in the lake when they first started buzzing overhead.\u00a0</p><p>\"Everybody took the hint and cleared the lake. Then they came in right out of nowhere and started scooping,\" he said.</p><p>\"We were laughing because commercial planes couldn't\u00a0land as softly as those guys were landing in the water as they were filling up. Then they would power up, take off and they just kept a continuous circle. It was an amazing sight to see.\"</p><p>He said dozens of people arrived on the shores of the lake to take in the action.</p><p>\"We could have handed the pilot a Pepsi, it felt like. He was so close to us as he was coming through,\" said\u00a0Knowlton.</p><p/><p>Officials issued an emergency alert Tuesday evening <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/residents-warned-against-drone-use-during-bayers-lake-fire-1.7607385\">warning people not to use drones</url> within\u00a09.3 kilometres of the uncontrolled wildfire.\u00a0The Halifax Professional Fire Fighters confirmed in a Facebook post that a drone did temporarily pause operations.</p><p>Hollett said if helicopters or planes see a drone in the air, \"they will not risk hitting them.\"</p><p>\"It could cause a very serious air collision,\" he said. \"If you get caught having a drone in the wildfire area, you will be charged.\"</p><p>Nova Scotia has been experiencing extremely dry conditions. Last week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/hiking-ban-vehicles-wildfire-concerns-1.7019695\">the provincial government imposed a ban on people entering the woods</url> in an effort to help prevent wildfires. People who violate the ban could be slapped with a $25,000 fine.</p><p>The federal Agriculture Department's latest drought update, released Tuesday, said the Atlantic\u00a0region received below-normal precipitation in July,\u00a0with large portions of Nova Scotia receiving less than 40 per cent\u00a0of normal monthly precipitation.</p><p>The report said the\u00a0southwestern tip of the province is\u00a0abnormally dry, while there are moderate to severe drought conditions elsewhere.</p><p>Environment Canada said\u00a0smoke from nearby wildfires is reducing air quality throughout Halifax County.<br/><br/> The air quality statement said people more likely to be impacted by wildfire smoke, including people aged 65 and older, pregnant people and infants, should avoid strenuous activities outdoors and seek medical attention if experiencing symptoms.</p><p>The national weather forecaster said health risks can increase as smoke levels rise, so people should consider reducing or rescheduling outdoor sports, activities and events.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATCH | Highlights from wildfire news conference on Wednesday: </emphasis></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORE TOP STORIES</emphasis>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanovascotiasusieslakewildfireaug13202517607563</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGN-8XN3-RSXW-J402-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1009\"/><timeReceived>10:55 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Calvin Callahan joined other Republican state lawmakers from Iowa, Minnesota and North Dakota in filing a formal complaint against Canada to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and the International Joint Commission, a binational organization that resolves disputes on shared water and air quality.</p><p>The Republican lawmakers called for an investigation of Canada's wildfire management practices and for potential remedies under international law.</p><p>\"If Canada can't get these wildfires under control, they need to face real consequences,\" Callahan said in the news release. \"We won't sit back while our air becomes a health hazard.\"</p><p>Callahan joins a chorus of Republican politicians at other levels of government who have been voicing concerns about Canada's wildfires.</p><p>Michigan Rep. Jack Bergman sent a letter to Canadian Sen. Michael MacDonald on Monday calling for stronger forest management policies and more accountability from Canadian officials. Both are members of the Canada\u2014United States Inter-Parliamentary Group.</p><p>Michigan Rep. John James sent a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney last week saying his constituents are choking on toxic wildfire smoke.</p><p>Citing a letter other Republican members of Congress sent to Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman in July, James said that \"since then, rather than progress, we have seen escalation.\"</p><p>James said Kinew's declaration of a second state of emergency in Manitoba \"confirmed what many Americans have feared: that Canada is not doing nearly enough to stop these fires before they start.\"</p><p>The American lawmaker also criticized Kinew's comments in response to the initial letter. Kinew in July said it turns people off politics \"when you have got a group of congresspeople trying to trivialize and make hay out of a wildfire season where we've lost lives in our province.\"</p><p>A husband and wife were killed by a fast-moving wildfire northeast of Winnipeg in May and thousands have been evacuated from their communities.</p><p>James said Kinew's comments dismissed the health impacts the wildfire smoke has on neighbouring states. The Republican said the smoke amounts to a public health emergency \"and it is actively damaging the U.S.-Canada relationship.\"</p><p>The increasing pressure from Republicans comes as the bilateral relationship between the two countries remains tense.</p><p>On Aug. 1, U.S. President Donald Trump boosted tariffs on Canadian goods to 35 per cent after a new security and economic agreement failed to materialize ahead of the president's deadline. The duties do not apply to goods compliant with the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement on trade.</p><p>Canada is also being hit with Trump's steel, aluminum, copper and automobile tariffs.</p><p>Natural Resources Canada said in July that wildfires are a global problem caused by the effects of climate change, including prolonged drought.</p><p>Trump has called climate change a \"hoax\" and his administration dismissed all of the scientists working on a flagship climate report.</p><p>Many Republicans point to the 2023 Canadian wildfire season, which was the worst on record. Fires blazing across the country that year sent thick smoke into the United States and even across the Atlantic Ocean to northern Europe.</p><p>Canadian officials have warned that this year's wildfire season could shape up to be the second-worst on record. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, a non-profit owned and operated by federal, provincial and territorial wildland fire management agencies, said on its website that 744 active wildfires were burning across Canada on Wednesday.</p><p>U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said Tuesday that Canada's recent wildfires offer a \"stark reminder\" of the countries' shared challenges.</p><p>In a statement shared by the U.S. Embassy, Hoekstra said the United States and Canada have \"a long history\" of supporting one another in times of crisis.</p><p>\"Canadians stood with us during the tragic California wildfires earlier this year, and we are committed to standing with Canada now,\" he said.</p><p>Wildfires burning across multiple American states, including California, have been sending smoke into nearby communities.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 6, 2025.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-55460744a52945e2a5dbcf048ca3d573</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GFC-DGB3-S14G-W41X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"878\"/><timeReceived>05:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 6, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(TSX.V: NAM | OTCQB: NMTLF | FSE: P7J) (\"NAM\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that, effective September 30, 2025, it has entered into an option agreement, after completing its due diligence, with arms-length parties, Mr. Doug Bundy, Mr. Dave Burt and Mr. Jon Burt, who are all local Kenora Mining District Prospectors. The Project consists of 114 mining claims and 1 patented Mining Claim totalling 2,191 hectares or 5,414 acres. The Project is located ~25 km southeast of Kenora in northwestern Ontario. The Company has the option to acquire a 100% of the Project subject to a 2% royalty, which the Company has a option to buy down the royalty to 1% for $1 million.</p><p>Highlights</p><p>Highlights of the Bonanza Gold Project are:</p><p>Multiple high-grade mineral occurrences with spectacular visible gold at surface;</p><p>Excellent infrastructure, including road access to all areas to the Project and provincial grid power lines;</p><p>Location 25 km southeast of City of Kenora, a major northwestern Ontario economic hub with a population of ~14,800;</p><p>Select due diligence surface grab sample assays include 1.1 g/t Au, 3.7 g/t Au, 8.9 g/t Au, 13.2 g/t Au, 22.2 g/t Au, 31.9 g/t Au and up to 127 g/t Au from five prospects on the Project (see Table 2 below);</p><p>Lack of modern-day exploration; and</p><p>Drill-ready with 3-year permits in place.</p><p>With the gold price and demand at historic highs, parts of the Kenora District have seen limited application of modern exploration methods, which provides NAM with an opportunity to unlock significant value through the use of new techniques, advanced technologies and upgraded mineralization models. Our long-term goal is to assemble a district-scale gold asset in Kenora that can ultimately attract the attention of major gold producers that are now cash rich with significant new exploration funds, as a result of their recent enhanced profitability. Given the severe lack of funds in recent years for the junior mining industry, there has been little new modern-day exploration completed in this region.</p><p>Chairman and CEO Harry Barr states, \"We began our search for new gold assets in early 2024, leading to the establishment of our Gold-Antimony Division in Newfoundland in early 2025. Since then, our technical and management teams have been systematically reviewing projects on an international scale. Always more comfortable with North American assets, we believe the Bonanza Gold Project and parts of the Kenora Mining District have been under-explored, under-appreciated, and underfunded in recent years. This new acquisition adds to our diversified mineral portfolio, and we believe it is a significant gold exploration project for the Company. This additional gold Project will allow our shareholders more exposure to what we believe is one of most significant gold rallies in recent history. Gold is not a new metal for the New Age Metals management team and board of directors; in fact, we collectively have over 150 years experience in the gold industry.</p><p>From the onset, our corporate objective has been to acquire and develop critical metal projects. Today we are a well financed, multi-asset company that is aggressively expanding its project portfolio across gold, antimony, lithium, and platinum group metals. In my opinion, our flagship asset is still the <url normalizedValue=\"https://newagemetals.com/river-valley-palladium-project\">https://newagemetals.com/river-valley-palladium-project</url>/ and both platinum and palladium have enjoyed major price increases in the last 3 months.</p><p>In June of this year, NAM upsized its equity position in MetalQuest Mining to ~12%. MetalQuest Mining inc. (TSXV:MQM | OTCQB: MQMIF | FRA:E7Q) who controls a 100% of a substantial, high-purity iron deposit project in the Labrador Trough, Quebec. Approximately $120 million has been spent to date, including a historical NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate and a 2015 Feasibility Study.\"</p><p>Farid Mammadov, VP Investor Relations states, \"In today's climate of global uncertainty, gold has once again proven itself to be one of the world's most essential metals. Prices are at record highs, now trading near US$3,830 (C$5,330) and global demand continues to climb. These market conditions have opened the door for NAM to add to its already diversified and significant project portfolio and mineral inventory. The response to our recent private placement indicates that there is renewed investor interest in both our company and the broader junior mining industry. Proof that the industry is turning around was the recent upsizing of our private placement to $4,000,000. Mr. Eric Sprott indicated his intention to subscribe for $2,000,000 hard dollars for last week's placement.\"</p><p>The Kenora Gold District</p><p>The Kenora Gold District, located in northwestern Ontario, has been recognized since the late-1800s as one of Canada's most prolific gold camps. Known for its high-grade Archean lode-gold deposits, the district has supported mineral exploration and some mining for more than a century. With established infrastructure, year-round access, and a highly skilled workforce, Kenora has potential to become a cornerstone of Ontario's mining industry. Some of the active majors and mid-tier companies in the District are Agnico Eagle, Kinross, Centerra and New Gold.</p><p>Terms of the Option Agreement</p><p>To exercise the Option, NAM's agreement calls for a series of cash payments and share issuances to the Prospectors, exploration expenditures on the Project. The share payments will be based on a 10-day trading average before issuance. NAM has the ability to terminate the agreement any time after the first year's commitments have been completed.</p><p>The agreement also provides for contingent milestone payments of $250,000 on the completion of an NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource and Technical Report outlining more than one million ounces of gold, and an additional $250,000 for a compliant Mineral Resource exceeding 2.5 million ounces. The Partners will also retain a 2% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty, of which NAM has the right to re-purchase 1% for $1 million.</p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"> &lt;table style=''&gt; &lt;tr style=''&gt;

Twenty-five grab samples were taken from quartz veins, quartz-carbonate veins and sulphide zones at 5 prospects distributed along 4 km across the Property. The mineralized vein and zones are hosted in silicified, carbonated and sulphidized (mainly pyrite) mafic to intermediate volcanic and plutonic host rocks. The rocks are cut by a regional high-strain zone and property-scale and smaller scale structures and generally metamorphosed under greenschist conditions.</p><p>The mineral occurrences sampled and RUSH gold assay results are shown in Figure 1 and listed in Table 1. Photographs of selected high-grade samples are shown in Figure 2. The due diligence program successfully confirmed the presence of high-grade gold mineralization on the Project, particularly at the Triggs, Kite Lake, Stella and Blue Star Prospects.</p><p>Figure 1.

Two certified reference materials (\"CRMs\") were inserted into the sample batch. The CRMs were sourced from industry-certified providers and selected to match, as closely as possible, the expected mineralization style and grade ranges of the samples.</p><p>All samples were individually sealed in heavy-duty plastic bags, labelled with unique sample numbers, and placed into rice bags for transport. Continuous possession of the samples was maintained until they were dropped off at a courier service in Saskatoon for express delivery to SGS Canada Minerals laboratory facilities in Burnaby, British Columbia. At this facility, the samples were weighed and prepared into pulps in accordance with SGS's standard procedures before being analysed on a RUSH basis for gold.</p><p>The analytical work included:</p><p>Gold: Au exploration grade 50-g Fire Assay with Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (\"AAS\") (reporting limits 5 to 10,000 ppb) (GE_FAA50V5</p><p>Gold: Au over limit analysis \"ore\" grade 50-g Fire Assay with Gravimetric Finish (reporting limits 0.5 to 10000 ppm) (GO_FAG50V)</p><p>Internal laboratory QA/QC procedures at SGS included the insertion and analysis of certified reference materials, analytical blanks and sample duplicates with the submitted samples to monitor analytical accuracy and precision.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Dr. William Stone, P.Geo. and a Qualified Person for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and a consultant to NAM, has collected, reviewed and approved the scientific and technical disclosure in this press release.</p><p>The Qualified Person has not completed sufficient work to verify the historical information on the neighbouring and other properties in the Kenora region. Nevertheless, the Qualified Person considers that drilling and analytical results were completed to industry standard practices. The reader is cautioned that mineral occurrences, prospects and deposits on neighbouring properties are not necessarily indicative of mineralization on the Company's properties. This information may provide an indication of the exploration potential of the Properties, but might not be representative of exploration results.</p><p>About NAM</p><p>New Age Metals is a junior mineral exploration and development company focused on the discovery, exploration, and development of critical green metal projects in North America. The Company has three divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, an Antimony-Gold Division as well as an investment in <url normalizedValue=\"https://metalquestmining.com\">https://metalquestmining.com</url>/ high purity Lac Otelnuk Iron Project.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North America's largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>The Company's Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (\"MinRes\"), one of the world's largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canada's critical metals sector, with New Age Metals' portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Age's properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat Lake-Winnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAM's Antimony-Gold division is in Newfoundland and spans over 19,800 hectares consisting of 11 non-contiguous properties. Six of these properties are in St. Alban's area, along Canstar's Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining 5 properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Gold's Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 of the Project, Phase 2 has been initiated, and further news will follow. On July 30th, the Company was pleased to announce that it has received formal approval under Newfoundland and Labrador's Junior Exploration Assistance (JEA) Program, including eligibility for the Critical Minerals Assistance (CMA) and Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (PCMA) streams.

The snowpack vanished early, the ground is dry, and the forecasts are anything but comforting. Everyone from climatologists to firefighters are warning us, this summer could rival the worst we\u2019ve ever seen. Which is why I ask:why wait? Just imagine what Chilliwack would be like if the Chilliwack River Valley, Cultus Lake, the Columbia Valley, the Eastern Hillsides, or even Harrison Hot Springs, or any other location near us were to be consumed by forest fire. It\u2019s unimaginable. Yet we are at far greater risk in this area with the larger population density that will descend upon our backcountry from now until the cooler weather in the fall. With the large increase in homeless camps in our local forests, the risks are even higher. We\u2019ve been here before. 2017, 2018, 2023 - entire communities upended or erased. People displaced. Lives lost. Recovery that takes years, if it ever comes. And every time, we hear the same post-mortem:\u201cWe should\u2019ve acted sooner.\u201d</p><p/><p>This year, let\u2019s actually do that. Close the backcountry preemptively, and remove the homeless camps before disaster hits. It won\u2019t be easy, or fair to some, but everyone is a risk.</p><p>I say this as someone who values Crown land access deeply. I hike, I camp, I fish, I hunt, I photograph. These wild spaces are sacred to many of us. But keeping them open during extreme wildfire risk is not freedom, it\u2019s foolishness. And the price of that gamble is paid by small towns, Indigenous communities, rural residents, and everywhere that forest fire smoke invades with its toxic particulates.</p><p>Yes, many of us in B.C. have behaved responsibly. Yet, human caused fires have caused on average, 39 per cent of them in recent years. It only takes one discarded cigarette, fireworks, or a tailpipe over dry grass to light the fuse.</p><p>Let\u2019s not rely on luck this year. Let\u2019s rely on leadership.</p><p>The B.C. government must establish a clear, enforceable policy for closing high-risk backcountry areas when wildfire risk reaches critical levels, before the flames do. This shouldn\u2019t be a reactive panic measure, instead it should be a well-communicated, repeatable part of fire season response. Much like avalanche forecasts guide winter backcountry access, fire risk should guide summer closures.</p><p>And while tourism will undoubtedly take a temporary hit, the alternative is long-term economic ruin for regions scorched and shuttered by fire. The short-term losses are nothing compared to the devastation of a fire like Elephant Hill, Lytton, or White Rock Lake.</p><p>It\u2019s time we stopped treating the fire season like an exception. It\u2019s now the rule.</p><p>So to Premier David Eby and the Government of British Columbia:Close the backcountry before it burns.</p><p>To my fellow British Columbians:if you truly love your backcountry escapes, prove it by staying out when the danger is high. No fires. No fireworks. No risk. If you see someone being reckless, report it, and record it. Let\u2019s be smart this year. Not selfish. Not reactive. Not sorry. To the wildfire crews preparing for another exhausting summer:thank you. We see you. We support you.</p><p>Let\u2019s give them fewer fires to fight.</p><p>Sincerely, Carsten Arnold Chilliwack</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHLPRO-news20250530PPUA0004773794</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHLPRO2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FXR-B6R3-RS1K-8018-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"578\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

It is especially dangerous because these particles are so small they can be absorbed into your bloodstream when you breathe, IQAir said.</p><p>Shortly before 10 a.m., the PM2.5 concentration in Toronto was 12.6 times more than the World Health Organization's guideline.</p><p>The Greenwood and Danforth Avenue area and the Beaches neighbourhood are getting hit the hardest, according to the company. </p><p>Environment Canada is recommending that children and elderly people should reduce or reschedule any arduous outdoor activities. Others should only do so if they're experiencing symptoms such as coughing or throat irritation.</p><p>Here's what you need to know about the weather in the days to come.</p><p>Environment Canada forecast for Toronto</p><p>There is a 60 per cent chance of rain Thursday afternoon with a daytime high of 23 C. The showers should clear up by the evening where cloudy periods will help drop temperatures to a cool 14 C. </p><p>Kicking off the month of August, Friday will bring sunshine with a high of 24 C during the day and clear skies at night with a low of 15 C.</p><p>Heading into the weekend, Saturday is also forecast to bring sunshine throughout the day and clear skies at night. There will be a high of 27 C and low of 13 C.</p><p>Sunday will see much of the same weather with sunny skies, a clear evening, a high of 29 C and a low of 15 C.</p><p>Monday will have a mix of sun and cloud and a daytime high of 28 C. There will be cloudy periods at night with a low of 16 C.</p><p>How to protect yourself from smoky air</p><p>You might have mild, common symptoms related to Thursday's smoky skies like eye, nose and throat irritation, headaches or a mild cough, Environment Canada said. More serious symptoms like wheezing, chest pains or a severe cough are less common and mean you should stop outdoor activities, the agency added, noting anyone having a medical emergency should seek immediate medical help.</p><p>When you're indoors, keep your windows and doors closed as much as possible to keep smoky air out, the agency said, but you should prioritize keeping cool when there is extreme heat and poor air quality at the same time.</p><p>You can also protect indoor air from wildfire smoke by using an air filter in your ventilation system or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine particles. You can also try moving to public spaces with better ventilation, such as Toronto's six \"Cleaner Air\" spaces:</p><p>City Hall, open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on SaturdaysMetro Hall, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdaysNorth York Civic Centre, open from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on weekdays, and from 8 to 6 p.m. on weekends and holidaysScarborough Civic Centre, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on SaturdaysYork Civic Centre, open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdaysEast York Civic Centre, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays</p><p>You can reduce your exposure to fine particles in the outdoor smoke by wearing a well-fitting, respirator-type mask, like a NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent respirator, the agency said.</p><p>Torontonians are also encouraged to check in on people who may be affected by the pollution.</p><p>With files from Anastasia Blosser </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025073176231567</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCY-HHH3-S59V-V0P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Pretty much the entirety of this country - and indeed much of Europe - is in the grips of a major heatwave.</p><p>Many habits here in the Old World stubbornly resist the forces of change, but some of the most entrenched inevitably fall.</p><p>French cuisine is grumpily making way for the air fryer. New laws have come into effect banning cigarettes on France's beaches, in parks and in front of schools.</p><p>And the more intense and more frequent heatwaves in this country look set to topple another long-held custom: the national disdain for air conditioning units.</p><p>The traditional French answer to the intensity of August sees the vast majority of the country's city dwellers shut down and shift to the nation's seashores.</p><p>Outside of Paris' tourist haunts, a great many restaurants, boulangeries, caf\u00e9s and boutiques are shuttered, with signs noting that they'll be back when life returns to the capital at the very end of the month.</p><p>But there is little respite anywhere this summer.</p><p>A historic forest fire near the southern city of Narbonne has been extinguished after burning up more than 16,000 hectares of thirsty, arid land, helped along by high temperatures and winds.</p><p>On Monday, the village of Le Montat, north of Toulouse, recorded temperatures of 43 C. The southern port city of Marseille has waived entry fees at the city's public pools until the temperatures return to less dangerous and more hospitable levels. Some of the country's older trains have been preventively taken out of service for fear that they too will succumb to the heat.</p><p>And forecasts say that the end of the French heatwave could be another week away, meaning it is on track to at least equal that of 2003, which made history as the hottest summer on record in 150 years.</p><p>French health officials determined in a 2004 study that the intensity and length of that heatwave was directly responsible for 15,000 deaths, particularly among the elderly and those living in retirement homes.</p><p>Homes for the elderly in France now have a legal obligation to maintain at least one collective area for residents that is equipped with air conditioning.</p><p>It's a different matter in private residences throughout the country. Statistics show that only about a quarter of homes and apartments have an air conditioning unit, which is reportedly due to concerns about the electricity costs of the energy-hungry cooling units as well as the harmful environmental impacts.</p><p>In Paris, where the city's zinc rooftops were listed last year on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity there is no question of spoiling them with the installation of A/C units' bulky metal fans.</p><p>The intensity of these ecological and aesthetic sentiments are not, apparently, shared in the United States and Canada, where 90 per cent and 70 per cent of homes, respectively, are air conditioned.</p><p>One news outlet considering these statistics asked whether French people's resistance to air conditioning was \"absurd.\"</p><p>The answer may depend on your political, environmental and ethical convictions. But for some, the answer is a resounding and unequivocal \"yes.\"</p><p>With hotter temperatures and more frequent heatwaves, they say, the country needs to abandon its environmental high horse and get practical about beating the heat.</p><p>That's what happened in the dying days of the last school year when far-right leader Marine Le Pen, head of the National Rally party, put aside her usual anti-immigration talking points and called for a national air-conditioning policy for France, one she pledged to institute if her party ever comes to power.</p><p>The instigator was an early-season heatwave that led to the closure in June of nearly 60 schools in the western city of Tours, on the Loire River, but also an acknowledgement that France and its public services are increasingly paralyzed by spiking temperatures, she wrote on X.</p><p>\"I am thinking also of all those workers who suffocate in buildings without A/C because of leaders who have decided that the French must suffer through the heat while they enjoy air-conditioned vehicles and offices,\" she wrote.</p><p>\"With France's so-called elites, austerity is always reserved for the lower classes.\"</p><p>Urban planning experts are haunted by forecasts of continued and worsening temperature problems, seized with the problem and in search of solutions.</p><p>One professional group, which goes by the French acronym APUR, conducted a cast study last year that looked at technical fixes like walls that store cool air, interior layouts that encourage air circulation and the strategic positioning of buildings in urban environments to better protect from the heat.</p><p>And the Ecological Transition Agency, a French government body responsible for the national climate change fight, recommends things like closing windows and shutters before peak temperatures, shutting interior doors to prevent hot air from circulating, planting gardens and eating fresh fruits and vegetables rather than cooking with the oven or stove.</p><p>You can take those steps as practical advice to get a little relief, or discard them as wholly insufficient measures to cool off in a burning planet. The French, according to statistics, are looking for protection a bit stronger than window shutters.</p><p>The number of permanently installed air conditioning units in residences across the country reportedly doubled to 800,000 in 2020 from 400,000 in 2010, and the rate of residential A/C use is expected to hit 95 per cent by 2050.</p><p>In a country beset by blistering summer temperatures, the French are rising up and look ready to topple another longstanding custom, climate change advocates and architectural aesthetes be damned. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025081376318666</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGR-4SP3-RXB7-X02D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1013\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The snowpack vanished early, the ground is dry, and the forecasts are anything but comforting. Everyone from climatologists to firefighters are warning us, this summer could rival the worst we've ever seen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Which is why I ask: why wait? Just imagine what Chilliwack would be like if the Chilliwack River Valley, Cultus Lake, the Columbia Valley, the Eastern Hillsides, or even Harrison Hot Springs, or any other location near us were to be consumed by forest fire. It's unimaginable. Yet we are at far greater risk in this area with the larger population density that will descend upon our backcountry from now until the cooler weather in the fall. With the large increase in homeless camps in our local forests, the risks are even higher.</p><p>We've been here before. 2017, 2018, 2023 - entire communities upended or erased. People displaced. Lives lost. Recovery that takes years, if it ever comes. And every time, we hear the same post-mortem: \"We should've acted sooner.\"</p><p>This year, let's actually do that.</p><p>Close the backcountry preemptively, and remove the homeless camps before disaster hits. It won't be easy, or fair to some, but everyone is a risk.</p><p>I say this as someone who values Crown land access deeply. I hike, I camp, I fish, I hunt, I photograph. These wild spaces are sacred to many of us. But keeping them open during extreme wildfire risk is not freedom, it's foolishness. And the price of that gamble is paid by small towns, Indigenous communities, rural residents, and everywhere that forest fire smoke invades with its toxic particulates.</p><p>Yes, many of us in B.C. have behaved responsibly. Yet, human caused fires have caused on average, 39 per cent of them in recent years. It only takes one discarded cigarette, fireworks, or a tailpipe over dry grass to light the fuse.</p><p>Let's not rely on luck this year. Let's rely on leadership.</p><p>The B.C. government must establish a clear, enforceable policy for closing high-risk backcountry areas when wildfire risk reaches critical levels, before the flames do. This shouldn't be a reactive panic measure, instead it should be a well-communicated, repeatable part of fire season response. Much like avalanche forecasts guide winter backcountry access, fire risk should guide summer closures.</p><p>And while tourism will undoubtedly take a temporary hit, the alternative is long-term economic ruin for regions scorched and shuttered by fire. The short-term losses are nothing compared to the devastation of a fire like Elephant Hill, Lytton, or White Rock Lake.</p><p>It's time we stopped treating the fire season like an exception. It's now the rule.</p><p>So to Premier David Eby and the Government of British Columbia: Close the backcountry before it burns.</p><p>To my fellow British Columbians: if you truly love your backcountry escapes, prove it by staying out when the danger is high. No fires. No fireworks. No risk. If you see someone being reckless, report it, and record it.</p><p>Let's be smart this year. Not selfish. Not reactive. Not sorry.</p><p>To the wildfire crews preparing for another exhausting summer: thank you. We see you. We support you.</p><p>Let's give them fewer fires to fight.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Carsten Arnold</p><p>Chilliwack</p><p>Copyright 2025 Chilliwack Progress</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHLPRO-news20250528PCL4729224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHLPRO2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FX9-D3C3-RS55-G0WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"583\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Especially if you can't escape it.\"</p><p>The combination of heat, humidity and air pollution can also cloud cognition, making people more irritable and reactive, which can lead to substance abuse, Kidd said.</p><p>Kidd said evidence suggests there\u2019s also an increase in domestic violence and interpersonal conflict during extreme weather events.</p><p>The United Nations (UN) reported in April that climate change could be linked to one in every ten cases of intimate partner violence by the end of the century if action is not taken to interrupt that trajectory.\u00a0</p><p>A 2018 study cited in the UN report found intimate partner femicide rose 28 per cent during heat waves in Madrid.</p><p>Among the solutions is creating better, more stable housing that reduces exposure to high-risk air, and in doing so, improves health and well-being across the board, Kidd said.</p><p>\u201cIt's not just about breathing bad air,\" Kidd said. \"(It's) ultimately about having fewer people breathing air like this.\"\u00a0</p><p>Still, those who have access to cool indoor spaces can feel stuck inside and socially isolated, which can result in doom scrolling and worsen feelings of loneliness.</p><p>Jiaying Zhao, a professor of psychology and sustainability at the University of British Columbia, said when wildfires pollute the air in Vancouver and the sky turns an orange hue, she tends to stay home.\u00a0</p><p>\"I just don't interact with people. I'm isolated as a result of air pollution and that's not good. That can really exacerbate depressive symptoms and any kind of mental-health issues associated with depression,\" Zhao said.\u00a0</p><p>Some young people struggle with the crushing reality of climate change, said Zhao.</p><p>When air quality plummets, those feelings can swing from abstract to material.</p><p>\u201cThat further exacerbates eco-anxiety, climate anxiety, that makes me, as well as others, think this is the end of the world. It does seem like an apocalypse,\u201d said Zhao.</p><p>Dr. Zarina Giannone, a registered psychologist in Vancouver, said it helps to think about what makes you feel safe and more in control of the exposure, which can include connecting with other people who are also exposed and isolated.\u00a0</p><p>\"When they're not breathing in clean air or there's been a forest fire, which is common out here in B.C. \u2014 for the, for the air to really change suddenly and quite significantly like that \u2014 that can impact how people feel, how safe they feel; can kind of provoke more situational change in their mental status and wellness.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 15, 2025.</p><p>Canadian Press health coverage receives support through a partnership with the Canadian Medical Association.

It is especially dangerous because these particles are so small they can be absorbed into your bloodstream when you breathe, IQAir said.</p><p>Shortly before 10 a.m., the PM2.5 concentration in Toronto was 12.6 times more than the World Health Organization's guideline.</p><p>The Greenwood and Danforth Avenue area and the Beaches neighbourhood were  hit the hardest, according to the company. </p><p>Environment Canada had recommended that children and older people should reduce or reschedule any arduous outdoor activities. Others should only do so if they're experiencing symptoms such as coughing or throat irritation.</p><p>Here's what you need to know about the weather in the days to come.</p><p>Environment Canada forecast for Toronto</p><p>As the local smoke dissipates, Thursday is expected to see 20 km/h winds tapering off in the afternoon. A high of 23 C will feel like 25 with humidity, as the UV index climbs to a very high 9.</p><p>Some clouds will roll in Thursday night as the low drops to 14 C.</p><p>Kicking off the month of August, Friday will bring sunshine with a high of 24 C during the day and clear skies at night with a low of 13 C.</p><p>Heading into the weekend, Saturday is also forecasted to bring sunshine throughout the day and clear skies at night. There will be a high of 27 C and low of 16 C.</p><p>Sunday will see much of the same weather with sunny skies, a clear evening, a high of 29 C and a low of 16 C.</p><p>Monday will have a mix of sun and cloud and a daytime high of 29 C. There will be cloudy periods at night with a low of 17 C.</p><p>How to protect yourself from smoky air</p><p>You might have mild, common symptoms related to Thursday's smoky skies like eye, nose and throat irritation, headaches or a mild cough, Environment Canada said. More serious symptoms like wheezing, chest pains or a severe cough are less common and mean you should stop outdoor activities, the agency added, noting anyone having a medical emergency should seek immediate medical help. </p><p>The wildfire smoke can also worsen lung and heart conditions, Toronto public health officials added in a post on X.</p><p>When you're indoors, keep your windows and doors closed as much as possible to keep smoky air out, the agency said, but you should prioritize keeping cool when there is extreme heat and poor air quality at the same time.</p><p>You can also protect indoor air from wildfire smoke by using an air filter in your ventilation system or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine particles. You can also try moving to public spaces with better ventilation, such as Toronto's six \"Cleaner Air\" spaces:</p><p>City Hall, open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on SaturdaysMetro Hall, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdaysNorth York Civic Centre, open from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on weekdays, and from 8 to 6 p.m. on weekends and holidaysScarborough Civic Centre, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on SaturdaysYork Civic Centre, open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdaysEast York Civic Centre, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays</p><p>You can reduce your exposure to fine particles in the outdoor smoke by wearing a well-fitting, respirator-type mask, like a NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent respirator, the agency said.</p><p>Torontonians are also encouraged to check in on people who may be affected by the pollution.</p><p>With files from Anastasia Blosser </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025073176233202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCY-HHH3-S59V-V0PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

It is especially dangerous because these particles are so small they can be absorbed into your bloodstream when you breathe, IQAir said.</p><p>Shortly before 10 a.m., the PM2.5 concentration in Toronto was 12.6 times more than the World Health Organization's guideline.</p><p>The Greenwood and Danforth Avenue area and the Beaches neighbourhood were  hit the hardest, according to the company. </p><p>Environment Canada had recommended that children and older people should reduce or reschedule any arduous outdoor activities. Others should only do so if they're experiencing symptoms such as coughing or throat irritation.</p><p>Here's what you need to know about the weather in the days to come.</p><p>Environment Canada forecast for Toronto</p><p>As the local smoke dissipates, Thursday is expected to see 20 km/h winds tapering off in the afternoon. A high of 23 C will feel like 25 with humidity, as the UV index climbs to a very high 9.</p><p>Some clouds will roll in Thursday night as the low drops to 14 C.</p><p>Kicking off the month of August, Friday will bring sunshine with a high of 24 C during the day and clear skies at night with a low of 13 C.</p><p>Heading into the weekend, Saturday is also forecasted to bring sunshine throughout the day and clear skies at night. There will be a high of 27 C and low of 16 C.</p><p>Sunday will see much of the same weather with sunny skies, a clear evening, a high of 29 C and a low of 16 C.</p><p>Monday will have a mix of sun and cloud and a daytime high of 29 C. There will be cloudy periods at night with a low of 17 C.</p><p>How to protect yourself from smoky air</p><p>You might have mild, common symptoms related to Thursday's smoky skies like eye, nose and throat irritation, headaches or a mild cough, Environment Canada said. More serious symptoms like wheezing, chest pains or a severe cough are less common and mean you should stop outdoor activities, the agency added, noting anyone having a medical emergency should seek immediate medical help. </p><p>The wildfire smoke can also worsen lung and heart conditions, Toronto public health officials added in a post on X.</p><p>When you're indoors, keep your windows and doors closed as much as possible to keep smoky air out, the agency said, but you should prioritize keeping cool when there is extreme heat and poor air quality at the same time.</p><p>You can also protect indoor air from wildfire smoke by using an air filter in your ventilation system or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine particles. You can also try moving to public spaces with better ventilation, such as Toronto's six \"Cleaner Air\" spaces:</p><p>City Hall, open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on SaturdaysMetro Hall, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdaysNorth York Civic Centre, open from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on weekdays, and from 8 to 6 p.m. on weekends and holidaysScarborough Civic Centre, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on SaturdaysYork Civic Centre, open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdaysEast York Civic Centre, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays</p><p>You can reduce your exposure to fine particles in the outdoor smoke by wearing a well-fitting, respirator-type mask, like a NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent respirator, the agency said.</p><p>Torontonians are also encouraged to check in on people who may be affected by the pollution.</p><p>With files from Anastasia Blosser </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025073176233469</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCY-HHH3-S59V-V0PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Elsewhere, park workers were already replanting the first batch of trees in the recently scorched earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Douglas firs\u00a0were chosen because they resist fire better than other conifers, according to Marcia DeWandel, vegetation restoration specialist for Parks Canada.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, replanting so soon after a fire is much more exception than rule.\u00a0Replanting is typically expensive, time consuming, labour intensive - and doesn't always work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DeWandel says they were able to move so quickly was because they had already done the\u00a0necessary studies and surveys for replanting the area and - most importantly - they already had the seedlings, which can sometimes take years to source and\u00a0grow.</p><p>\"That wasn't necessarily the plan, because we didn't know the fire was going to happen,\" says DeWandel. \"But we did have these seedlings on hand for other restoration projects, so we did end up putting them in some of the burned areas at that time.\"</p><p>She notes they were already seeing an \"amazing\" level of greenery re-sprouting after the fire, which showed the soil\u00a0and root network\u00a0were \"somewhat intact.\" She says they prioritized\u00a0replanting recently-burned areas near wetlands, erosion-prone slopes\u00a0and frequently used trails - though planting has since paused while they monitor drought conditions and destructive cutworms that tend to breed in severely burned areas.\u00a0</p><p/><p>This year is already Canada's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/climate/wildfire-season-2025-1.7606371\">second-worst wildfire season on record</url>, with more that 7.3 million hectares - roughly the size of New Brunswick - burned so far. And that's on the heels of the previous two years of devastation, including Canada's worst wildfire season in 2023.</p><p>As climate change makes wildfires <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/forest-fires-northern-ontario-1.7588711\">more intense</url>, experts suggest\u00a0the forests we rebuild\u00a0most likely won't resemble what was there before. But given enough time, there is an opportunity to grow back healthier and more resilient.</p><p>How soon can replanting start after a fire?</p><p>In most cases, it can take years for replanting to begin after a fire.</p><p>Northwestern Ontario's Ogoki Forest was the site of intense fires in 2023, which scarred more than 40,000 hectares of pine- and spruce-covered landscape, much of it vital caribou habitat.\u00a0</p><p>Located about 400 kilometres northeast of Thunder Bay, Ont., replanting efforts in the boreal forest are only just starting to take root - more than 700,000 sets of roots.</p><p>\"It's actually really important not to speed and just go right after a fire,\" says Jess Kaknevicius, CEO of Forests Canada, one of the organizations supporting Ogoki's replanting.</p><p/><p>After a fire, Kaknevicius says there could be years of surveys and assessments before planting can begin. That includes the initial safety assessments, looking at what is growing back naturally, where replanting will have the greatest effect and what to plant.</p><p>There's also the matter of sourcing seeds from the burned areas, which are cultivated into seedlings at nurseries for up to two years before they can be hand-planted.</p><p>\"If you need 500,000 to 1,000,000 trees, they're not just sitting there waiting for you,\" says Kaknevicius. \"People don't realize that seed is a very, very precious commodity and is one that is being impacted by climate change, too.\"</p><p>After planting, it's a matter of returning to the site at the one-year, two-year, and five-year marks to see how they're growing. \"The overall process, if you think of it, from seed to survival, is anywhere between five to eight years,\" she adds.</p><p>What does survival look like?</p><p>In some replanted areas, ensuring survival is easier said than done, especially when dealing with other effects of climate change.\u00a0</p><p>In 2017, the Elephant Hill fire burned more than 192,000 hectares of the B.C. Interior, roughly 100 kilometres west of Kamloops.\u00a0</p><p>Three years later, the Secwepemc\u00fal'ecw Restoration and Stewardship Society - formed from eight First Nations communities affected by the fire - began hand-replanting a mix of cottonwood, aspen and willow along the Bonaparte River.</p><p>However, almost none of the initial batch survived the next year - seedlings baked in dry earth as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-heat-wave-climate-change-1.6085275\">2021 heat dome brought temperatures approaching 50 C to the region</url>.\u00a0</p><p/><p>\"There was a huge mortality rate within all of the planting within B.C. that year,\" says Angela Kane, CEO of the society. \"So we had to sit down and think about what's next, what's a better way to plan it?\"</p><p>One solution? Dig with high-power pressure washers.\u00a0</p><p>\"It disperses enough of the dirt and just totally saturates that area [with water], so it gives it a really good head start,\" says Kane. \"And it's twofold. The same equipment that you use for the planting, you can then turn around and use for firefighting in your community as well.\"</p><p>Burned too much, or not enough?</p><p>Another challenge is the land itself. When a fire burns too hot and deep, it can create a glass-like layer that repels water, which Kane says cannot be replanted even with human help. \"It's just a dead moonscape,\" says Kane.</p><p>Not burning deep enough can come with other problems, according to Victor Danneyrolles, a forest ecologist at the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi.\u00a0</p><p/><p>He says the organic top layer of soil contains fewer nutrients and retains less water compared to the mineral soil underneath. If the organic layer isn't burned away, it needs to be cleared with heavy machinery before planting - which, at more than $2,000 per hectare, adds up very quickly when hundreds of thousands of hectares have burned.</p><p>To solve that issue, Danneyrolles is helping develop seeds coated in nutrients and water-retaining material, which can be dropped by drone into hard to reach terrain. He says the coating helps seeds take root in organic soil more easily, and skips the step of cultivating them into seedlings first.</p><p>Soot with a silver lining</p><p>While an out-of-control forest fire might not be ideal for the health of an ecosystem, the blackened blank slate that remains does bring opportunities for change.</p><p>\"Most of our replanted forests are black spruce, which is great for the forest industry. But we have alternatives that can be more resistant and more resilient to fires,\" says Danneyrolles.\u00a0</p><p>Danneyrolles says that could be a less commercially desirable but faster-growing conifer such as jack pine, or less-flammable deciduous species such as white birch or aspen, which can act as a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/stopping-wildfires-with-trees-how-thousands-of-aspen-seedlings-could-help-protect-whitehorse-1.7554568\">natural fire break</url>.</p><p>But focusing on just one type of greenery risks missing the forest for the trees, says Amy Cardinal Christianson, senior fire advisor with the Indigenous Leadership Initiative.</p><p>\"I think we need to lose our obsession with trees,\" says Christianson.\u00a0</p><p>She says promoting a greater range of native species such as berries and medicinal plants, as well as allowing some areas to return to grasslands rather than forest, could go a long way.</p><p>\"I don't think we'll ever get back to the way it was,\" says Kane of the efforts at Elephant Hill. \"Our goal is to try and create something better than what it was.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewsclimatetreesforestwildfiresplantingseeds17606076</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH3-2NH3-RRV4-R0TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1169\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Data shows that the global smart robot market size surged from 158.3 billion yuan in 2020 to 369 billion yuan in 2024, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) as high as 23.6%.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this wave, \"Embodied Intelligence\" robots are becoming a key direction for technological breakthroughs. Different from traditional robots, embodied intelligence robots realize the ability of intelligent interaction with the physical environment through a closed-loop system of \"perception-decision-action\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Within this technical framework, robot forms have evolved into three mainstream directions: tracked (high-load stable movement), wheeled (high-efficiency planar motion), and legged (complex terrain adaptation, including humanoid). Among them, quadruped robots, by virtue of balancing motion stability and terrain adaptability, have become one of the most promising carriers for Embodied Intelligence in terms of industrialization.</p><p>In China's quadruped robot sector, DEEP Robotics has established a leading edge with its Jueying (Absolute Shadow) series of products. These products have demonstrated excellent adaptability in complex scenarios such as power inspection, emergency rescue, and police security. They have been widely applied in multiple key domestic industry fields and successfully entered overseas markets, with implementations in international projects like Singapore's national power grid.</p><p>It is worth noting that in complex and ever-changing practical application scenarios, traditional robots often face the dilemma of being unable to balance efficiency and adaptability. To breakthis limitation, DEEP Robotics has innovatively launched the \"wheel-foot robot\" - LYNX M20, which can achieve wheeled high-speed movement on flat roads and switch to foot-type obstacle-crossing mode on complex terrain.</p><p>According to official data, this product is \"the world's first industry-applied wheel-foot robot specially built for complex terrains and dangerous environments\". LYNX M20 can handle complex terrains such as deserts, snowfields, swamps, and mountains, and boasts industrial-grade performance including IP66 protection, 2.5-hour battery life, and 15kg load capacity. This evaluation will verify whether it deserves the title of \"King of All-domain Operations\" from four major dimensions: movement capability, environmental adaptability, functional expansion, and actual combat performance.</p><p>1.Product highlights</p><p>Excellent flexibility</p><p>LYNX M20 weighs only 33kg and can be carried by a single person. Compared with other robots of the same type, it has a more compact size, making it convenient for operators to carry and transport in certain specific scenarios.</p><p>It features seamless \"morphing\" capability between two forms, with an ultra-large joint movement range and the ability to seamlessly switch between double-leg configurations. The \"front elbow and rear knee\" structure allows LYNX M20 to easily navigate through narrow dead corners, Moreover, it features omnidirectional movement, allowing it to make zero-radius turns in tight spaces without needing to change orientation. , freely pass through narrow channels only 50cm wide, and penetrate into confined spaces such as tunnels and pipe corridors. In specific scenarios, it can also seamlessly switch to the \"full elbow mode\", demonstrating excellent obstacle-crossing ability in complex situations.</p><p>Compared with Spot's self-weight of 32.7kg, LYNX M20 has more advantages in the comprehensive performance of flexibility and portability. When operating in complex spaces, it can respond to task requirements at a faster speed and improve overall work efficiency.</p><p>In addition, apart from the lightweight design specifically created for certain scenarios and operations, as an industrial-grade wheel-foot robot designed for operations on complex terrains, LYNX M20 boasts excellent terrain-conquering capabilities. Its unique wheel-foot integrated structure enables it to climb slopes with an extreme gradient of 45\u00b0, and the maximum vertical obstacle-crossing height reaches 80 centimeters, which allows LYNX M20 to exhibit extremely strong adaptive terrain capabilities in operation scenarios such as emergency rescue.</p><p>Strong functional expansibility</p><p>LYNX M20 is equipped with a variety of interfaces on its back, including 24V/72V power interfaces, Gigabit Ethernet ports, and USB 3.0 interfaces etc. This provides a broad space for its functional expansion, allowing users to conveniently and quickly install various professional devices according to different operational needs.</p><p>Take power inspection as an example: a dual-light pan-tilt can be installed, and through the collaboration of visible light and thermal imaging, comprehensive and accurate monitoring of transmission lines can be achieved; In fire emergency scenarios, mounting fire-extinguishing devices and life detectors enables it to go deep into dangerous areas to carry out rescue work.</p><p>In terms of secondary development capabilities, LYNX M20 provides industry users with richer business-side development interfaces (such as standardized mechanical/electrical interfaces, Gigabit Ethernet ports, and USB3.0), which can quickly adapt to professional modules such as power inspection equipment and sensor kits, significantly improving the efficiency of secondary development. GO2 W mainly focuses on functions such as basic movement and intelligent OTA upgrades, with a load capacity of about 8kg (maximum ~12kg), making it difficult to carry large or various types of professional equipment like LYNX M20, and thus unable to meet some industrial-grade application scenarios with high requirements for functional diversity.</p><p>Good endurance and durability</p><p>LYNX M20 can achieve an effective payload endurance of 2.5 hours with a maximum cruising range of 12km, and it supports hot-swappable battery replacement, allowing for quick battery changes without stopping operations during work, thus enabling long-term continuous operation. In contrast, Spot can run for 90 minutes on a single charge, with endurance far inferior to that of LYNX M20.</p><p>In terms of protection level, LYNX M20 reaches IP66 (Note: IP66 protection level means the product is completely protected against the intrusion of external objects and can completely prevent dust from entering; when subjected to violent wave impact or strong water spray, the amount of water entering the machine should not reach a harmful level). It is completely dustproof, can resist strong water impact, can work normally in extreme temperature environments ranging from -20\u2103 to 55\u2103, and is also equipped with a night fill light device, enabling it to adapt to dark environments. Spot has a protection level of IP54, which can only prevent dust intrusion and limited water splashing, so its adaptability in harsh environments is not as good as that of LYNX M20. LYNX M20 has stronger durability and can work more stably in complex and harsh environments.</p><p>Excellent environmental perception</p><p>LYNX M20 is equipped with a 96-line LiDAR, which can generate high-quality point clouds at approximately 860,000 points per second. It features an ultra-large field of view of 360\u00b0\u00d790\u00b0, supports positioning, mapping, navigation, and omnidirectional obstacle avoidance, and is also equipped with a 360\u00b0 point cloud surround view function.</p><p>GO2 W is equipped with a 4D LiDAR L1, with the same field of view of 360\u00b0\u00d790\u00b0 (minimum detection distance of 0.05 meters), but the point cloud output is approximately 43,000 points per meter (calculated based on the parameters of Unitree 4D LiDAR L1). The high-density point cloud of LYNX M20 has more advantages in capturing obstacle details, making it especially suitable for complex scenarios that require precise obstacle avoidance.</p><p>Spot adopts a solution of four sets of depth cameras + 3D distance sensors to achieve 360\u00b0 visual perception, but is not equipped with a high-line-beam LiDAR. Relatively speaking, the LiDAR of LYNX M20 performs better in distance measurement accuracy and ambient light stability, especially in dark or strong light environments.</p><p>2. Actual combat scene evaluation</p><p>Desert steep slope sprint: The official video of DEEP Robotics starts with a scene showing LYNX M20 sprinting on a desert steep slope. The desert geology is soft with low friction, making it difficult for ordinary legged and wheeled robots to maintain their balance. However, LYNX M20 can ensure stable movement on the desert ground through the combination of wheeled foot soles and legged movement gaits, effectively coping with complex terrains such as deserts.</p><p>Muddy marsh traversal: Footage from DEEP Robotics shows that when operating in muddy marsh areas, LYNX M20's legged drive system can automatically adjust its stride length according to the terrain. When its feet encounter obstacles hidden beneath the mud, the motion system responds quickly to adjust its movement posture to navigate over them. Even when its IP66-protected exterior is covered in mud, the device continues to function normally, demonstrating reliable performance in harsh environments.</p><p>Ruins obstacle-crossing demonstration: In the video simulating a mountain forest fire scenario, LYNX M20 can switch to the \"front elbow and rear knee\" movement configuration to climb over obstacles. Besides, in narrow passages, M20 can also move freely thanks to its relatively compact size. With the wheel-foot form, it doesn't need to change direction, demonstrating speed and movement advantages in complex environments. The dual-module device mounted on the mechanical interface of the fuselage works synchronously - the dual-light pan-tilt marks the heat source of the fire point in real-time, and the fire-extinguishing equipment operates on the simulated fire source, showing the emergency response capability at the fire site.</p><p>Nighttime full-dark operation: In the full-darkness test at the end of the video, LYNX M20 can activate its supplementary lighting system, turning on both front and rear fill lights. Additionally, the device's 96-line LiDAR is capable of constructing a 3D environmental model even in complete darkness, assisting the robot dog in perceiving the surrounding environment.</p><p>Scenario application test</p><p>Mountain forest fire-fighting scenario: Although the official video does not elaborate on the complete process of mountain forest fire-fighting, judging from the performance of LYNX M20, it is capable of moving quickly in the complex terrain of mountain forests. It can carry fire-fighting equipment to go deep into the fire site, and cooperate with devices such as thermal imaging to conduct fire reconnaissance and preliminary disposal.</p><p>Power inspection application: Combining its product features, LYNX M20 can traverse complex terrains such as mountains and forests to conduct close-range inspections of transmission lines. The sensors and other equipment it carries can promptly detect potential hidden dangers in the lines, ensuring the safe operation of the power system.</p><p>Logistics and distribution scenario: In terms of logistics and distribution, LYNX M20's load capacity and endurance make it capable of completing the last-mile delivery tasks in scenarios such as residential communities. It has more advantages compared with traditional distribution methods, especially in areas with complex terrain.</p><p>3.Comparison of similar products</p><p>Comparison and summary:</p><p>GO2 W is an excellent consumer-grade product, but LYNX M20 holds significant advantages in professionalism, environmental adaptability, and functional expansion, making it suitable for industrial customers who truly require reliable operations. While Spot remains the pinnacle of motion control, LYNX M20, with its wheel-foot integration and industrial-grade cost-effectiveness, offers greater practical value in real operational scenarios.</p><p>4. Conclusion and prospect</p><p>Overall, as the world's first wheel-foot robot deeply customized for complex terrains and hazardous environments, DEEP Robotics' LYNX M20 has achieved a key breakthrough in the industrial robot field through its wheel-foot integrated design. It not only addresses the long-standing pain point of traditional robots-\"the difficulty of balancing efficiency and adaptability\"-but also demonstrates significant advantages in scenarios such as power inspection, emergency rescue, and logistics distribution with its modular ecosystem and industrial-grade reliability.</p><p>Compared with the consumer-grade GO2 W, LYNX M20 takes the lead in load capacity, environmental adaptability, and functional expandability. When compared to Spot, it achieves differentiated breakthroughs in industrial rigid demands such as endurance and protection, supported by a highly competitive cost advantage.</p><p>However, the popularization of LYNX M20 still faces certain challenges. Its customized development costs and high hardware investment brought by industry-grade high performance are relatively high, and large-scale mass production has not yet fully amortized the costs, but this does not prevent it from becoming a benchmark product in China's quadruped robot field at present. In the future, with the integration of technologies such as 5G remote control and AI autonomous decision-making, the application scenarios of LYNX M20 may be further expanded. It is worth looking forward to that with large-scale mass production and the maturity of the supply chain, the comprehensive application cost of LYNX M20 is expected to be further optimized, thus opening a broader market.</p><p>Company: DEEP Robotics<br/>Contact: Vera Huang<br/>Email 1: huanglingxiao@deeprobotics.cn <br/>Email 2: partner@deeprobotics.cn <br/>Inquiry Form: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.deeprobotics.cn/en/index/buy.html\">https://www.deeprobotics.cn/en/index/buy.html</url></p><p>SOURCE: DEEP Robotics</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/computers-technology-and-internet/in-depth-evaluation-deep-robotics-lynx-m20-robot-dog-surpasses-th-1047854\">press release</url> on ACCESS Newswire</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FSCWRE-498399193</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G7K-PKC3-RY0T-H3RB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411383</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2316\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025  ACCESS Newswire Inc.

Life in Prince Rupert, the rainiest city in Canada!</p><p>The weather is getting to me right now, so I took to thinking about what drew me here thirty-three years ago. Moving from Montreal, I'd had enough of their weather. Freezing winters and hot, humid summers.</p><p>One particularly hot day, I got heat stroke riding home on my bicycle. I must say, that is not a possibility in Prince Rupert. I can also do without three months of snow or summer heatwaves and forest fire smoke, although forest fires weren't as frequent thirty years ago.</p><p>Montreal was a wonderful city to live in when I was a young adult because rent was cheap; there was, and still is such a mixture of cultures; and so many great restaurants.</p><p>Fifty years ago it was easy to get work, and there was a great choice of colleges and universities.</p><p>I have fond memories of Montreal, but I never liked the surrounding freeways and the heavy traffic.</p><p>I grew up in Vancouver, which, as we all know, is warmer than Rupert, (right now by 10 degrees Celsius!) and has rain but less rain than up here.</p><p>As an adolescent, once I got a 10-speed I literally went out of my way to bike to the outskirts of the city and beyond. Vancouver seemed too small to me and I wanted to see the world.</p><p>When I moved back to B.C., 20 years later, I was taken aback at how Vancouver had grown. Traffic had grown insane! The same streets, but double the population and double the traffic. Everything faster and noisier.</p><p>Prince Rupert drew me at first because of work. I came for the job, but I loved its location on the rugged northwest coast, the beautiful ferry ride, the proximity to Haida Gwaii and Southeast Alaska, the beautiful highway drive along the Skeena, the music festivals up and down the valley.</p><p>It was one of the few cities in B.C. where I could afford to buy a house, and for a drummer, a detached house is a necessity if you want to practice on a real drum set.</p><p>With the steady rain and the cold temperatures, the demise of the local movie theatre, and the perennial absence of a beach, I'm not liking this summer, but I have options for warmer climes - driving to Terrace and Smithers, going down island, it's all good!</p><p>And hopefully the oldtimers are wrong and there will be warmer, sunnier summers in the very near future.</p><p>I consider Rupert my home, and I'm more comfortable here than anywhere else I can think of, the people, the salmon, the wildlife, the big sky.</p><p>In my heart, I know there is no substitute.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Prince Rupert Northern View</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NORTHV-news20250702PNV4740165</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NORTHV2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G5S-C403-RRSP-51CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438217</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

By using the loophole of non-resident candidacy, Pierre Poilievre is desperately circumventing our system of local representation. Fine for him to use this loophole but when others follow suit he screams foul, even though he set the example.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As it stands, only the party in power can initiate electoral reform, yet it is against their best interests to do so. The Liberals and Conservatives prefer the status quo which guarantees hyper-partisan infighting and wildly childish behaviour in parliament. They support the travesty of a party forming a majority government while receiving a minority of popular votes cast. Electoral reform would be tantamount to enacting political anti-trust legislation. This is mirrored by the Conservative party itself where Poilievre's minority of Tea Party-style Conservatives have hijacked this once-proud party.</p><p>Hyper-partisan politics is the hallmark of the disaster happening to our southern neighbours. We should see this as a cautionary tale and strive for governments that include more voices. This can only happen through electoral reform. It will lead to coalition governments intent on getting things done. Coalition leads to collaboration, co-operation, compromise and consensus. This is what we should strive for. </p><p>David Ottenbrite, Cambridge</p><p>GOP whines</p><p>but won't fight climate change</p><p>Manitoba's Wab Kinew accuses group of Republicans of pitching 'timber tantrum' over wildfire smoke, Aug. 6</p><p>Rather than create noise on social media with unsubstantiated blaming of fire management practices in Canada, GOP lawmakers can quickly and easily act on a couple of quick solutions to the epidemic of climate change. These would include sending more firefighting help where needed and immediately stopping the burning of coal, oil and gas.</p><p>Jack Bergmans, Toronto</p><p> Olive reminds</p><p> us that Canada</p><p> is not broken</p><p> In recent columns, David Olive helped Canadians to think constructively in the face of Donald Trump's tariff chaos. July 21 it was the auto industry. His Option B urges us to consider a Canadian-owned and tariff-protected assembly industry, meeting defence and other public needs in the first instance, but also producing high-priority heavy equipment. I would add that, if federal and provincial governments are prepared to support multibillion-dollar battery-assembly plants, why are we leaving it to the Chinese to produce the small, low-cost reliable electric cars and plug-in hybrids that our carbon reduction targets demand?</p><p>On Aug. 2, it was the steel industry. While supporting the anti-dumping and emergency relief measures already announced, he also has faith in the power of a rapid and rigorous \"buy Canadian\" commitment for the steel that a \"build, baby, build\" Canada will need for, housing, infrastructure and defence.</p><p>With facts at his fingertips, insightful analysis and no fear of well-thought-out boldness, Olive reminds us that Canada is not broken. He reassures us that it is not economic ignorance or Oz-like fantasy to believe that Canada can and will thrive. Thanks David. Elbows Up!</p><p>Bill Winegard, Etobicoke</p><p>America's return to manufacturing means pollution </p><p>Months into his worldwide trade war, Donald Trump still appears resistant to learning how tariffs work, Aug. 5</p><p>As the GTA chokes on climate-change-worsened forest fire smoke, smoke we're perfectly willing to share with the Americans, let's consider that a \"return to the golden age of American manufacturing\" would mean ever more pollution. This is because the Trump MAGAs have zero interest in industrial laws that protect the environment, viewing them as nothing more than red tape. By outsourcing manufacturing, the U.S. has reduced industrial pollution here, emissions that the Americans would be happy to share with us. Thriving through Draconian tariffs is indeed what the Bard called \"a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\" That too many Albertans are willing to make noises about separation from the rest of Canada can only heighten Trump's fantasy of the dissolution of Canada and the acquisition of his \"cherished\" 51st state.</p><p>Ron Charach, Toronto</p><p> Ford wants more space for gas cars as Canada burns</p><p>'Most ridiculous decision': Doug Ford slams Ontario judge over bike lane decision, Aug. 6</p><p>We're in the midst of a smoke-filled climate change conundrum. Our Canadian forests are burning to a point where the smoke is soon to reach the shores of Europe. Meanwhile, Premier Doug Ford is in a spat with Ontario's judiciary, as he continues in his attempt to remove bike lanes in Toronto, so there'll be more road space for greenhouse gas-emitting automobiles. It's time for us air-breathing constituents to stand up and be counted.</p><p>Jack Drury, Toronto</p><p>Premier's tunnel vision inspires little confidence</p><p>'It's a vision and it works': Ford offers new details on his plan for a Hwy. 401 tunnel, Aug. 6</p><p>Premier Doug Ford is a brave man to propose a three-level tunnel that's \"never been done in the world\" when Metrolinx can't finish the Eglinton Crosstown or get the Finch LRT, which is all above ground, running. Is this a fantasy or just loose political talk?</p><p>Michael Levin, Toronto</p><p>Do people want a tunnel under Highway 401? Absolutely not! This is nothing but a colossal gift to Doug Ford's construction friends and will almost certainly bankrupt the province. Instead of trying to use Highway 407, which a previous Conservative government sold to private interests, Ford wants to waste our tax dollars on the 401 tunnel. I was in Windsor in July and was shocked to find no one in my family knew anything about the tunnel plan. Windsor pays provincial taxes too, so why are they unaware of this huge government line item that will not help anyone in the province except GTA commuters? </p><p>Gord Deane, Mississauga</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2025080876283753</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GFK-GH93-RRS5-Y2V6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1003\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

The scale and complexity of these air evacuations cannot be overstated  and neither can the unwavering dedication of the teams executing them.</p><p>The Prime Minister has been in close contact with the Premiers of Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Various arms of the federal government are working with premiers and the Canadian Armed Forces. All orders of government are engaged, including with Indigenous leadership.</p><p>Prime Minister Carney shared that the government will partner with the Canadian Red Cross to match donations and will work with provincial partners to provide essential services, such as temporary lodging, clothing, and food, to those impacted.</p><p>The Prime Minister emphasized emergency management support to all those affected, including First Nations communities. He also expressed gratitude to first responders, Canadian Armed Forces members, and local officials on the ground.</p><p>The Prime Minister affirmed that the government stands ready to mobilize additional federal support wherever needed and in all aspects.</p><p>Associated Links</p><p>WildfiresGet PreparedCanadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre</p><p>This document is also available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://pm.gc.ca\">https://pm.gc.ca</url></p><p>SOURCE  Prime Minister's Office</p><p> View original content: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2025/30/c9530.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2025/30/c9530.html</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNW-20250530C9530</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FXT-K9M3-RSYS-X4V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"293\"/><timeReceived>8:54 PM Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CNW Group</copyright><publicationName>Canada NewsWire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 30, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And some, he said, likely wrongfully assumed the fire meant the death of Miramichi's forest industry.\u00a0</p><p/><p>\"The fire basically meant that some people moved further north in New Brunswick, some moved to Gasp\u00e9 and Quebec, I mean, even up into the Ottawa Valley,\" MacEachern said.</p><p>\"You could say that the Miramichi fire kick-started the forest industry in the Ottawa Valley, to the point that, if you go to Pembroke, Ontario, now, two centuries later, the long-term care facility is called the Miramichi Lodge.\"</p><p>Some people moved to the Bathurst region, and this detail is the motivation behind a summer of events at the Maison Doucet Hennessy House exploring the Bathurst connection to the Great Miramichi Fire.</p><p>MacEachern will give a presentation in August as part of the program, but the rest of the events begin on Thursday at the house overlooking the house, a provincial heritage building overlooking the\u00a0Bay of Chaleur.</p><p>Melynda Jarratt, the president of the Maison Doucet Hennessy House, built more than 210 years ago, said she had two inspirations for program.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATCH | Melynda Jarratt explains family connection to the Great Miramichi fire:\u00a0</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>Her ancestors were directly affected by the fire, which broke out just after they\u00a0arrived from Ireland.</p><p>And the Doucet Hennessy House came into possession of doors from the O'Brien House, built after the fire and\u00a0associated with Joseph Cunard, an influential shipbuilder who came to Bathurst in the early 1830s and built several homes to house his employees.\u00a0</p><p>\"The O'Brien House was the very last of a ... small, purpose-built community by Joseph Cunard when he came up to Bathurst after the fire to continue his shipbuilding enterprise, which had been decimated due to the fires,\" Jarratt said.</p><p>One of the doors will soon be the front door of the Maison Doucet Hennessy House, which Jarratt said was just an obvious connection to the fire.\u00a0</p><p/><p>The summer programming has three different aspects - theatre, music and history.</p><p>MacEachern will be part of the history portion.</p><p>Mary Anne Riordon Barry, from the northeast community of Pokeshaw,\u00a0will also take part, with a presentation of oral history she gathered from people whose ancestors had to move after the fire.</p><p>\"I really had to do my own time connecting with people who were up here because I don't think that the people in Miramichi really know who and where the diaspora of people went to after the fire,\" said Riordon Barry.</p><p>A lot of names she found settled in the former village of Jacquet River, which has since amalgamated with Belledune.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Riordon Barry will give her presentations this weekend.\u00a0</p><p/><p>But along with history presentations, Jarratt said the events also include weekly performances of a play by Character Matters Miramichi, which features portrayals of Joseph Cunard and Charles Doucet, who Jarratt said built\u00a0Maison Doucet Hennessy House.</p><p>The house's artist-in-residence, David Scott, will also perform his own clarinet compositions inspired by the Miramichi fire.</p><p>Scott said while his presentation uses the historical narrative of the fire as a reference, for him, the music is more about \"the impact that has led to a metamorphosis of a displaced community.\"</p><p>\"I'm kind of imagining the symbolism of the phoenix - so this idea of the immortal firebird of mythology that is said to be reborn from the ashes of its predecessor,\" Scott said.</p><p/><p>\"The fire didn't just destroy everything, and that was the end of the story. So while\u00a0...\u00a0it was a significant tragedy, I really think of it as a story of resilience of the people of New Brunswick.\"</p><p>Scott said he only started learning about the fire when he started this project, so he hopes that people will be able to enjoy the music and potentially learn something about themselves, the community or the history in general.\u00a0</p><p>Jarratt has the same goal.</p><p>\"If I get people walking away from these events saying, 'I did not know that,' that means more to me than anything else,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanewbrunswickmiramichifire200yearseventsbathurst17592149</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GBK-65V3-RW2X-B02R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><timeReceived>1:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Over the past few weeks, we've brought you stories from fire-afflicted communities in British Columbia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and most recently Newfoundland and Labrador. Today, in Ottawa, the federal government announced $45.7 million in funding for wildfire prevention projects across the country. Emergency Management and Community Resilience Minister Eleanor Olszewski was in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan for that announcement -- visiting with Canadian Armed Forces members supporting firefighting efforts there. That's where we reached her.</p><p><br/><br/>AP: Minister Olszewski, what did you hear from the Canadian Armed Forces members you met with today?<br/><br/>ELEANOR OLSZEWSKI: I had a wonderful opportunity to meet members of the Canadian Armed Forces, and it struck me, the main thing I heard from them being their passion for being able to step up and help the people, not only of Saskatchewan, where they are now, but in other deployments across Canada as well.<br/><br/>AP: We know that in terms of federal assistance, your government announced today that it's committing $45.7 million to 30 projects through its Build and Mobilize Foundational Wildland Fire Knowledge program. But today's announcement didn't offer many specifics. Can you tell us a little bit more about how that money will be spent? What are these 30 projects?<br/><br/>EO: I don't have the specifics of those particular projects. I can tell you what my own department is working on, and that is enhancing the response system that the federal government has in place at the present time. And we're looking at all kinds of other options with respect to how we can better coordinate our federal response to wildfires. And I really think a lot of things have gone particularly well this fire season. And certainly, in terms of the number of people that have been evacuated across the country, I think that's something, really, we can be very proud of in terms of our response to wildfires. Another thing is just the degree to which the provinces and territories have cooperated with one another. You know, something that I think is not understood sometimes, and especially in this time of tariffs, is the extent to which, you know, to which the Americans actually are a great support to our number of provinces by providing firefighters as well.<br/><br/>AP: You know, Minister, you mentioned greater coordination and the cooperation you're seeing between provinces and territories as well. Last week on the show, listeners heard from Newfoundland and Labrador Association for Fire Services President Duane Antle. And I just want to play you some of what he had to say in that interview.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>DUANE ANTLE: We have been lobbying for a federal forest secretariat now for a number of years. And having that agency in place, and it can be done rather quickly, and it's not a very expensive thing to do, that can be up and running, and it could do so many things for us inter-provincially. That fire secretariat is needed, and it's something that we really, really hope we can see put in place rather quickly.<br/><br/>AP: We know that there has been some looking into this idea of a National Forest Fire Coordination Agency. So, Minister, I'm wondering if your government can commit to creating this kind of secretariat that they're calling for?<br/><br/>EO: It's interesting because the fire chiefs are calling for, basically, what they call a Fire Administration, as I understand it. And it would primarily deal with firefighting. And, you know, one of the things that I myself and my department are looking at at this point in time is whether what we do needs to be much broader than that. That's not to say that we don't need to focus on wildfires because we do. But there are a number of other kinds of natural disasters that this country faces, including flooding. So, one of the things we need to look at is whether whatever we establish needs to be broader in scope. Although, having said that, all of the options that are available for consideration are being considered at this point in time.<br/><br/>AP: Certainly there's only so much, though, that firefighters, the Canadian Armed Forces, all the resources that have been deployed can do in the face of these conditions that we're seeing right now. And those come down to, to climate change. This weekend we know that Canada's top climate advisor Simon Donner appeared on the CBC radio programme The House and said that Canada is unlikely to meet its legally binding international climate commitments by 2030, just five years away. I know that you're Canada's emergency management minister, but what is your message to Canadians who feel that your government isn't doing enough to prevent the kinds of emergencies that you are tasked with managing?<br/><br/>EO: My response would be that our government absolutely does care about climate change. We'll take appropriate steps, and are taking appropriate steps, in order to deal with that. And I would just add to that that I think community resilience is a really important factor, as well, as we deal with wire fires and floods and our other new realities. I think the prime minister showed a lot of foresight in adding community resilience to my portfolio. That doesn't quite answer your question about climate change, but it's another thing that we can do to fire-safe our communities.<br/><br/>AP: So then, to the question of climate change again, one can say we care about climate change, but Prime Minister Mark Carney has also endorsed the idea of, quote, decarbonized oil, which we know that the climate advisor, Simon Donner, says is fiction. And virtually his first official act as prime minister when we're talking about Mark Carney was to kill the consumer carbon tax. So, is this still a government then that's committed to reaching net zero?<br/><br/>EO: Absolutely, it is. And I believe what the prime minister said as well is that there will be different programs put in place, and we'll be looking forward to hearing the details with respect to the government's plans in that regard.<br/><br/>AP: And finally, in terms of those changes that you were discussing with coordination, do you think this time next year, we will see a different agency or a different coordination plan in place?<br/><br/>EO: Yes, we will. We are working very hard on that. And as I say, I just want to make sure that we get things right, and that I've heard and considered input from all of the people who are part of the emergency management system, and that includes, in particular, our provincial and territorial counterparts, but also indigenous leaders across the country and our humanitarian workforce and others.<br/><br/>AP: Minister, I want to thank you so much for your time and for joining us.<br/><br/>EO: Thank you so much. I very much appreciate it.<br/><br/>FF: Eleanor Olszewski is Canada's minister of emergency management and community resilience. We reached her in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCBCT-AIH2508122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCBCT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGX-8CX3-RRRY-01TW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487018</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1173\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

The closing is comprised of 598,500 Flow Through Units at a price of $0.30 per Flow-Through Unit representing proceeds of $179,550.00 for an aggregate total raised of $179,550.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The securities issued are subject to a four-month statutory hold period in Canada ending on December 1, 2025.</p><p>The Units consist of, and separate immediately upon closing into, one common share of the Issuer (each, a \"Common Share\") and one common share purchase warrant (each, a \"Warrant\"), each entitling the holder to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of $0.30 per Warrant for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the date of issuance. The Flow-Through Shares shall consist of one Common Share, to be issued as a \"flow-through share\" (the \"Flow-Through Shares\") within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada).</p><p>Use of Proceeds</p><p>Boreal Gold intends to use the proceeds from this financing to perform ground geophysical surveys over the western portion of the Fay Lake grid (not previously covered) as well as the north eastern portion of the Fay Lake grid that will be cut and surveyed to follow the strike extension of the Sunrise conductor to the eastern shore of Fay Lake. Drill testing of designed targets will follow up confirmation of Airborne conductors by ground geophysics on the Fay Lake property subject to a successful financing and direct consultation with Kiciwapa Cree Nation. Also planned is detailed mapping, prospecting, sampling and line cutting on the Fay Lake Property on a small portion of the Redwin volcanogenic massive sulphide horizon that remains unmapped but contains conductors.</p><p>Separate to the VMS exploration at Fay Lake above, gold exploration through mapping and prospecting of the western portion of the Puffy Lake Mine style gold mineralization trend, east of the Railroad. Approximately 10-line kilometers is planned on this trend where samples assayed up to 14.33 g/t Au, to evaluate its on strike continuity. The gold potential at Koscielny Lake located at the eastern end of the property south of the Puffy Lake Gold Mine will also be assessed. Here mineralization contained values of up to 11.81 g/t Au (0.38 oz/ton Au) over one meter (J. Pearson, Sept. 4, 2024, National Instrument 43-101 Fay Lake technical report).</p><p>North Star</p><p>Planned Program</p><p>Line cutting and refurbishing old Grids</p><p>Refurbish and recut the Grid from South of the North Star deposit on Line 46 N to Line 59 N between Baselines 46 E and Tie Line 59 E for both mapping and drilling purposes. This portion of the grid is almost 25 years old and overgrown to obliterated as it was cut a few years (12) after a forest fire.</p><p>Geological Mapping, Prospecting and Sampling</p><p>The Grids from Lines 59+50 N south to L 46 N will require geological remapping and detailed sampling to bring it up to the standard and detail of the northern grids that cover the Gold Rock and Richard Veins, with special emphasis on the section in between the North Star and Gold Rock deposits.</p><p>Drilling</p><p>Selective infill drilling, as well as down plunge drilling on the Gold Rock Vein with a view of completing a resource estimate and NI 43-101 compliant technical report (never undertaken). Ultimately the plan is to drill off enough tonnes that the combined resource of the North Star and Gold Rock Vein Structures, with sufficient grade, will warrant to bring it to a prefeasibility study. Even if successful on the first pass, this objective will require a few additional drill programs.</p><p>Melgurd Lake</p><p>On the Melgurd Lake property, following up detailed analysis of Airborne Geophysical conductors on strike with the Shotts Lake deposit and the encouragement found in the felsic volcanic package with VMS style alteration in the 2023-2024 field work, further work is planned to ground truth these conductors. Detailed mapping, prospecting, sampling and line cutting will be carried out over these conductors on the Keep Lake grid with follow up reports. Funds will also be used for corporate purposes.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Stephen L.

He figured if it came to it, he could put 10 people in the boat and his small 40-horsepower motor would get them across the lake in about 10 minutes. Then he'd come back and do it again and again until everyone was safe.</p><p>\"I had fuel. I had my oars. I even had my fishing rods ready and stuff. It was all set up and ready to go,\" he said.</p><p>Fortunately, a water bomber was on the scene within hours, arriving when the fire was aggressively spreading, going from two to 200 hectares in only an hour and a half, Meekis said. Dropping more than 6,000 litres of water in a single load, the \"super scooper\" was able to cool down the area around the airport enough so that ground crews could beat back the flames and the runway was reopened.</p><p>With more than 40 Ontario fire rangers on the ground deploying hoses and sprinklers, the town's essential infrastructure has been saved. At one point, the fire was raging less than 100 metres from the nursing station; the band office came within 60 metres of going up in smoke.</p><p>The people of Deer Lake are still worried about the fire, which had burned more than 17,000 hectares when Meekis got on that plane in early June and has since exploded to over 183,000 hectares. If it flares back up around town, it could destroy their homes. But after witnessing Ontario's forest fire fighters in action, Meekis was hopeful they have escaped the worst.</p><p>\"They're good people who have been through this before and are very knowledgeable and know how to fight the fire. I'm grateful there's people like that.\"</p><p>But with this new breed of fire, \"we're going to need a lot more of them,\" he said.</p><p>'It's just not a livable job anymore'It's hard to predict how bad a fire season will be because the weather can turn on a dime. But this year in Ontario is shaping up to be a doozy.</p><p>The wildfire that forced the evacuation of Deer Lake - dubbed Red Lake 12 - is alone more than twice as large as all the forest fires that burned last year, provincewide.</p><p>Ontario doesn't have enough wilderness firefighters. I learned what it takes to be one</p><p>And while the town is safe for now, and everyone has been safely evacuated, some people are questioning how the fire got so out of hand so quickly - and whether that would have happened if there were more fire rangers available.</p><p>Ten years ago, there were 732 fire rangers. Now there are 630.</p><p>At a time when the threat of forest fires is greater than it has ever been, our front line of defence is understaffed by more than 100 firefighters.</p><p>And with fewer fire rangers, reaction time to new fires is slower, and more of them are escaping containment. </p><p>\"Would these fires have become as big as they are if we just had the same resources as we've had in the past?\" said Noah Freedman, a crew leader and vice-president of the fire rangers' union, OPSEU Local 703.</p><p>The problem, according to government reports, the union as well as more than a dozen interviews with current and former firefighters, is staff retention. What used to be a career for people across Ontario's North has turned into a summer job for most.</p><p>The Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch (AFFES) \"is losing their experienced staff at an alarming rate,\" states an internal Ministry of Natural Resources report, obtained by the Star.</p><p>The report, published nearly a decade ago, identified a turnover rate of 45 per cent - a rate which has not improved.</p><p>\"Because of this turnover, the organization has been forced to promote employees despite them possessing only minimal practical experience and limited fire line expertise,\" the report states.</p><p>It's not just fire rangers that are short-staffed. At least three of the province's nine waterbombers have been grounded this season due to a lack of pilots, according to OPSEU.  </p><p>\"Just weeks ago, crews in Northwestern Ontario worked tirelessly battling wildfires to save people's homes and property,\" the union said in a statement. \"All the while, an aircraft sat unused, calling into question whether that grounded aircraft and a skilled crew could have made a difference.\"</p><p>In a dangerous job like forest firefighting, a lack of experience can be deadly.</p><p>\"Say you have a guy that has 10 years of experience leading a crew. They can see things and read things that somebody who has become a crew leader after three years just won't notice or won't even think of,\" said Dean Rosen, a former Ontario fire ranger who worked for five seasons out of Pickle Lake, more than 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. \"Lots of those little mistakes can have big consequences when you just don't have the right amount of experience.\"</p><p>Rosen, who wrote his master's thesis in 2021 on turnover in the Ontario FireRanger program, says there are many issues affecting retention, ranging from the remote, isolated work conditions to the physical difficulty and danger of the work itself. The fact that forest firefighters aren't employed year-round means that everyone is effectively laid off every year and has months to think about whether they want to go back.</p><p>But ultimately, it comes down to pay.</p><p>While entry-level pay recently went up to $25.38 an hour, it hasn't kept up with inflation. Today, crew members are only making one-and-a-half times minimum wage. Fifteen years ago, their wages were more than double minimum wage.</p><p>\"It's just not a livable job anymore, really. Unless fire seasons are crazy and you're working your ass off,\" said Rosen. \"Because the money's in the overtime.\"</p><p>In 2021, the last big wildfire season in Ontario, Rosen said fire rangers were able to work 500 hours overtime, adding 50 per cent to their take-home earnings.</p><p>In the quiet seasons since, there hasn't been much action. Not only is this discouraging people from returning, those who do are not building up much on-the-ground experience.</p><p>\"You get somebody who comes into the program and they're all excited and amped up and ready to go, and then they're just kind of sitting all summer. And that really deters them from coming back the next year,\" he said. \"If you're not giving them incentive to stay in the program and to develop their skills and experience and move up the ranks, why would they?\"</p><p>The budget is not enough - even in slow yearsThe bottleneck is a lack of crew leaders. No matter how many rookies are brought in, the province cannot hire additional crew members if there are no crew leaders to supervise them.</p><p>According to a 2024 ministerial briefing document obtained by the Star, the optimal number of fire rangers is 756, organized into 189 four-person crews. But in order to achieve this level of coverage, the province needs 189 crew leaders - and it has been coming up far short.</p><p>This year, there are only 144 crew leaders and, as a result, the FireRangers are limited to fielding that number of crews. Even though one-third of these crews were assigned an extra member - adopting a five-person model that had been discontinued years ago after it was found to be inefficient - the province is still 45 crews and more than 100 fire rangers short.</p><p>With fewer people on the front line, the FireRangers' response time is suffering. Over the past 10 years, the province's preferred performance metric, called \"wildfire containment effectiveness\" or \"initial attack success rate,\" has dropped markedly.</p><p>The percentage of significant fires that were \"being held\" by noon the day after they were reported was nearly 98 per cent in 2014. In 2022, the most recent year for which numbers are available, that had dropped to 92 per cent - well short of the 96 per cent target.</p><p>They say Muskoka won't burn. But climate has changed the calculus</p><p>Getting to a fire quickly is important because only two per cent of fires account for 98 per cent of the forest area burned each year, according to a Ministry of Natural Resources presentation prepared for the Auditor General and obtained by the Star. In other words, 98 per cent of fires are put out when they're small and it's the handful of fires that escape early containment that cause virtually all the damage.</p><p>In Deer Lake, so many resources were focused on saving the town that the fire was never contained and it grew rapidly in the opposite direction. A week later, it had become the second biggest fire on record in Ontario, and had burned 60 km north until it reached the doorstep of next town, Sandy Lake, which also had to be evacuated.</p><p>With more fires and fewer fire rangers to fight them, the pressure on the small number of experienced leaders increases.</p><p>Ten years ago, according to the ministry report on recruitment and retention, more than half the crew leaders had one year of experience or less in the position, and the vast majority of the initial attacks on fires were led by the more experienced crew leaders. At the fire base in Sioux Lookout, for example, only one of the 17 crew leaders had led more than 10 initial attacks, and he had 48 to his name.</p><p>While the AFFES has produced two follow up reports over the last decade, it declined to provide them to the Star. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests did not respond to questions for this story, instead sending a statement that read: \"Ontario remains an internationally recognized leader in wildfire fire management.\"</p><p>Over the last two years, the province has added 100 year-round \"support\" positions, and paid out a one-time \"retention incentive payment\" of up to $5,000 to fire rangers last year, the statement read. There's also been a pay bump, a bonus introduced for days spent camping while fighting fires and as much as $500 in reimbursement for eligible expenses related to training, including the cost of safety boots.</p><p>At the FireRangers base in Haliburton, supervisor Bob Hurley said the real difference maker has been the introduction of nine-month \"tech\" contracts for crew leaders, which allows some of them to start earlier in the spring and stay later in the fall.</p><p>\"I think we've turned the corner. We're starting to see the positive recruitment come back in, and we're starting to see people come back. They want to be here,\" he said. </p><p>According to the union that represents fire rangers, however, these retention measures haven't been enough to address the problem.</p><p>\"We are having an enormously difficult time keeping people because the job is extremely demanding and we aren't being recognized in terms of compensation for how hard we work and the risk that we put on ourselves in the same way that structural firefighters are,\" said Freedman, who has nine years of front-line experience.</p><p>It's not just a question of the number of rangers, he said, but a lack of crews means they can fight fewer fires at once, take longer to respond to new fires, and run the risk of letting them grow out of control.</p><p>\"They only have seven crews in Red Lake, when they're supposed to have 15. In Geraldton, they've got six crews, and they're supposed to have 18,\" he said. \"It's bad.\"</p><p>While Ontario's emergency wildfire suppression budget has nearly doubled over the past 10 years, the cost of actually fighting the fires is almost always more - a lot more. The AFFES has blown past its budget every year but one over the past decade. It happens in big fire years as expected, but also in quiet years, when little forest burns.</p><p>Asked about these budget overruns, Ministry of Natural Resources spokesperson Mike Fenn explained that the budget \"ensures the resources are in place to respond immediately at the onset of fire season.\"</p><p>\"Once the total costs for the fire season can be accurately predicted, the Ministry will request the balance of the total funding requirements from the contingency fund,\" he said.</p><p>This is not a good way to plan, Freedman said, because it leaves fire rangers scrambling to find helicopters and planes in the middle of a busy fire season instead of leasing them in advance. The approach is indicative of a service stretched to its limits, one that scrambles to fulfil its duties with fewer staff and aircraft than needed, he added.</p><p>\"We are not anywhere near what they call the 'ideal capacity,' and that's saying nothing about the capacity we'll need in the future,\" said Freedman.</p><p>The number of fires and forest area burned across Canada, which has doubled over the past 60 years, is projected to double again by the end of this century. It stands to reason that the cost of forest fire fighting will also rise, but by how much remains the focus of debate.</p><p>Studies have pegged the rise as low as 45 per cent and as high as 145 per cent.</p><p>Research carried out by the Canadian Forest Service found that in order to adequately contain the bigger fires and prevent them from entering towns and cities, the cost could be far greater. The study found a 15 per cent increase in the number and size of forest fires would require a doubling of resources needed to contain them at the same rate as today.</p><p>So if fire activity doubles as expected, Ontario would need six times more firefighting resources - fire rangers, water bombers, helicopters and support staff - or risk losing control of many more massive runaway fires.</p><p>How to prepare for the next fire disasterIf you want to see a vision of a future wracked by climate change, you need only look across the country to British Columbia.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, Canada's westernmost province has suffered repeated natural disasters: wildfires that have levelled towns, torrential rains that have washed out highways, floods that have turned entire communities into islands and heatwaves that have killed hundreds.</p><p>The provincial government has spent a lot of time reviewing the damage and preparing for the next disaster and the ways it has beefed up its wildfire service are instructive for Ontario.</p><p>Despite having a smaller land mass to cover and having fewer people to protect, B.C. now employs twice as many wildfire fighters as Ontario. It also has three times as many waterbombers and more helicopters.</p><p>In 2022, B.C. announced it would convert the service from seasonal to year-round, pledging more than $200 million in new funding. In the three years since, the number of year-round jobs has risen by 56 per cent, according to figures provided to the Star, and BCWS now employs more than 600 year-round staff - nearly the same number of people as the entire fire ranger force in Ontario.</p><p>\"Historically, wildfires were really seen as just like a summer situation. The core wildfire season would be July and August and that was what we were prepared for,\" said BC Wildfire Service Information Officer Sarah Budd. \"This is a year-round problem. The climate that we're working in is changing, and we need to be ready for a much longer response season.\"</p><p>Not only are the forest fire fighters in B.C. on the ground earlier in the spring and staying later in the fall, but many of them are now involved in risk-reduction activities in the winter, in hopes of improving the next season's response.</p><p>This means doing more prescribed burns that consume fuel on the forest floor that would otherwise feed summer fires. It also means improving access roads to get fire crews into high-risk areas, proactively creating firebreaks with heavy equipment in the winter when the machines won't bog down, and working with nearby communities to develop partnerships with local fire departments and emergency evacuation plans.</p><p>While Ontario's response mirrors some of these initiatives, it falls short of the massive effort underway in B.C. If the predictions of bigger fire seasons are to be believed, and the erosion of the fire rangers' ranks is to be turned around, a fully year-round service is the formula B.C. considers best.</p><p>\"There's been a pretty intense focus on the human resources side of it, making this into a place where people can build a career, so that you can come up through the crews and then continue to contribute that expertise. That way, we're not losing that knowledge when people peel off year after year,\" said Budd.</p><p>This story is Part 1 in The Coming Firestorm, a three-part series on the growing risk of wildfires fuelled by human-induced climate change.</p><p>In Part 2: A Star reporter learns to be an Ontario fire ranger - the province's front line against the next uncontrollable blaze.</p><p>Coming Monday in Part 3: Why computer models are failing to predict \"impossible\" wildfires, and what that means for Southern Ontario. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2025062275889627</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G3J-VS63-RTM6-90D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2834\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

He figured if it came to it, he could put 10 people in the boat and his small 40-horsepower motor would get them across the lake in about 10 minutes. Then he'd come back and do it again and again until everyone was safe.</p><p>\"I had fuel. I had my oars. I even had my fishing rods ready and stuff. It was all set up and ready to go,\" he said.</p><p>Fortunately, a water bomber was on the scene within hours, arriving when the fire was aggressively spreading, going from two to 200 hectares in only an hour and a half, Meekis said. Dropping more than 6,000 litres of water in a single load, the \"super scooper\" was able to cool down the area around the airport enough so that ground crews could beat back the flames and the runway was reopened.</p><p>With more than 40 Ontario fire rangers on the ground deploying hoses and sprinklers, the town's essential infrastructure has been saved. At one point, the fire was raging less than 100 metres from the nursing station; the band office came within 60 metres of going up in smoke.</p><p>The people of Deer Lake are still worried about the fire, which had burned more than 17,000 hectares when Meekis got on that plane in early June and has since exploded to over 183,000 hectares. If it flares back up around town, it could destroy their homes. But after witnessing Ontario's forest fire fighters in action, Meekis was hopeful they have escaped the worst.</p><p>\"They're good people who have been through this before and are very knowledgeable and know how to fight the fire. I'm grateful there's people like that.\"</p><p>But with this new breed of fire, \"we're going to need a lot more of them,\" he said.</p><p>'It's just not a livable job anymore'It's hard to predict how bad a fire season will be because the weather can turn on a dime. But this year in Ontario is shaping up to be a doozy.</p><p>The wildfire that forced the evacuation of Deer Lake - dubbed Red Lake 12 - is alone more than twice as large as all the forest fires that burned last year, provincewide.</p><p>Ontario doesn't have enough wilderness firefighters. I learned what it takes to be one</p><p>And while the town is safe for now, and everyone has been safely evacuated, some people are questioning how the fire got so out of hand so quickly - and whether that would have happened if there were more fire rangers available.</p><p>Ten years ago, there were 732 fire rangers. Now there are 630.</p><p>At a time when the threat of forest fires is greater than it has ever been, our front line of defence is understaffed by more than 100 firefighters.</p><p>And with fewer fire rangers, reaction time to new fires is slower, and more of them are escaping containment. </p><p>\"Would these fires have become as big as they are if we just had the same resources as we've had in the past?\" said Noah Freedman, a crew leader and vice-president of the fire rangers' union, OPSEU Local 703.</p><p>The problem, according to government reports, the union as well as more than a dozen interviews with current and former firefighters, is staff retention. What used to be a career for people across Ontario's North has turned into a summer job for most.</p><p>The Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch (AFFES) \"is losing their experienced staff at an alarming rate,\" states an internal Ministry of Natural Resources report, obtained by the Star.</p><p>The report, published nearly a decade ago, identified a turnover rate of 45 per cent - a rate which has not improved.</p><p>\"Because of this turnover, the organization has been forced to promote employees despite them possessing only minimal practical experience and limited fire line expertise,\" the report states.</p><p>It's not just fire rangers that are short-staffed. At least three of the province's nine waterbombers have been grounded this season due to a lack of pilots, according to OPSEU.  </p><p>\"Just weeks ago, crews in Northwestern Ontario worked tirelessly battling wildfires to save people's homes and property,\" the union said in a statement. \"All the while, an aircraft sat unused, calling into question whether that grounded aircraft and a skilled crew could have made a difference.\"</p><p>In a dangerous job like forest firefighting, a lack of experience can be deadly.</p><p>\"Say you have a guy that has 10 years of experience leading a crew. They can see things and read things that somebody who has become a crew leader after three years just won't notice or won't even think of,\" said Dean Rosen, a former Ontario fire ranger who worked for five seasons out of Pickle Lake, more than 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. \"Lots of those little mistakes can have big consequences when you just don't have the right amount of experience.\"</p><p>Rosen, who wrote his master's thesis in 2021 on turnover in the Ontario FireRanger program, says there are many issues affecting retention, ranging from the remote, isolated work conditions to the physical difficulty and danger of the work itself. The fact that forest firefighters aren't employed year-round means that everyone is effectively laid off every year and has months to think about whether they want to go back.</p><p>But ultimately, it comes down to pay.</p><p>While entry-level pay recently went up to $25.38 an hour, it hasn't kept up with inflation. Today, crew members are only making one-and-a-half times minimum wage. Fifteen years ago, their wages were more than double minimum wage.</p><p>\"It's just not a livable job anymore, really. Unless fire seasons are crazy and you're working your ass off,\" said Rosen. \"Because the money's in the overtime.\"</p><p>In 2021, the last big wildfire season in Ontario, Rosen said fire rangers were able to work 500 hours overtime, adding 50 per cent to their take-home earnings.</p><p>In the quiet seasons since, there hasn't been much action. Not only is this discouraging people from returning, those who do are not building up much on-the-ground experience.</p><p>\"You get somebody who comes into the program and they're all excited and amped up and ready to go, and then they're just kind of sitting all summer. And that really deters them from coming back the next year,\" he said. \"If you're not giving them incentive to stay in the program and to develop their skills and experience and move up the ranks, why would they?\"</p><p>The budget is not enough - even in slow yearsThe bottleneck is a lack of crew leaders. No matter how many rookies are brought in, the province cannot hire additional crew members if there are no crew leaders to supervise them.</p><p>According to a 2024 ministerial briefing document obtained by the Star, the optimal number of fire rangers is 756, organized into 189 four-person crews. But in order to achieve this level of coverage, the province needs 189 crew leaders - and it has been coming up far short.</p><p>This year, there are only 144 crew leaders and, as a result, the FireRangers are limited to fielding that number of crews. Even though one-third of these crews were assigned an extra member - adopting a five-person model that had been discontinued years ago after it was found to be inefficient - the province is still 45 crews and more than 100 fire rangers short.</p><p>With fewer people on the front line, the FireRangers' response time is suffering. Over the past 10 years, the province's preferred performance metric, called \"wildfire containment effectiveness\" or \"initial attack success rate,\" has dropped markedly.</p><p>The percentage of significant fires that were \"being held\" by noon the day after they were reported was nearly 98 per cent in 2014. In 2022, the most recent year for which numbers are available, that had dropped to 92 per cent - well short of the 96 per cent target.</p><p>They say Muskoka won't burn. But climate has changed the calculus</p><p>Getting to a fire quickly is important because only two per cent of fires account for 98 per cent of the forest area burned each year, according to a Ministry of Natural Resources presentation prepared for the Auditor General and obtained by the Star. In other words, 98 per cent of fires are put out when they're small and it's the handful of fires that escape early containment that cause virtually all the damage.</p><p>In Deer Lake, so many resources were focused on saving the town that the fire was never contained and it grew rapidly in the opposite direction. A week later, it had become the second biggest fire on record in Ontario, and had burned 60 km north until it reached the doorstep of next town, Sandy Lake, which also had to be evacuated.</p><p>With more fires and fewer fire rangers to fight them, the pressure on the small number of experienced leaders increases.</p><p>Ten years ago, according to the ministry report on recruitment and retention, more than half the crew leaders had one year of experience or less in the position, and the vast majority of the initial attacks on fires were led by the more experienced crew leaders. At the fire base in Sioux Lookout, for example, only one of the 17 crew leaders had led more than 10 initial attacks, and he had 48 to his name.</p><p>While the AFFES has produced two follow up reports over the last decade, it declined to provide them to the Star. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests did not respond to questions for this story, instead sending a statement that read: \"Ontario remains an internationally recognized leader in wildfire fire management.\"</p><p>Over the last two years, the province has added 100 year-round \"support\" positions, and paid out a one-time \"retention incentive payment\" of up to $5,000 to fire rangers last year, the statement read. There's also been a pay bump, a bonus introduced for days spent camping while fighting fires and as much as $500 in reimbursement for eligible expenses related to training, including the cost of safety boots.</p><p>At the FireRangers base in Haliburton, supervisor Bob Hurley said the real difference maker has been the introduction of nine-month \"tech\" contracts for crew leaders, which allows some of them to start earlier in the spring and stay later in the fall.</p><p>\"I think we've turned the corner.

But this year in Ontario is shaping up to be a doozy.</p><p>The wildfire that forced the evacuation of Deer Lake - dubbed Red Lake 12 - is alone more than twice as large as all the forest fires that burned last year, provincewide.</p><p>And while the town is safe for now, and everyone has been safely evacuated, some people are questioning how the fire got so out of hand so quickly - and whether that would have happened if there were more fire rangers available.</p><p>Ten years ago, there were 732 fire rangers. Now there are 630.</p><p>At a time when the threat of forest fires is greater than it has ever been, our front line of defence is understaffed by more than 100 firefighters.</p><p>And with fewer fire rangers, reaction time to new fires is slower, and more of them are escaping containment. </p><p>\"Would these fires have become as big as they are if we just had the same resources as we've had in the past?\" said Noah Freedman, a crew leader and vice-president of the fire rangers' union, OPSEU Local 703.</p><p>The problem, according to government reports, the union as well as more than a dozen interviews with current and former firefighters, is staff retention. What used to be a career for people across Ontario's North has turned into a summer job for most.</p><p>The Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch (AFFES) \"is losing their experienced staff at an alarming rate,\" states an internal Ministry of Natural Resources report, obtained by the Star.</p><p>The report, published nearly a decade ago, identified a turnover rate of 45 per cent - a rate which has not improved.</p><p>\"Because of this turnover, the organization has been forced to promote employees despite them possessing only minimal practical experience and limited fire line expertise,\" the report states.</p><p>It's not just fire rangers that are short-staffed. At least three of the province's nine waterbombers have been grounded this season due to a lack of pilots, according to OPSEU.  </p><p>\"Just weeks ago, crews in Northwestern Ontario worked tirelessly battling wildfires to save people's homes and property,\" the union said in a statement. \"All the while, an aircraft sat unused, calling into question whether that grounded aircraft and a skilled crew could have made a difference.\"</p><p>In a dangerous job like forest firefighting, a lack of experience can be deadly.</p><p>\"Say you have a guy that has 10 years of experience leading a crew. They can see things and read things that somebody who has become a crew leader after three years just won't notice or won't even think of,\" said Dean Rosen, a former Ontario fire ranger who worked for five seasons out of Pickle Lake, more than 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. \"Lots of those little mistakes can have big consequences when you just don't have the right amount of experience.\"</p><p>Rosen, who wrote his master's thesis in 2021 on turnover in the Ontario FireRanger program, says there are many issues affecting retention, ranging from the remote, isolated work conditions to the physical difficulty and danger of the work itself. The fact that forest firefighters aren't employed year-round means that everyone is effectively laid off every year and has months to think about whether they want to go back.</p><p>But ultimately, it comes down to pay.</p><p>While entry-level pay recently went up to $25.38 an hour, it hasn't kept up with inflation. Today, crew members are only making one-and-a-half times minimum wage. Fifteen years ago, their wages were more than double minimum wage.</p><p>\"It's just not a livable job anymore, really. Unless fire seasons are crazy and you're working your ass off,\" said Rosen. \"Because the money's in the overtime.\"</p><p>In 2021, the last big wildfire season in Ontario, Rosen said fire rangers were able to work 500 hours overtime, adding 50 per cent to their take-home earnings.</p><p>In the quiet seasons since, there hasn't been much action. Not only is this discouraging people from returning, those who do are not building up much on-the-ground experience.</p><p>\"You get somebody who comes into the program and they're all excited and amped up and ready to go, and then they're just kind of sitting all summer. And that really deters them from coming back the next year,\" he said. \"If you're not giving them incentive to stay in the program and to develop their skills and experience and move up the ranks, why would they?\"</p><p>The budget is not enough - even in slow yearsThe bottleneck is a lack of crew leaders. No matter how many rookies are brought in, the province cannot hire additional crew members if there are no crew leaders to supervise them.</p><p>According to a 2024 ministerial briefing document obtained by the Star, the optimal number of fire rangers is 756, organized into 189 four-person crews. But in order to achieve this level of coverage, the province needs 189 crew leaders - and it has been coming up far short.</p><p>This year, there are only 144 crew leaders and, as a result, the FireRangers are limited to fielding that number of crews. Even though one-third of these crews were assigned an extra member - adopting a five-person model that had been discontinued years ago after it was found to be inefficient - the province is still 45 crews and more than 100 fire rangers short.</p><p>With fewer people on the front line, the FireRangers' response time is suffering. Over the past 10 years, the province's preferred performance metric, called \"wildfire containment effectiveness\" or \"initial attack success rate,\" has dropped markedly.</p><p>The percentage of significant fires that were \"being held\" by noon the day after they were reported was nearly 98 per cent in 2014. In 2022, the most recent year for which numbers are available, that had dropped to 92 per cent - well short of the 96 per cent target.</p><p>Getting to a fire quickly is important because only two per cent of fires account for 98 per cent of the forest area burned each year, according to a Ministry of Natural Resources presentation prepared for the Auditor General and obtained by the Star. In other words, 98 per cent of fires are put out when they're small and it's the handful of fires that escape early containment that cause virtually all the damage.</p><p>In Deer Lake, so many resources were focused on saving the town that the fire was never contained and it grew rapidly in the opposite direction. A week later, it had become the second biggest fire on record in Ontario, and had burned 60 km north until it reached the doorstep of next town, Sandy Lake, which also had to be evacuated.</p><p>With more fires and fewer fire rangers to fight them, the pressure on the small number of experienced leaders increases.</p><p>Ten years ago, according to the ministry report on recruitment and retention, more than half the crew leaders had one year of experience or less in the position, and the vast majority of the initial attacks on fires were led by the more experienced crew leaders. At the fire base in Sioux Lookout, for example, only one of the 17 crew leaders had led more than 10 initial attacks, and he had 48 to his name.</p><p>While the AFFES has produced two follow up reports over the last decade, it declined to provide them to the Star. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests did not respond to questions for this story, instead sending a statement that read: \"Ontario remains an internationally recognized leader in wildfire fire management.\"</p><p>Over the last two years, the province has added 100 year-round \"support\" positions, and paid out a one-time \"retention incentive payment\" of up to $5,000 to fire rangers last year, the statement read. There's also been a pay bump, a bonus introduced for days spent camping while fighting fires and as much as $500 in reimbursement for eligible expenses related to training, including the cost of safety boots.</p><p>At the FireRangers base in Haliburton, supervisor Bob Hurley said the real difference maker has been the introduction of nine-month \"tech\" contracts for crew leaders, which allows some of them to start earlier in the spring and stay later in the fall.</p><p>\"I think we've turned the corner. We're starting to see the positive recruitment come back in, and we're starting to see people come back. They want to be here,\" he said. </p><p>According to the union that represents fire rangers, however, these retention measures haven't been enough to address the problem.</p><p>\"We are having an enormously difficult time keeping people because the job is extremely demanding and we aren't being recognized in terms of compensation for how hard we work and the risk that we put on ourselves in the same way that structural firefighters are,\" said Freedman, who has nine years of front-line experience.</p><p>It's not just a question of the number of rangers, he said, but a lack of crews means they can fight fewer fires at once, take longer to respond to new fires, and run the risk of letting them grow out of control.</p><p>\"They only have seven crews in Red Lake, when they're supposed to have 15. In Geraldton, they've got six crews, and they're supposed to have 18,\" he said. \"It's bad.\"</p><p>While Ontario's emergency wildfire suppression budget has nearly doubled over the past 10 years, the cost of actually fighting the fires is almost always more - a lot more. The AFFES has blown past its budget every year but one over the past decade. It happens in big fire years as expected, but also in quiet years, when little forest burns.</p><p>Asked about these budget overruns, Ministry of Natural Resources spokesperson Mike Fenn explained that the budget \"ensures the resources are in place to respond immediately at the onset of fire season.\"</p><p>\"Once the total costs for the fire season can be accurately predicted, the Ministry will request the balance of the total funding requirements from the contingency fund,\" he said.</p><p>This is not a good way to plan, Freedman said, because it leaves fire rangers scrambling to find helicopters and planes in the middle of a busy fire season instead of leasing them in advance. The approach is indicative of a service stretched to its limits, one that scrambles to fulfil its duties with fewer staff and aircraft than needed, he added.</p><p>\"We are not anywhere near what they call the 'ideal capacity,' and that's saying nothing about the capacity we'll need in the future,\" said Freedman.</p><p>The number of fires and forest area burned across Canada, which has doubled over the past 60 years, is projected to double again by the end of this century. It stands to reason that the cost of forest fire fighting will also rise, but by how much remains the focus of debate.</p><p>Studies have pegged the rise as low as 45 per cent and as high as 145 per cent.</p><p>Research carried out by the Canadian Forest Service found that in order to adequately contain the bigger fires and prevent them from entering towns and cities, the cost could be far greater. The study found a 15 per cent increase in the number and size of forest fires would require a doubling of resources needed to contain them at the same rate as today.</p><p>So if fire activity doubles as expected, Ontario would need six times more firefighting resources - fire rangers, water bombers, helicopters and support staff - or risk losing control of many more massive runaway fires.</p><p>How to prepare for the next fire disasterIf you want to see a vision of a future wracked by climate change, you need only look across the country to British Columbia.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, Canada's westernmost province has suffered repeated natural disasters: wildfires that have levelled towns, torrential rains that have washed out highways, floods that have turned entire communities into islands and heatwaves that have killed hundreds.</p><p>The provincial government has spent a lot of time reviewing the damage and preparing for the next disaster and the ways it has beefed up its wildfire service are instructive for Ontario.</p><p>Despite having a smaller land mass to cover and having fewer people to protect, B.C. now employs twice as many wildfire fighters as Ontario. It also has three times as many waterbombers and more helicopters.</p><p>In 2022, B.C. announced it would convert the service from seasonal to year-round, pledging more than $200 million in new funding. In the three years since, the number of year-round jobs has risen by 56 per cent, according to figures provided to the Star, and BCWS now employs more than 600 year-round staff - nearly the same number of people as the entire fire ranger force in Ontario.</p><p>\"Historically, wildfires were really seen as just like a summer situation. The core wildfire season would be July and August and that was what we were prepared for,\" said BC Wildfire Service Information Officer Sarah Budd. \"This is a year-round problem. The climate that we're working in is changing, and we need to be ready for a much longer response season.\"</p><p>Not only are the forest fire fighters in B.C. on the ground earlier in the spring and staying later in the fall, but many of them are now involved in risk-reduction activities in the winter, in hopes of improving the next season's response.</p><p>This means doing more prescribed burns that consume fuel on the forest floor that would otherwise feed summer fires. It also means improving access roads to get fire crews into high-risk areas, proactively creating firebreaks with heavy equipment in the winter when the machines won't bog down, and working with nearby communities to develop partnerships with local fire departments and emergency evacuation plans.</p><p>While Ontario's response mirrors some of these initiatives, it falls short of the massive effort underway in B.C. If the predictions of bigger fire seasons are to be believed, and the erosion of the fire rangers' ranks is to be turned around, a fully year-round service is the formula B.C. considers best.</p><p>\"There's been a pretty intense focus on the human resources side of it, making this into a place where people can build a career, so that you can come up through the crews and then continue to contribute that expertise. That way, we're not losing that knowledge when people peel off year after year,\" said Budd.</p><p>This story is Part 1 in The Coming Firestorm, a three-part series on the growing risk of wildfires fuelled by human-induced climate change.</p><p>In Part 2: A Star reporter learns to be an Ontario fire ranger - the province's front line against the next uncontrollable blaze.</p><p>Coming Monday in Part 3: Why computer models are failing to predict \"impossible\" wildfires, and what that means for Southern Ontario. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025062275889482</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G3J-VS63-RTM6-90K5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2809\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

They can see things and read things that somebody who has become a crew leader after three years just won't notice or won't even think of,\" said Dean Rosen, a former Ontario fire ranger who worked for five seasons out of Pickle Lake, more than 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. \"Lots of those little mistakes can have big consequences when you just don't have the right amount of experience.\"</p><p>Rosen, who wrote his master's thesis in 2021 on turnover in the Ontario FireRanger program, says there are many issues affecting retention, ranging from the remote, isolated work conditions to the physical difficulty and danger of the work itself. The fact that forest firefighters aren't employed year-round means that everyone is effectively laid off every year and has months to think about whether they want to go back.</p><p>But ultimately, it comes down to pay.</p><p>While entry-level pay recently went up to $25.38 an hour, it hasn't kept up with inflation. Today, crew members are only making one-and-a-half times minimum wage. Fifteen years ago, their wages were more than double minimum wage.</p><p>\"It's just not a livable job anymore, really. Unless fire seasons are crazy and you're working your ass off,\" said Rosen. \"Because the money's in the overtime.\"</p><p>In 2021, the last big wildfire season in Ontario, Rosen said fire rangers were able to work 500 hours overtime, adding 50 per cent to their take-home earnings.</p><p>In the quiet seasons since, there hasn't been much action. Not only is this discouraging people from returning, those who do are not building up much on-the-ground experience.</p><p>\"You get somebody who comes into the program and they're all excited and amped up and ready to go, and then they're just kind of sitting all summer. And that really deters them from coming back the next year,\" he said. \"If you're not giving them incentive to stay in the program and to develop their skills and experience and move up the ranks, why would they?\"</p><p>The budget is not enough - even in slow yearsThe bottleneck is a lack of crew leaders. No matter how many rookies are brought in, the province cannot hire additional crew members if there are no crew leaders to supervise them.</p><p>According to a 2024 ministerial briefing document obtained by the Star, the optimal number of fire rangers is 756, organized into 189 four-person crews. But in order to achieve this level of coverage, the province needs 189 crew leaders - and it has been coming up far short.</p><p>This year, there are only 144 crew leaders and, as a result, the FireRangers are limited to fielding that number of crews. Even though one-third of these crews were assigned an extra member - adopting a five-person model that had been discontinued years ago after it was found to be inefficient - the province is still 45 crews and more than 100 fire rangers short.</p><p>With fewer people on the front line, the FireRangers' response time is suffering. Over the past 10 years, the province's preferred performance metric, called \"wildfire containment effectiveness\" or \"initial attack success rate,\" has dropped markedly.</p><p>The percentage of significant fires that were \"being held\" by noon the day after they were reported was nearly 98 per cent in 2014. In 2022, the most recent year for which numbers are available, that had dropped to 92 per cent - well short of the 96 per cent target.</p><p>They say Muskoka won't burn. But climate has changed the calculus</p><p>Getting to a fire quickly is important because only two per cent of fires account for 98 per cent of the forest area burned each year, according to a Ministry of Natural Resources presentation prepared for the Auditor General and obtained by the Star. In other words, 98 per cent of fires are put out when they're small and it's the handful of fires that escape early containment that cause virtually all the damage.</p><p>In Deer Lake, so many resources were focused on saving the town that the fire was never contained and it grew rapidly in the opposite direction. A week later, it had become the second biggest fire on record in Ontario, and had burned 60 km north until it reached the doorstep of next town, Sandy Lake, which also had to be evacuated.</p><p>With more fires and fewer fire rangers to fight them, the pressure on the small number of experienced leaders increases.</p><p>Ten years ago, according to the ministry report on recruitment and retention, more than half the crew leaders had one year of experience or less in the position, and the vast majority of the initial attacks on fires were led by the more experienced crew leaders. At the fire base in Sioux Lookout, for example, only one of the 17 crew leaders had led more than 10 initial attacks, and he had 48 to his name.</p><p>While the AFFES has produced two follow up reports over the last decade, it declined to provide them to the Star. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests did not respond to questions for this story, instead sending a statement that read: \"Ontario remains an internationally recognized leader in wildfire fire management.\"</p><p>Over the last two years, the province has added 100 year-round \"support\" positions, and paid out a one-time \"retention incentive payment\" of up to $5,000 to fire rangers last year, the statement read. There's also been a pay bump, a bonus introduced for days spent camping while fighting fires and as much as $500 in reimbursement for eligible expenses related to training, including the cost of safety boots.</p><p>At the FireRangers base in Haliburton, supervisor Bob Hurley said the real difference maker has been the introduction of nine-month \"tech\" contracts for crew leaders, which allows some of them to start earlier in the spring and stay later in the fall.</p><p>\"I think we've turned the corner. We're starting to see the positive recruitment come back in, and we're starting to see people come back. They want to be here,\" he said. </p><p>According to the union that represents fire rangers, however, these retention measures haven't been enough to address the problem.</p><p>\"We are having an enormously difficult time keeping people because the job is extremely demanding and we aren't being recognized in terms of compensation for how hard we work and the risk that we put on ourselves in the same way that structural firefighters are,\" said Freedman, who has nine years of front-line experience.</p><p>It's not just a question of the number of rangers, he said, but a lack of crews means they can fight fewer fires at once, take longer to respond to new fires, and run the risk of letting them grow out of control.</p><p>\"They only have seven crews in Red Lake, when they're supposed to have 15. In Geraldton, they've got six crews, and they're supposed to have 18,\" he said. \"It's bad.\"</p><p>While Ontario's emergency wildfire suppression budget has nearly doubled over the past 10 years, the cost of actually fighting the fires is almost always more - a lot more. The AFFES has blown past its budget every year but one over the past decade. It happens in big fire years as expected, but also in quiet years, when little forest burns.</p><p>Asked about these budget overruns, Ministry of Natural Resources spokesperson Mike Fenn explained that the budget \"ensures the resources are in place to respond immediately at the onset of fire season.\"</p><p>\"Once the total costs for the fire season can be accurately predicted, the Ministry will request the balance of the total funding requirements from the contingency fund,\" he said.</p><p>This is not a good way to plan, Freedman said, because it leaves fire rangers scrambling to find helicopters and planes in the middle of a busy fire season instead of leasing them in advance. The approach is indicative of a service stretched to its limits, one that scrambles to fulfil its duties with fewer staff and aircraft than needed, he added.</p><p>\"We are not anywhere near what they call the 'ideal capacity,' and that's saying nothing about the capacity we'll need in the future,\" said Freedman.</p><p>The number of fires and forest area burned across Canada, which has doubled over the past 60 years, is projected to double again by the end of this century. It stands to reason that the cost of forest fire fighting will also rise, but by how much remains the focus of debate.</p><p>Studies have pegged the rise as low as 45 per cent and as high as 145 per cent.</p><p>Research carried out by the Canadian Forest Service found that in order to adequately contain the bigger fires and prevent them from entering towns and cities, the cost could be far greater. The study found a 15 per cent increase in the number and size of forest fires would require a doubling of resources needed to contain them at the same rate as today.</p><p>So if fire activity doubles as expected, Ontario would need six times more firefighting resources - fire rangers, water bombers, helicopters and support staff - or risk losing control of many more massive runaway fires.</p><p>How to prepare for the next fire disasterIf you want to see a vision of a future wracked by climate change, you need only look across the country to British Columbia.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, Canada's westernmost province has suffered repeated natural disasters: wildfires that have levelled towns, torrential rains that have washed out highways, floods that have turned entire communities into islands and heatwaves that have killed hundreds.</p><p>The provincial government has spent a lot of time reviewing the damage and preparing for the next disaster and the ways it has beefed up its wildfire service are instructive for Ontario.</p><p>Despite having a smaller land mass to cover and having fewer people to protect, B.C. now employs twice as many wildfire fighters as Ontario. It also has three times as many waterbombers and more helicopters.</p><p>In 2022, B.C. announced it would convert the service from seasonal to year-round, pledging more than $200 million in new funding. In the three years since, the number of year-round jobs has risen by 56 per cent, according to figures provided to the Star, and BCWS now employs more than 600 year-round staff - nearly the same number of people as the entire fire ranger force in Ontario.</p><p>\"Historically, wildfires were really seen as just like a summer situation. The core wildfire season would be July and August and that was what we were prepared for,\" said BC Wildfire Service Information Officer Sarah Budd. \"This is a year-round problem. The climate that we're working in is changing, and we need to be ready for a much longer response season.\"</p><p>Not only are the forest fire fighters in B.C. on the ground earlier in the spring and staying later in the fall, but many of them are now involved in risk-reduction activities in the winter, in hopes of improving the next season's response.</p><p>This means doing more prescribed burns that consume fuel on the forest floor that would otherwise feed summer fires. It also means improving access roads to get fire crews into high-risk areas, proactively creating firebreaks with heavy equipment in the winter when the machines won't bog down, and working with nearby communities to develop partnerships with local fire departments and emergency evacuation plans.</p><p>While Ontario's response mirrors some of these initiatives, it falls short of the massive effort underway in B.C. If the predictions of bigger fire seasons are to be believed, and the erosion of the fire rangers' ranks is to be turned around, a fully year-round service is the formula B.C. considers best.</p><p>\"There's been a pretty intense focus on the human resources side of it, making this into a place where people can build a career, so that you can come up through the crews and then continue to contribute that expertise. That way, we're not losing that knowledge when people peel off year after year,\" said Budd.</p><p>This story is Part 1 in The Coming Firestorm, a three-part series on the growing risk of wildfires fuelled by human-induced climate change.</p><p>In Part 2: A Star reporter learns to be an Ontario fire ranger - the province's front line against the next uncontrollable blaze.</p><p>Coming Monday in Part 3: Why computer models are failing to predict \"impossible\" wildfires, and what that means for Southern Ontario. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2025062275889513</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G3J-VS63-RTM6-90G1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2834\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

He figured if it came to it, he could put 10 people in the boat and his small 40-horsepower motor would get them across the lake in about 10 minutes. Then he'd come back and do it again and again until everyone was safe.</p><p>\"I had fuel. I had my oars. I even had my fishing rods ready and stuff. It was all set up and ready to go,\" he said.</p><p>Fortunately, a water bomber was on the scene within hours, arriving when the fire was aggressively spreading, going from two to 200 hectares in only an hour and a half, Meekis said. Dropping more than 6,000 litres of water in a single load, the \"super scooper\" was able to cool down the area around the airport enough so that ground crews could beat back the flames and the runway was reopened.</p><p>With more than 40 Ontario fire rangers on the ground deploying hoses and sprinklers, the town's essential infrastructure has been saved. At one point, the fire was raging less than 100 metres from the nursing station; the band office came within 60 metres of going up in smoke.</p><p>The people of Deer Lake are still worried about the fire, which had burned more than 17,000 hectares when Meekis got on that plane in early June and has since exploded to over 183,000 hectares. If it flares back up around town, it could destroy their homes. But after witnessing Ontario's forest fire fighters in action, Meekis was hopeful they have escaped the worst.</p><p>\"They're good people who have been through this before and are very knowledgeable and know how to fight the fire. I'm grateful there's people like that.\"</p><p>But with this new breed of fire, \"we're going to need a lot more of them,\" he said.</p><p>'It's just not a livable job anymore'It's hard to predict how bad a fire season will be because the weather can turn on a dime. But this year in Ontario is shaping up to be a doozy.</p><p>The wildfire that forced the evacuation of Deer Lake - dubbed Red Lake 12 - is alone more than twice as large as all the forest fires that burned last year, provincewide.</p><p>Ontario doesn't have enough wilderness firefighters. I learned what it takes to be one</p><p>And while the town is safe for now, and everyone has been safely evacuated, some people are questioning how the fire got so out of hand so quickly - and whether that would have happened if there were more fire rangers available.</p><p>Ten years ago, there were 732 fire rangers. Now there are 630.</p><p>At a time when the threat of forest fires is greater than it has ever been, our front line of defence is understaffed by more than 100 firefighters.</p><p>And with fewer fire rangers, reaction time to new fires is slower, and more of them are escaping containment. </p><p>\"Would these fires have become as big as they are if we just had the same resources as we've had in the past?\" said Noah Freedman, a crew leader and vice-president of the fire rangers' union, OPSEU Local 703.</p><p>The problem, according to government reports, the union as well as more than a dozen interviews with current and former firefighters, is staff retention.

The study found a 15 per cent increase in the number and size of forest fires would require a doubling of resources needed to contain them at the same rate as today.</p><p>So if fire activity doubles as expected, Ontario would need six times more firefighting resources - fire rangers, water bombers, helicopters and support staff - or risk losing control of many more massive runaway fires.</p><p>How to prepare for the next fire disasterIf you want to see a vision of a future wracked by climate change, you need only look across the country to British Columbia.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, Canada's westernmost province has suffered repeated natural disasters: wildfires that have levelled towns, torrential rains that have washed out highways, floods that have turned entire communities into islands and heatwaves that have killed hundreds.</p><p>The provincial government has spent a lot of time reviewing the damage and preparing for the next disaster and the ways it has beefed up its wildfire service are instructive for Ontario.</p><p>Despite having a smaller land mass to cover and having fewer people to protect, B.C. now employs twice as many wildfire fighters as Ontario. It also has three times as many waterbombers and more helicopters.</p><p>In 2022, B.C. announced it would convert the service from seasonal to year-round, pledging more than $200 million in new funding. In the three years since, the number of year-round jobs has risen by 56 per cent, according to figures provided to the Star, and BCWS now employs more than 600 year-round staff - nearly the same number of people as the entire fire ranger force in Ontario.</p><p>\"Historically, wildfires were really seen as just like a summer situation. The core wildfire season would be July and August and that was what we were prepared for,\" said BC Wildfire Service Information Officer Sarah Budd. \"This is a year-round problem. The climate that we're working in is changing, and we need to be ready for a much longer response season.\"</p><p>Not only are the forest fire fighters in B.C. on the ground earlier in the spring and staying later in the fall, but many of them are now involved in risk-reduction activities in the winter, in hopes of improving the next season's response.</p><p>This means doing more prescribed burns that consume fuel on the forest floor that would otherwise feed summer fires. It also means improving access roads to get fire crews into high-risk areas, proactively creating firebreaks with heavy equipment in the winter when the machines won't bog down, and working with nearby communities to develop partnerships with local fire departments and emergency evacuation plans.</p><p>While Ontario's response mirrors some of these initiatives, it falls short of the massive effort underway in B.C. If the predictions of bigger fire seasons are to be believed, and the erosion of the fire rangers' ranks is to be turned around, a fully year-round service is the formula B.C. considers best.</p><p>\"There's been a pretty intense focus on the human resources side of it, making this into a place where people can build a career, so that you can come up through the crews and then continue to contribute that expertise.

He figured if it came to it, he could put 10 people in the boat and his small 40-horsepower motor would get them across the lake in about 10 minutes. Then he'd come back and do it again and again until everyone was safe.</p><p>\"I had fuel. I had my oars. I even had my fishing rods ready and stuff. It was all set up and ready to go,\" he said.</p><p>Fortunately, a water bomber was on the scene within hours, arriving when the fire was aggressively spreading, going from two to 200 hectares in only an hour and a half, Meekis said. Dropping more than 6,000 litres of water in a single load, the \"super scooper\" was able to cool down the area around the airport enough so that ground crews could beat back the flames and the runway was reopened.</p><p>With more than 40 Ontario fire rangers on the ground deploying hoses and sprinklers, the town's essential infrastructure has been saved. At one point, the fire was raging less than 100 metres from the nursing station; the band office came within 60 metres of going up in smoke.</p><p>The people of Deer Lake are still worried about the fire, which had burned more than 17,000 hectares when Meekis got on that plane in early June and has since exploded to over 183,000 hectares. If it flares back up around town, it could destroy their homes. But after witnessing Ontario's forest fire fighters in action, Meekis was hopeful they have escaped the worst.</p><p>\"They're good people who have been through this before and are very knowledgeable and know how to fight the fire. I'm grateful there's people like that.\"</p><p>But with this new breed of fire, \"we're going to need a lot more of them,\" he said.</p><p>'It's just not a livable job anymore'It's hard to predict how bad a fire season will be because the weather can turn on a dime. But this year in Ontario is shaping up to be a doozy.</p><p>The wildfire that forced the evacuation of Deer Lake - dubbed Red Lake 12 - is alone more than twice as large as all the forest fires that burned last year, provincewide.</p><p>And while the town is safe for now, and everyone has been safely evacuated, some people are questioning how the fire got so out of hand so quickly - and whether that would have happened if there were more fire rangers available.</p><p>Ten years ago, there were 732 fire rangers. Now there are 630.</p><p>At a time when the threat of forest fires is greater than it has ever been, our front line of defence is understaffed by more than 100 firefighters.</p><p>And with fewer fire rangers, reaction time to new fires is slower, and more of them are escaping containment. </p><p>\"Would these fires have become as big as they are if we just had the same resources as we've had in the past?\" said Noah Freedman, a crew leader and vice-president of the fire rangers' union, OPSEU Local 703.</p><p>The problem, according to government reports, the union as well as more than a dozen interviews with current and former firefighters, is staff retention. What used to be a career for people across Ontario's North has turned into a summer job for most.</p><p>The Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch (AFFES) \"is losing their experienced staff at an alarming rate,\" states an internal Ministry of Natural Resources report, obtained by the Star.</p><p>The report, published nearly a decade ago, identified a turnover rate of 45 per cent - a rate which has not improved.</p><p>\"Because of this turnover, the organization has been forced to promote employees despite them possessing only minimal practical experience and limited fire line expertise,\" the report states.</p><p>It's not just fire rangers that are short-staffed. At least three of the province's nine waterbombers have been grounded this season due to a lack of pilots, according to OPSEU.  </p><p>\"Just weeks ago, crews in Northwestern Ontario worked tirelessly battling wildfires to save people's homes and property,\" the union said in a statement. \"All the while, an aircraft sat unused, calling into question whether that grounded aircraft and a skilled crew could have made a difference.\"</p><p>In a dangerous job like forest firefighting, a lack of experience can be deadly.</p><p>\"Say you have a guy that has 10 years of experience leading a crew. They can see things and read things that somebody who has become a crew leader after three years just won't notice or won't even think of,\" said Dean Rosen, a former Ontario fire ranger who worked for five seasons out of Pickle Lake, more than 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. \"Lots of those little mistakes can have big consequences when you just don't have the right amount of experience.\"</p><p>Rosen, who wrote his master's thesis in 2021 on turnover in the Ontario FireRanger program, says there are many issues affecting retention, ranging from the remote, isolated work conditions to the physical difficulty and danger of the work itself. The fact that forest firefighters aren't employed year-round means that everyone is effectively laid off every year and has months to think about whether they want to go back.</p><p>But ultimately, it comes down to pay.</p><p>While entry-level pay recently went up to $25.38 an hour, it hasn't kept up with inflation. Today, crew members are only making one-and-a-half times minimum wage. Fifteen years ago, their wages were more than double minimum wage.</p><p>\"It's just not a livable job anymore, really. Unless fire seasons are crazy and you're working your ass off,\" said Rosen. \"Because the money's in the overtime.\"</p><p>In 2021, the last big wildfire season in Ontario, Rosen said fire rangers were able to work 500 hours overtime, adding 50 per cent to their take-home earnings.</p><p>In the quiet seasons since, there hasn't been much action. Not only is this discouraging people from returning, those who do are not building up much on-the-ground experience.</p><p>\"You get somebody who comes into the program and they're all excited and amped up and ready to go, and then they're just kind of sitting all summer. And that really deters them from coming back the next year,\" he said. \"If you're not giving them incentive to stay in the program and to develop their skills and experience and move up the ranks, why would they?\"</p><p>The budget is not enough - even in slow yearsThe bottleneck is a lack of crew leaders. No matter how many rookies are brought in, the province cannot hire additional crew members if there are no crew leaders to supervise them.</p><p>According to a 2024 ministerial briefing document obtained by the Star, the optimal number of fire rangers is 756, organized into 189 four-person crews. But in order to achieve this level of coverage, the province needs 189 crew leaders - and it has been coming up far short.</p><p>This year, there are only 144 crew leaders and, as a result, the FireRangers are limited to fielding that number of crews. Even though one-third of these crews were assigned an extra member - adopting a five-person model that had been discontinued years ago after it was found to be inefficient - the province is still 45 crews and more than 100 fire rangers short.</p><p>With fewer people on the front line, the FireRangers' response time is suffering. Over the past 10 years, the province's preferred performance metric, called \"wildfire containment effectiveness\" or \"initial attack success rate,\" has dropped markedly.</p><p>The percentage of significant fires that were \"being held\" by noon the day after they were reported was nearly 98 per cent in 2014. In 2022, the most recent year for which numbers are available, that had dropped to 92 per cent - well short of the 96 per cent target.</p><p>Getting to a fire quickly is important because only two per cent of fires account for 98 per cent of the forest area burned each year, according to a Ministry of Natural Resources presentation prepared for the Auditor General and obtained by the Star. In other words, 98 per cent of fires are put out when they're small and it's the handful of fires that escape early containment that cause virtually all the damage.</p><p>In Deer Lake, so many resources were focused on saving the town that the fire was never contained and it grew rapidly in the opposite direction. A week later, it had become the second biggest fire on record in Ontario, and had burned 60 km north until it reached the doorstep of next town, Sandy Lake, which also had to be evacuated.</p><p>With more fires and fewer fire rangers to fight them, the pressure on the small number of experienced leaders increases.</p><p>Ten years ago, according to the ministry report on recruitment and retention, more than half the crew leaders had one year of experience or less in the position, and the vast majority of the initial attacks on fires were led by the more experienced crew leaders. At the fire base in Sioux Lookout, for example, only one of the 17 crew leaders had led more than 10 initial attacks, and he had 48 to his name.</p><p>While the AFFES has produced two follow up reports over the last decade, it declined to provide them to the Star. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests did not respond to questions for this story, instead sending a statement that read: \"Ontario remains an internationally recognized leader in wildfire fire management.\"</p><p>Over the last two years, the province has added 100 year-round \"support\" positions, and paid out a one-time \"retention incentive payment\" of up to $5,000 to fire rangers last year, the statement read. There's also been a pay bump, a bonus introduced for days spent camping while fighting fires and as much as $500 in reimbursement for eligible expenses related to training, including the cost of safety boots.</p><p>At the FireRangers base in Haliburton, supervisor Bob Hurley said the real difference maker has been the introduction of nine-month \"tech\" contracts for crew leaders, which allows some of them to start earlier in the spring and stay later in the fall.</p><p>\"I think we've turned the corner. We're starting to see the positive recruitment come back in, and we're starting to see people come back. They want to be here,\" he said. </p><p>According to the union that represents fire rangers, however, these retention measures haven't been enough to address the problem.</p><p>\"We are having an enormously difficult time keeping people because the job is extremely demanding and we aren't being recognized in terms of compensation for how hard we work and the risk that we put on ourselves in the same way that structural firefighters are,\" said Freedman, who has nine years of front-line experience.</p><p>It's not just a question of the number of rangers, he said, but a lack of crews means they can fight fewer fires at once, take longer to respond to new fires, and run the risk of letting them grow out of control.</p><p>\"They only have seven crews in Red Lake, when they're supposed to have 15. In Geraldton, they've got six crews, and they're supposed to have 18,\" he said. \"It's bad.\"</p><p>While Ontario's emergency wildfire suppression budget has nearly doubled over the past 10 years, the cost of actually fighting the fires is almost always more - a lot more. The AFFES has blown past its budget every year but one over the past decade. It happens in big fire years as expected, but also in quiet years, when little forest burns.</p><p>Asked about these budget overruns, Ministry of Natural Resources spokesperson Mike Fenn explained that the budget \"ensures the resources are in place to respond immediately at the onset of fire season.\"</p><p>\"Once the total costs for the fire season can be accurately predicted, the Ministry will request the balance of the total funding requirements from the contingency fund,\" he said.</p><p>This is not a good way to plan, Freedman said, because it leaves fire rangers scrambling to find helicopters and planes in the middle of a busy fire season instead of leasing them in advance. The approach is indicative of a service stretched to its limits, one that scrambles to fulfil its duties with fewer staff and aircraft than needed, he added.</p><p>\"We are not anywhere near what they call the 'ideal capacity,' and that's saying nothing about the capacity we'll need in the future,\" said Freedman.</p><p>The number of fires and forest area burned across Canada, which has doubled over the past 60 years, is projected to double again by the end of this century.

At one point, the fire was raging less than 100 metres from the nursing station; the band office came within 60 metres of going up in smoke.</p><p>The people of Deer Lake are still worried about the fire, which had burned more than 17,000 hectares when Meekis got on that plane in early June and has since exploded to over 183,000 hectares. If it flares back up around town, it could destroy their homes. But after witnessing Ontario's forest fire fighters in action, Meekis was hopeful they have escaped the worst.</p><p>\"They're good people who have been through this before and are very knowledgeable and know how to fight the fire.

What used to be a career for people across Ontario's North has turned into a summer job for most.</p><p>The Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch (AFFES) \"is losing their experienced staff at an alarming rate,\" states an internal Ministry of Natural Resources report, obtained by the Star.</p><p>The report, published nearly a decade ago, identified a turnover rate of 45 per cent - a rate which has not improved.</p><p>\"Because of this turnover, the organization has been forced to promote employees despite them possessing only minimal practical experience and limited fire line expertise,\" the report states.</p><p>It's not just fire rangers that are short-staffed. At least three of the province's nine waterbombers have been grounded this season due to a lack of pilots, according to OPSEU.  </p><p>\"Just weeks ago, crews in Northwestern Ontario worked tirelessly battling wildfires to save people's homes and property,\" the union said in a statement. \"All the while, an aircraft sat unused, calling into question whether that grounded aircraft and a skilled crew could have made a difference.\"</p><p>In a dangerous job like forest firefighting, a lack of experience can be deadly.</p><p>\"Say you have a guy that has 10 years of experience leading a crew. They can see things and read things that somebody who has become a crew leader after three years just won't notice or won't even think of,\" said Dean Rosen, a former Ontario fire ranger who worked for five seasons out of Pickle Lake, more than 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. \"Lots of those little mistakes can have big consequences when you just don't have the right amount of experience.\"</p><p>Rosen, who wrote his master's thesis in 2021 on turnover in the Ontario FireRanger program, says there are many issues affecting retention, ranging from the remote, isolated work conditions to the physical difficulty and danger of the work itself. The fact that forest firefighters aren't employed year-round means that everyone is effectively laid off every year and has months to think about whether they want to go back.</p><p>But ultimately, it comes down to pay.</p><p>While entry-level pay recently went up to $25.38 an hour, it hasn't kept up with inflation. Today, crew members are only making one-and-a-half times minimum wage. Fifteen years ago, their wages were more than double minimum wage.</p><p>\"It's just not a livable job anymore, really. Unless fire seasons are crazy and you're working your ass off,\" said Rosen. \"Because the money's in the overtime.\"</p><p>In 2021, the last big wildfire season in Ontario, Rosen said fire rangers were able to work 500 hours overtime, adding 50 per cent to their take-home earnings.</p><p>In the quiet seasons since, there hasn't been much action. Not only is this discouraging people from returning, those who do are not building up much on-the-ground experience.</p><p>\"You get somebody who comes into the program and they're all excited and amped up and ready to go, and then they're just kind of sitting all summer. And that really deters them from coming back the next year,\" he said. \"If you're not giving them incentive to stay in the program and to develop their skills and experience and move up the ranks, why would they?\"</p><p>The budget is not enough - even in slow yearsThe bottleneck is a lack of crew leaders. No matter how many rookies are brought in, the province cannot hire additional crew members if there are no crew leaders to supervise them.</p><p>According to a 2024 ministerial briefing document obtained by the Star, the optimal number of fire rangers is 756, organized into 189 four-person crews. But in order to achieve this level of coverage, the province needs 189 crew leaders - and it has been coming up far short.</p><p>This year, there are only 144 crew leaders and, as a result, the FireRangers are limited to fielding that number of crews. Even though one-third of these crews were assigned an extra member - adopting a five-person model that had been discontinued years ago after it was found to be inefficient - the province is still 45 crews and more than 100 fire rangers short.</p><p>With fewer people on the front line, the FireRangers' response time is suffering. Over the past 10 years, the province's preferred performance metric, called \"wildfire containment effectiveness\" or \"initial attack success rate,\" has dropped markedly.</p><p>The percentage of significant fires that were \"being held\" by noon the day after they were reported was nearly 98 per cent in 2014. In 2022, the most recent year for which numbers are available, that had dropped to 92 per cent - well short of the 96 per cent target.</p><p>They say Muskoka won't burn. But climate has changed the calculus</p><p>Getting to a fire quickly is important because only two per cent of fires account for 98 per cent of the forest area burned each year, according to a Ministry of Natural Resources presentation prepared for the Auditor General and obtained by the Star. In other words, 98 per cent of fires are put out when they're small and it's the handful of fires that escape early containment that cause virtually all the damage.</p><p>In Deer Lake, so many resources were focused on saving the town that the fire was never contained and it grew rapidly in the opposite direction. A week later, it had become the second biggest fire on record in Ontario, and had burned 60 km north until it reached the doorstep of next town, Sandy Lake, which also had to be evacuated.</p><p>With more fires and fewer fire rangers to fight them, the pressure on the small number of experienced leaders increases.</p><p>Ten years ago, according to the ministry report on recruitment and retention, more than half the crew leaders had one year of experience or less in the position, and the vast majority of the initial attacks on fires were led by the more experienced crew leaders. At the fire base in Sioux Lookout, for example, only one of the 17 crew leaders had led more than 10 initial attacks, and he had 48 to his name.</p><p>While the AFFES has produced two follow up reports over the last decade, it declined to provide them to the Star. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests did not respond to questions for this story, instead sending a statement that read: \"Ontario remains an internationally recognized leader in wildfire fire management.\"</p><p>Over the last two years, the province has added 100 year-round \"support\" positions, and paid out a one-time \"retention incentive payment\" of up to $5,000 to fire rangers last year, the statement read. There's also been a pay bump, a bonus introduced for days spent camping while fighting fires and as much as $500 in reimbursement for eligible expenses related to training, including the cost of safety boots.</p><p>At the FireRangers base in Haliburton, supervisor Bob Hurley said the real difference maker has been the introduction of nine-month \"tech\" contracts for crew leaders, which allows some of them to start earlier in the spring and stay later in the fall.</p><p>\"I think we've turned the corner. We're starting to see the positive recruitment come back in, and we're starting to see people come back. They want to be here,\" he said. </p><p>According to the union that represents fire rangers, however, these retention measures haven't been enough to address the problem.</p><p>\"We are having an enormously difficult time keeping people because the job is extremely demanding and we aren't being recognized in terms of compensation for how hard we work and the risk that we put on ourselves in the same way that structural firefighters are,\" said Freedman, who has nine years of front-line experience.</p><p>It's not just a question of the number of rangers, he said, but a lack of crews means they can fight fewer fires at once, take longer to respond to new fires, and run the risk of letting them grow out of control.</p><p>\"They only have seven crews in Red Lake, when they're supposed to have 15. In Geraldton, they've got six crews, and they're supposed to have 18,\" he said. \"It's bad.\"</p><p>While Ontario's emergency wildfire suppression budget has nearly doubled over the past 10 years, the cost of actually fighting the fires is almost always more - a lot more. The AFFES has blown past its budget every year but one over the past decade. It happens in big fire years as expected, but also in quiet years, when little forest burns.</p><p>Asked about these budget overruns, Ministry of Natural Resources spokesperson Mike Fenn explained that the budget \"ensures the resources are in place to respond immediately at the onset of fire season.\"</p><p>\"Once the total costs for the fire season can be accurately predicted, the Ministry will request the balance of the total funding requirements from the contingency fund,\" he said.</p><p>This is not a good way to plan, Freedman said, because it leaves fire rangers scrambling to find helicopters and planes in the middle of a busy fire season instead of leasing them in advance. The approach is indicative of a service stretched to its limits, one that scrambles to fulfil its duties with fewer staff and aircraft than needed, he added.</p><p>\"We are not anywhere near what they call the 'ideal capacity,' and that's saying nothing about the capacity we'll need in the future,\" said Freedman.</p><p>The number of fires and forest area burned across Canada, which has doubled over the past 60 years, is projected to double again by the end of this century. It stands to reason that the cost of forest fire fighting will also rise, but by how much remains the focus of debate.</p><p>Studies have pegged the rise as low as 45 per cent and as high as 145 per cent.</p><p>Research carried out by the Canadian Forest Service found that in order to adequately contain the bigger fires and prevent them from entering towns and cities, the cost could be far greater. The study found a 15 per cent increase in the number and size of forest fires would require a doubling of resources needed to contain them at the same rate as today.</p><p>So if fire activity doubles as expected, Ontario would need six times more firefighting resources - fire rangers, water bombers, helicopters and support staff - or risk losing control of many more massive runaway fires.</p><p>How to prepare for the next fire disasterIf you want to see a vision of a future wracked by climate change, you need only look across the country to British Columbia.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, Canada's westernmost province has suffered repeated natural disasters: wildfires that have levelled towns, torrential rains that have washed out highways, floods that have turned entire communities into islands and heatwaves that have killed hundreds.</p><p>The provincial government has spent a lot of time reviewing the damage and preparing for the next disaster and the ways it has beefed up its wildfire service are instructive for Ontario.</p><p>Despite having a smaller land mass to cover and having fewer people to protect, B.C. now employs twice as many wildfire fighters as Ontario. It also has three times as many waterbombers and more helicopters.</p><p>In 2022, B.C. announced it would convert the service from seasonal to year-round, pledging more than $200 million in new funding. In the three years since, the number of year-round jobs has risen by 56 per cent, according to figures provided to the Star, and BCWS now employs more than 600 year-round staff - nearly the same number of people as the entire fire ranger force in Ontario.</p><p>\"Historically, wildfires were really seen as just like a summer situation. The core wildfire season would be July and August and that was what we were prepared for,\" said BC Wildfire Service Information Officer Sarah Budd. \"This is a year-round problem. The climate that we're working in is changing, and we need to be ready for a much longer response season.\"</p><p>Not only are the forest fire fighters in B.C. on the ground earlier in the spring and staying later in the fall, but many of them are now involved in risk-reduction activities in the winter, in hopes of improving the next season's response.</p><p>This means doing more prescribed burns that consume fuel on the forest floor that would otherwise feed summer fires. It also means improving access roads to get fire crews into high-risk areas, proactively creating firebreaks with heavy equipment in the winter when the machines won't bog down, and working with nearby communities to develop partnerships with local fire departments and emergency evacuation plans.</p><p>While Ontario's response mirrors some of these initiatives, it falls short of the massive effort underway in B.C. If the predictions of bigger fire seasons are to be believed, and the erosion of the fire rangers' ranks is to be turned around, a fully year-round service is the formula B.C. considers best.</p><p>\"There's been a pretty intense focus on the human resources side of it, making this into a place where people can build a career, so that you can come up through the crews and then continue to contribute that expertise. That way, we're not losing that knowledge when people peel off year after year,\" said Budd.</p><p>This story is Part 1 in The Coming Firestorm, a three-part series on the growing risk of wildfires fuelled by human-induced climate change.</p><p>In Part 2: A Star reporter learns to be an Ontario fire ranger - the province's front line against the next uncontrollable blaze.</p><p>Coming Monday in Part 3: Why computer models are failing to predict \"impossible\" wildfires, and what that means for Southern Ontario. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2025062275889491</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G3J-VS63-RTM6-90CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2834\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

In Geraldton, they've got six crews, and they're supposed to have 18,\" he said. \"It's bad.\"</p><p>While Ontario's emergency wildfire suppression budget has nearly doubled over the past 10 years, the cost of actually fighting the fires is almost always more - a lot more. The AFFES has blown past its budget every year but one over the past decade.

It stands to reason that the cost of forest fire fighting will also rise, but by how much remains the focus of debate.</p><p>Studies have pegged the rise as low as 45 per cent and as high as 145 per cent.</p><p>Research carried out by the Canadian Forest Service found that in order to adequately contain the bigger fires and prevent them from entering towns and cities, the cost could be far greater. The study found a 15 per cent increase in the number and size of forest fires would require a doubling of resources needed to contain them at the same rate as today.</p><p>So if fire activity doubles as expected, Ontario would need six times more firefighting resources - fire rangers, water bombers, helicopters and support staff - or risk losing control of many more massive runaway fires.</p><p>How to prepare for the next fire disasterIf you want to see a vision of a future wracked by climate change, you need only look across the country to British Columbia.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, Canada's westernmost province has suffered repeated natural disasters: wildfires that have levelled towns, torrential rains that have washed out highways, floods that have turned entire communities into islands and heatwaves that have killed hundreds.</p><p>The provincial government has spent a lot of time reviewing the damage and preparing for the next disaster and the ways it has beefed up its wildfire service are instructive for Ontario.</p><p>Despite having a smaller land mass to cover and having fewer people to protect, B.C. now employs twice as many wildfire fighters as Ontario. It also has three times as many waterbombers and more helicopters.</p><p>In 2022, B.C. announced it would convert the service from seasonal to year-round, pledging more than $200 million in new funding. In the three years since, the number of year-round jobs has risen by 56 per cent, according to figures provided to the Star, and BCWS now employs more than 600 year-round staff - nearly the same number of people as the entire fire ranger force in Ontario.</p><p>\"Historically, wildfires were really seen as just like a summer situation. The core wildfire season would be July and August and that was what we were prepared for,\" said BC Wildfire Service Information Officer Sarah Budd. \"This is a year-round problem. The climate that we're working in is changing, and we need to be ready for a much longer response season.\"</p><p>Not only are the forest fire fighters in B.C. on the ground earlier in the spring and staying later in the fall, but many of them are now involved in risk-reduction activities in the winter, in hopes of improving the next season's response.</p><p>This means doing more prescribed burns that consume fuel on the forest floor that would otherwise feed summer fires. It also means improving access roads to get fire crews into high-risk areas, proactively creating firebreaks with heavy equipment in the winter when the machines won't bog down, and working with nearby communities to develop partnerships with local fire departments and emergency evacuation plans.</p><p>While Ontario's response mirrors some of these initiatives, it falls short of the massive effort underway in B.C.

He figured if it came to it, he could put 10 people in the boat and his small 40-horsepower motor would get them across the lake in about 10 minutes. Then he'd come back and do it again and again until everyone was safe.</p><p>\"I had fuel. I had my oars. I even had my fishing rods ready and stuff. It was all set up and ready to go,\" he said.</p><p>Fortunately, a water bomber was on the scene within hours, arriving when the fire was aggressively spreading, going from two to 200 hectares in only an hour and a half, Meekis said. Dropping more than 6,000 litres of water in a single load, the \"super scooper\" was able to cool down the area around the airport enough so that ground crews could beat back the flames and the runway was reopened.</p><p>With more than 40 Ontario fire rangers on the ground deploying hoses and sprinklers, the town's essential infrastructure has been saved. At one point, the fire was raging less than 100 metres from the nursing station; the band office came within 60 metres of going up in smoke.</p><p>The people of Deer Lake are still worried about the fire, which had burned more than 17,000 hectares when Meekis got on that plane in early June and has since exploded to over 183,000 hectares. If it flares back up around town, it could destroy their homes. But after witnessing Ontario's forest fire fighters in action, Meekis was hopeful they have escaped the worst.</p><p>\"They're good people who have been through this before and are very knowledgeable and know how to fight the fire. I'm grateful there's people like that.\"</p><p>But with this new breed of fire, \"we're going to need a lot more of them,\" he said.</p><p>'It's just not a livable job anymore'It's hard to predict how bad a fire season will be because the weather can turn on a dime. But this year in Ontario is shaping up to be a doozy.</p><p>The wildfire that forced the evacuation of Deer Lake - dubbed Red Lake 12 - is alone more than twice as large as all the forest fires that burned last year, provincewide.</p><p>Ontario doesn't have enough wilderness firefighters. I learned what it takes to be one</p><p>And while the town is safe for now, and everyone has been safely evacuated, some people are questioning how the fire got so out of hand so quickly - and whether that would have happened if there were more fire rangers available.</p><p>Ten years ago, there were 732 fire rangers. Now there are 630.</p><p>At a time when the threat of forest fires is greater than it has ever been, our front line of defence is understaffed by more than 100 firefighters.</p><p>And with fewer fire rangers, reaction time to new fires is slower, and more of them are escaping containment. </p><p>\"Would these fires have become as big as they are if we just had the same resources as we've had in the past?\" said Noah Freedman, a crew leader and vice-president of the fire rangers' union, OPSEU Local 703.</p><p>The problem, according to government reports, the union as well as more than a dozen interviews with current and former firefighters, is staff retention. What used to be a career for people across Ontario's North has turned into a summer job for most.</p><p>The Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch (AFFES) \"is losing their experienced staff at an alarming rate,\" states an internal Ministry of Natural Resources report, obtained by the Star.</p><p>The report, published nearly a decade ago, identified a turnover rate of 45 per cent - a rate which has not improved.</p><p>\"Because of this turnover, the organization has been forced to promote employees despite them possessing only minimal practical experience and limited fire line expertise,\" the report states.</p><p>It's not just fire rangers that are short-staffed. At least three of the province's nine waterbombers have been grounded this season due to a lack of pilots, according to OPSEU.  </p><p>\"Just weeks ago, crews in Northwestern Ontario worked tirelessly battling wildfires to save people's homes and property,\" the union said in a statement. \"All the while, an aircraft sat unused, calling into question whether that grounded aircraft and a skilled crew could have made a difference.\"</p><p>In a dangerous job like forest firefighting, a lack of experience can be deadly.</p><p>\"Say you have a guy that has 10 years of experience leading a crew. They can see things and read things that somebody who has become a crew leader after three years just won't notice or won't even think of,\" said Dean Rosen, a former Ontario fire ranger who worked for five seasons out of Pickle Lake, more than 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. \"Lots of those little mistakes can have big consequences when you just don't have the right amount of experience.\"</p><p>Rosen, who wrote his master's thesis in 2021 on turnover in the Ontario FireRanger program, says there are many issues affecting retention, ranging from the remote, isolated work conditions to the physical difficulty and danger of the work itself. The fact that forest firefighters aren't employed year-round means that everyone is effectively laid off every year and has months to think about whether they want to go back.</p><p>But ultimately, it comes down to pay.</p><p>While entry-level pay recently went up to $25.38 an hour, it hasn't kept up with inflation. Today, crew members are only making one-and-a-half times minimum wage. Fifteen years ago, their wages were more than double minimum wage.</p><p>\"It's just not a livable job anymore, really. Unless fire seasons are crazy and you're working your ass off,\" said Rosen. \"Because the money's in the overtime.\"</p><p>In 2021, the last big wildfire season in Ontario, Rosen said fire rangers were able to work 500 hours overtime, adding 50 per cent to their take-home earnings.</p><p>In the quiet seasons since, there hasn't been much action. Not only is this discouraging people from returning, those who do are not building up much on-the-ground experience.</p><p>\"You get somebody who comes into the program and they're all excited and amped up and ready to go, and then they're just kind of sitting all summer. And that really deters them from coming back the next year,\" he said. \"If you're not giving them incentive to stay in the program and to develop their skills and experience and move up the ranks, why would they?\"</p><p>The budget is not enough - even in slow yearsThe bottleneck is a lack of crew leaders. No matter how many rookies are brought in, the province cannot hire additional crew members if there are no crew leaders to supervise them.</p><p>According to a 2024 ministerial briefing document obtained by the Star, the optimal number of fire rangers is 756, organized into 189 four-person crews. But in order to achieve this level of coverage, the province needs 189 crew leaders - and it has been coming up far short.</p><p>This year, there are only 144 crew leaders and, as a result, the FireRangers are limited to fielding that number of crews. Even though one-third of these crews were assigned an extra member - adopting a five-person model that had been discontinued years ago after it was found to be inefficient - the province is still 45 crews and more than 100 fire rangers short.</p><p>With fewer people on the front line, the FireRangers' response time is suffering. Over the past 10 years, the province's preferred performance metric, called \"wildfire containment effectiveness\" or \"initial attack success rate,\" has dropped markedly.</p><p>The percentage of significant fires that were \"being held\" by noon the day after they were reported was nearly 98 per cent in 2014. In 2022, the most recent year for which numbers are available, that had dropped to 92 per cent - well short of the 96 per cent target.</p><p>They say Muskoka won't burn. But climate has changed the calculus</p><p>Getting to a fire quickly is important because only two per cent of fires account for 98 per cent of the forest area burned each year, according to a Ministry of Natural Resources presentation prepared for the Auditor General and obtained by the Star. In other words, 98 per cent of fires are put out when they're small and it's the handful of fires that escape early containment that cause virtually all the damage.</p><p>In Deer Lake, so many resources were focused on saving the town that the fire was never contained and it grew rapidly in the opposite direction. A week later, it had become the second biggest fire on record in Ontario, and had burned 60 km north until it reached the doorstep of next town, Sandy Lake, which also had to be evacuated.</p><p>With more fires and fewer fire rangers to fight them, the pressure on the small number of experienced leaders increases.</p><p>Ten years ago, according to the ministry report on recruitment and retention, more than half the crew leaders had one year of experience or less in the position, and the vast majority of the initial attacks on fires were led by the more experienced crew leaders. At the fire base in Sioux Lookout, for example, only one of the 17 crew leaders had led more than 10 initial attacks, and he had 48 to his name.</p><p>While the AFFES has produced two follow up reports over the last decade, it declined to provide them to the Star. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests did not respond to questions for this story, instead sending a statement that read: \"Ontario remains an internationally recognized leader in wildfire fire management.\"</p><p>Over the last two years, the province has added 100 year-round \"support\" positions, and paid out a one-time \"retention incentive payment\" of up to $5,000 to fire rangers last year, the statement read. There's also been a pay bump, a bonus introduced for days spent camping while fighting fires and as much as $500 in reimbursement for eligible expenses related to training, including the cost of safety boots.</p><p>At the FireRangers base in Haliburton, supervisor Bob Hurley said the real difference maker has been the introduction of nine-month \"tech\" contracts for crew leaders, which allows some of them to start earlier in the spring and stay later in the fall.</p><p>\"I think we've turned the corner. We're starting to see the positive recruitment come back in, and we're starting to see people come back. They want to be here,\" he said. </p><p>According to the union that represents fire rangers, however, these retention measures haven't been enough to address the problem.</p><p>\"We are having an enormously difficult time keeping people because the job is extremely demanding and we aren't being recognized in terms of compensation for how hard we work and the risk that we put on ourselves in the same way that structural firefighters are,\" said Freedman, who has nine years of front-line experience.</p><p>It's not just a question of the number of rangers, he said, but a lack of crews means they can fight fewer fires at once, take longer to respond to new fires, and run the risk of letting them grow out of control.</p><p>\"They only have seven crews in Red Lake, when they're supposed to have 15.

He figured if it came to it, he could put 10 people in the boat and his small 40-horsepower motor would get them across the lake in about 10 minutes. Then he'd come back and do it again and again until everyone was safe.</p><p>\"I had fuel. I had my oars. I even had my fishing rods ready and stuff. It was all set up and ready to go,\" he said.</p><p>Fortunately, a water bomber was on the scene within hours, arriving when the fire was aggressively spreading, going from two to 200 hectares in only an hour and a half, Meekis said. Dropping more than 6,000 litres of water in a single load, the \"super scooper\" was able to cool down the area around the airport enough so that ground crews could beat back the flames and the runway was reopened.</p><p>With more than 40 Ontario fire rangers on the ground deploying hoses and sprinklers, the town's essential infrastructure has been saved. At one point, the fire was raging less than 100 metres from the nursing station; the band office came within 60 metres of going up in smoke.</p><p>The people of Deer Lake are still worried about the fire, which had burned more than 17,000 hectares when Meekis got on that plane in early June and has since exploded to over 183,000 hectares. If it flares back up around town, it could destroy their homes. But after witnessing Ontario's forest fire fighters in action, Meekis was hopeful they have escaped the worst.</p><p>\"They're good people who have been through this before and are very knowledgeable and know how to fight the fire. I'm grateful there's people like that.\"</p><p>But with this new breed of fire, \"we're going to need a lot more of them,\" he said.</p><p>'It's just not a livable job anymore'It's hard to predict how bad a fire season will be because the weather can turn on a dime. But this year in Ontario is shaping up to be a doozy.</p><p>The wildfire that forced the evacuation of Deer Lake - dubbed Red Lake 12 - is alone more than twice as large as all the forest fires that burned last year, provincewide.</p><p>Ontario doesn't have enough wilderness firefighters. I learned what it takes to be one</p><p>And while the town is safe for now, and everyone has been safely evacuated, some people are questioning how the fire got so out of hand so quickly - and whether that would have happened if there were more fire rangers available.</p><p>Ten years ago, there were 732 fire rangers. Now there are 630.</p><p>At a time when the threat of forest fires is greater than it has ever been, our front line of defence is understaffed by more than 100 firefighters.</p><p>And with fewer fire rangers, reaction time to new fires is slower, and more of them are escaping containment. </p><p>\"Would these fires have become as big as they are if we just had the same resources as we've had in the past?\" said Noah Freedman, a crew leader and vice-president of the fire rangers' union, OPSEU Local 703.</p><p>The problem, according to government reports, the union as well as more than a dozen interviews with current and former firefighters, is staff retention. What used to be a career for people across Ontario's North has turned into a summer job for most.</p><p>The Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch (AFFES) \"is losing their experienced staff at an alarming rate,\" states an internal Ministry of Natural Resources report, obtained by the Star.</p><p>The report, published nearly a decade ago, identified a turnover rate of 45 per cent - a rate which has not improved.</p><p>\"Because of this turnover, the organization has been forced to promote employees despite them possessing only minimal practical experience and limited fire line expertise,\" the report states.</p><p>It's not just fire rangers that are short-staffed. At least three of the province's nine waterbombers have been grounded this season due to a lack of pilots, according to OPSEU.  </p><p>\"Just weeks ago, crews in Northwestern Ontario worked tirelessly battling wildfires to save people's homes and property,\" the union said in a statement. \"All the while, an aircraft sat unused, calling into question whether that grounded aircraft and a skilled crew could have made a difference.\"</p><p>In a dangerous job like forest firefighting, a lack of experience can be deadly.</p><p>\"Say you have a guy that has 10 years of experience leading a crew. They can see things and read things that somebody who has become a crew leader after three years just won't notice or won't even think of,\" said Dean Rosen, a former Ontario fire ranger who worked for five seasons out of Pickle Lake, more than 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. \"Lots of those little mistakes can have big consequences when you just don't have the right amount of experience.\"</p><p>Rosen, who wrote his master's thesis in 2021 on turnover in the Ontario FireRanger program, says there are many issues affecting retention, ranging from the remote, isolated work conditions to the physical difficulty and danger of the work itself. The fact that forest firefighters aren't employed year-round means that everyone is effectively laid off every year and has months to think about whether they want to go back.</p><p>But ultimately, it comes down to pay.</p><p>While entry-level pay recently went up to $25.38 an hour, it hasn't kept up with inflation. Today, crew members are only making one-and-a-half times minimum wage. Fifteen years ago, their wages were more than double minimum wage.</p><p>\"It's just not a livable job anymore, really. Unless fire seasons are crazy and you're working your ass off,\" said Rosen. \"Because the money's in the overtime.\"</p><p>In 2021, the last big wildfire season in Ontario, Rosen said fire rangers were able to work 500 hours overtime, adding 50 per cent to their take-home earnings.</p><p>In the quiet seasons since, there hasn't been much action. Not only is this discouraging people from returning, those who do are not building up much on-the-ground experience.</p><p>\"You get somebody who comes into the program and they're all excited and amped up and ready to go, and then they're just kind of sitting all summer. And that really deters them from coming back the next year,\" he said. \"If you're not giving them incentive to stay in the program and to develop their skills and experience and move up the ranks, why would they?\"</p><p>The budget is not enough - even in slow yearsThe bottleneck is a lack of crew leaders. No matter how many rookies are brought in, the province cannot hire additional crew members if there are no crew leaders to supervise them.</p><p>According to a 2024 ministerial briefing document obtained by the Star, the optimal number of fire rangers is 756, organized into 189 four-person crews. But in order to achieve this level of coverage, the province needs 189 crew leaders - and it has been coming up far short.</p><p>This year, there are only 144 crew leaders and, as a result, the FireRangers are limited to fielding that number of crews. Even though one-third of these crews were assigned an extra member - adopting a five-person model that had been discontinued years ago after it was found to be inefficient - the province is still 45 crews and more than 100 fire rangers short.</p><p>With fewer people on the front line, the FireRangers' response time is suffering. Over the past 10 years, the province's preferred performance metric, called \"wildfire containment effectiveness\" or \"initial attack success rate,\" has dropped markedly.</p><p>The percentage of significant fires that were \"being held\" by noon the day after they were reported was nearly 98 per cent in 2014. In 2022, the most recent year for which numbers are available, that had dropped to 92 per cent - well short of the 96 per cent target.</p><p>They say Muskoka won't burn. But climate has changed the calculus</p><p>Getting to a fire quickly is important because only two per cent of fires account for 98 per cent of the forest area burned each year, according to a Ministry of Natural Resources presentation prepared for the Auditor General and obtained by the Star. In other words, 98 per cent of fires are put out when they're small and it's the handful of fires that escape early containment that cause virtually all the damage.</p><p>In Deer Lake, so many resources were focused on saving the town that the fire was never contained and it grew rapidly in the opposite direction. A week later, it had become the second biggest fire on record in Ontario, and had burned 60 km north until it reached the doorstep of next town, Sandy Lake, which also had to be evacuated.</p><p>With more fires and fewer fire rangers to fight them, the pressure on the small number of experienced leaders increases.</p><p>Ten years ago, according to the ministry report on recruitment and retention, more than half the crew leaders had one year of experience or less in the position, and the vast majority of the initial attacks on fires were led by the more experienced crew leaders. At the fire base in Sioux Lookout, for example, only one of the 17 crew leaders had led more than 10 initial attacks, and he had 48 to his name.</p><p>While the AFFES has produced two follow up reports over the last decade, it declined to provide them to the Star. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests did not respond to questions for this story, instead sending a statement that read: \"Ontario remains an internationally recognized leader in wildfire fire management.\"</p><p>Over the last two years, the province has added 100 year-round \"support\" positions, and paid out a one-time \"retention incentive payment\" of up to $5,000 to fire rangers last year, the statement read. There's also been a pay bump, a bonus introduced for days spent camping while fighting fires and as much as $500 in reimbursement for eligible expenses related to training, including the cost of safety boots.</p><p>At the FireRangers base in Haliburton, supervisor Bob Hurley said the real difference maker has been the introduction of nine-month \"tech\" contracts for crew leaders, which allows some of them to start earlier in the spring and stay later in the fall.</p><p>\"I think we've turned the corner. We're starting to see the positive recruitment come back in, and we're starting to see people come back. They want to be here,\" he said. </p><p>According to the union that represents fire rangers, however, these retention measures haven't been enough to address the problem.</p><p>\"We are having an enormously difficult time keeping people because the job is extremely demanding and we aren't being recognized in terms of compensation for how hard we work and the risk that we put on ourselves in the same way that structural firefighters are,\" said Freedman, who has nine years of front-line experience.</p><p>It's not just a question of the number of rangers, he said, but a lack of crews means they can fight fewer fires at once, take longer to respond to new fires, and run the risk of letting them grow out of control.</p><p>\"They only have seven crews in Red Lake, when they're supposed to have 15. In Geraldton, they've got six crews, and they're supposed to have 18,\" he said. \"It's bad.\"</p><p>While Ontario's emergency wildfire suppression budget has nearly doubled over the past 10 years, the cost of actually fighting the fires is almost always more - a lot more. The AFFES has blown past its budget every year but one over the past decade. It happens in big fire years as expected, but also in quiet years, when little forest burns.</p><p>Asked about these budget overruns, Ministry of Natural Resources spokesperson Mike Fenn explained that the budget \"ensures the resources are in place to respond immediately at the onset of fire season.\"</p><p>\"Once the total costs for the fire season can be accurately predicted, the Ministry will request the balance of the total funding requirements from the contingency fund,\" he said.</p><p>This is not a good way to plan, Freedman said, because it leaves fire rangers scrambling to find helicopters and planes in the middle of a busy fire season instead of leasing them in advance. The approach is indicative of a service stretched to its limits, one that scrambles to fulfil its duties with fewer staff and aircraft than needed, he added.</p><p>\"We are not anywhere near what they call the 'ideal capacity,' and that's saying nothing about the capacity we'll need in the future,\" said Freedman.</p><p>The number of fires and forest area burned across Canada, which has doubled over the past 60 years, is projected to double again by the end of this century. It stands to reason that the cost of forest fire fighting will also rise, but by how much remains the focus of debate.</p><p>Studies have pegged the rise as low as 45 per cent and as high as 145 per cent.</p><p>Research carried out by the Canadian Forest Service found that in order to adequately contain the bigger fires and prevent them from entering towns and cities, the cost could be far greater. The study found a 15 per cent increase in the number and size of forest fires would require a doubling of resources needed to contain them at the same rate as today.</p><p>So if fire activity doubles as expected, Ontario would need six times more firefighting resources - fire rangers, water bombers, helicopters and support staff - or risk losing control of many more massive runaway fires.</p><p>How to prepare for the next fire disasterIf you want to see a vision of a future wracked by climate change, you need only look across the country to British Columbia.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, Canada's westernmost province has suffered repeated natural disasters: wildfires that have levelled towns, torrential rains that have washed out highways, floods that have turned entire communities into islands and heatwaves that have killed hundreds.</p><p>The provincial government has spent a lot of time reviewing the damage and preparing for the next disaster and the ways it has beefed up its wildfire service are instructive for Ontario.</p><p>Despite having a smaller land mass to cover and having fewer people to protect, B.C. now employs twice as many wildfire fighters as Ontario. It also has three times as many waterbombers and more helicopters.</p><p>In 2022, B.C. announced it would convert the service from seasonal to year-round, pledging more than $200 million in new funding. In the three years since, the number of year-round jobs has risen by 56 per cent, according to figures provided to the Star, and BCWS now employs more than 600 year-round staff - nearly the same number of people as the entire fire ranger force in Ontario.</p><p>\"Historically, wildfires were really seen as just like a summer situation. The core wildfire season would be July and August and that was what we were prepared for,\" said BC Wildfire Service Information Officer Sarah Budd. \"This is a year-round problem. The climate that we're working in is changing, and we need to be ready for a much longer response season.\"</p><p>Not only are the forest fire fighters in B.C. on the ground earlier in the spring and staying later in the fall, but many of them are now involved in risk-reduction activities in the winter, in hopes of improving the next season's response.</p><p>This means doing more prescribed burns that consume fuel on the forest floor that would otherwise feed summer fires. It also means improving access roads to get fire crews into high-risk areas, proactively creating firebreaks with heavy equipment in the winter when the machines won't bog down, and working with nearby communities to develop partnerships with local fire departments and emergency evacuation plans.</p><p>While Ontario's response mirrors some of these initiatives, it falls short of the massive effort underway in B.C. If the predictions of bigger fire seasons are to be believed, and the erosion of the fire rangers' ranks is to be turned around, a fully year-round service is the formula B.C. considers best.</p><p>\"There's been a pretty intense focus on the human resources side of it, making this into a place where people can build a career, so that you can come up through the crews and then continue to contribute that expertise. That way, we're not losing that knowledge when people peel off year after year,\" said Budd.</p><p>This story is Part 1 in The Coming Firestorm, a three-part series on the growing risk of wildfires fuelled by human-induced climate change.</p><p>In Part 2: A Star reporter learns to be an Ontario fire ranger - the province's front line against the next uncontrollable blaze.</p><p>Coming Monday in Part 3: Why computer models are failing to predict \"impossible\" wildfires, and what that means for Southern Ontario. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2025062275889667</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G3J-VS63-RTM6-902V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2834\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario) Online</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 22, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0AY</classCode><className>MARINE VESSELS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D7JM</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He figured if it came to it, he could put 10 people in the boat and his small 40-horsepower motor would get them across the lake in about 10 minutes. Then he'd come back and do it again and again until everyone was safe.</p><p>\"I had fuel. I had my oars. I even had my fishing rods ready and stuff. It was all set up and ready to go,\" he said.</p><p>Fortunately, a water bomber was on the scene within hours, arriving when the fire was aggressively spreading, going from two to 200 hectares in only an hour and a half, Meekis said. Dropping more than 6,000 litres of water in a single load, the \"super scooper\" was able to cool down the area around the airport enough so that ground crews could beat back the flames and the runway was reopened.</p><p>With more than 40 Ontario fire rangers on the ground deploying hoses and sprinklers, the town's essential infrastructure has been saved. At one point, the fire was raging less than 100 metres from the nursing station; the band office came within 60 metres of going up in smoke.</p><p>The people of Deer Lake are still worried about the fire, which had burned more than 17,000 hectares when Meekis got on that plane in early June and has since exploded to over 183,000 hectares. If it flares back up around town, it could destroy their homes. But after witnessing Ontario's forest fire fighters in action, Meekis was hopeful they have escaped the worst.</p><p>\"They're good people who have been through this before and are very knowledgeable and know how to fight the fire. I'm grateful there's people like that.\"</p><p>But with this new breed of fire, \"we're going to need a lot more of them,\" he said.</p><p>'It's just not a livable job anymore'It's hard to predict how bad a fire season will be because the weather can turn on a dime. But this year in Ontario is shaping up to be a doozy.</p><p>The wildfire that forced the evacuation of Deer Lake - dubbed Red Lake 12 - is alone more than twice as large as all the forest fires that burned last year, provincewide.</p><p>Ontario doesn't have enough wilderness firefighters. I learned what it takes to be one</p><p>And while the town is safe for now, and everyone has been safely evacuated, some people are questioning how the fire got so out of hand so quickly - and whether that would have happened if there were more fire rangers available.</p><p>Ten years ago, there were 732 fire rangers. Now there are 630.</p><p>At a time when the threat of forest fires is greater than it has ever been, our front line of defence is understaffed by more than 100 firefighters.</p><p>And with fewer fire rangers, reaction time to new fires is slower, and more of them are escaping containment. </p><p>\"Would these fires have become as big as they are if we just had the same resources as we've had in the past?\" said Noah Freedman, a crew leader and vice-president of the fire rangers' union, OPSEU Local 703.</p><p>The problem, according to government reports, the union as well as more than a dozen interviews with current and former firefighters, is staff retention. What used to be a career for people across Ontario's North has turned into a summer job for most.</p><p>The Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch (AFFES) \"is losing their experienced staff at an alarming rate,\" states an internal Ministry of Natural Resources report, obtained by the Star.</p><p>The report, published nearly a decade ago, identified a turnover rate of 45 per cent - a rate which has not improved.</p><p>\"Because of this turnover, the organization has been forced to promote employees despite them possessing only minimal practical experience and limited fire line expertise,\" the report states.</p><p>It's not just fire rangers that are short-staffed. At least three of the province's nine waterbombers have been grounded this season due to a lack of pilots, according to OPSEU.  </p><p>\"Just weeks ago, crews in Northwestern Ontario worked tirelessly battling wildfires to save people's homes and property,\" the union said in a statement. \"All the while, an aircraft sat unused, calling into question whether that grounded aircraft and a skilled crew could have made a difference.\"</p><p>In a dangerous job like forest firefighting, a lack of experience can be deadly.</p><p>\"Say you have a guy that has 10 years of experience leading a crew. They can see things and read things that somebody who has become a crew leader after three years just won't notice or won't even think of,\" said Dean Rosen, a former Ontario fire ranger who worked for five seasons out of Pickle Lake, more than 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. \"Lots of those little mistakes can have big consequences when you just don't have the right amount of experience.\"</p><p>Rosen, who wrote his master's thesis in 2021 on turnover in the Ontario FireRanger program, says there are many issues affecting retention, ranging from the remote, isolated work conditions to the physical difficulty and danger of the work itself. The fact that forest firefighters aren't employed year-round means that everyone is effectively laid off every year and has months to think about whether they want to go back.</p><p>But ultimately, it comes down to pay.</p><p>While entry-level pay recently went up to $25.38 an hour, it hasn't kept up with inflation. Today, crew members are only making one-and-a-half times minimum wage. Fifteen years ago, their wages were more than double minimum wage.</p><p>\"It's just not a livable job anymore, really. Unless fire seasons are crazy and you're working your ass off,\" said Rosen. \"Because the money's in the overtime.\"</p><p>In 2021, the last big wildfire season in Ontario, Rosen said fire rangers were able to work 500 hours overtime, adding 50 per cent to their take-home earnings.</p><p>In the quiet seasons since, there hasn't been much action. Not only is this discouraging people from returning, those who do are not building up much on-the-ground experience.</p><p>\"You get somebody who comes into the program and they're all excited and amped up and ready to go, and then they're just kind of sitting all summer. And that really deters them from coming back the next year,\" he said. \"If you're not giving them incentive to stay in the program and to develop their skills and experience and move up the ranks, why would they?\"</p><p>The budget is not enough - even in slow yearsThe bottleneck is a lack of crew leaders. No matter how many rookies are brought in, the province cannot hire additional crew members if there are no crew leaders to supervise them.</p><p>According to a 2024 ministerial briefing document obtained by the Star, the optimal number of fire rangers is 756, organized into 189 four-person crews. But in order to achieve this level of coverage, the province needs 189 crew leaders - and it has been coming up far short.</p><p>This year, there are only 144 crew leaders and, as a result, the FireRangers are limited to fielding that number of crews. Even though one-third of these crews were assigned an extra member - adopting a five-person model that had been discontinued years ago after it was found to be inefficient - the province is still 45 crews and more than 100 fire rangers short.</p><p>With fewer people on the front line, the FireRangers' response time is suffering. Over the past 10 years, the province's preferred performance metric, called \"wildfire containment effectiveness\" or \"initial attack success rate,\" has dropped markedly.</p><p>The percentage of significant fires that were \"being held\" by noon the day after they were reported was nearly 98 per cent in 2014. In 2022, the most recent year for which numbers are available, that had dropped to 92 per cent - well short of the 96 per cent target.</p><p>They say Muskoka won't burn. But climate has changed the calculus</p><p>Getting to a fire quickly is important because only two per cent of fires account for 98 per cent of the forest area burned each year, according to a Ministry of Natural Resources presentation prepared for the Auditor General and obtained by the Star. In other words, 98 per cent of fires are put out when they're small and it's the handful of fires that escape early containment that cause virtually all the damage.</p><p>In Deer Lake, so many resources were focused on saving the town that the fire was never contained and it grew rapidly in the opposite direction. A week later, it had become the second biggest fire on record in Ontario, and had burned 60 km north until it reached the doorstep of next town, Sandy Lake, which also had to be evacuated.</p><p>With more fires and fewer fire rangers to fight them, the pressure on the small number of experienced leaders increases.</p><p>Ten years ago, according to the ministry report on recruitment and retention, more than half the crew leaders had one year of experience or less in the position, and the vast majority of the initial attacks on fires were led by the more experienced crew leaders. At the fire base in Sioux Lookout, for example, only one of the 17 crew leaders had led more than 10 initial attacks, and he had 48 to his name.</p><p>While the AFFES has produced two follow up reports over the last decade, it declined to provide them to the Star. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests did not respond to questions for this story, instead sending a statement that read: \"Ontario remains an internationally recognized leader in wildfire fire management.\"</p><p>Over the last two years, the province has added 100 year-round \"support\" positions, and paid out a one-time \"retention incentive payment\" of up to $5,000 to fire rangers last year, the statement read. There's also been a pay bump, a bonus introduced for days spent camping while fighting fires and as much as $500 in reimbursement for eligible expenses related to training, including the cost of safety boots.</p><p>At the FireRangers base in Haliburton, supervisor Bob Hurley said the real difference maker has been the introduction of nine-month \"tech\" contracts for crew leaders, which allows some of them to start earlier in the spring and stay later in the fall.</p><p>\"I think we've turned the corner. We're starting to see the positive recruitment come back in, and we're starting to see people come back. They want to be here,\" he said. </p><p>According to the union that represents fire rangers, however, these retention measures haven't been enough to address the problem.</p><p>\"We are having an enormously difficult time keeping people because the job is extremely demanding and we aren't being recognized in terms of compensation for how hard we work and the risk that we put on ourselves in the same way that structural firefighters are,\" said Freedman, who has nine years of front-line experience.</p><p>It's not just a question of the number of rangers, he said, but a lack of crews means they can fight fewer fires at once, take longer to respond to new fires, and run the risk of letting them grow out of control.</p><p>\"They only have seven crews in Red Lake, when they're supposed to have 15. In Geraldton, they've got six crews, and they're supposed to have 18,\" he said. \"It's bad.\"</p><p>While Ontario's emergency wildfire suppression budget has nearly doubled over the past 10 years, the cost of actually fighting the fires is almost always more - a lot more. The AFFES has blown past its budget every year but one over the past decade. It happens in big fire years as expected, but also in quiet years, when little forest burns.</p><p>Asked about these budget overruns, Ministry of Natural Resources spokesperson Mike Fenn explained that the budget \"ensures the resources are in place to respond immediately at the onset of fire season.\"</p><p>\"Once the total costs for the fire season can be accurately predicted, the Ministry will request the balance of the total funding requirements from the contingency fund,\" he said.</p><p>This is not a good way to plan, Freedman said, because it leaves fire rangers scrambling to find helicopters and planes in the middle of a busy fire season instead of leasing them in advance. The approach is indicative of a service stretched to its limits, one that scrambles to fulfil its duties with fewer staff and aircraft than needed, he added.</p><p>\"We are not anywhere near what they call the 'ideal capacity,' and that's saying nothing about the capacity we'll need in the future,\" said Freedman.</p><p>The number of fires and forest area burned across Canada, which has doubled over the past 60 years, is projected to double again by the end of this century. It stands to reason that the cost of forest fire fighting will also rise, but by how much remains the focus of debate.</p><p>Studies have pegged the rise as low as 45 per cent and as high as 145 per cent.</p><p>Research carried out by the Canadian Forest Service found that in order to adequately contain the bigger fires and prevent them from entering towns and cities, the cost could be far greater. The study found a 15 per cent increase in the number and size of forest fires would require a doubling of resources needed to contain them at the same rate as today.</p><p>So if fire activity doubles as expected, Ontario would need six times more firefighting resources - fire rangers, water bombers, helicopters and support staff - or risk losing control of many more massive runaway fires.</p><p>How to prepare for the next fire disasterIf you want to see a vision of a future wracked by climate change, you need only look across the country to British Columbia.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, Canada's westernmost province has suffered repeated natural disasters: wildfires that have levelled towns, torrential rains that have washed out highways, floods that have turned entire communities into islands and heatwaves that have killed hundreds.</p><p>The provincial government has spent a lot of time reviewing the damage and preparing for the next disaster and the ways it has beefed up its wildfire service are instructive for Ontario.</p><p>Despite having a smaller land mass to cover and having fewer people to protect, B.C. now employs twice as many wildfire fighters as Ontario. It also has three times as many waterbombers and more helicopters.</p><p>In 2022, B.C. announced it would convert the service from seasonal to year-round, pledging more than $200 million in new funding. In the three years since, the number of year-round jobs has risen by 56 per cent, according to figures provided to the Star, and BCWS now employs more than 600 year-round staff - nearly the same number of people as the entire fire ranger force in Ontario.</p><p>\"Historically, wildfires were really seen as just like a summer situation. The core wildfire season would be July and August and that was what we were prepared for,\" said BC Wildfire Service Information Officer Sarah Budd. \"This is a year-round problem. The climate that we're working in is changing, and we need to be ready for a much longer response season.\"</p><p>Not only are the forest fire fighters in B.C. on the ground earlier in the spring and staying later in the fall, but many of them are now involved in risk-reduction activities in the winter, in hopes of improving the next season's response.</p><p>This means doing more prescribed burns that consume fuel on the forest floor that would otherwise feed summer fires. It also means improving access roads to get fire crews into high-risk areas, proactively creating firebreaks with heavy equipment in the winter when the machines won't bog down, and working with nearby communities to develop partnerships with local fire departments and emergency evacuation plans.</p><p>While Ontario's response mirrors some of these initiatives, it falls short of the massive effort underway in B.C. If the predictions of bigger fire seasons are to be believed, and the erosion of the fire rangers' ranks is to be turned around, a fully year-round service is the formula B.C. considers best.</p><p>\"There's been a pretty intense focus on the human resources side of it, making this into a place where people can build a career, so that you can come up through the crews and then continue to contribute that expertise. That way, we're not losing that knowledge when people peel off year after year,\" said Budd.</p><p>This story is Part 1 in The Coming Firestorm, a three-part series on the growing risk of wildfires fuelled by human-induced climate change.</p><p>In Part 2: A Star reporter learns to be an Ontario fire ranger - the province's front line against the next uncontrollable blaze.</p><p>Coming Monday in Part 3: Why computer models are failing to predict \"impossible\" wildfires, and what that means for Southern Ontario. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2025062275889644</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G3J-VS63-RTM6-90G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2834\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Those in areas close to the blazes were evacuated. As far south as Chatham, residents were advised to avoid unnecessary outdoor activities. In Toronto, besieged by a brutal heat wave, the urban heat island effect trapped pollutants in the densely packed city, resulting in the dubious honour of being named one of the cities with the worst air quality in the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although authorities have become accustomed to taking action during wildfire season, the increasing intensity, duration and scope of fires mean that their impact is felt in areas that used to be impervious to forest fire fallout, and pre-existing protocols no longer suffice. While organizations and various levels of government conduct drills to help manage emergency situations, there are limits to how effective real-life practice can be if one is facing a previously unheard-of scenario.</p><p>\"That's where computer modelling comes in,\" says Myrna Bittner, the CEO and co-founder of RunWithIt Synthetics, which has developed an AI-driven platform (she describes it as Google Earth meets Sim City) that can help municipalities and other groups visualize how a particular crisis might play out depending on different variables.</p><p>Virtual models and algorithmic calculations have long been involved in emergency planning, but as climate change makes it harder to anticipate the parameters of wildfires and other natural disasters, old frameworks are no longer effective. </p><p>\"The failure is in the unimaginable,\" says Bittner, who notes that conventional climate modelling has often focused on incremental shifts over time. What's missing from that approach, she says, are \"the sudden and severe and chronic and compounding disasters\" that people need to understand in order to protect themselves and their communities.</p><p>For RunWithIt, Bittner uses visualizations and leverages population-specific data that allows her to represent, for instance, how people navigate daily life in their community, how many homes will be permeated by smoke and how many residents will experience health complications.</p><p>Rather than foregrounding the human experience, many predictive tools focus on infrastructure destruction, buildings lost, acreage burnt. This makes it harder for people to grasp the urgency of a potential disaster - and it speaks to how virtual modelling itself needs to evolve. The world is not fixed or binary, Bittner says.</p><p> \"We need to be constantly revising and augmenting our understanding,\" she adds, \"and the modelling world needs to escape that foundation of being reliant on historical data, because the future is not like the past.\"</p><p>Manzil expands banking options </p><p>for Muslim Americans </p><p>Toronto-based Manzil, which specializes in financial services that adhere to the core tenets of the Islamic faith, is a unique fintech resource for a group that can struggle to access inclusive banking options. The startup, which has been providing halal mortgages to Canadians since 2020 (Sharia law prohibits transactions that earn interest, so conventional mortgages are verboten), has just launched Manzil Invest USA, an app that will allow American customers to explore different investment options without compromising their religious beliefs.</p><p>X CEO is now ex-CEO</p><p>Linda Yaccarino, who was named CEO of X (formerly Twitter) two years ago, is exiting her role at the corporation.

That translates to about 156 square miles (404 square kilometers), or about half the size of New York City, which has a land area of 300 square miles (778 square kilometers).</p><p>Not all researchers agree that megafire is a scientifically sound term, though Clements has used it, and with its usage by the media increasing, he believes it\u2019s \u201chere to stay,\u201d similar to \u201cheat dome\u201d and other popular weather labels that aren\u2019t formal scientific terms. References to 100,000 acres as megafires can also be found in some government reports and research in recent years.</p><p>Are megafires happening more often?</p><p>There were at least 14 wildfires that burned more than 100,000 acres in the U.S. in 2024, according to a report by the National Interagency Coordination Center. A 2022 Interior Department report found that the number of megafires, which it defined as more than 100,000 acres, had increased in the preceding decade.</p><p>The amount of forest area burned each year in the western U.S. has approximately tripled since the 1980s, according to Brian Harvey, professor of forest fire science at the University of Washington.</p><p>The link between wildfires and climate change</p><p>The link between climate change and the increasing frequency of severe wildfires is particularly noticeable in the western U.S. and the boreal forest that stretches from Canada into Alaska, Harvey said, because these fire-prone ecosystems rely on winter snowpack to provide moisture all summer, and global warming has led to less snow, melting earlier in the year.</p><p>Wildfires naturally occur in healthy ecosystems, but extreme wildfires can slow the regrowth of native plants and trees and create favorable conditions for invasive species. The threat is growing as climate change can make wildfires more frequent and severe, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p><p>Wildfire seasons are also influenced by lightning, land management practices and human-caused fires. Fires started by humans account for 70-90% of wildfires depending on the state and year, according to the USDA. This includes fires started by fireworks or discarded cigarettes.</p><p>Rising temperatures and longer droughts have dried out plants and leaves, driving wildfires in the western U.S. over the past 20 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cFires are getting bigger and this has been linked to drying of fuels from a warming climate,\u201d Clements said.</p><p>\u201cLarge fires are, by definition, fires that are driven by extreme weather conditions like really high temperatures, low relative humidity and strong winds,\u201d said James Johnston, assistant research professor at the University of Oregon. Climate change explains much of this weather, which is increasing the frequency of large, fast-moving fires, he added.</p><p>When and how did the Cram Fire start?</p><p>Firefighters responded to a fire burning on private land along U.S. Route 97 in the Willowdale area on July 13, according to Central Oregon Fire Information. It burned just over 2 square miles (6 square kilometers) at the time and was uncontained.</p><p>By the next day, it had grown so much that Gov. Tina Kotek invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act after county officials requested assistance, allowing the Oregon State Fire Marshal to mobilize resources to support local agencies. It was the sixth time this wildfire season that the governor invoked the act.</p><p>The cause is under investigation.</p><p>What kind of damage has it caused?</p><p>The fire has destroyed two homes and 14 outbuildings such as barns, pump houses, workshops or sheds, officials said. The threat to structures was significantly reduced when containment reached 73%, officials said Monday. Some evacuations remained in effect Monday, but some zones have been downgraded.</p><p>____</p><p>O\u2019Malley reported from Philadelphia and Brumfield reported from Cockeysville, Maryland.</p><p>____</p><p>The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Heavy smoke from fires in the prairie provinces has drifted into Eeyou Istchee, causing occasional health advisories.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Waswanipi\u2019s public safety department issued a smoke advisory July 13. With hazy conditions impacting air quality and visibility, community members were advised to limit time outdoors, keep windows and doors closed, and use air purifiers or air conditioning on recirculate mode.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe Cree Health Board monitors the air quality through Purple Air [sensors] set up in each community,\u201d explained regional fire coordinator Lee-Roy Blacksmith. \u201cThey started installing community air quality devices in 2023 due to asthma, Elders and infants.\u201d</p><p>These sensors send air quality data to a centralized map, which displays an Air Quality Health Index to determine the extent of health risk. The record-breaking 2023 wildfire season impacted over 11% of the land and nearly 60% of traplines throughout Eeyou Istchee, destroying 150 bush cabins and forcing numerous community evacuations.</p><p>With the resources of provincial forest firefighting agency SOPFEU overwhelmed by that year\u2019s unprecedented damage, many people were upset that certain areas weren\u2019t considered priorities for intervention. Firefighters in Eastmain had wanted to battle an approaching blaze but were advised not to by SOPFEU, resulting in the community being evacuated.</p><p>Quebec responded by investing $29 million in SOPFEU over five years, for a hiring blitz, new equipment and prevention initiatives. SOPFEU is also working with the Cree Nation to train additional firefighters in all Cree communities.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe have eight new forest firefighters doing our training right now and possibly four others who are getting recertified,\u201d said Clarence Jason Jolly, Nemaska\u2019s director of public health and safety. \u201cThey\u2019re out there working on the fire pumps \u2013 I\u2019d say we\u2019re well prepared.\u201d</p><p>Jolly said their department is able to fight fires up to 30 km from the community, as long as SOPFEU is informed and sufficient resources are available. SOPFEU will intervene with water bombers within this radius or if they threaten \u201cpriority infrastructure\u201d like the nearby Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec substation.</p><p>Situated beside a lake with a river behind the community, Nemaska has not installed further protections like a fire break. However, two of these strips of land cleared of combustible vegetation were built near Old Nemaska, where the community hosts summer gatherings.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be getting more sophisticated drones for our area, including training,\u201d added Jolly. \u201cIf we were able to report any fires to SOPFEU by drone, it certainly saves them the time and money rather than sending a plane. We\u2019re adapting to the technology and able to monitor the weather a lot better.\u201d</p><p>Drone technology is rapidly advancing to detect and suppress fires before they spread. These remotely piloted vehicles can serve as emergency first responders, picking up and dropping water autonomously, providing real-time images of inaccessible areas, and locating missing persons.</p><p>\u201cDrones help us at forest fire hot spots where it\u2019s not accessible and also help on fire investigations or search and rescue,\u201d explained Blacksmith. \u201cDrones have all this high technology, like heat sensors and infrared. Drones can carry items like life jackets and buoys that can be dropped and also speak with the person.\u201d</p><p>Firefighters across the region are implementing a range of tools and strategies to better ensure community safety. A Cree Nation Fire Master Plan is being developed with Waswanay Consulting, identifying areas of heightened risk where communities are not yet prepared to intervene, such as airports.</p><p>\u201cAs communities expand rapidly, it affects fire protection, resources and training,\u201d said former regional fire prevention officer George Cox, who recently transitioned to community public safety. \u201cSometimes a large fire was out of control and departments had to shut off operations because they were emptying out the water reservoir of the community.\u201d</p><p>Chisasibi declared a state of emergency in June when lightning struck their water treatment plant while river levels were already critically low. While fires burned the week before and after the crisis, Chief Daisy House was thankful that none occurred when water was unavailable.\u00a0</p><p>Blacksmith said one fire remains active north of Chisasibi around the Rupert trapline but is expected to be extinguished by rain. Caused by lightning on June 10, it has burned slowly and isn\u2019t considered a threat to the community.</p><p>The Fire Master Plan will detail how to access water resources during such a crisis through dry hydrants that can be installed near lakes or rivers. These non-pressurized tools involve permanently installed pipes, providing firefighters a reliable water source.\u00a0</p><p>Fire prevention officers from all Cree communities are participating in a unique mentorship program this summer with Ontario fire departments to learn about early detection systems, inspections and public education programs. Waskaganish fire investigator Tyler Diamond even assisted an active scene in St. Catharines, Ontario.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt builds their confidence to do the work in their community,\u201d Cox said. \u201cIf we learned it all by ourselves it would probably take over a decade, so having this mentorship we can learn from people with 20 or 30 years of experience in the field.\u201d</p><p>A similar program is planned for community fire chiefs, deputy fire chiefs, captains and lieutenants. Another initiative called Fire Smart is an online training program which offers guidelines for mitigating risk, such as having smoke detectors, fire extinguishers and two doors in bush cabins.\u00a0</p><p>A model cabin to demonstrate safety tips was featured at last fall\u2019s Fire and Life Symposium in Mistissini. Another symposium will be in Wemindji this September, where the Cree Health Board, SOPFEU and police services are expected to attend.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20381e9968a54408a35f57ef6012a644</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCF-NRP3-RSMS-10FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"999\"/><timeReceived>11:57 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 28, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The closing is comprised of 598,500 Flow Through Units at a price of $0.30 per Flow-Through Unit representing proceeds of $179,550.00 for an aggregate total raised of $179,550.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The securities issued are subject to a four-month statutory hold period in Canada ending on December 1, 2025.</p><p>The Units consist of, and separate immediately upon closing into, one common share of the Issuer (each, a \"Common Share\") and one common share purchase warrant (each, a \"Warrant\"), each entitling the holder to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of $0.30 per Warrant for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the date of issuance. The Flow-Through Shares shall consist of one Common Share, to be issued as a \"flow-through share\" (the \"Flow-Through Shares\") within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada).</p><p>Use of Proceeds</p><p>Boreal Gold intends to use the proceeds from this financing to perform ground geophysical surveys over the western portion of the Fay Lake grid (not previously covered) as well as the north eastern portion of the Fay Lake grid that will be cut and surveyed to follow the strike extension of the Sunrise conductor to the eastern shore of Fay Lake. Drill testing of designed targets will follow up confirmation of Airborne conductors by ground geophysics on the Fay Lake property subject to a successful financing and direct consultation with Kiciwapa Cree Nation. Also planned is detailed mapping, prospecting, sampling and line cutting on the Fay Lake Property on a small portion of the Redwin volcanogenic massive sulphide horizon that remains unmapped but contains conductors.</p><p>Separate to the VMS exploration at Fay Lake above, gold exploration through mapping and prospecting of the western portion of the Puffy Lake Mine style gold mineralization trend, east of the Railroad. Approximately 10-line kilometers is planned on this trend where samples assayed up to 14.33 g/t Au, to evaluate its on strike continuity. The gold potential at Koscielny Lake located at the eastern end of the property south of the Puffy Lake Gold Mine will also be assessed. Here mineralization contained values of up to 11.81 g/t Au (0.38 oz/ton Au) over one meter (J. Pearson, Sept. 4, 2024, National Instrument 43-101 Fay Lake technical report).</p><p>North Star</p><p>Planned Program</p><p>Line cutting and refurbishing old Grids</p><p>Refurbish and recut the Grid from South of the North Star deposit on Line 46 N to Line 59 N between Baselines 46 E and Tie Line 59 E for both mapping and drilling purposes. This portion of the grid is almost 25 years old and overgrown to obliterated as it was cut a few years (12) after a forest fire.</p><p>Geological Mapping, Prospecting and Sampling</p><p>The Grids from Lines 59+50 N south to L 46 N will require geological remapping and detailed sampling to bring it up to the standard and detail of the northern grids that cover the Gold Rock and Richard Veins, with special emphasis on the section in between the North Star and Gold Rock deposits.</p><p>Drilling</p><p>Selective infill drilling, as well as down plunge drilling on the Gold Rock Vein with a view of completing a resource estimate and NI 43-101 compliant technical report (never undertaken). Ultimately the plan is to drill off enough tonnes that the combined resource of the North Star and Gold Rock Vein Structures, with sufficient grade, will warrant to bring it to a prefeasibility study. Even if successful on the first pass, this objective will require a few additional drill programs.</p><p>Melgurd Lake</p><p>On the Melgurd Lake property, following up detailed analysis of Airborne Geophysical conductors on strike with the Shotts Lake deposit and the encouragement found in the felsic volcanic package with VMS style alteration in the 2023-2024 field work, further work is planned to ground truth these conductors. Detailed mapping, prospecting, sampling and line cutting will be carried out over these conductors on the Keep Lake grid with follow up reports. Funds will also be used for corporate purposes.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Stephen L.

That's what made 2023 so bad, but right now, it's just fires mainly to the west of the province and some in the northwest that we're contending with.\"</p><p>Saari said as it's a moderate risk in Toronto, those who are not vulnerable to the effects of the smoke can continue to go outside and breathe the air but those who are sensitive to polluted air should steer clear of the outdoors and consider rescheduling vigorous outdoor activities, especially if they're having symptoms. </p><p>For healthy adults, Saari said \"there's no need to panic. Their risk is moderate. It's not a major acute concern,\" but she noted that the situation may change rapidly depending on how the fire evolves, if new fires develop and if wind patterns change. However, she does note that the more days with moderate levels of bad air can lead to higher exposure over the year and potentially risk health. </p><p>Who is most at risk from polluted air from wildfire smoke? </p><p>Sensitive groups most at risk of wildfire smoke air pollution include seniors, children, pregnant women, people with chronic diseases such as asthma and underlying health conditions such as heart and lung diseases.</p><p>Common symptoms caused by inhalation of smoky air include irritation of the eyes, nose, throat or lungs and for people who have pre-existing chronic conditions, the exposure of wildfire smoke may worsen their symptoms. </p><p>How can I protect myself from wildfire smoke? </p><p>The best way to protect yourself from breathing in bad air caused by smoke from wildfires is to stay indoors, said Saari, but for those who can't stay inside and are required to work outdoors, they are recommended to wear a well-fitting respirator-type mask such as an N95 or P100. </p><p>The masks are designed to reduce exposure to smoke by filtering out fine particulate matter. Wearing a mask and making sure you wear it properly prevents the particles from getting into the lungs and body. </p><p>\"If you are outdoors for a prolonged period of time to do work, you also need to consider reducing the intensity of the work that you're doing and take breaks more frequently and ideally have a cleaner air shelter that you can go in and get some relief,\" said Angela Yao, a senior scientist with Environmental Health Services at the B.C. centre for Disease Control.</p><p>Yao points out that masks may become less effective if they build moisture through wearing it while exercising. Her advice is to shorten the length of time you spend outside and reduce the intensity of the outdoor activity. </p><p>Saari said staying indoors doesn't guarantee safety from the smoke if steps aren't taken to keep the smoke out. Those staying inside are advised to have windows and doors closed as much as possible and to keep indoor air clean, which could mean running a ventilation system and air conditioning with a well-functioning filter or by using a portable air cleaner.</p><p>For those who live in homes without a built-in ventilation system who rely on an open window to cool down, Yao said to avoid wildfire smoke by visiting a public space with cleaner, cooler air ventilation such as a shopping mall or library. </p><p>What to do before heading outside when there's poor air quality?</p><p>With Toronto finally getting a taste of summer this week , Saari and Yao both recommend checking the local air quality health index and to make it part of their daily routine. </p><p>\"Sometimes wildfire smoke can linger for a long period of time, so it's crucial to know when it's a better time to go out,\" Yao said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025073176230997</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCY-HHH3-S59V-V0NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Hundreds of people have had to leave their homes, and Ottawa has sent in the Armed Forces and the Coast Guard to help. This week, Premier John Hogan called this summer a quote \"unbelievable, historic, dry season.\" Leaving already exhausted firefighters to battle the fires without any reprieve from rain. Duane Antle is the president of the Newfoundland and Labrador Association for Fire Services, and the fire chief of Come By Chance, Newfoundland and Labrador. That's where we reached him.</p><p><br/><br/>RZ: Duane, what are you hearing from firefighters right now?<br/><br/>DUANE ANTLE: Right now, the firefighters who are on the front lines of the active fires, they're working really, really hard. They are tired. The work is dangerous. Some of them have taken their vacation time, some have just plain and simply given up their paycheques to be there, to support the communities. And, you know, they're praying for rain.<br/><br/>RZ: Giving up their paycheques because the majority of them are volunteers, right?<br/><br/>DA: Yeah, 90-plus per cent of the firefighters in our province are volunteers. That's correct.<br/><br/>RZ: What kind of strain is that for them to do this right now then?<br/><br/>DA: Well, it's a tremendous strain, not only financially, but if we think about it, you know, they're leaving their families, and their families are worried about them. If you really think about, when we go out to do our work, we can't do it without the support of our families. They're sitting at home. They're worrying about wildfires happening around their homes as well. But they're shouldering all that load themselves, while they allow us to go out and do our work. Now, I'll just clarify, I'm not on the front lines, but I'm talking to folks who are on the front lines every day.<br/><br/>RZ: How bad is this fire season in Newfoundland? Have you seen anything like this before in your career?<br/><br/>DA: No, never. You know, we've seen, I mean, we've always had a fire here and there, no doubt. Some years, less than others. But as an example, last year I think it was 58, and now we're almost to 200, and we're just a few shy of 200, so that's a big difference.<br/><br/>RZ: You mentioned some of the firefighters, the volunteer firefighters, have taken vacation, some have left, but others are staying on more than they normally would. What are you saying to them? Or who's talking to them and giving them the motivation to keep going back out?<br/><br/>DA: I think for the most part, you know, the public are really recognizing the, the contribution that they're making and the sacrifice that the firefighters and their families are making, and they're grateful for that. The government, our government, as well, has been very quick to recognize the hard work of the volunteers. And they are trying to bring in as many resources as they can to lessen the work on those volunteers.<br/><br/>RZ: Right. The army is there now helping, is it not, and the Coast Guard?<br/><br/>DA: Yes, that was announced today. And I also understand that Quebec and Ontario are going to be sending apparatus as well. So, hopefully, this will help get our folks back home to their families.<br/><br/>RZ: You know, the president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs said today it's time for the federal government to have a National Forest Fire Coordination Agency, something like the U.S. Fire Administration. Do you think something like that would help?<br/><br/>DA: We have been lobbying for a federal fire secretariat now for a number of years. And having that agency in place, and it can be done rather quickly, and it's not a very expensive thing to do, that can be up and running. And it could do so many things for us inter-provincially. Getting equipment moved around. Getting crews coordinated and sent from province to province when they're needed. They could eliminate a lot of the paperwork. That fire secretariat is needed, and it's something that we really, really hope we can see put in place rather quickly.<br/><br/>RZ: How concerned are you for the future? Because we are seeing, it seems every year we hear more and more about wildfires. Nova Scotia is already doing something preemptively, telling people they can't go into the woods. And we're seeing your province also increasing dramatically the fines for people who are still having fires. We're talking $50,000 fine for the first offence at this point. I mean, if we look at what's happening, and do you worry what's next? What's in 2030?<br/><br/>DA: Well, of course, you know, things are not getting any better. And obviously, we have to recognize that climate change is real. Our summers are getting warmer and drier. And we used to have a joke in Come By Chance that you move here so you'd never get a sunburn. And now, it's almost like living in Florida. So, I know people are upset, you know, they can't go in the woods, they can't ride their ATV. You know what? That's a small sacrifice to make to keep a firefighter safe. Just a few nights ago, one of the crews fighting the Kingston Fire. The fire came around so quickly that they didn't even have time to pick up their equipment. They had to cut their lines, jump on the truck and run. That's how quick this happened. They came very close to losing their lives. I don't feel like we have the right to say it's OK to put people in harm's way to that extent so I can go for a ride on an ATV. It's not about keeping people out of the woods. It's about preventing another fire. Because you know what? We don't have enough to go around anymore. And the more that these folks have to go out and attend the fires, the more likely the risk of something bad happening to them. And we have to recognize that. And I think, you know, it's a small sacrifice.<br/><br/>RZ: I wonder, too. Do you think it's time to pay firefighters to have more fire services that have paid people working?<br/><br/>DA: Of course. I mean, it's inevitable. You know, the day of people giving up what they're giving up this week, you know, to fight that fire, like, those days are going to have to come to an end. And it's not because people don't want to do it, it is because people can't do it. You know, the financial strain on people is just going to be too much. And as calls increase, you know, people are needed more. Uh, you know, how long are, how long are the families going to be able to say, yeah, we can keep making sacrifices so we can do keep doing this?<br/><br/>RZ: Duane Antle, thank you very much for your time.<br/><br/>DA: And thank you for allowing me to share our story with you.<br/><br/>FF: Duane Antle is the president of the Newfoundland and Labrador Association for Fire Services. We reached him in Come By Chance, Newfoundland and Labrador.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCBCT-AIH2508086</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCBCT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGG-B0D3-RRRK-W1JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487018</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1115\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

By using the loophole of non-resident candidacy, Pierre Poilievre is desperately circumventing our system of local representation. Fine for him to crawl through this loophole but when others follow suit he screams foul, even though he set the example.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As it stands, only the party in power can initiate electoral reform yet it is against their best interests to do so. The Liberals and Conservatives prefer the status quo which guarantees hyper-partisan infighting and wildly childish behaviour in parliament. They fear electoral reform. They support the travesty of a party forming a majority government while receiving a minority of popular votes cast. Electoral reform would be tantamount to enacting political anti-trust legislation. This is mirrored by the Conservative Party itself where Poilievre's minority of Tea Party style Conservatives have hijacked this once proud party.</p><p>Hyper-partisan politics is the hallmark of the disaster happening before our eyes to our southern neighbours. We should see this as a cautionary tale and strive for governments that include more voices. This can only happen through electoral reform. It will lead to coalition governments intent on getting things done. Coalition leads to Collaboration, Cooperation, Compromise and Consensus. This is what we should strive for. And be proud of, if our leaders would only find the courage.</p><p>David Ottenbrite, Cambridge, ON</p><p> David Olive reminds us that Canada is not broken</p><p>Trump could spell the death of Canadian auto production. Here's Plan B, July 31</p><p>Trump's tariffs are delivering a crushing blow to our steel industry. Here's how we turn that around, Aug. 2</p><p>In two columns last week, David Olive helped Canadians to think constructively in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff chaos. July 21 it was the auto industry. His option B urges us to consider a Canadian-owned and tariff-protected assembly industry, meeting defence and other public needs in the first instance, but also producing high-priority heavy equipment. I would add that, if federal and provincial governments are prepared to support multi-billion dollar battery-assembly plants, why are we leaving it to the Chinese to produce the small low-cost reliable electric cars and plug-in hybrids that our carbon reduction targets demand?</p><p>On Aug. 2, it was the steel industry. While supporting the anti-dumping and emergency relief measures already announced, he also has faith in the power of a rapid and rigorous buy-Canadian commitment for the steel that a \"build, baby, build\" Canada will need for, housing, infrastructure, and defence.</p><p>With facts at his fingertips, insightful analysis, and no fear of well-thought-out boldness, Olive reminds us that Canada is not broken. He reassures us that it is not economic ignorance or Oz-like fantasy to believe that Canada can and will thrive. Thanks David. Elbows Up!</p><p>Bill Winegard, Etobicoke</p><p>America's return to manufacturing will mean even more pollution </p><p>Months into his worldwide trade war, Donald Trump still appears resistant to learning how tariffs work, Aug. 5</p><p>As the GTA chokes on climate-change-worsened forest fire smoke, smoke we're perfectly willing to share with the Americans, let's consider that a \"return to the golden age of American manufacturing\" would mean ever more pollution. This is because the Trump MAGAs have zero interest in industrial laws that protect the environment, viewing them as nothing more than red tape. By outsourcing manufacturing, the U.S. has reduced industrial pollution here, emissions that the Americans would be happy to share with us. Thriving through Draconian tariffs is indeed what the Bard called \"a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\" That too many Albertans are willing to make noises about separation from the rest of Canada can only heighten Trump's fantasy of the dissolution of Canada and the acquisition of his \"cherished\" 51st state.</p><p>Ron Charach, Toronto</p><p>Canada is burning and Ford wants more road space for gas emitting automobiles'Most ridiculous decision': Doug Ford slams Ontario judge over bike lane decision, Aug. 6</p><p>We're in the midst of a smoke-filled climate change conundrum. Our Canadian forests are burning to a point where the smoke is soon to reach the shores of Europe. Meanwhile, Ontario Premier Doug Ford is in a spat with Ontario's judiciary, as he continues in his attempt to remove bike lanes in Toronto, so there'll be more road space for greenhouse gas-emitting automobiles. It's time for us air-breathing constituents to stand up and be counted.</p><p>Jack Drury, Toronto</p><p>Two quick fixes Republicans can implement to fight global warming forest firesManitoba's Wab Kinew accuses group of Republicans of pitching 'timber tantrum' over wildfire smoke, Aug. 6</p><p>Rather than create noise on social media with unsubstantiated blaming of fire management practices in Canada, GOP lawmakers can quickly and easily act on a couple of quick solutions to the epidemic of climate change. These would include sending more firefighting help where needed and immediately stopping the burning of coal, oil and gas.</p><p>Jack Bergmans, Toronto</p><p>A Doug Ford tunnel dream?'It's a vision and it works': Doug Ford offers new details on his plan for a Hwy. 401 tunnel, Aug. 6</p><p>Premier Doug Ford is a brave man to propose a three-level tunnel that's \"never been done in the world\" when Metrolinx can't finish the Eglington Crosstown or get the Finch LRT, which is all above ground, running. Is this a fantasy or just loose political talk?</p><p>Michael Levin, Toronto</p><p>Tunnel vision will bankrupt the province</p><p>Do people want a tunnel under the 401? Absolutely not! This is nothing but a colossal gift to Premier Doug Ford's construction friends and will almost certainly bankrupt the province. Instead of trying to use highway 407, which a previous Conservative government sold to private interests, the Ford government wants to waste  our tax dollars on the 401 tunnel. I was in Windsor in July for my mother's 100th birthday and was shocked to find no one in my Windsor family knew anything about the tunnel plan.  Windsor pays provincial taxes too, so why are they unaware of this  huge government line item that will not help anyone  in the province except GTA commuters? </p><p>Gord Deane, Mississauga</p><p>Tunnel cost estimates are laughable</p><p>The cost estimate for the proposed tunnel under highway 401 of $250 million to $1.5 billion per kilometre actually made me laugh out loud. Subway construction currently costs $700 million per kilometre for single level tunnels. The idea that we can build a much more complex triple level tunnel for anything less than double that is preposterous. If we are going to pursue this dreadful waste of money, at least let us go into the project with a realistic estimate of the cost. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025080876284652</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GFK-GH93-RRS5-Y2WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1168\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Coming down, and the rise and the blazes, I'd say it was a couple hundred feet high.\"</p><p>Hayward was one of many residents in the town of Small Point-Broad Cove-Blackhead-Adam's Cove running from an out of control wildfire.</p><p>The fire was deemed contained on Thursday afternoon, as crews dealt with remaining hot spots. The fire burned as large as about 600 hectares.</p><p>The town has been under a state of emergency since Wednesday night. More than 20 buildings have been damaged or destroyed, the provincial government said on Thursday, including at least 12 homes.</p><p>Hayward's home still stands, he said, but his shed was lost.</p><p>\"It came right to the road to my place and went right around my boundary line. Good thing I had my grass cut low, that's what the firefighter said. That's what saved my place,\" he said.</p><p>Scott Penney lives down the road from Hayward. He says he smelled smoke in his home on Wednesday afternoon and quickly evacuated with his family.</p><p>\"By the time I got up to the end of the track to see [about] my neighbours and get them, all was engulfed. My front yard, my neighbours house in front of me, that was all gone,\" Penney said.</p><p>\"Our town of Adam's Cove is gone.\"</p><p/><p>Penney said he hopes insurance companies can respond to the damage quickly, but rebuilding will be a challenging process.</p><p>\"We've got a population of 52 people, and now we got seniors with their house gone. How are they going to rebuild?\"</p><p>Wildfire evacuation earlier than past years</p><p>The evacuation isn't the first of its kind in Newfoundland and Labrador, but could be among the earliest in recent history.</p><p>Newfoundland's forest fire season typically runs from the end of April to the end of September. In Labrador it's around mid-May to the end of September.</p><p>Last year, Labrador communities dealt with the same large-scale evacuation because of wildfires. Churchill Falls was evacuated on June 19, and Labrador City did the same just weeks later.</p><p>In 2022, large-scale forest fires in the Bay d'Espoir area prompted a state of emergency that lasted nearly a week that August.</p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador's active wildfire dashboard, which tracks the size and status of fires, reported 96 in 2024.\u00a0</p><p>As of Thursday, there have been 58 reported wildfires so far in 2025.</p><p>\"I'm very concerned,\" Jeff Motty, provincial forest fire duty officer, told CBC's\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Here &amp; Now on\u00a0</emphasis>Thursday, adding parts of the province are abnormally dry for this time of year.</p><p>\"Here we are, May 8, with 607 hectares [burned] on the books already.

With climate change increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather, including heat waves and wildfires, this particularly pernicious combination could become more common in the future.</p><p>Toronto had the third worst air quality in the world Monday, according to IQAir city rankings. The heat wave is forecast to last until Thursday and the smoke will likely linger just as long, though Toronto will avoid the worst of the smoke, which is headed to Ottawa and Montreal, according to the BlueSky fire smoke forecast map.</p><p>Emerging research shows that wildfire smoke is worse for your health than other kinds of air pollution.</p><p>\"I oftenequate it to smoking because we know when people smoke, they're breathing in combusted plant life,\" said Dr. Anne Hicks, a professor of pediatric respiratory medicine at the University of Alberta. \"With wildfires, we're burning down vegetation and you're inhaling it.\"</p><p>Smoke from forest fires contains toxicvolatile organic hydrocarbons and heavy metals, Hicks said. And when they react to sunlight in the atmosphere, they generate ozone and other pollutants that can cause swelling in the lungs. While the visible particles in smoke won't penetrate as deeply into your lungs as some of the smaller, invisible particles, the smallest particles of all can pass directly into your bloodstream.</p><p>\"If you're smelling something, probably at least some of that is getting absorbed directly into your olfactory nerve - the part of your nervous system that's involved in scent - and that can go directly to your brain,\" she said.</p><p>With increased wildfire activity, and the huge \"monster\" fires that burn for months on end becoming more commonplace, smoke is travelling long distances and reaching places it didn't used to.</p><p>A recent study found that hospitalizations increased by 20 per cent in the U.S. northeast in 2023, after smoke from B.C. and Alberta travelled 3,200 kilometres to blanket the area. Quebec fires that same year sent smoke into southern Ontario, where a similar spike in hospital visits for asthma was found.</p><p>As bad as that sounds, smoke is the lesser evil when compared to extreme heat. </p><p>\"Heat is an immediate risk. Heat kills. Heat kills especially the most vulnerable populations: infants and young children, the elderly, people with less access to services or who live alone, and people who have housing insecurity,\" Hicks said.</p><p>So as much as avoiding the smoke is important, compromises - like opening a window in a stuffy apartment - might be necessary to avoid the heat.</p><p>\"Being too hot with no smoke exposure is riskier than being exposed to smoke at cooler temperatures,\" said Dr. Sarah Henderson, director of environmental health services at the University of British Columbia, in an interview posted online.</p><p>In order to protect yourself from smoke, Hicks recommends staying inside if possible, or minimizing physical activity if you have to be outside. Masks can filter out some toxic particles, but few will protect you completely. She also says keeping indoor spaces clean is important for improving air quality, and investing in a HEPA filter for children's bedrooms has been shown to have health benefits. </p><p>It's both a short-term and a long-term concern, she said.</p><p>\"Wildfires I think didn't use to fall into both categories, and now they do just because we're exposed to the smoke so many more days per year,\" said Hicks.</p><p>\"In the short term we absolutely need to worry about it. And there's lots of good evidence that infants and young children, the elderly, people with heart and lung problems and so on are going to be at increased risk of immediate harms like asthma attacks, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) attacks, strokes, that kind of stuff ... Not to mention that it's miserable to be coughing all day.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2025071576093981</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G8G-5XM3-RRHY-P55K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"713\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.
