People and property do not need to suffer destruction or death, if the powers that be enforce some rules about how people live in the bush. It seems that we need a fuel exclusion zone of some size around all towns, hamlets and houses in fire risk areas.\nThis raises the question: why should the house owners who make the logical decision to live in areas that are not in a non-defendable fuel and forest fire area, pay a royalty on insurance to support all those who don't?\nI think it would make more sense for the government to clear the fuel away and let the people who still wish to live in the bush pay their own way. Thus leaving more money in the pockets of the logical majority.\nRoger Wolfe\nBalwyn, Vic", "FIREFIGHTERS battled on Thursday to douse a series of wildfires fuelled by high winds, scorching temperatures and dry vegetation, which have forced tens of thousands of Californians to flee their homes.\nA blaze scorching sections of the Angeles National Forest, in southern California, two huge infernos in the central part of the state and another fire further north have displaced entire towns.\n\"Our fire activity has definitely picked up in past weeks in number and severity,\" said Daniel Berlant, a spokesman for the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\nThe Angeles forest fire - dubbed \"Blue Cut\" - has devoured 12,545ha and is only 4 per cent contained.\nThe fire has been spreading at such an alarming pace that it appears as if it were \"running at you\", according to Michael Lopez, a spokesman for fire information website Inciweb.\nMore than 82,500 people potentially in Blue Cut's path are under evacuation orders.\nAbout 1600 firefighters are committed to Blue Cut, while 5000 are battling the larger Soberanes fire, which has charred 32,000ha in the Big Sur tourist region, further north.Since the beginning of the year, 4600 fires have ripped through 120,000ha of Californian scrub and forest.", "FIVE rural fire crews and three urban fire crews battled a bushfire which broke out about 2am Monday in the Samford Valley.\nA Department of Community Safety spokesman said the medium-sized (200m x 200m) slow-moving forest fire in bushland at Closeburn, near McDowells Rd and Mt Samson Rd, was no threat to property, but still advised nearby residents to review bushfire survival plans as a precaution.
