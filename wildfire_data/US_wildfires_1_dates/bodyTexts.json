She'll head SFU's Fire and Ecosystems Research Lab, where researchers will study wildfire behaviour and impacts and the conditions that fuel them, including the importance and management of peatlands (bogs, fens and swamps).\n\"The effects of climate change are a contributing factor to this record-breaking wildfire season and now more than ever, there is a need for scientists to work with community partners to understand and mitigate the impacts,\" says Wilkinson. \"The creation of this new Fire and Ecosystems Research Lab responds to the need to study and apply up-to-date knowledge for the protection of our ecosystems and communities.\"\nAs head of SFU's Fire and Ecosystems Research Lab, Wilkinson and her group are developing ecosystem management strategies that reduce the negative impacts fire can have on all aspects of the environment and society.\nShe applies an interdisciplinary approach to her research by incorporating field assessments and experimental fires with remote sensing and ecological modelling to understand the resilience of ecosystems to wildfire.\nHer expertise as a wildfire and ecosystem scientist is timely, given major fire activity across the country, resulting in lost properties and continuous evacuation alerts and orders. The resulting smoke has caused weeks of poor air quality in Canada and the U.S.\nWilkinson's current research includes understanding patterns of wildfire severity and identifying ecological tipping points to high-severity fire in boreal lowlands and mountain pine beetle-attacked forests of western Canada.\nWilkinson, a former NSERC post-doctoral fellow with the University of Toronto's School of Forestry FireLab, is also collaborating with the Canadian Forest Service, Provincial Parks and resource and land managers from various industries. She is responsible for developing a new fuel moisture index for the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System and plans to continue translating academic research findings into actionable management solutions in Canada and internationally.\n* * *\nRecent research:\nOne of her most recent papers, published in Nature, Climate Change finds that wildfires reduce the ability of pristine northern peatlands to store carbon, a greenhouse gas, by 35 per cent and enhance emissions from degraded peatlands by 10 per cent.\nThe study finds that the impacts of climate change will accelerate carbon losses from peatlands, noting that projected increases in burn severity and burn rate will reduce the carbon sink capacity of northern peatlands by up to 65 per cent by 2100.\nHer most recent work, published in Environmental Research highlights the role peatlands play in also storing toxic metals and metalloids such as lead, arsenic, and mercury and risks to human health of wildfires releasing these pollutants into the atmosphere.\nThe study suggests there is an urgent need to focus policy and research on reversing peatland degradation \"that also minimizes future risks for environmental and human health exposure to the toxic environmental legacy held within global peatlands.\"\n* * *\nJOURNAL: Nature Climate Change <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01657-w\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01657-w</url>\n* * *\nOriginal text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/stories/2023/07/wildfire---ecosystem-scientist-leads-new-research-group-at-sfu.html\">https://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/stories/2023/07/wildfire---ecosystem-scientist-leads-new-research-group-at-sfu.html</url>\nCopyright Targeted News Services\nMSTRUCK-8214549 MSTRUCK", "TORONTO \u2014 Canadian wildfires will send worsening smoky air across the country and neighboring United States in coming days after recent heavy rains failed to fall in areas of Quebec where the fires are most active, officials said Wednesday.\nDrifting smoke from the wildfires has lowered curtains of haze on broad swaths of Canada and the United States, pushing into southern Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, and moving into parts of West Virginia.\nCanadian officials say it is the nation\u2019s worst wildfire season ever and they expect air quality to remain a concern through the summer, as long as the fires continue.\nIt started early on drier-than-usual ground and accelerated very quickly, exhausting firefighting resources across the country, fire and environmental officials said.\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada Meteorologist Steven Flisfeder said smoke will migrate across Quebec and Ontario over the next few days, and that air quality will deteriorate as a result.\n\u201cAs long as the fires are burning and the smoke is in the atmosphere it is going to be a concern not just for Canadians but Americans as well,\u201d Flisfeder said.\nFlisfeder said the smoky, hazy skies will persist unless rainfall provides sufficient help to firefighters in controlling the blazes. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the highest amounts of rain were not received in those areas where most active forest fires are,\u201d Flisfeder said.\nThe Detroit area woke up Wednesday to some of the worst air quality in the United States as smoke from Canada\u2019s wildfires settled over most of the Great Lakes region and unhealthy haze spread southward, as far as Missouri and Kentucky.\nMeanwhile, NASA is reporting that smoke from wildfires in northern Quebec has reached Europe.

The associated costs due to required increases in staffing and resources were deferred in the 202123 biennium by a one-time offset of $15 million for both public and private landowners. ODF's 202325 budget, as approved by the state legislature, does not include the offset.\nThe Labor Day wildfires of 2020 demonstrated the state's vulnerability to catastrophic wildfires. In response, the 2021 Legislature passed Senate Bill 762 adding wildfire response capacity and preparedness programs to benefit Oregonians.\nSenate Bill 762 directed the Oregon Department of Forestry to create new programs and increase capacity for adequate protection of public and private forestland and rangeland. The cost for increased capacity is shared between public and private landowners through Forest Patrol Assessments. Private landowner rates are provided to county tax assessors July 1 for inclusion in property tax rolls.\nLandowners pay a per-acre assessment to help fund wildfire suppression. To alleviate the initial financial increase to forest patrol assessments, SB 762, passed by the 2021 Legislature, included a one-time offset in the amount of $15 million. This offset was intended to mitigate a sharp increase from previous landowner rates to the new rates that were created by expansion of wildfire capacity in SB 762.\nAn extension of the landowner offset was considered during the 2023 legislative session. However, the extension ultimately did not make it into ODF's budget. As a result, the fiscal-year 2024 Forest Patrol Assessments will be provided to county assessors for inclusion in county property tax rolls. Those assessments include the increased costs for fire protection required by law, but without the one-time financial assistance for landowners provided in the 202123 biennium.\nIn response, Senator Steiner sent a letter to Republican legislative leadership stating her commitment to seeking solutions to this cost burden for the 2024 legislative session. Click here for that letter. In it, Senator Steiner writes:\n\"After consulting with partners and interests closely involved with these issues, we have committed to convening a workgroup to propose revisions in the assessment and harvest tax structure to better address the cost of grazing and forest fire protection in ways that consider proportionate contributions from various stakeholders.\"\nThis legislative workgroup convened by Senator Steiner, in coordination with the Governor's Office, will work to bring potential landowner rate relief and concepts to restructure wildfire funding to the 2024 Legislature. If landowner offsets are again funded by the 2024 Legislature, it will be applied to fiscal year 2025 Forest Patrol Assessments, reducing the per-acre charge in the second year of the biennium.\nAn updated funding structure is necessary to address the increasing severity of Oregon's wildfires. ODF protects approximately 16.2 million acres of public and private forestland and rangeland, and hotter and dryer climate conditions require ever-increasing demands on wildfire firefighting resources.", "Smoke from Canadian wildfires led to unhealthy air in much of North Dakota on Tuesday.\nAir quality in most of the state including Bismarck-Mandan was rated \"unhealthy\" by the afternoon, with a few areas rated \"unhealthy for sensitive groups,\" according to\u00a0AirNow, a partnership of federal and state agencies including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nNorth Dakota's Department of Environmental Quality on Tuesday advised state residents to consider limiting activities outdoors, and to continue monitoring the air quality the rest of the week. DEQ air sampling data is part of the AirNow partnership.\nThe wildfire season in Canada has been the worst on record. Nearly 6,000 fires this summer have blackened an estimated 38 million acres -- equivalent to about 60,000 square miles. As a comparison, North Dakota comprises about 69,000 square miles. More than 1,000 fires were burning north of the border on Tuesday, with nearly 700 of them considered to be out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.\nThe fires have impacted air quality across North Dakota several times this summer. The latest southward sweep of smoke over the state began late Monday\u00a0and was expected to ease by Tuesday night, according to the National Weather Service. Windy conditions were expected Wednesday, along with showers and potential thunderstorms in the evening impacting western and central North Dakota, forecasters said.\nWildfire smoke is particularly dangerous because it contains tiny particulate matter, the tiniest of pollutants. When inhaled, it can move deep into lung tissue and enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources including the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires. Such smoke has been linked to several health complications including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.\nPeople reacting to smoke to the extent that it affects breathing should seek immediate help from a medical provider, according to DEQ. General health-related smoke questions can be directed to the Health and Human Services Operating Center at 701-328-0707.\nInformation on wildfires and air quality is on the DEQ website, at\u00a0bit.ly/3OhrD7E.

There is a 30% chance of showers Sunday night and Monday.\nNormal high temps for the Labor Day period in the capital city are in the upper 70s, according to weather service data.\nThe latest U.S. Drought Monitor map shows more than half of North Dakota in some form of drought -- double the area three months ago -- with nearly one-third of the state in either moderate or severe drought, up from less than 7% at the end of spring. But Burleigh and Morton counties remain out of any drought category.\nNorth Dakota as a whole has been drying out as summer progresses, however. Topsoil moisture supplies statewide are rated 50% adequate to surplus; 47% of subsoil moisture supplies are in those categories, according to the latest\u00a0crop report\u00a0from the National Agricultural Statistics Service. That compares with 82% and 77%, respectively, at the end of May.\nPasture and range conditions statewide are rated 49% good to excellent, compared with 65% at the beginning of summer.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor is a partnership of NOAA, the National Drought Mitigation Center and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.", "<br/>2023 MAY 26 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Agriculture Daily -- New research on agriculture is the subject of a new report. According to news reporting out of Kastamonu University by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The main purpose of the study is to examine the impact of drastic and proactive forest fire interventions, which are applied to avoid the risk of loss of life and property close to urban areas, on the continuity of plant species with fire-adapted characters and the potential to cause species loss.\" \n<br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Kastamonu University: \"In this context, the basic assumption of the study is that the reduced frequency of fires caused by suppressed fires in natural areas in order to avoid the risk of forest fires that may affect residential areas, will lead to the reduction of various plant species that sustain their lives thanks to their fire-adaptive characters. As a qualitative data analysis method, the rates of urban and forest areas, the number of forest fires, the amount of burned area and plant species diversity data were used to deal with the study data with document analysis. In the selection of the 10 metropolitan cities that constitute the sample area of the study, the criteria of being in the Mediterranean ecosystem, containing plant species adapted to fire, and being metropolitan (where natural and built environment elements are intertwined) were taken as basis.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The study will create an ecological perspective in fire prevention policies and strategies to be developed through the determination of plant species characteristics in large cities located in the fire-prone Mediterranean ecosystem.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Urbanization of Forest Fires: An Evaluation on Metropolitan Forest Fires in The Mediterranean Ecosystem.

Any fires that start may spread rapidly and become difficult to extinguish.\nIn Connecticut, the red flag warning was issued for Hartford, Tolland, and Windham counties. It was also issued for all of Rhode Island, and Massachusetts from the east slopes of the Berkshires east through the remainder of the state, for locations where a snow pack no longer exists.\nConnecticut traditionally experiences high forest fire danger in the Spring from mid-March through May. High winds during this time dry surface fuels and can drive fire to spread quickly.\nWeve had a busy start to the Spring fire season, with several brush fires breaking out around the state in the past few days. DEEP Forestry and Parks staff were called to assist local fire departments on two separate fires yesterday, in Southbury and Meriden. The Southbury fire was about 30 acres in size as of Friday evening. Both fires were contained Friday evening, and DEEP staff have returned to both sites today to monitor conditions and assist local fire personnel as needed.\nDEEP's Division of Forestry constantly monitors the danger of forest fire to help protect Connecticut's 1.8 million acres of forested land. Throughout the Spring forest fire season, DEEP sends daily advisories on forest fire danger levels to DEEP's state park forest field staff, municipalities, fire departments and the media. Forest fire danger levels are classified at low, moderate, high, very high or extreme. In an average year approximately 500 acres of Connecticut woodland are burned by forest fires. You can sign up to receive the daily Forest Fire Danger Report here.\nIts especially important to exercise caution during these periods when forest fire danger levels increase. Its important to obey local laws regarding open fires, carefully dispose of hot charcoal, and completely extinguish smoking materials.

The strike might have been intended for the city's airfield, officials said.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the facilities of aircraft engine manufacturer Motor Sich in the Zaporizhzhia region had also come under attack.\nThe Russian barrage followed a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian tanker in the Black Sea near Crimea late Friday. Ukraine also struck a major Russian port with drones earlier the same day.\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova condemned what she called a Ukrainian \"terrorist attack\" on a civilian vessel in the Kerch Strait.\n\"There can be no justification for such barbaric actions, they will not go unanswered and their authors and perpetrators will inevitably be punished,\" she posted on the Telegram messaging app.\nAn official with Ukraine's Security Service confirmed to The Associated Press that a Ukrainian drone packed with nearly 1,000 pounds of explosives struck the tanker that was transporting fuel for Russian forces. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.\nRussia's Federal Agency for Marine and River Transport posted on Telegram that although the drone blasted a hole in the tanker's engine room, there were no casualties among the 11 crew members. On Sunday, a Ukrainian missile hit the Chonhar bridge connecting the Russian-occupied Kherson region and northern Crimea, causing minor damage to the span's roadway, said Vladimir Saldo, the Moscow-installed leader of the Kherson region. He also said several more rockets had been shot down by air defense forces.\nThe bridge, which is one of three key spans connecting the Crimean Peninsula to the mainland, was previously attacked on July 22 and July 29.\nTwo of the six killed overnight occurred during a Russian airstrike in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, according to the head of the local regional military administration, Oleh Syniehubov. Four others were injured.\nZelenskyy said a guided bomb had hit a blood transfusion center in the area's Kupyan district late on Saturday.\n\"This war crime alone says everything about Russian aggression,\" Zelenskyy wrote on social media. \"Defeating terrorists is a matter of honor for everyone who values life.\"\nHeavy shelling continued along the front line in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv continued its ongoing counteroffensive. Elsewhere in the Kharkiv region, a 58-year-old woman was killed and a 66-year-old man was wounded after Russian shelling of the village of Podoly, an official said. In Ukraine's eastern Kupyan region, Russian missiles injured a 55-year-old man and ignited a forest fire, officials said on social media.

Scott announced today.\nThe fire, known as the \"Way Fire,\" ignited on August 18, 2014, in the community of Wofford Heights in Kern County. The United States alleges that the fire ignited when, as a result of SoCal Edison's negligence, an insulator broke free from its pin on the cross arm of a SoCal Edison power pole, allowing the conductor to come into contact with another conductor.\n\"This settlement goes a long way toward compensating the public for the damage to public lands caused by the fire and the expense of fighting the Way Fire,\" U.S. Attorney Scott said. \"This office will continue to pursue recovery against those whose carelessness results in fires that place public lands and communities at risk and require public funds to suppress.\"\n\"I'm pleased that this issue was resolved in a positive manner for our agency,\" Randy Moore, Regional Forester for the USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region. \"A lot of time and resources go into both fighting fires and cost recovery, and recouping these costs is important.\"\nSince 2012, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California has secured settlements in more than 25 different cases involving wildfire damage to federal lands, with settlements valued at nearly $200 million.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Vincente A. Tennerelli handled the case.\nUpdated February 10, 2020", "ALEXANDRIA, Va., June 1 -- United States Patent no. 11,344,760, issued on May 31, was assigned to FRS Group LLC (Rocklin, Calif.).\n\"Long-term fire retardant with corrosion inhibitors and methods for making and using same\" was invented by Dennis Hulbert (Grass Valley, Calif.), Robert J.

This remote tower can only be reached by a dirt fire road. Visitors are welcome at High Point but are not permitted in the tower.\nBoucher Lookout is a 30-foot wooden tower, located at 5,438 feet in Palomar Mountain State Park. It offers commanding views to the south, west and north to Lake Elsinore. On a clear day, you can see Catalina and San Clemente islands and ships at sea. When operational, the public can visit.\nOn this late July day at High Point, tropical moisture from Mexico was bringing afternoon thunderstorms to the desert and mountains. My quiet summer day had now become tense.\nPerched in the 13-by-13-foot all-steel cab, on top of a 70-foot metal tower on one of our highest mountains, can be an exciting place in the middle of a thunderstorm, especially when the lightning starts dancing.\nAnd it was getting close.\nThe flash of lightning and roar of thunder were seconds apart. The tower was swaying in the wind and now rain was pouring from the metal roof. As a safety measure, I had turned off radios and I was standing on a wooden stool that has glass insulators on the legs that offers protection should lightning strike the tower.\nI was focused on recording the location of down strikes since those locations will be closely watched for smoldering fires that might erupt when things dry out.\nThat's easy to do when a lightning bolt hits several miles away. It's a bit harder when lightning and thunder are simultaneous, meaning it's hitting where you are.\nWhile this was one of the more exciting days in the tower, many lookout shifts are a peaceful, daylong sit-and-see visit with nature.\nA typical day in the tower starts with check-in by radio with the fire dispatch center, taking weather recordings and reviewing previous logs for any important information.\nThroughout the day, however, lookouts are constantly scanning the landscape for any hint of smoke. Early detection is critical so aircraft and fire equipment can be dispatched as quickly as possible.\nLookouts also spend a lot of time watching nature. It's common to see hawks or eagles soaring around the towers, flocks of bluebirds, woodpeckers, or a covey of quail.\nDeer, foxes, bobcats and even a mountain lion may wander past the tower, oblivious to the lookout watching from above.\nThe silence of the forest might be interrupted with a siren salute from a passing law enforcement helicopter, or a wing waggle from firefighting aircraft passing en route to a fire.\nIt's fascinating to watch weather develop through a bird's eye view from the top of a mountain. Tiny clouds on the distant skyline can slowly grow into towering thunderheads, or a rain squall moving in from the coast directed by the whim of the wind.\nLookouts work only during the day, but many will occasionally spend the night at High Point because of the remote access.\nSunrises and sunsets are spectacular, especially early and late in the season when cold and warm weather fronts clash creating layers of clouds, fog and mist.\nOn nights when a marine layer brings in a blanket of valley fog, the heavenly view from the tower is spectacular with a sparkling Milky Way painted on an inky sky, or the occasional bright meteor flash.\nBeing a volunteer fire lookout is mostly a calm and relaxing activity, punctuated by moments of frenzy when  smoke is spotted.\nThat's when you spring into action, using the Osborne fire finder to plot bearing and estimated distance so this information can be radioed to dispatch.\nIn the meantime, lookouts are part of a long tradition of service by people who care about our wild places.\nA day in a fire lookout tower gives you an intimate look at the cycles of weather, plants, birds and wildlife that, in a sense, lookouts are protecting.\nThe Forest Fire Lookout Association is always looking for interested volunteers to work in the towers. Training includes three days of classroom instruction and three shifts in each tower to become certified.\nIf you are interested, visit ffla-sandiego.org.\nMaybe I'll see you in the penthouse.\nCowan is a freelance columnist.

The multi-year project aims to address the unique challenges faced by public and private forested lands in the area, according to Sean Johnson, NRCS District Conservationist in Flathead County. These challenges include wildfire risk, forest health issues, invasive species, habitat fragmentation, and the protection of water resources.\n\"This was a multi-year process of revisions and drafts trying to get this thing off the ground and funded and we were able to do that last year,\" Johnson says, \"and it's really cool to see the whole thing take place.\"\nBy promoting sustainable land management practices under the expert guidance of the NRCS, the partnership helps private landowners contribute to the overall health and ecological integrity of the forested landscapes in the region. All while the Forest Service and other partners work toward the same objectives on public lands.\n\"The goals we share with other land managers is a healthy, resilient forest for multiple uses,\" says Forest Fire Prevention Officer for the Flathead National Forest, Mike West.\nWest previously served as the Assistant Fire Management Officer for Fuel Reduction on the Tally Lake Ranger District of the Flathead. These days, he works closely with his Joint Chief's NRCS counterpart, Johnson, to make a landscape-scale difference by treating forests across land ownerships.\nJoint Chiefs' is a partnership primarily between the NRCS and Forest Service, which are both housed under the USDA, that began in 2014. Other partners on this project include the State of Montana, Flathead County, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and numerous private and public stakeholders.\nThere are currently more than 40 active projects as part of the Joint Chief's program running across the country, with the muti-year project in Flathead National Forest being one of them.\nAccording to West, the Forest Service's relationship with the NRCS began through their local Firesafe Flathead group.\n\"When Sean Johnson got here as the District Conservationist, he actually sought us out as a group, which is a lot of different folks the Forest Service, the County, the State of Montana, NRCS, a bunch of homeowners associations, and different fire departments.\"\nWorking together made a lot of sense, according to West, \"Because there's not only a lot of work to do on the forest itself, but also a lot of public land interest in doing forest health and fuel reduction projects.\"\nImplementing a Landscape-Scale Approach\nOne of the key aspects of the partnership is working with private landowners in the vicinity of public forested lands. The area is characterized by a mix of private and public lands, with many landowners having properties that adjoin or are near the Flathead National Forest. By engaging these private landowners, the partnership can foster a landscape-scale approach to conservation and restoration, ensuring that the benefits extend beyond public lands.\n\"To work across boundaries where you have three or four different private landowners, industry landowners, and the National Forest,\" says West, \"it takes a lot of work and relationships to explain to everybody why it's important to reach a common goal.\"\nWest and the Forest Service bring valuable expertise in forest management and conservation planning to the partnership. Their involvement ensures the restoration efforts align with the goals and objectives of the Flathead National Forest, while also considering the needs and priorities of local communities.\nThe joint efforts of the NRCS and the Forest Service not only aim to restore and conserve forest ecosystems, but also contribute to the overall well-being of the community. Healthy forests provide numerous benefits, including clean air and water, recreational opportunities, and support for local economies through tourism, outdoor activities, and wood products.\nKeeping the Public Safe\nAnother key aspect of the project is public safety. The location of the project being on the west side of the Flathead Valley plays a role in how the Forest Service and NRCS are approaching the project because large fires tend to move from west to east.\n\"Being right here in the wildland urban interface with the prevailing wind direction, these treatments we're doing and connecting all these fuel breaks is very important,\" says West. \"If we have a large fire coming off the National Forest and into the town, it will either allow us a chance to manage the fire or hopefully stop it. Or if not, modify the fire intensity to where we just have a less intense fire coming into where people's home are.\"\nSince the project started, West says they have already connected over 20 miles of fuel breaks across the National Forest and multiple ownerships all in an effort to reduce and mitigate wildfire threats.\n\"Being able to do that work in advance of a wildfire is a lot less stressful and safer because we're not trying to complete that work in a rushed fashion with a fire bearing down on us,\" he says. \"It's a lot easier and safer to do that work on the front end.\"\nWest explains firefighters could find themselves having to deal with 20 to 40 and even 100-foot flame lengths rather than the much more desirable 4-footh lengths achievable by putting in the fuel treatments. Not only is this a better fire behavior to deal with during an event, but also one that leaves much less negative after-effect on the land itself.\nHaving in-place fuel treatments means less chance of tree torching which creates embers that lead to spot fires.\n\"Post-fire we're much more likely to have a healthy, intact, functioning forest environment instead of a stand replacement like a wildfire where we would lose the majority of overstory trees,\" says West.\nImproving the Land and Changing Minds\nJust a year into the project, West, just like Johnson, is already starting to see changes. \"And not just the vegetation that we're managing,\" he says.\nHe points out the amount of interest the work is garnering from more private landowners and other partners is growing and that's a good thing.\n\"When they see the end result of the work, they recognize that 'wow, that does look nice and I do see how that can make a difference',\" he says. \"I think being able to put enough work out there that's square in the public's eye and to be able to tell the story helps a lot because it gets more folks interested in doing other work.\"\nBeyond the local presence, they've caught the attention of policy and decision makers, too.\n\"We've also received Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding in addition to our Joint Chief's allocation which was super helpful,\" says West. Effectively linking two preplanned road constructions through these interconnected fuel breaks has provided firefighters and the public multiple access routes, enhancing safety and accessibility.\nThe project is an example of a collaborative conservation effort that preserves forested lands. By working together, West and Johnson are more effectively addressing wildfires and other forest health issues. Engaging private landowners, they ensure the sustainable management of forested lands and provide benefits like clean air and water, recreation, and economic support.\nMost importantly, the partnership is fostering a resilient natural environment for generations to come with an understanding that fire is inevitable.\n\"Were never going to address a property and remove wildfire from the landscape and totally mitigate against it, Johnson says, \"but by doing treatments like this we can keep it on the ground where it's manageable and the fire crews can get in here and do what they need to do.\"\nJohnson mentions the large catastrophic fires with incredible heat causing destruction that we see taking place more and more across the West.\n\"We're trying to avoid catastrophic fire, but still knowing these species need fire to thrive and to regenerate. It's how they've all adapted over time.\"", "Ian Willms/Getty Images\nSmoke from wildfires in the provinces of Quebec and Nova Scotia is seen on June 28 in Toronto.", "Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press\nThe McDougall Creek wildfire burns on the mountainside in West Kelowna, British Columbia, on Aug.18.\nPremier David Eby meets with Chief James Tomma from the Little Shushwap Lake as he talks about evacuating his home as they tour the Tselletkwe Lodge in Kamloops, British Columbia, Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2023.

According to news reporting originating from Harbin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Crown vertical profiles (CVP) play an essential role in stand biomass and forest fire prediction. Traditionally, due to measurement difficulties, CVP models developed based on a small number of individual trees are not convincing.\" \n<br/> Regional Innovation And Development of The National Natural Science Foundation of China; Special Fund Project For Basic Research in Central Universities; Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Northeast Forestry University: \"Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) provides new insights for researching trees' CVPs. However, there is a limited understanding of the ability to accurately describe CVPs with TLS. In this study, we propose a new approach to automatically extract the crown radius (CR) at different heights and confirm the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed approach with field measurement data from 30 destructively harvested sample trees. We then applied the approach to extract the CR from 283 trees in 6 sample plots to develop a two-level nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model for the CVP. The results of the study showed that the average extraction accuracy of the CR when the proposed approach was applied was 90.12%, with differences in the extraction accuracies at different relative depths into the crown (RDINC) ranges. The TLS-based extracted CR strongly correlated with the field-measured CR, with an R2 of 0.93.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Compared with the base model, the two-level NLME model has significantly improved the prediction accuracy, with Ra2 increasing by 13.8% and RMSE decreasing by 23.46%. All our research has demonstrated that TLS has great potential for accurately extracting CRs, which would provide a novel way to nondestructively measure the crown structure. Moreover, our research lays the foundation for the future development of CVP models using TLS at a regional scale.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Novel Approach to Characterizing Crown Vertical Profile Shapes Using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS).

The Government of Canada is committed to helping Canadians whose lives are affected when emergencies happen, helping communities deal with the realities of increased climate-related risks and disasters, and, ultimately, increasing our resiliency.\nThe Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada, concluded a visit to Manitoba where he met with his counterpart the Honourable Lisa Naylor, Manitoba's Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, and Minister of Consumer Protection and Government Services.\nIn his first of several roundtables, the Minister met with stakeholders and key emergency management partners, including local governments, non-governmental organizations and Indigenous organizations, to discuss lessons learned from recent emergencies, with the goal to collectively better prepare for future events and the range of hazards faced in Canada. While in Winnipeg, he toured Manitoba's Emergency Management Organization Centre and visited the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC), which played a key role in the coordination of this year's historic wildfire season.\nDuring his visit, the Minister also announced five payments totaling $193,720,186 to Manitoba through the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA) program, to assist with response and recovery costs associated with the 2022 spring flood, 2020 June rainstorm, 2019 October storm, 2016 June flood, and the 2014 spring flood.\nThrough these arrangements, the Government of Canada continues to support the province of Manitoba to respond and recover from disasters.\nQuotes\n\"As the effects of climate change increase the frequency of disasters like flooding, we are committed to supporting Canadians, and keeping them safe. These payments will help support the province of Manitoba with their recovery and rebuilding efforts, as we work together to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Prioritizing our resiliency towards recurring extreme weather events will help strengthen our adaptability and our ability to better recover.\"\n- The Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada\n\"Keeping Manitobans safe and responding quickly and effectively to emergencies when they happen is a priority for our government, and partnering with the Federal Government is important to ensure this goal is met. I was pleased to welcome Minister Sajjan to Winnipeg, and I look forward to continue working together on increasingly critical issues such as protecting Manitobans in the context of a changing climate.\"\n- The Honourable Lisa Naylor, Manitoba's Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, Minister of Consumer Protection and Government Services\nQuick facts\n* In Canada, emergencies are managed first at the municipal level and if assistance is needed, the municipality requests it from the province or territory. If the emergency escalates further, provinces or territories can get help from the federal government.\n* In the event of a large-scale disaster, the Government of Canada provides financial assistance through the DFAA program to provinces and territories, at their request, for eligible disaster response and recovery expenses that exceed what they could reasonably be expected to bear on their own. Provincial or territorial governments design, develop and deliver disaster financial assistance, deciding the amounts and types of assistance that will be provided to those who have experienced losses.\n* The DFAA provides assistance when response and recovery costs exceed what individual provinces or territories could be expected to bear on their own. Federal government payments are calculated on a per capita basis and are cost-shared with the province or territory. The amount cost-shared is determined by an established formula of up to 90 percent of the costs of eligible expenses.\n* Eligible expenses under the DFAA include, but are not limited to, evacuation operations, restoring public works and infrastructure to their pre-disaster condition, as well as restoration or replacement of individuals' uninsurable principle dwellings, restoration of small businesses, and farmsteads and mitigation measures to reduce the future vulnerability of repaired or replaced infrastructure.\n* Under the DFAA, provinces and territories have six months following the end of a disaster event to request financial assistance from the federal government. Once an event has been designated under the DFAA, provinces and territories have up to five years to submit their final claim.\n* Following the approval of an Order-in-Council which is required to make payments, in the first 12 months following the end of an event, a province or territory may request in writing advance DFAA payments to address early requirements. These requests must contain supporting documentation, including actual interim expenditures and projected estimates, for review by the federal auditor. Based on this audit review, Public Safety Canada determines the total amount of the advance payments which should not exceed half of the projected federal cost-share.\n* Since the inception of the program in 1970, the DFAA has been a reliable source of support for provinces and territories. As of March 2023, the Government of Canada has provided $7.9 billion in post disaster assistance to help provinces and territories with the costs of response and returning infrastructure and property to pre-disaster condition.\n* Budget 2023 committed $48.1 million over five years, starting in 2023-2024, to identify high-risk flood areas and implement a modernized DFAA program which would incentivize mitigation efforts. This work is being informed by the findings and recommendations of an independent advisory panel and the input of provinces and territories. A modernized program is expected in April 2025.\n* * *\nOriginal text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2023/11/minister-sajjan-reaffirms-support-to-the-province-of-manitoba-to-respond-and-recover-from-disasters.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2023/11/minister-sajjan-reaffirms-support-to-the-province-of-manitoba-to-respond-and-recover-from-disasters.html</url>\nContact: Joanna Kanga, Press Secretary, Office of the President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Joanna.Kanga@kpc-cpr.gc.ca\">Joanna.Kanga@kpc-cpr.gc.ca</email>\nCopyright Targeted News Services\nMSTRUCK-8369782 MSTRUCK", "CUSTER, S.D., Jan. 3 -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture's U.S. Forest Service unit ?

At least 3,500 acres have burned in Canada alone. The fire remains completely uncontained in both countries, according to Washington and Canadian fire officials. \nWind gusts are expected to ease over the area by midweek, which could lend a helping hand to  firefighters.\nThe Eagle Bluff Fire is one in a series of large fires that ignited<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>across the Western US in July. At least 64 large fires are currently burning across nine states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, including the York Fire, which continues to rage in Southern California's Mojave National Preserve. Still uncontained, that<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>fire has already burned 77,000 acres in California and is closing in on the Nevada border. Weather conditions gave firefighters a slight boost on Sunday night as some rainfall moved through the area and helped slow down fire activity.\nThe United States' fire season has been pacing below average in terms of acres burned so far this year. As of July 31, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/nfn\">1.1 million acres have burned across the US </url>in 2023, according to the National Interagency Fire Center<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>- well below the 5.7 million acres that<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>had burned to-date in 2022.\nThe US wildfire season may pick up pace as August arrives. Much of the Pacific Northwest is dry and hot, which is expected to continue through the summer, leaving room for increasingly dry fuels and easy wildfire spread.\nWhile the US wildfire season has started out slow, that is not the case for Canada, which is in the middle of its worst fire season on record.

I knew that Smokey was based on a real bear cub who had been rescued from a forest fire but I knew nothing else about his history until I recently read an article about Capitan, New Mexico.\nAccording to the U.S. Forest Service website on Smokey, the original Smokey Bear was a fictional bear dreamed up as a symbol in 1944 for the Forest Service's campaign on forest fire prevention. However, in 1950, his name was bestowed on a bear cub who was rescued from a forest fire in New Mexico.\nThere were two back-to-back forest fires in early May 1950 in the Capitan Mountains, which are part of the Lincoln National Forest. The first began on May 4th and burned about 1,000 acres before it was brought under control on May 6th. On that same day, however, a second fire, the Capitan Gap fire started and, due to high winds, it quickly raged out of control. On May 9th, firefighters from Taos Pueblo and soldiers from Fort Bliss discovered a tiny North American Black Bear cub who had survived the fire. The soldiers rescued the cub whom they named initially named Hotfoot Teddy. Shortly thereafter they changed his name to Smokey Bear after the fictional character. A New Mexico game warden named Ray Bell realized the cub needed specialized attention and arranged for the cub to be flown to Santa Fe for treatment by veterinarian Dr. Ed Smith.\nAfter recovering, the bear cub was moved to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. According to Timeless Heritage: A History of the Forest Service in the Southwest, 1998, the bear was flown to Washington and met by a company of dignitaries, including Senator Chavez of New Mexico.\nIn 1952, Congress passed a law (ch. 327, 66 Stat. 92) prohibiting the use or manufacture of the character Smokey Bear by unauthorized persons. The law allowed the Secretary of Agriculture to authorize specific persons to use the Smokey Bear character. This law also directed the Secretary to deposit in a special account fees collected from the authorized use of the Smokey Bear character. These fees were to be used \"for furthering the nationwide forest-fire prevention campaign.\"\nIn the meantime, as the living representative of the Smokey Bear campaign, the bear was so popular and received so many letters when he lived at the zoo, that he was issued his own zip code. Smokey lived at the zoo for 26 years until he died in 1976. His body was sent back to Capitan, New Mexico, where it is buried. The New Mexico Energy, Mineral and Natural Resources Department now operates a park that houses his body and hosts exhibits focusing on forest health and fire ecology. However, as a symbol, Smokey Bear lives on and in 2019 celebrated his 75th birthday as the symbol of forest fire prevention.\nA final note on the name Smokey Bear versus \"Smokey the Bear.\" According to the New Mexico Smokey Bear Historic Park website, a \"the\" was added to Smokey's name when a song was written about the bear so the lyrics would match the melody.", "The following information was released by Michigan State University:\nAssociate Professor in the Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering and Civil and Environmental Engineering departments chosen for important role\nAssociate Professor Narendra N. Das of the Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering and Civil and Environmental Engineering departments has been selected as a Science Team member of the prestigious NISAR mission of NASA.\nThis NASA mission is in developmental stage and is scheduled to be launched in January 2024.

The two countries share seven international border gates, and six main border gates./.", "By: Clarence Ndabahwerize, Staff Writer\u00a0\nPart of the Vancouver Latin American Film Festival, Mart\u00edn Heredia Troncoso's Bajo la corteza (Under Bark) begins with a raging forest fire in the Argentine province of C\u00f3rdoba. We meet C\u00e9sar, a humble man out of work, moving rapidly to join the efforts to assist in its extinguishment. The sirens are ever present as a reminder of the danger the fires pose to the community around him.\u00a0\nLand acquisition, from the beginning of time, has been a matter of contention and frustration. Troncoso's film presents us with a perspective not commonly portrayed; someone willing to get their hands dirty for, in their view, noble reasons. C\u00e9sar's sister Mabel, struggles with an illness that will leave her out of work, and serves as the reason C\u00e9sar goes down a dark path. The family's economic situation, coupled with this curveball, is the straw that breaks the camel's back. Fragility is key here: C\u00e9sar's economic fragility, and the fragility of his sister's health.\u00a0\nAfter seeking employment at a job placement centre, C\u00e9sar finds H\u00e9ctor, a real estate developer, seeking to extend his frontier into protected land. C\u00e9sar works with his nephew to clear and fence H\u00e9ctor's land, showing him the ropes of how to properly burn incendiary twigs. At a gathering, H\u00e9ctor is accused of land grabbing. He defends his employer, showing he's willing to get physical on his behalf.\nTowards the end of Bajo la corteza, we see C\u00e9sar start a forest fire at H\u00e9ctor's behest. The costs of his actions are revealed through radio snippets featuring community members lamenting the loss of their homes, and clips of the destruction the blaze wreaks upon the landscape. The film's debut on local and international stages followed the 2022 Corrientes wildfires in Argentina.\nC\u00e9sar himself revisits the charred land he set fire to. Perpetrators are smart to avoid returning to the scene of their crime, but C\u00e9sar isn't a criminal and clearly has a conscience. His actions put him at great odds with himself, and later with Mabel, who pieces together what he has done. She rejects the money he brings to her. The final act of the film is a lesson in teaching the art of deduction as this chain of events is more implicit than explicit.\u00a0\nLocal film buffs are familiar with The Cinematheque and it delivered a brilliant experience, as should be expected of the venue. Troncoso's film was in good hands and lived up to the expectations set by many other great motion pictures that graced that screen. With its long takes, neorealist characteristics and pertinent storyline, Bajo la corteza is a reminder that the most unexpected situations and people can have a profound effect on our environment and communities.\u00a0", "Forests, a scholarly journal of forestry and forest ecology, published research articles on the following topics in its September 2023 edition (Vol. 14, Issue 9):\n* A 3D Lidar SLAM System Based on Semantic Segmentation for Rubber-Tapping Robot\n* A 900-Year Isotopic Proxy Rainfall Record from Northeastern Botswana\n* A Denoising Scheme for Scanned Wood Grain Images via Adaptive Color Substitution\n* A General Rule-Based Framework for Generating Alternatives for Forest Ecosystem Management Decision Support Systems\n* A Method for Extracting the Tree Feature Parameters of Populus tomentosa in the Leafy Stage\n* Aboveground Biomass Mapping and Fire Potential Severity Assessment: A Case Study for Eucalypts and Shrubland Areas in the Central Inland Region of Portugal\n* Accessibility Improvement and Renewal of Urban Park Green Space for the Elderly and the Disabled\n* Accuracy Assessment of Drone Real-Time Open Burning Imagery Detection for Early Wildfire Surveillance\n* Allometric Model of Crown Length for Pinus sylvestris L.

Mr. Srettha Thavisin, Prime Minister, paid an official visit to the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) at the invitation of H.E. Mr. Sonexay Siphandone, Prime Minister of the Lao PDR.\nThe official visit reflected the special relationship between Thailand and the Lao PDR as neighbours that enjoy cultural similarities and close bonds at the people level. The visit also emphasized the importance of the Strategic Partnership for Growth and Sustainable Development between the two countries.\nIn addition to the bilateral discussion with the Prime Minister of the Lao PDR, the Thai Prime Minister paid a courtesy call on H.E. Mr. Thongloun Sisoulith, President of the Lao PDR and General Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, and met with H.E. Mr. Xaysompone Phomvihane, President of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR.\nIn these meetings, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to working closely to advance their bilateral cooperation in all dimensions. There would be regular exchange of high-level visits between the two countries, and both sides will strengthen cooperation in security, economic, development, and people aspects.\nOn economic cooperation, both sides will strive to achieve the bilateral trade target of 11 billion US dollars by 2025 through various measures, such as better trade facilitation, expansion of cross-border networks of SMEs, and promotion of economic activities between border provinces of both countries.\nBoth sides agreed to expedite the process to start the construction of a new railway bridge over Mekong River at Nong KhaiVientiane border crossing as early as possible by 2026 to support the cross-border rail freight growth between ThailandLaos China.\nDuring this visit, the two Prime Ministers presided over the opening ceremony of the Vientiane Train Station (Khamsavath), which is a cooperation project between the two Governments, through Thailands Neighbouring Countries Economic Development Cooperation Agency (NEDA), to better connect the two countries rail systems. The inaugural train service from Nong Khai station to the newly built Vientiane (Khamsavath) Station in inner Vientiane will start in 2024 to promote more cross-border tourism.\nBoth sides were pleased with the progress of the construction of the 5th ThaiLao Friendship Bridge (Bueng Kan Bolikhamxai), which is now almost 90 percent completed. The construction is expected to be completed and the bridge will be opened in the near future.\nThey looked forward to more projects in the pipeline to enhance better connectivity between the two countries and the region, including the construction of the 6th ThaiLao Friendship Bridge (Ubon Ratchathani - Salavan) and the improvement of the National Road No. 12 (R12) from ThaiLao border at Nakhon Phanom Thakek to LaoViet Nam border at Na Phao Cha Lo.\nOn transportation and logistics, both sides will work together to increase the efficiency of road and rail transshipment to boost bilateral and regional trade. Both sides will also expedite the establishment of Common Control Areas (CCA) to reduce customs procedures for cross-border transportation at the 2nd ThaiLao Friendship Bridge (Mukdahan Savannakhet), which is a major transport route between ThailandLaosViet Nam.\nOn tourism, both sides will conclude a Joint Plan of Action to promote cross-border tourism and make joint activities to attract tourists, in conjunction with the 2024 Visit Laos Year.\nSecurity agencies of the two countries will cooperate closely to maintain peace and stability along the border, and effectively tackle transnational crimes, especially drug trafficking and online scams.

Thailand will support the development of Lao PDRs fire risk map and capacity building programmes on the control of forest fire and crop burning.\nThe Lao side expressed appreciation for Thailands continued development cooperation in a wide range of areas, which have contributed to the uplifting of peoples livelihood as well as the bond of friendship between the peoples of the two countries.\nBoth sides took the opportunity to exchange views on international and regional issues of mutual interest and concern. The Thai Prime Minister expressed his confidence and full support for the Lao PDRs ASEAN Chairmanship in 2024. Thailand and Lao PDR will cooperate closely to strengthen ASEAN unity and cohesiveness, and maintain ASEANs central role in maintaining regional peace, stability and development amidst international uncertainties.\nAfter their bilateral discussion, the two Prime Ministers presided over the handover ceremonies and witnessed the signing of documents as follows:\n(1) Handover of the Learning Centre for the Development of Sustainable Agriculture based on the Application of Sufficiency Economy Philosophy at the Attapeu Integrated Vocational Education and Technical School;\n(2) Handover of the Friendship Arboretum in Commemoration of the 70th Anniversary of ThaiLao Diplomatic Relations;\n(3) Signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cultural Exchange between the Ministry of Culture of Thailand and the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism of the Lao PDR; and\n(4) Signing of the Record of Discussion between NEDA and the Lao National Railway for Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for Locomotive Driving and Ticketing System and Development of a Business Model for the Lao National Railway.", "KEITH ROBERTSON Group vice president, supply chain management, Toyota Motor North America\nBeing in charge of automotive supply chain management over the last year has been a lot like trying to fight a raging forest fire with nothing more than a watering can and a garden trowel. Yet in the middle of this unprecedented conflagration, a system created by Keith Robertson and his team at Toyota is helping supply-strapped dealerships closely monitor where their ordered vehicles are in the delivery pipeline.\nThe system's automatic updates allow dealerships to better communicate with their customers about when their ordered vehicles will actually be arriving at the store - turning a bright light on what had been an informational black hole between factory door and dealership driveway. Perhaps the best thing about what has come to be known as Toyota's Project ETA is the fact that Robertson and his team were able to create it from whole cloth because they thought it might come in handy as inventories tightened and direct consumer ordering increased.\nRobertson, 53, has been with Toyota since joining its massive Georgetown Assembly Plant in 1993 and has held a variety of executive roles over the years. He was appointed to his current position in 2020 and also serves as president of Toyota Logistics Services.", "The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management issued the following news release:\nThe Department of Environmental Management (DEM) is announcing that depending on weather and wind conditions, it plans on conducting low-severity prescribed burns on state lands in Exeter and Coventry and on Prudence Island starting sometime in the last two weeks of March or the first week of April, excluding weekends. DEM will advise the public again several days before it has identified a more reliable \"burn window\" in which to conduct a prescribed fire operation. The agency will further notify Rhode Islanders by timely social media posts and distributing flyers to abutting landowners and neighbors.\nA burn window refers to when the environmental variables such as fuel moisture and weather conditions are balanced so that the fire will accomplish its goals, which include reducing fuels (i.e., combustible materials on forest floors and in grasslands), modifying wildlife habitat, and restoring ecological function while remaining under control. One of the biggest factors in determining a burn window is forecasting the weather. Whereas a 10-day forecast is accurate about only half the time, a five-day forecast can accurately predict the weather around 90% of the time, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nWind is an equally critical factor. DEM's \"go/no-go\" decision on which of the burns to conduct will likely come down to wind speed and direction, to allow for the optimal dispersal of smoke. At this point in their preparations for a busy burn season, however, DEM burn managers are targeting parcels at Pratt Farm in the Arcadia Management Area, located on the Exeter-Richmond line, as the location of the first prescribed burn in 2023.\n\"Pratt Farm and the surrounding forestland is a fire-adapted ecosystem that depends on the use of prescribed fire to maintain healthy vegetation and wildlife habitats,\" said Forest Fire Program Manager Pat MacMeekin. \"The project at Pratt Farm will be the start of our prescribed fire season this spring. We plan to conduct burning here and at other DEM properties across the state throughout the spring and fall.\" MacMeekin described the Pratt Farm fire - which will target one or more parcels at the DEM-run management area - as \"a grassland burn, with the goal of removing the grass thatch layer, to open and release the seedbank and promote native, warm season grasses such as little bluestem and big bluestem.\"\nCurrently, the grasslands at the site are recently converted hayfields whose grasses are mostly nonnative and cool season species. Also, pitch pine saplings are scattered throughout the field site. Pitch pine refers to the high resin content of this important native tree's knotty wood. It thrives on dry rocky soil that other trees cannot tolerate. \"The application of consistent, prescribed fire will help to restore the fields to native grasses and pitch pine barrens. Pitch pine barrens are especially important habitats for moths, leafhoppers, pollinators, box turtles, Northern black racers, and whip-poor-wills, Eastern towhees, and several songbirds,\" MacMeekin said.\nLast month DEM announced it was planning more prescribed fires in 2023 for the reasons stated above and to reduce the risk of unplanned, high-severity, destructive wildfires. In 2022, which was marked by a severe drought that the state only now is recovering from, Rhode Island experienced more than 80 wildland fires. Parched conditions forced DEM to ban outdoor fires at all state campgrounds, parks, and management areas for a two-week period in August.\nBy increasing its use of prescribed fire, Rhode Island will be better aligning its land management policies and practices with neighboring states. From 2018 to 2022, Massachusetts ignited 223 prescribed fires totaling 7,148 acres and Connecticut had 18 prescribed fires totaling 300 acres. In the same five-year period, Rhode Island conducted three prescribed fires totaling around 75 acres. Among other benefits, common ecological restoration goals with other states help to strengthen climate change resilience across southern New England.\nExperts from DEM's Forest Fire Program, a subsidiary of the Division of Agriculture and Forest Environment, will lead the prescribed burns. They will employ detailed operational and safety plans. Planning is critical for every burn. A prescribed burn plan developed by a qualified burn boss must be in place before a burn is conducted. Firebreaks and other site preparations are made. Fire behavior, fuels, and weather are monitored throughout the burn, and if the prescription parameters are exceeded, the fire is shut down. The burn is carried out by a skilled crew under the direction of a qualified burn boss. DEM burn managers have obtained the required local permits and an exemption from state air pollution control regulation Part 4: Open Fires (250-RICR-120-05-4). Managers also have communicated with the Exeter No. 2 Fire Chief, Hope Valley-Wyoming Fire Chief, Rhode Island Southern Firefighters League, US Fish and Wildlife Service, the DEM Division of Fish &amp; Wildlife, and the DEM Office of Air Resources.\n* * *\nOriginal text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ri.gov/press/view/45357\">https://www.ri.gov/press/view/45357</url>\nCopyright Targeted News Services\nMSTRUCK-8102668 MSTRUCK", "The New Mexico Wildlife Federation issued the following news on Dec. 14, 2023:\nBy Ben Neary, NMWF Conservation Director\nResidents of the town of Kingston used a road to access the Aldo Leopold Wilderness for decades without permission before landowners blocked it with a locked gate early this year, residents testified at a court hearing Dec. 13.\nThe New Mexico Wildlife Federation and the Percha Creek Association - a group of area residents - are pressing a lawsuit seeking to force landowners Mark and Ruth Bennett to remove the gate.\nAt the end of a day-long hearing in Truth or Consequences, Judge Shannon Murdock said she intends to issue a written ruling next week on the request from the NMWF and the residents for an order requiring the Bennetts to remove the gate immediately while the lawsuit proceeds.\nThe Percha Creek Association and the NMWF were represented by Santa Fe lawyers Gene Gallegos and Las Cruces lawyer David Baake. The Bennetts were represented by lawyer William L. Lutz of Las Cruces.\nGallegos and Baake argued that it's clear the public has established a prescriptive easement over private lands owned by the Bennetts and others and that the public has the right to continue to use the road. In order to establish a prescriptive easement, they said the public has to have used the road openly, without asking permission from any private landowners, for more than 10 years.\nThe road extends westerly 2.9 miles from the end of Main Street in the town of Kingston to the entry of the Aldo Leopold Wilderness portion of the Gila National Forest. The road leads up the canyon that holds Percha Creek to a trailhead on the Ladrone Gulch Trail, that allows access into the Black Range and the Aldo Leopold Wilderness for hikers or horseback riders.\nThe road has long been delineated on U.S. Forest Service maps as Forest Road 40E. For years, there's been a USFS sign at the base of the road that states, \"Private Property. Please Stay on Roadway for Next 1 Mile. Forest Road 40E Open to Public.\"\nAssociation member Chuck Heard, of Twenty-Nine Palms, Calif., testified his family has been in the Kingston area since the 1920s and still owns property there. He said his fondest childhood memories center on times spent in the canyon with his brothers and other family members.\n\"Early 1960s, we were up there all the time,\" Heard said. \"That was some of the best times of my childhood, going up there with my grandfather.\"\nHeard said his family never asked anyone for permission to use the road. Now 69 years old, he showed a photograph of himself as a toddler standing at the end of the road in the trailhead area.\nAfter military service, Heard said he returned to the area and worked for a time for the Forest Service in the Black Range Ranger District. He said he did road maintenance on the road for the agency. \"We'd make sure the road was clear so vehicles could drive by,\" he said.\nOther area residents testified that they, too, had used the road for decades without ever asking for permission.\nDeborah Brandt of Las Cruces, a registered nurse and professional herbalist, testified that she owns a residence in Kingston where she stays regularly. She said has used the road since 1996. She said she commonly took field trips up the road to show others the medicinal use of rare plants that grow in the canyon.\nSteve Morgan, a resident of Kingston since 2007 and a retired landscape architect, said he worked with the Forest Service to address runoff issues on the road following a large forest fire in 2013.\n\"Since the mining days in the 1880s and 1890s, the road has been used,\" Morgan said. He said he and his wife commonly walked their dog on the road without asking for permission before the Bennetts closed it.\nBefore the Bennetts installed their gate, it was a 15-minute walk to access the trailhead, Morgan said. He said the sides of the canyon are steep and rugged and said there's almost no other way to access the trailhead with the road closed. He said reaching it from Kingston now would require a seven-hour trip through the mountains around the private parcels and that anyone using horses or needing handicapped access couldn't reach it.\nJesse Deubel, executive director of the NMWF, testified that the organization represents the interests of New Mexicans including hunters and anglers in accessing and protecting public lands and wildlife.\n\"It's very important to us to ensure that the public retains access to the public lands that belong to all New Mexicans,\" Deubel said. The NMWF was founded by Aldo Leopold in 1914..\nUnder questioning of Lutz, Bennett said he bought his roughly 20-acre parcel that is crossed by Forest Road 40E in 2022 and installed his gate across it early this year because he was concerned about people stealing firewood from his land and otherwise trespassing. He said the road crosses his property for less than a third of a mile.\nBefore installing the gate, Bennett said he put up no-trespassing signs on both sides of the road where it crossed his property, \"because we were concerned with problems with people going off the road.\"\nBennett testified he doesn't live on the property where he installed the gate, but intends to build a cabin on his land in the area. He said there's only one place on his property where he could build, but said it's close to the road. \"Obviously, we don't want people we don't know going by our front door twenty-four-seven,\" he said.\nUnder questioning by Gallegos, Bennett said he has handed out keys to the gate to 12 friends.\nGallegos asked Bennett that if a family came from Socorro that wanted to go up Forest Road 40E to reach the trailhead, \"They can't go enjoy that road because they're not your friends?\"\nBennett responded that there are other roads into the national forest. He said the hypothetical family wasn't there when he and his wife worked hard for 40 years to earn the money to buy the property. He testified that he's a retired industrial designer, and that he worked in Texas for a subsidiary of EDS - an information technology and services company founded by Ross Perot.\nBennett said he had driven up the road before he purchased the property without asking permission from any landowners.\n\"The road across our property is not Forest Road 40E,\" Bennett told Gallegos. \"They (the Forest Service) don't have an easement and they're never going to have an easement.\"\nGallegos asked Bennett, \"You agree that by your placing of that gate, the public cannot travel that road to reach the Aldo Leopold Wilderness?\"\nBennett responded, \"Yes.\"\n* * *\nOriginal text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nmwildlife.org/kingston-residents-testify-they-used-forest-road-40e-for-decades-before-landowners-closed-it-this-year\">https://nmwildlife.org/kingston-residents-testify-they-used-forest-road-40e-for-decades-before-landowners-closed-it-this-year</url>/\n[Category: Environment]\nCopyright Targeted News Services\nMSTRUCK-8416703 MSTRUCK", "The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

This comes in addition to more than 200 firefighters and technical equipment from Bulgaria, Finland, France, Germany, Romania and Norway that will be positioned in Greece to allow for immediate support to national first responders throughout the wildfire season.\n* * *\nBackground\nThe EU ensures a coordinated approach to preventing, preparing and responding to forest fires. When the scale of a forest fire overwhelms the response capabilities of a country, it can request assistance via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. Once activated, the EU's Emergency Response Coordination Centre coordinates and finances assistance made available by EU Member States and six additional Participating States. In addition, the EU has created the European Civil Protection Pool to have a critical number of readily available civil protection capacities allowing for a stronger and coherent collective response. Should the emergency require more life-saving assistance, the Commission activates its rescEU firefighting fleet to confront disasters in Europe. The EU's Copernicus emergency satellite mapping service complements operations with detailed information from space.\n* * *\nFor More Information\nForest Fires (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what-we-do/civil-protection/forest-fires_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what-we-do/civil-protection/forest-fires_en</url>)\nrescEU (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/resceu_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/resceu_en</url>)\nEU Civil Protection Mechanism (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en</url>)\nEuropean Civil Protection Pool (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/european-civil-protection-pool_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/european-civil-protection-pool_en</url>)\nEmergency Response Coordination Centre (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/emergency-response-coordination-centre-ercc_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/emergency-response-coordination-centre-ercc_en</url>)\n* * *\nOriginal text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_3719\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_3719</url>\nCopyright Targeted News Services\nT40-MgEditor-7865847 T40-MgEditor", "The following information was released by the State of Rhode Island:\nThe Department of Environmental Management (DEM) is announcing that depending on weather and wind conditions, it plans on conducting low-severity prescribed burns on state lands in Exeter and Coventry and on Prudence Island starting sometime in the last two weeks of March or the first week of April, excluding weekends.

Peeler and other UM researchers have studied where to optimize ongoing wildfire mitigation efforts and reduce carbon loss due to wildfire, benefitting communities and climate at the same time.\nDuring a wildfire, most carbon loss occurs when litter, duff and downed woody material is consumed by the fire. But over time trees killed during a fire decompose, producing another source of carbon loss. The study identifies locations where communities and agencies can consider implementing proactive forest management to reduce negative impacts from wildfires, including carbon loss.\nPeeler's study recently was published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. It highlights widespread \"opportunity hot spots\" in the western U.S. for using proactive forest management - such as forest thinning, prescribed fire and cultural burning - to reduce the risk of losing carbon to future wildfires.\nThe study is a collaboration among UM, The Nature Conservancy and the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers evaluated where living trees and the carbon they store are at risk of burning in the future. They then compared these areas to areas highlighted in the Forest Service's Wildfire Crisis Strategy, identifying where human communities are most vulnerable to wildfire. Areas of overlap highlight \"opportunity hot spots\" where action can reduce the risk from wildfire to both carbon and communities.\n\"Our approach can help land management agencies plan where to invest in proactive forest treatments that simultaneously reduce wildfire-caused carbon loss and protect communities from wildfire,\" Peeler said. \"It also could be applied to reduce risk from wildfire to other important values such as municipal water, culturally important plants, recreation and wildlife habitat.\"\nCongress recently passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which includes a \"wildfire crisis strategy\" to dramatically increase the pace of forest restoration across the West. The plan includes unprecedented levels of funding ($3 billion dollars) from the federal government to reduce fuels in fire-adapted forests across 50 million acres in the next 10 years, which is at least two times more than current rates.\n\"As a fire ecologist, it's an exciting time working on this topic, with billions of dollars dedicated to proactive forest treatments in the western U.S.,\" Peeler said. \"It's a historic chance for science to drive where this money will be delegated.\"\nA big objective of the project was to prioritize where treatments would get the biggest bang for the buck in terms of carbon.\nProactive forest management can reduce the number of trees killed in wildfires by reducing excess fuels, reducing the negative impacts of a century of fire suppression and global warming. It also can keep more living trees on the landscape after wildfire, where they continue to capture and store carbon from the atmosphere and provide seeds for future forests.\n\"The message we want to emphasize is that we don't have to choose between people and climate when we decide where we want to prioritize spending this money,\" Peeler said.\nThe Conversation published an article by Peeler on this topic. The Nature Conservancy also published a news release on protecting communities and carbon from forest fires.\n* * *\nJOURNAL: Environmental Research Letters <url normalizedValue=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acf05a\">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acf05a</url>\n* * *\nOriginal text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.umt.edu/news/2023/09/090823fire.php\">https://www.umt.edu/news/2023/09/090823fire.php</url>\nContact: Jamie Peeler, postdoctoral research fellow, W.A.

The decision was based on numerous factors, including the fire's location near the national forest boundary and prioritizing plans for prescribed fire in the nearby Montoya Unit.\nThe Medio Fire was caused by lightning and first reported on May 13. The fire crept on the forest floor, consuming fuels like pine needles, brush and fallen branches over a quarter-acre.

The court in Valparaiso ruled the two men, who were arrested Friday, could be held for 180 days while they are investigated. The chief prosecutor in the case, Osvaldo Ossand\u00c3\u00b3n, told journalists that the main suspect is Francisco Mondaca, a 22-year-old volunteer firefighter in Valparaiso who is accused of physically starting the fire. \nHe said flares and fireworks were found in Mondaca's vehicle. The other suspect was identified as Franco Pinto, a former employee of the National Forest Corp. He is accused of planning the crime. The regional prosecutor for Valparaiso, Claudia Perivancich, said investigators have evidence the two men agreed \"in advance to carry out conduct of this type when the weather conditions were adequate.\" Prosecutors said that according to Mondaca's testimony, there was an economic motive behind the plot - providing more work in fighting fires. They said they had not ruled out the possibility of more people being involved. The commander of the Valparaiso Fire Department, Vicente Maggiolo, said, \"We are very dismayed by the situation.\" Maggiolo called it an isolated incident and said it should not tarnish the work of the fire department. \"We have been saving lives for more than 170 years,\" he told TVN. Christian Little, executive director of the forestry department, described the detention of a former official as \"a pain\" for the agency. Both the fire department and forestry agency said they would tighten hiring procedures. The megafire began Feb. 2 in the Lago Pe\u00c3\u00b1uelas nature reserve, in the central region of Chile, and for several days burned several communes, including destroying more than 10,000 homes. It is considered Chile's worst tragedy since a magnitude 8.8 earthquake killed more than 500 people on Feb. 27, 2010.", "<br/>2022 DEC 07 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Computer News Today -- Researchers detail new data in Environment - Environmental Modelling and Software. According to news reporting out of Rio Negro, Argentina, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Fire propagation is a big concern all over the world. Visualization is a valuable tool to test possible different scenarios for fire spread, specially for designing strategies for fire control, mitigation and management.\" \n<br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from National University, \"We present a parallel High-Performance Computing (HPC) forest fire simulator with an interactive and intuitive user interface that offers several functionalities to the user. The visualization interface allows to choose the propagation model of preference, the scenario of interest, as well as numerous simulation features including firebreaks and ignition points. We show some of the outputs for two different mathematical models for fire spreading. The simulator was developed with an open source philosophy in the framework of Faster Than Real Time (FTRT) applications thinking on its possible use in the field during a forest fire propagation.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"It can be run in Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows Operating Systems and for portability purposes the simulator was also implemented on a NVIDIA Jetson Nano.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Visualization and Modeling of Forest Fire Propagation In Patagonia.

Listen to it  <url normalizedValue=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily-blast-with-greg-sargent/id1728152109\">here </url>.</emphasis>\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Sargent: </emphasis>This is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Daily Blast </emphasis>from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New Repub</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">lic, </emphasis>produced and presented by the DSR network. I\u2019m your host, Greg Sargent.\n\u200aWith wildfires raging out of control in Los Angeles, Donald Trump unleashed some truly ugly and hateful attacks on California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom. This might seem like Trump being Trump, and a lot of reporters will treat it that way. But we think there\u2019s another way to look at this. It\u2019s yet another example of how the right wing, particularly in the MAGA era, seeks to thoroughly degrade public life in every conceivable way it can and looks for every way it can find to turn Americans against each other at the most critical moments.\nToday, we\u2019re super excited to be talking about all this with Nicole Hemmer, who\u2019s one of the best historians of the right wing out there today. She\u2019s the author of a number of books, most recently <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Partisans-Conservative-Revolutionaries-American-Politics/dp/1541646886\">Partisans </url>,</emphasis> which traces today\u2019s moment back to the 1990s. Nicole, thanks so much for coming on.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nicole Hemmer: </emphasis>Thanks so much for having me, Greg.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>The wildfires in California, they\u2019re just a horror. Thousands are fleeing, at least two are dead as of now. But Trump attacked the governor as Gavin \u201cNewscum,\u201d blaming the fires on the incompetence of the Biden-Newscum duo, as he put it. Trump said Biden was leaving him no money in FEMA and blamed the lack of water to fight the fires on California environmental policy, which Newsom\u2019s office immediately shot down as pure fiction.<br/><br/>In fact, Newsom has poured huge amounts of money into firefighting and forest management. What\u2019s your immediate reaction to this from Trump?\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>It definitely is the case that this is something Trump does, right? He takes these moments, moments that used to be a time when people began to come together a little bit, at least in that period of immediate disaster when there\u2019s shock and horror ... You and I grew up in a period where we had the Oklahoma City bombing, the Columbine shootings, so many different natural disasters. And they have been these moments when people found a kind of common humanity. I don\u2019t want to paint too rosy a picture of it, but I do think that there\u2019s something substantially different about entering that moment and saying, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Actually, the person responsible for your problems are my political enemies,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and instead of focusing on rebuilding, you should focus on hating them.</emphasis>\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>Yeah. I want to try to understand this as a full-on right-wing MAGA effort to degrade public life. Everything is about seizing on every opportunity to s Spread deranged conspiracy theories, turn people against each other. When the flooding in North Carolina happened during the campaign, for instance, remember Trump and MAGA pushed all kinds of lies about the disaster response. When Trump was president during Covid, he used it to attack blue state governors and blame them.<br/><br/>Can you talk about this impulse as a kind of broader phenomenon of the right wing today?\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>You have this desire to metastasize disasters, to make them worse than they actually are. It does strike me as something novel about the right, certainly within the last 15 years. I think it goes back a little bit further because I\u2019m a historian and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to say, but there is something that is a combination of the malignancy of Donald Trump himself, who is constantly seeking ways to be in the headlines, the media environment in which we live that really favors this outrage and negative emotion, and a conservative media ecosystem that takes that revved up let\u2019s-make-everybody-angry dynamic and applies it directly to electoral politics.\nAll those things come together in order to turn everything that happens into an opportunity for a fight and into an opportunity to make everyone feel worse than they already felt. And that I think is It gets to the heart of what you\u2019re saying about the degradation of public life, that everything just feels worse all the time.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>You wrote a book about the right wing media, called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Messengers-Right-Conservative-Transformation-American/dp/0812248392\">Messengers of the Right </url>,</emphasis> that gets into the whole history of its evolution, gets at some of its darker impulses over the years. I think you\u2019re getting at something critical here when you say there\u2019s a bit of a different thing going on, and I wonder if technological change is part of it.<br/><br/>Elon Musk is right now fanning the flames of hate around the California stuff. He essentially bought Twitter to elevate and expand and spread deranged right wing conspiracy theories, to make it a space for that. Does that make things worse? Is that something new? Is that part of what we\u2019re seeing now?\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>It\u2019s like we\u2019ve reached the apotheosis or like the height of all of these different trends with both Donald Trump and Elon Musk. We certainly could go back and we could look at conservative media, which has for decades really been a site of conspiracy theorizing and partisan attacks. That\u2019s not anything that\u2019s new. But its combination with electoral politics is something that really started to come of age in the \u201990s, and then you layer on top of it this not just anger but a kind of meanness that has become the overarching emotional scale or the emotional tenor of right-wing media. It used to be you would have to turn on Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck in order to access that, and now you just have to listen to a Republican politician and you\u2019re going to get uncut, unmediated conspiracy theories and cruelty.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>It\u2019s really interesting that you say that, because for a time during the talk radio era, it was a separate space. I can recall a time when older people who were seeking refuge from the modern world would turn on right-wing talk radio, and it seemed like a separate realm. And yet now the idea of a separate realm is gone; it\u2019s all sort of merged together. All these Republican politicians are constantly tweeting out the most sick memes that you can imagine. Has there been an erosion where the private spaces or the separate spaces where this once resided are now gone? It\u2019s all one?\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>It is all one big mass, and all one big mess. It is an erosion that\u2019s been happening over time.<br/><br/>I really would root this in the 1990s when the lines between politics and entertainment began to erode, and also when Republican politicians really began to take their cues from right-wing media. I think about the suicide events, Vince Foster in 1993, and the conspiracy theories around his suicide, this idea that the Clintons had him murdered.<br/><br/>This was extremely popular in right-wing media, but it very quickly jumps over into Republican politicians. You had one member of Congress, Dan Coats, who talked on the floor about going into his backyard, getting a melon and a handgun and proving, he said, that Vince Foster couldn\u2019t have shot himself, that it had to be a murder. That almost right-wing radio cosplay is happening in the \u201990s. And now we see it not just in a one-off representative from Indiana, but in almost the entirety of the Republican caucus. That\u2019s what feels different: that erosion of any separate sphere for some of the craziness, that it has infected the entire party. It\u2019s also infected all of us.We can\u2019t escape from it either.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>The use of these moments to degrade public life and make people dumber also has a history. You write about Pat Robertson in your book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=partisans+by+nicole+hemmer&amp;hvadid=616116387117&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9007733&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=2275958424626288384&amp;hvtargid=kwd-1727416287532&amp;hydadcr=22566_13531289&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;ref=pd_sl_2ban64dhou_e\">Partisans </url></emphasis>. He seized on natural disasters to cast them as punishment for social liberalism. In a way you can see MAGA\u2019s conduct as an updated, secularized version of this in the sense that disasters are always cast as a failure of Democratic governance. Or in other cases, with Covid\u2019s initial spread in blue cities, it was attacked as a sign that cosmopolitan urban areas are corrupted and infested and diseased.<br/><br/>Is there a through line from that Pat Robertson religious right stuff right through to the way MAGA does it today?\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>I think there is. There are two ways that conservatives got to natural disasters as political opportunities. Certainly, it comes up through the religious right.<br/><br/>Pat Robertson is saying that everything, from hurricanes to earthquakes to tornadoes, these are all God\u2019s punishment. And even in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina happened, there was a pastor, John Hagee, who said, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Well, have you been to New Orleans? You see the way that they are. You see what sinful people they are.God has sent this as punishment against them</emphasis>. So you have that history and that rhetoric.\nI also think that Hurricane Katrina is a really important moment here because Hurricane Katrina was badly mismanaged by the Bush administration. That was something that benefited Democrats, because Americans hated the way that Bush responded to Katrina, and Republicans took from that. Not that they should be better at responding to natural disasters, but that you could seize on a natural disaster to injure the Democrats.\nWhen Barack Obama takes office, they first take the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and they try to turn that into Obama\u2019s Katrina.<br/><br/>You have Republican politicians who are, on the one hand, talking to the administration and getting all sorts of help from the administration, and then going on Fox News and talking about how terrible and unresponsive the Obama administration is. You see it in Superstorm Sandy. You\u2019ll remember that Chris Christie was persona non grata for years because he accepted aid from the Obama administration. So I think that\u2019s an important turning point because Republicans realized that they could make political hay from natural disasters.<br/><br/>And then you get to Donald Trump, and he\u2019s like, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hey, every time a natural disaster happens, I can make political hay out of it. </emphasis>Whether it is a hurricane in Puerto Rico or fires out in California, what you get is a purely partisan political response to what\u2019s happening. \n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent:</emphasis> There\u2019s another good example of this as well.<br/><br/>Remember when the chemical train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, MAGA figures tried to cast it as proof that liberal elites were deliberately abandoning a virtuous white  working class community. They actually racialized this. JD Vance even did a little bit of that. If you\u2019ll recall on Twitter and in social media, these pictures of these huge clouds rising up out of East Palestine were everywhere, and right-wing politicians were pushing them. They all coalesced behind this story in which the white working class was being abandoned and getting poisoned by liberal elites. I see a lot of that in there.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer:</emphasis> Absolutely. This does seem to me to be one of those places where the mode of politics and the media really combine with one another. That East Palestine story was not only the headlining story on all of these right-wing media sites but, of course, it was on social media sites like X and it would combine with all sorts of fake images and fake stories. It all becomes this stew where you might not even really know what happened in East Palestine but you walk away with this feeling that something went horribly wrong, people are very angry about it, and you just feel worse about your country and the people in it when you hear about that story. That brings us back to Donald Trump and the degradation of everything. There\u2019s no space for a story of hope or renewal to emerge. It\u2019s all just awfulness and destruction.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>That\u2019s exactly it. The explicit game plan here is to just fill everybody with hate and rage and, critically, confusion.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>Yeah. Remember Steve Bannon\u2019s saying that the strategy of the Trump administration\u2014he was saying this back in 2015, 2016\u2014was to flood the zone with crap, right?<br/><br/>Just put so much bad stuff out there, make people feel terrible all the time, and while people are feeling terrible, you can go over here and amass all of this political power and use it for whatever you want. And we are still living in that world. \n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent:</emphasis> There\u2019s an irony to this in the current context, by the way. If Trump were president right now, he\u2019d be using the wildfires and he\u2019d be withholding federal help to extort political or even personal favors from Gavin Newsom.<br/><br/>In fact, you may recall that Politico reported that as president, Trump temporarily withheld wildfire aid from California until he established whether the relevant areas had voted for him. And the funny thing about it is that MAGA sees that as a positive thing, and that\u2019s especially getting worse now that Trump keeps doing it over and over, whether he\u2019s politicizing or spreading conspiracy theories around the flooding in North Carolina, or spreading lies about California. He\u2019s just telling his supporters, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This is what we should be doing, we should take every opportunity to try to grind blue America and non-MAGA America into the dirt.</emphasis>\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>It is absolutely his strategy. He did it with the ventilators too, during the early days of Covid. And it really is not just about negotiation and power plays, although that\u2019s how it\u2019s often framed in Trumpworld\u2014he\u2019s a master negotiator, he\u2019s getting these people to bend to his will. It\u2019s actually this deeper fascistic strategy of \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem.\u201d  And what do you do with \u201cthem\u201d? You punish them at every opportunity. If you have power, you use that power to protect your own and to harm others. And that is absolutely the philosophy of the Trump administration that just becomes very clear in these moments of crisis.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>You could argue in a way that these types of natural disasters are a real threat to the MAGA project because they actually encourage people to unite and come together and to start to believe that government is there to help them.<br/><br/>This is really anathema. To go all Carl Schmitt on you, MAGA requires politics always to be about the enemy, and there can be no point at which politics is not about the enemy. That, I think, is what explains a lot of this. Can you talk about that?\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>Absolutely. That is the ethos behind MAGA. You have to have somebody who you\u2019re fighting against, somebody who you\u2019re railing against. Moments like in the face of disaster, I was mentioning earlier Oklahoma City and Columbine, 9/11 ... Glenn Beck used to have something called the 9/12 Project, and it was tethered exactly to this idea that in this moment after national tragedy, what happens? We put aside our differences, we come together, we recognize our common humanity, and we want to get back to that kind of feeling.<br/><br/>And that is a danger to a divisive movement. People look at one another and they see that they\u2019re not actually all that different, that they are devoted to a common project. That common project could just be keeping their communities safe and whole, and making sure people have a place to sleep and that they\u2019re safe from the storm\u2014and that is probably the biggest threat to the MAGA project. It\u2019s why these moments have to be turned into moments of division.\nThe same thing is true for the right in a way that kind of predates Donald Trump. The big problem of Katrina was not just that it hurt the Bush administration, but it proved the lie of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the most dangerous words in the English language are I\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help.</emphasis> What did people want? They wanted the government to show up. The government was doing good things. That, too, is a dangerous message.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>That happened in North Carolina too. Republicans had to step forward and say,<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> I\u2019m sorry, MAGA, but the truth is that the federal response is actually very good.</emphasis>\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer:</emphasis> Right.<br/><br/>Then instead, you also have these stories then of people who could really use the help of the federal government not wanting to interact with FEMA, or waving their guns when FEMA shows up. In these moments of real crisis, it cuts people off from the things that would make their lives better.<br/><br/>That is both part of the MAGA project and part of the conservative project: to take away from people the things that might make their lives better. That seems like it should be easier to counter, but those affective ties that MAGA voters have to Donald Trump are proving to be very difficult to overcome.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent:</emphasis> So Nicole, what\u2019s the answer to this stuff? It seems to me that for MAGA and for MAGA media, a lot of this stuff festers and doesn\u2019t really penetrate to the broader culture really.<br/><br/>But at the same time, as you point out, in some cases it does where some people were duped by the attacks on the federal responders during North Carolina, and that was a terrible thing. Is the answer for Democrats and liberals and small-d democrats and people who want a sane public life to just marginalize and ignore that stuff and count on common humanity to assert itself?<br/><br/>Or is that not enough? Do we have to call this stuff out for the derangement that it really is?\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>It seems like hoping that it goes away is not working, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend that as a strategy going forward. I do think that there is real value in calling it out, right? Talking about the fact that it is weird and cruel to respond to a forest fire or to flooding or to a hurricane with this vitriol and these wild conspiracy theories. There is real value in that, and so I definitely think that people should be doing that.\nThat can\u2019t be all people do. The other thing that people have to do is model the world that they want to be part of.<br/><br/>It means being the person who shows up for your neighbors. It means being the person who helps gather supplies to send people who are hurt. It means modeling a humane response to disasters when they happen. And so I think that it\u2019s both end. It is both pointing out and making clear how terrible this is, and then proving that there\u2019s a better way to do it right, a better way to move forward. You can\u2019t do that everywhere all the time, but it is something that I would hope that all of your listeners are thinking about: how they can in their communities respond to pain and loss and crisis and deprivation in ways that make their communities better. I actually think that is the generational road out of a lot of this.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>Nicole Hemmer, that was beautifully said, and I really hope you\u2019re right that that\u2019s where the true impulse of the American public lies.<br/><br/>Thanks so much for coming on with us today.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>Thank you so much for having me, Greg.\n<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>You\u2019ve been listening to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Daily Blast</emphasis> with me, your host, Greg Sargent. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Daily Blast</emphasis> is a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New Republic </emphasis>podcast and is produced by Riley Fessler and the DSR Network.", "The following information was released by the office of the Governor of New Jersey:\nGovernor Phil Murphy and DEP Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette Give Update on New Jersey's Record-Breaking Dry Spell and Wildfire Response\nAs New Jersey continues to experience historically low precipitation, above-average temperatures, and deteriorating water-supply conditions, Governor Phil Murphy and DEP Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette announced the State is declaring a Drought Warning and gave an update on the significant increase in wildfires over last year. As New Jersey enters the next stage in severity of water-storage conditions, officials strongly encouraged the public to reduce water use during a virtual press conference.\nFirefighters across New Jersey are battling a number of wildfires during a record-breaking dry spell that is affecting the entire Northeast. Since early October, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has responded to 537 wildfires, a more than 1,300% increase in wildfires over the same period last year. The New Jersey Office of Emergency Management has deployed the State's All-Hazards Incident Management Team to supplement operations. The Jennings Creek wildfire, burning along New Jerseys border with New York, claimed the life of New York State parks system employee Dariel Vasquez as he fought the fire on Saturday.\nSince the start of the year, nearly 1,300 wildfires have burned over 11,000 acres. The average number of fires per year since the year 2000 is 1,071 wildfires and 4,000 acres burned.As a result of the extremely dry conditions, mandatory statewide Stage 3 fire restrictions remain in effect. These restrictions prohibit all fires unless they are contained in an elevated stove using only propane, natural gas, or electricity. No wood or charcoal fires are allowed, and the use of kerosene or gas torches of any kind is prohibited while this level of restriction is in place.\nCommissioner LaTourette signed an Administrative Order authorizing the Drought Warning designation, which is the next stage of drought after a Water Supply Drought Watch. DEP announced Drought Watch status in mid-October, following a period of prolonged dry conditions. A Drought Warning enables the DEP to more closely manage water systems by directing water transfers among systems, controlling releases from reservoirs, and modifying the rate of flow in streams and rivers in order to balance ecological protection and needs of water suppliers.\nNew Jersey is experiencing unprecedented weather conditionsas a result of climate changethat require us to take these precautionary measures now,Governor Murphy said.It can be challenging to adjust our daily habits, but it is imperative that we all work together, heed the guidance to conserve water, and use the utmost caution outdoors to reduce the risk of wildfire as dry conditions continue statewide.\nClimate change is driving our record low precipitation and above-average temperature recorded statewide in September and October,Commissioner LaTourette said.This combination of events has resulted in decreased streamflow and groundwater levels, which harms our available water supplies. Taking these measures now and encouraging reduced water use will help provide some measure of protection from the weather uncertainty we face entering winter.\nREAD MORE\nStatement from Governor Murphy Opposing New York's Congestion Pricing Plan\nFollowing the relaunch of New York's congestion pricing plan, Governor Murphy released the following statement:\nI am firmly opposed to any attempt to force through a congestion pricing proposal in the final months of the Biden Administration. All of us need to listen to the message that voters across America sent last Tuesday, which is that the vast majority of Americans are experiencing severe economic strains and still feeling the effects of inflation. There could not be a worse time to impose a new $9 toll on individuals who are traveling into downtown Manhattan for work, school, or leisure.\nNew Jersey has never been meaningfully consulted on the design of this plan, either in its initial iteration or the version that was announced. Perhaps that is because this effort has always simply been a way to take money from the pockets of New Jersey residents to bail out the MTA from a mountain of debt.\nI have consistently expressed openness to a form of congestion pricing that meaningfully protects the environment and does not put unfair burdens upon hardworking New Jersey commuters. Todays plan woefully fails that test.\nI urge Governor Hochul to reconsider the plan, and I urge all elected officials in the region including those set to take office in January to speak out against this proposal. Meanwhile, my administration will continue the fight to block this plan in court.\nREAD MORE\nActing Governor Tahesha Way Announces Launch of Bringing Veterans Home Initiative\nActing Governor Tahesha Way announced the launch of Bringing Veterans Home (BVH), an initiative led by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA) and Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMAVA). Acting Governor Way made the announcement during the State Veterans Day Ceremony at the New JerseyVietnam Veterans Memorial and Museum in Holmdel.\nMore than $30 million in State and federal funds has been committed to fund services and interventions over a two-year period to help place more than 1,000 homeless veterans in New Jersey in stable housing. This is the first time veteran service organizations in New Jersey will formally partner with the State in the fight against unsheltered veteran homelessness. This effort will be led by DCAs Office of Homelessness Prevention via a dedicated data and project management team in partnership with DMAVA.\nWe must always take the time to express our gratitude and honor the bravery and selflessness of our veterans,said Acting Governor Way.The courageous men and women who have served our country should never bear the weight of homelessness. Our Administration is committed to connecting veterans with the resources they need for the housing they deserve.\nNew Jersey veterans deserve our utmost respect and supportafter serving our country, they should never worry about where they will sleep at night,said Governor Phil Murphy.My Administration is proud to partner with our veteran service organizations to invest in the fight against veteran homelessness and ensure that it will be rare and brief in New Jersey.\nREAD MORE\nStatement from Governor Murphy on $300 Million in Federal Funding for Improvements to NJ TRANSIT\nFollowing the announcement of $300 million in federal funding for NJ TRANSIT, Governor Murphy released the following statement:\nThis $300 million in grant funding from theFederal Railroad Administrationwill bring needed enhancements to Amtraks infrastructure, which will improve reliability for NJ TRANSIT riders and will also be transformational for Penn Station, which is the gateway between New Jersey and New York.\nSince I took office, I have been committed to improving NJ TRANSIT. But state investments alone are insufficient, as we rely on tracks shared with Amtrak.\nIm proud to announce that this funding will help us improve resiliency along the most heavily traveled rail line in the countryallowing for upgrades that will increase the speed and the volume of trains and improve infrastructure that is more than a century old, including the catenary overhead wire systems that are prone to failures.\nThank you to the Biden Administration and New Jerseys congressional delegation for working alongside us to secure this funding.\nREAD MORE\nGovernor Murphy, Governor Hochul, and Port Authority Propose Reduced Fare Program For Passengers With Disabilities on Path Commuter Rail\nGovernor Phil Murphy, Governor Kathy Hochul, and The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced the proposal of a new reduced fare program for customers with disabilities using the PATH system. The 50 percent fare reduction would match the reduced fare program currently available for senior riders. If approved, riders could begin applying for the program in spring 2025, with the reduced fare implemented in the summer as PATH continues rolling out its TAPP tap-to-pay system.\nIn New Jersey, we have pursued a whole-of-government approach to empowering residents with disabilities, and we have witnessed how targeted services and supports can help an individual to thrive in their community,said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy.Public transportation is crucial to our disability community enabling countless individuals who may not be able to operate a vehicle to get to work, school, health care appointments, social services, and social gatherings. Todays proposed PATH fare reduction would build on our work to ensure our public transportation infrastructure is inclusive and reliable for all commuters.\nEasy access to convenient, reliable and affordable public transportation is a basic right that everyone should be able to enjoy,said New York Governor Kathy Hochul.With this new fare reduction for people with disabilities proposed by New Jersey Governor Murphy, the Port Authority and myself, Im confident we are making that right to transportation even easier to enjoy.\nThe proposed reduced fare program is another step in the Port Authoritys agenda to continue improving the PATH system. Those efforts have included thePATH Improvement Plan, which aimed to increase the systems capacity and reduce delays through new railcars, signal upgrades and track work. PATH riders have also enthusiastically taken to the newTAPP fare payment system, providing a seamless payment option with the tap of a contactless debit/credit card, smartphone or wearable device. Comprehensive work is also ongoing around the $430 millionPATH Forwardprogram, which focuses on improving the speed, reliability and passenger experience on the system.\nREAD MORE\nGovernor Phil Murphy", "SANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 A Chilean judge on Saturday ordered a volunteer firefighter and a former forestry official detained for allegedly planning and causing a mammoth forest fire in the Valparaiso region that caused 137 deaths and made 16,000 people homeless in February.\nThe court in Valparaiso ruled the two men, who were arrested Friday, could be held for 180 days while they are investigated.\nThe chief prosecutor in the case, Osvaldo Ossand\u00f3n, told journalists that the main suspect is Francisco Mondaca, a 22-year-old volunteer firefighter in Valparaiso who is accused of physically starting the fire.

The employee of the New York State Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Department who was assisting firefighting crews died Saturday when he was hit by a falling tree. \nThe East Coast fires were burning as much larger wildfires raged in California. \nThere have been multiple brush fires in the region, including one earlier this year near McCune Road in South Huntingdon that grew to nearly 5 acres before being knocked down. \n\"Our department has an advantage because we have 20 members who are trained in (Department of Conservation and Natural Resources) forestry, including two wardens,\" said Dan Pergola, chief at Turkeytown VFD, the lead company at the South Huntingdon fire. \"For the most part, we didn't use water, we used our sawyers and hand crews.\" \nA sawyer is a firefighter trained to cut down specific trees during a brush or woodland fire. \nBack-to-back mild winters could make the 2024 brush fire season more intense, but the area's fire chiefs say they are prepared. \n\"Normally, our brush fire season goes from late May until about November, depending on temperature and how dry the leaves are,\" said Lower Burrell VFC No. 3 Chief Brennan Sites. \nWestmoreland County Public Safety Director Roland \"Buddy\" Mertz said the most recent state report on weather conditions puts the county at a low risk for brush fires. \n\"I think the steady rain we got over the weekend helped some with lowering that risk,\" Mertz said. \nBefore the rain on Sunday, Tarentum's Summit Hose Co. and neighboring companies fought a 15-acre fire over the weekend in the borough's Fourth Ward, said Josh Fox, Summit Hose Co. fire chief. The cause of the fire is under investigation by the Allegheny County fire marshal, Fox said. \n\"It was pretty remote,\" Fox said. \nThe brush fire was hard to fight because it was in a wooded area that was not easily accessible. But the Rachel Carson Trail and West Penn Power line paths and a gas line cut through the woods, allowing firefighters to get some ATVs to the site of the fire, Fox said. \nFirefighters hooked a truck to a hydrant and filled a water supply container to feed the smaller brush trucks that maneuvered through the woods. \nIn some areas, firefighters had to down trees and dig fire breaks in the woods using a rake and a shovel, Fox said. \nA red flag \nBrian Vinski, who spent nearly three decades as the forest fire specialist supervisor at Forbes State Forest, said he became more concerned as the winter of 2023 progressed and continued with mild weather. \n\"We had very little snow pack, very mild conditions, and even in January (2023) we were seeing field fires popping up across our counties,\" said Vinski, who recently retired. \"That was a red flag for us.\" \nThe cause of most brush fires is somewhat predictable. That stands in stark opposition to the fires themselves, which can change direction with the wind. \n\"Someone could take all the right precautions and actions, and if the wind conditions are wrong, it can escape quickly,\" Vinski said. \nToday, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry's forest assistant manager, Cory Wentzel, works with a staff of about 40 people to cover six counties and 60,000 acres of state forest, where they are responsible for wildfire suppression and investigation. \n\"Since July 1, we've responded or sent a fire warden to 71 wildfires covering about 165 acres,\" Wentzel said. \nBy comparison, those crews responded to 44 fires covering 25 acres in 2023, and 43 fires covering 101 acres in 2022. \n\"This fall isn't even over, and we're already up to 71,\" he said. \"I've been here for 27 years, and this is the first year I can recall multiple counties enacting temporary burn bans.\" \nAs of Tuesday, 17 Pennsylvania counties have instituted 30-day burn bans until late November or early December. Fayette and Somerset counties have put temporary burn bans in effect for residents, as have some local communities in Westmoreland. \nFor wildfire experts like Wentzel and Vinski, it's all about humidity and wind speed. \n\"Those are two large factors,\" Vinski said. \"There's also the fuel type where ignition happens. If you have ignition in a field that's 100 acres of grass, with some wind behind it? That rate of spread is going to be very rapid.\" \nBy contrast, an ignition among larger fuel -- such as trees and large downed branches -- typically is countered with much more moisture. \n\"The ignition temperature has to be a lot higher, and that fire is not going to spread as quickly,\" Vinski said. \nCarelessness cited \nIn Westmoreland County, a large number of brush fires can be traced back to careless acts, whether it's a controlled burn that got away from a property owner or a burning cigarette tossed out a window near a dry woodline. \nNot every report of a brush fire is accurate -- often a fire company will be called out, only to be called off a few minutes later when it's discovered that a homeowner is simply using a burn barrel or getting rid of raked autumn leaves. \nBut controlled fires can turn into something more hazardous quite quickly. \n\"All it takes is a little breeze,\" said Crabtree VFD Chief Bill Watkins. \"The majority we see is outdoor burning, whether it's yard waste, garbage or a recreational fire. What we've seen is that a lot of people think the fire's out -- they dump a little water on it and leave -- but unless you stir it up and douse it, it's going to char back up.\" \nWatkins said his department was busy last spring with several brush fires, which he mostly attributed to the mild winter. \n\"A lot of what we see is cigarettes flicked into mulch,\" said Logans Ferry Heights Fire Chief Stephen Marsh of Plum. \"A lot of landscaping and roadway material can ignite. We had one once in the summer where a semi-trailer's brakes were malfunctioning and throwing sparks, and it was dry enough that it ignited a brush fire.\" \nIn Allegheny County, West Deer VFC No. 3 Fire Chief Josh Wiegand doesn't see a lot of burn-related brush fires because of the county's stricter burn laws. His department's brush fire calls generally come as a result of downed power lines. \nSpecial equipment \nMany departments have specialized trucks that are better equipped to access the places brush fires can spread. \nLower Burrell VFC No. 3 outfitted one of its vehicles with a 300-gallon pump and 1,000 feet of forestry hose. \n\"That allows us to get into places we can't reach with the fire engine,\" Sites said. Lower Burrell's hilly topography and sizable wooded acreage make it susceptible to brush fires in dry conditions. \n\"Once it gets started, it can take off,\" Sites said. \nBradenville VFD No. 1 in Derry Township has a brush truck and a four-wheel-drive \"attack\" truck along with a utility terrain vehicle that holds 80 gallons of water. \n\"We also use the county's ATV team, which is specialized with tanks on their vehicles and training through the forestry department,\" Bradenville Chief Mark Piantine said. \nYoungwood Fire Chief Lloyd Crago said one of the most effective tools is a simple fire rake. \n\"Those are really the best way to knock them down,\" he said. \"We use those to create a line break to stop the fire, in combination with our booster tanks. Fighting brush fires in the woods, or even along the fields and highways, definitely takes a physical toll on everyone.\" \nRough-terrain volunteers \nFormed in 1999, the Westmoreland County Team 211 Rough Terrain Support Unit has about 40 member-owned all-terrain vehicles and other equipment it uses to respond to brush fires and search details in locations that firefighters on foot or in larger vehicles can't easily reach. \n\"We don't get called to small brush fires,\" said Jason Frazier, chief of the all-volunteer unit of more than 50 members. \"We get called to the ones you can't walk, climb or get a fire truck to. A lot of times, we create our own path to get from point A to point B.\" \nFrazier said the unit's brush fire calls in Westmoreland County and neighboring areas typically occur in the spring and fall. \n\"This year is much worse with the dry season,\" he said. \"It seems like it's later this year than normal.\" The unit responded to three calls recently within a two-week period. \nWhile neither Westmoreland nor Allegheny County has enacted a burning ban, Wentzel said it's better to be safe than sorry. \n\"I got nearly an inch of rain in my gauge over the weekend in Latrobe,\" he said. \"But with the wind, that's going to dry up pretty quickly. We need a lot more rain than we just got. I'd urge people to just hold off from doing any burning.\" ", "<br/>2023 NOV 21 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Politics, Law &amp; Government Daily -- Investigators publish new report on information science. According to news originating from National University of Misiones by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This article presents a novel approach to wildfire risk assessment and behaviour prediction by leveraging open geospatial data and ontologies. The proposed methodology includes a spatially weighted index model and multicriteria analysis to represent the risk of forest fires in the affected area.\" \n<br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from National University of Misiones: \"It bridges gaps in theory and practice, offering a comprehensive solution for evaluating potential forest fire risk in near real time, predicting fire behaviour and elucidating the semantics of fire management. During dry and hot conditions, forest fires tend to escalate. Hence, we propose an algorithm that combines experts' empirical criteria and open-source data to identify dangerous fires in near real time, aiding authorities in directing attention to the riskiest areas. The objective is to predict forest fire behaviour, a complex and nonlinear system influenced by dynamic factors such as weather conditions, topography and land use. Our methodology enables real-time assessment of potential forest fire risks, complemented by predictive fire behaviour scenarios and a descriptive ontology of fire management semantics. We examine existing fire-related ontologies and propose a comprehensive one encompassing incident descriptions, firefighting resources, actor interrelations and knowledge for effective action. By classifying fire sources, our algorithm enables strategic decision-making to prevent uncontrolled fires. This solution significantly enhances data using semantic and spatial relationships among wildfire resources. Furthermore, we demonstrate how ontologies improve data integration and interoperability among diverse systems and organisations involved in forest fire risk management, fostering better coordination and faster responses to critical situations. To facilitate decision-making, we create decision-making scenarios linked to analysed hot spots, drawing from open hot spot data such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), OpenStreetMap (OSM), OpenWeatherMap (OWM) and OpenTopoData (OTD). We propose an ordinal and linguistic classification system (F1-F5) denoting risk levels as low, moderate, high, very high and extreme.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"These values are obtained through factor aggregation and fuzzy logic. A publicly accessible, interactive web map displays the results derived from this model. Overall, our contributions to wildfire risk management provide authorities with a valuable tool to make informed decisions and mitigate the damaging effects of wildfires.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Wildfire risk weighting and behaviour prediction using open geospatial data and ontologies.

According to news reporting from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"In satellite imagery, clouds obstruct the ground information, directly impacting various downstream applications. Thus, cloud annotation/cloud detection serves as the initial preprocessing step in remote sensing image analysis.\" \n<br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of Chin. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"Recently, deep learning methods have significantly improved in the field of cloud detection, but training these methods necessitates abundant annotated data, which requires experts with professional domain knowledge. Moreover, the influx of remote sensing data from new satellites has further led to an increase in the cost of cloud annotation. To address the dependence on labeled datasets and professional domain knowledge, this paper proposes an automatic cloud annotation method for satellite remote sensing images, CloudAUE. Unlike traditional approaches, CloudAUE does not rely on labeled training datasets and can be operated by users without domain expertise. To handle the irregular shapes of clouds, CloudAUE firstly employs a convex hull algorithm for selecting cloud and non-cloud regions by polygons. When selecting convex hulls, the cloud region is first selected, and points at the edges of the cloud region are sequentially selected as polygon vertices to form a polygon that includes the cloud region. Then, the same selection is performed on non-cloud regions. Subsequently, the fast KD-Tree algorithm is used for pixel classification. Finally, an uncertainty method is proposed to evaluate the quality of annotation. When the confidence value of the image exceeds a preset threshold, the annotation process terminates and achieves satisfactory results. When the value falls below the threshold, the image needs to undergo a subsequent round of annotation. Through experiments on two labeled datasets, HRC and Landsat 8, CloudAUE demonstrates comparable or superior accuracy to deep learning algorithms, and requires only one to two annotations to obtain ideal results.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"An unlabeled self-built Google Earth dataset is utilized to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of CloudAUE. To show the extension capabilities in various fields, CloudAUE also achieves desirable results on a forest fire dataset. Finally, some suggestions are provided to improve annotation performance and reduce the number of annotations.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Satellite Image Cloud Automatic Annotator with Uncertainty Estimation.

According to news reporting out of Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are an efficient tool for monitoring forest fire due to its advantages, e.g., cost-saving, lightweight, flexible, etc. Semantic segmentation can provide a model aircraft to rapidly and accurately determine the location of a forest fire.\" \n<br/> Funders for this research include Joint Fund of Science &amp; Technology Department of Liaoning Province And State Key Laboratory of Robotics; National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"However, training a semantic segmentation model requires a large number of labeled images, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming to generate. To address the lack of labeled images, we propose, in this paper, a semi-supervised learning-based segmentation network, SemiFSNet. By taking into account the unique characteristics of UAV-acquired imagery of forest fire, the proposed method first uses occlusion-aware data augmentation for labeled data to increase the robustness of the trained model. In SemiFSNet, a dynamic encoder network replaces the ordinary convolution with dynamic convolution, thus enabling the learned feature to better represent the fire feature with varying size and shape. To mitigate the impact of complex scene background, we also propose a feature refinement module by integrating an attention mechanism to highlight the salient feature information, thus improving the performance of the segmentation network. Additionally, consistency regularization is introduced to exploit the rich information that unlabeled data contain, thus aiding the semi-supervised learning.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted on the Flame dataset and Corsican dataset.

The Hurricane Ridge Fire began burning Wednesday afternoon, Nov. 23. More than 85 firefighters were working the fire as of Tuesday.\nThe cause of the Hurricane Ridge Fire is under investigation. No structures were burned.\nWhen the fire broke out, firefighters initially attempted to construct containment lines, but due to the steep terrain and difficulty accessing the fire's edge, they instead switched tactics to use gravel forest service roads as natural fire breaks.\nHelicopters were used for water drops to reduce the intensity of the fire near the firelines, which included Cold Springs Road as a boundary to the north and Hurricane Creek Road as a boundary to the south.\nAided by rain on Sunday, firefighters on Monday were able to improve contingency firelines around the perimeter of the Hurricane Creek drainage. Then on Tuesday, firefighters conducted burn out operations to remove understory and downed wood between the active fire and the fireline. Burn out operations reduce the fuel load to lessen the fire's intensity, in hopes that the fire wouldn't jump the firelines once it reached them.\nMeanwhile, several cabins were located inside the firelines. Crews protected the structures and successfully kept the fire off them.\nDue to the proximity to Interstate 40, smoke impacted visibility for drivers, especially Monday and Tuesday.\nThe forest service thanked firefighters for their response and sacrifices over the Thanksgiving Holiday.\nThe public is asked to avoid the area as not to interfere with firefighting operations and to exercise caution in the area as conditions will remain dry and windy throughout the area over the next several days.\n___ (c)2022 The Mountaineer (Waynesville, N.C.)

The Bitterroot National Forest Fire Management team advises that people know what precautions to take during this level.\nVery High fire danger means fires start easily from all causes, and immediately spread fast. Small fires can quickly become large fires and exhibit extreme fire intensity. These fires can be difficult to control and will often become much larger and longer-lasting fires.\nSpring and early summer rains have resulted in a tall, thick crop of grasses that are now starting to dry and cure, increasing the likelihood of a larger, more intense fire. Even in the timbered stands, heavy fuels like standing dead trees and logs are already extremely dry.\nIt is imperative that residents and visitors alike exercise caution when recreating outdoors. Several unattended campfires have been discovered by forest personnel, especially around Lake Como Recreation Area and Lost Horse.\n\"Just because there are no flames, doesn't mean the campfire is out,\" said Russell Buzzell, Fire Prevention Officer. Buzzell reminds people to drown a fire with water, stir it, and then touch the area to make sure it's cool to the touch. \"If it's too hot to touch, it's too hot to leave,\" he said.\nPlease follow these fire safety tips.\n* Keep campfires small and completely extinguish them before leaving camp. Always add water, stir it, and make sure all embers are out. It is illegal to have unattended campfires.\n* Smokers should light up only in areas cleared of all flammable debris. Cigarette butts should never be thrown from vehicle windows.\n* Fireworks are illegal on public lands: every forest, every campsite, every day. Never light fireworks in the woods.\n* Ensure your vehicle is properly maintained, with nothing dragging on the ground. A loose safety chain or dangling muffler can send a shower of sparks into dry vegetation.\n* Keep vehicles off dry grass. The catalytic converter may contact the vegetation and start a fire.\n* Recreational shooting? Take precautions! Never shoot into dry vegetation and always make sure you're shooting in a safe location, away from roads, trails, campsites, and occupied areas.

Such effects help return the forest to historic conditions, where stands are less dense with openings in the canopy. This, along with standing dead and down trees, are beneficial for wildlife.\nThe strategy for this fire is part of larger initiatives to benefit residents and downstream cities.\nSince 2011, Forest Service staff and partners have invested over $10 million in the Canjilon Wildland Urban Interface Project immediately to the north of the Yeso Fire.

Another person died in Grayvoron city in Russia's Belgorod region, bordering Ukraine, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\nRazvozhayev said 151 people were wounded in Sevastopol. Falling rocket fragments caused a forest fire of over 150 square meters and set a residential building alight, RIA Novosti said, noting that a fifth missile had exploded over the city.\nRussia's Defense Ministry said both Ukraine and the U.S. bore \"responsibility for a deliberate missile strike on civilians.\" It said that U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles were used in the Ukrainian attack.\nRazvozhayev declared today a day of mourning in Sevastopol, with public events canceled.\nAir defenses overnight shot down 33 Ukrainian drones over Russia's western Bryansk, Smolensk, Lipetsk and Tula regions, the Russian Ministry of Defense said Sunday. No casualties or damage were reported.\nA fresh attack on Kharkiv killed at least one person and wounded 11 on Sunday, according to local officials. Mayor Ihor Terekhov said the city was attacked by a guided bomb and that around half of Kharkiv was without electricity because of the strike.\nSunday's attacks came after Russia struck Kharkiv on Saturday afternoon with four aerial bombs, hitting a five-story residential building and killing three people.

Officials have essentially curtailed the supply of water available to LA firefighters, even as they have drastically increased the supply of combustible kindling and vegetation which feeds these wildfires. The latter, in turn, are being amplified by the seasonal Santa Ana winds, which have visited the California coast since time immemorial.\nThe kindling at issue stems from forest management policies that prevent the removal of excess fuel via controlled burns, which are fires intentionally set by forest managers to reduce the buildup of hazardous fuels. As we amplify below, red tape and bureaucratic obstacles have frequently delayed or prevented these controlled burns, allowing brush, dead trees, and other flammable materials to accumulate excessively.\nIn this case, state and Federal politicians have simultaneously curtailed the supply of water available to Los Angeles firefighters in order to protect so-called endangered species. Specifically, southern California is being held hostage by sharp curtailment of the water pumping rates from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in order to protect the Delta Smelt and Chinook Salmon.\nThese former are shiny but tiny little buggers, as suggested by the handful of Smelt in the first picture below. But apparently, if they are protected, fished, and then fried up, they make for a certain kind of delicacy.\nNeedless to say, California is entitled to stew in the foolishness of its own policies-if that's what its voters really want. But its self-imposed misery should not be an occasion for more howling in favor of Washington policies to fight climate change.\nAt least with respect to the latter, the Donald has his head screwed on right. And he does not hesitate to opine on the matter, which is all to the good of balancing what has otherwise been a wholly one-sided and utterly misleading Climate Crisis narrative. Naturally, the latter has been promulgated and peddled by statists because it provides yet one more big, scary, and urgent reason for an \"all of government\" campaign of more spending, borrowing, regulating, and the curtailing of free market enterprise and personal liberty.\nSo let us once again review the bogus case for AGW or what is known as Anthropogenic Global Warming. And perforce it must start with the geological and paleontological evidence, which overwhelmingly says that today's average global temperature of about 15 degrees C and CO2 concentrations of 420 ppm are nothing to fret about. And even if they rise to about 17-18 degrees C and 500-600 ppms, respectively, by the end of the century owing mainly to a natural warming cycle that has been underway since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in 1850, it may well on balance improve the lot of mankind.\nAfter all, bursts of civilization during the last 10,000 years uniformly occurred during the warmer red portion of the graph below. The great civilizations of the Yellow, Indus, Nile, and Tigris/Euphrates river valleys, the Minoan era, the Greco-Roman civilization, the Medieval flowering, and the industrial and technological revolutions of the present era all were enabled by periods of elevated temperatures. At the same time, the several lapses into \"dark ages\" happened when the climate turned colder (blue).\nAnd that's only logical. When it's warmer and wetter, growing seasons are longer and crop yields are better-regardless of the agricultural technology and practices of the moment. And it's better for human and community health, too-most of the deadly plagues of history have occurred under colder climes, such as the Black Death of 1344-1350.\nYet the Climate Crisis narrative deep-sixes this massive body of \"the science\" by means of two deceptive devices. Without them, the entire AGW story doesn't have much of a leg to stand on.\nFirst, it ignores the entirety of the planet's pre-Holocene (last 10,000 years) history, even though the science shows that more than 90% of the time in the last 600 million years global temperatures (blue line) and CO2 levels (black line) have been higher than at present; and that 50% of the time they were much higher-with temperatures in the range of 22 degrees C or 50% higher than current levels.\nThat's far beyond anything projected by the most unhinged climate models today. But, crucially, the planetary climate systems did not go into a doomsday loop of ever increasing temperatures ending in a scorching meltdown. To the contrary, warming epochs were always checked and reversed by powerful countervailing forces.\nEven the history the alarmists do acknowledge has been grotesquely falsified. As we have demonstrated elsewhere, the so-called \"hockey stick\" of the most recent 1,000 years in which temperatures were allegedly flat until 1850 and are now rising to supposedly dangerous levels is a complete crock. It was fraudulently manufactured by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) to \"cancel\" the fact that temperatures in the pre-industrial world of the Medieval Warm Period (1000-1200 AD) were actually significantly higher than at present.\nSecondly, it is falsely claimed that global warming is a one-way street in which rising concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and especially CO2 is causing the earth's heat balance to continuously increase. The truth, however, is that higher CO2 concentrations are a consequence and byproduct, not a driver and cause, of the current naturally rising (and falling) global temperature cycles.\nAgain, the now \"canceled\" history of Planet Earth knocks the CO2-forcing proposition into a cocked hat. During the Cretaceous Period between 145 and 66 million years (third orange panel) ago a natural experiment provided complete absolution for the vilified CO2 molecule. During that period, global temperatures rose dramatically from 17 degrees C to 25 degrees C-a level far above anything today's Climate Howlers have ever projected.\nAlas, CO2 wasn't the culprit. According to the science, ambient CO2 concentrations actually tumbled during the 80 million years expanse of the Cretaceous, dropping from 2,000 ppm to 900 ppm on the eve of the Extinction Event 66 million years ago. So temperature and CO2 concentrations actually moved in the opposite directions. Big time.\nYou would think that this powerful countervailing fact would give the CO2 witch-hunters pause, but that would be to ignore what the whole climate change brouhaha is actually about. That is, it's not about science, human health, and well-being, or the survival of Planet Earth; it's about politics and the ceaseless search of politicians and statists for control of modern economic and social life. The resulting aggrandizement of state power, in turn, is mightily assisted by the Beltway political class and the apparatchiks and racketeers who gain power and pelf from the anti-fossil fuels campaign.\nIndeed, the Climate Crisis narrative is the kind of ritualized policy mantra that has been concocted over and again by the political class and the permanent nomenklatura of the modern state-professors, think-tankers, lobbyists, career apparatchiks, officialdom-in order to gather and exercise state power.\nTo paraphrase the great Randolph Bourne, inventing purported failings of capitalism-such as a propensity to burn too much hydrocarbon-is the health of the state. Indeed, fabrication of false problems and threats that purportedly can only be solved by heavy-handed state intervention has become the modus operandi of a political class that has usurped near complete control of modern democracy.\nSo doing, however, the career political class and associated ruling elites have gotten used to such unimpeded success that they have become sloppy, superficial, careless, and dishonest. For instance, the minute we get a summer heat wave or an event like the current LA fires these natural weather events are jammed into the global warming narrative with nary a second thought by the lip-syncing journalists of the MSM.\nYet there is absolutely no scientific basis for all this tom-tom beating. For instance, on the related issue of heat waves and dry period wildfires, NOAA publishes a heat wave index. The latter is based on extended temperature spikes which last more than 4 days and which would be expected to occur only once every ten years based on the historical data.\nAs is evident from the chart below, the only true heat wave spikes we have had in the last 125 years were during the Dust Bowl heat waves of the 1930s. The frequency of mini-heat wave spikes since 1960 is actually no greater than it was during the 1895-1935 period.\nLikewise, all it takes is a good Cat 3 hurricane and they are off to the races, gumming loudly about AGW. Of course, this ignores entirely NOAA's own data as summarized in what is known as the ACE (accumulated cyclone energy) index.\nThis index was first developed by the renowned hurricane expert and Colorado State University professor, William Gray. It uses a calculation of a tropical cyclone's maximum sustained winds every six hours. The latter is then multiplied by itself to get the index value and accumulated for all storms for all regions to get an index value for the entire year. That's shown below for the past 170 years (the blue line is the seven-year rolling average).\nYour editor has an especially high regard for Professor Gray-not the least because he was roundly vilified by the very inexpert, Al Gore. But back in our private equity days, we invested in a Property-Cat company, which was in the super-hazardous business of insuring against the extreme layers of damage caused by very bad hurricanes and earthquakes. So setting the premiums correctly was no trifling business and it was the analytics, long-term databases, and current-year forecasts of Professor Gray upon which our underwriters crucially depended.\nThat is to say, hundreds of billions of insurance cover was then and still is being written with the ACE index as a crucial input. Yet if you examine the 7-year rolling average (blue line) in the chart, it is evident that ACE was as high (or higher) in the 1950s and 1960s as it is today, and that the same was true of the late 1930s and the 1880-1900 periods.\nTo be sure, the blue line is not flat as a board because there are natural short-term cycles, as amplified below, which drive the fluctuations shown in the chart. But there is no \"science\" extractable from the chart that supports the alleged linkage between the current natural warming cycle and worsening hurricanes.\nThe above is an aggregate index of all storms and is therefore as comprehensive a measure as exists. But for want of doubt, the next three panels look at hurricane data at the individual storm count level. The pink portion of the bars represent the number of big, dangerous Cat 3-5 storms, while the red portion reflects the number of lesser Cat 1-2 storms and the blue area the number of tropical storms that did not reach Cat 1 intensity.\nThe bars accumulate the number of storms in 5-year intervals and reflect recorded activity back to 1851. The reason we present three panels-for the Eastern Caribbean, Western Caribbean, and Bahamas/Turks and Caicos, respectively, is that the trends in these three sub-regions clearly diverge. And that's actually the smoking gun.\nIf global warming was generating more hurricanes as the MSM constantly maintains, the increase would be uniform across all of these sub-regions, but it's clearly not. Since the year 2000, for example,\n- The Eastern Caribbean has had a modest increase in both tropical storms and higher rated Cats relative to most of the past 170 years;<br/>- The Western Caribbean has not been unusual at all, and, in fact, has been well below the higher counts during the 1880-1920 period;<br/>- The Bahamas/Turks and Caicos region since 2000 has actually been well weaker than during 1930-1960 and 1880-1900.\nThe actual truth of the matter is that Atlantic hurricane activity is generated by atmospheric and ocean temperature conditions in the eastern Atlantic and North Africa. Those forces, in turn, are heavily influenced by the presence of an El Nino or La Nina in the Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o events increase the wind shear over the Atlantic, producing a less favorable environment for hurricane formation and decreasing tropical storm activity in the Atlantic basin. Conversely, La Ni\u00f1a causes an increase in hurricane activity due to a decrease in wind shear.\nThese Pacific Ocean events, of course, have never been correlated with the low level of natural global warming now underway.\nThe number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may also undergo a 50-70-year cycle known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Again, these cycles are unrelated to global warming trends since 1850.\nStill, scientists have reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century (@1700) and found five periods with elevated hurricane activity averaging 3-5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40-60 years each; and six other more quiescent periods averaging 1.5-2.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10-20 years each. These periods are associated with a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance, which is responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1-2 per year, and clearly not a product of AGW.\nMoreover, like in so many other cases the very long-term records of storm activity also rule out AGW because there was none for most of the time during the last 3,000 years, for instance. Yet according to a proxy record for that period from coastal lake sediments on Cape Cod, hurricane activity has increased significantly during the last 500-1,000 years versus earlier periods-but even that increase happened long before temperatures and carbon concentrations reached 20th-century levels.\nIn short, there is no reason to believe that these well understood precursor conditions and longer-term hurricane trends have been impacted by the modest increase in average global temperatures since the LIA ended in 1850.\nAs it happens, the same story is true with respect to wildfires like the current LA inferno. This has been the third category of natural disaster that the Climate Howlers have glommed onto. But in this case it's the aforementioned bad forestry management, not man-made global warming, which has turned much of California into a dry wood fuel dump.\nAnd don't take our word for it. This quotation below comes from the George Soros-funded Pro Publica, which is not exactly a right-wing tin foil hat outfit. It points out that environmentalists have so shackled Federal and state forest management agencies that today's tiny \"controlled burns\" are but an infinitesimal fraction of what Mother Nature herself accomplished before the helping hand of today's purportedly enlightened political authorities arrived on the scene:\nAcademics believe that between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each year in prehistoric California. Between 1982 and 1998, California's agency land managers burned, on average, about 30,000 acres a year. Between 1999 and 2017, that number dropped to an annual 13,000 acres. The state passed a few new laws in 2018 designed to facilitate more intentional burning. But few are optimistic this, alone, will lead to significant change.\nWe live with a deathly backlog. In February 2020, Nature Sustainability published this terrifying conclusion: California would need to burn 20 million acres - an area about the size of Maine - to restabilize in terms of fire.\nIn short, if you don't clear and burn out the deadwood, you build up nature-defying tinderboxes that then require only a lightning strike, a spark from an unrepaired power line, or human carelessness to ignite into a raging inferno. As one 40-year conservationist and expert summarized,\n...There's only one solution, the one we know yet still avoid. \"We need to get good fire on the ground and whittle down some of that fuel load.\"\nThe failure to do just such controlled burns is exactly what is behind the LA wildfire today. That is, a dramatically larger human footprint in the fire-prone shrublands and chaparral (dwarf trees) areas along the coasts has increased the risk residents will start fires, accidentally or otherwise. California's population doubled from 1970 to 2020, from about 20 million people to nearly 40 million people, and nearly all of the gain was in the coastal areas.\nUnder those conditions, California's strong, naturally-occurring winds, which crest periodically, as is occurring at the moment, are the main culprit which fuels and spreads the human-set blazes in the shrublands. The Diablo winds in the north of the state and the Santa Ana winds in the south can actually reach hurricane force, as has also been the case this week. As the winds move West over California mountains and down toward the coast, they compress, warm, and intensify.\nThese winds, in turn, blow flames and carry embers, spreading the fires quickly before they can be contained. And on top of that, the Santa Ana winds also function as Mother Nature's blow dryer. As they come down the mountains toward the sea, the hot winds dry the surface vegetation and deadwood rapidly and powerfully, paving the way for the blowing embers to fuel the spread of wildfires down the slopes.\nAmong other proofs that industrialization and fossil fuels aren't the culprit is the fact that researchers have shown that when California was occupied by indigenous communities, wildfires would burn up some 4.5 million acres a year. That's nearly 6X the level experienced during the 2010-2019 period, when wildfires burned an average of just 775,000 acres annually in California.\nBeyond the untoward clash of all of these natural forces of climate and ecology with misguided government forest and shrubland husbandry policies, there is actually an even more dispositive smoking gun, as it were.\nTo wit, the Climate Howlers have at least not yet embraced the patent absurdity that the planet's purportedly rising temperatures have targeted the Blue State of California for special punishment. Yet when we look at the data for forest fires we find, alas, that unlike California and Oregon, the US as a whole experienced the weakest fire years in 2020 since 2010.\nThat's right. As of August 24 each year, the 10-year average burn had been 5.114 million acres across the US, but in 2020 it was 28% lower at 3.714 million acres.\nIndeed, what the above chart shows is that on a national basis there has been no worsening trend at all during the decade ending in 2020, just huge oscillations year-to-year driven not by some grand planetary heat vector but by changing local weather and ecological conditions.\nYou just can't go from 2.7 million burned acres in 2010 to 7.2 million acres in 2012, back to 2.7 million acres in 2014, then to 6.7 million acres in 2017, followed by just 3.7 million acres in 2020-and still argue along with the Climate Howlers that the planet is angry.\nTo the contrary, the only real trend evident is that on a decadal basis during recent times there is just one place where the average forest fire acreage has been slowly rising-California!\nBut that's owing to the above described dismal failure of government forest management policies. Even then, California's mildly rising average fire acreage trend since 1950 is a rounding error compared to the annual averages from prehistoric times, which were nearly 6X greater than during the most recent decade.\nFurthermore, the gently rising trend since 1950, as shown below, should not be confused with the Climate Howlers' bogus claim that California's fires have \"grown more apocalyptic every year,\" as the New York Times reported.\nIn fact, the NYT was comparing the above average burn during 2020 versus that of 2019, which saw an unusually small amount of acreage burned. That is, just 280,000 acres in 2019 compared to 1.3 million and 1.6 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and 775,000 on average over the last decade.\nNor is this lack of correlation with global warming just a California and US phenomena. As shown in the chart below, the global extent of fire-causing drought, measured by five levels of severity with dark brown being the most extreme, has shown no worsening trend at all during the past 40 years.\nThis brings us to the gravamen of the case. To wit, there is no angry weather signal of impending climate crisis whatsoever. But the AGW hoax has so thoroughly contaminated the mainstream narrative and the policy apparatus in Washington and capitals all around the world that contemporary society was fixing to commit economic Hara Kari-well, until Donald Trump came along vowing to pull the entire Team America off the playing field of global green nonsense.\nAnd for damn good reason. In contradistinction to the phony case that the rise of fossil fuel use after 1850 has caused the planetary climate system to become unglued, there has been a sharp acceleration of global economic growth and human well-being. And one essential element behind that salutary development has been the massive increase in the use of cheap fossil fuels to power economic life.\nThe chart below could not be more dispositive. During the pre-industrial era between 1500 and 1870, global real GDP crawled along at just 0.41% per annum. By contrast, during the past 150 years of the fossil fuel age global GDP growth accelerated to 2.82% per annum-or nearly 7 times faster.\nThis higher growth, of course, in part resulted from a larger and far healthier global population made possible by rising living standards. Yet it wasn't human muscle alone that caused the GDP level to go parabolic as per the chart below.\nIt was also due to the fantastic mobilization of intellectual capital and technology. And one of the most important vectors of the latter was the ingenuity of the fossil fuel industry in unlocking the massive trove of stored work that Mother Nature extracted, condensed, and salted away from the incoming solar energy over the long warmer and wetter eons of the past 600 million years.\nNeedless to say, the curve of world energy consumption tightly matches the rise of global GDP shown above. Thus, in 1860 global energy consumption amounted to 30 exajoules per year and virtually 100% of that was represented by the blue layer labeled \"bio-fuels,\" which is just a polite name for firewood and the decimation of the forests which it entailed.\nSince then, annual energy consumption has increased 18-fold to 550 exajoules (@100 billion barrels of oil equivalent), but 90% of that gain was due to natural gas, coal, and petroleum. The modern world and today's prosperous global economy would simply not exist absent the massive increase in the use of these efficient fuels, meaning that per capita income and living standards would otherwise be only a small fraction of current levels.\nYes, that dramatic increase in prosperity-generating fossil fuel consumption has given rise to a commensurate increase in CO2 emissions. But as we have indicated, and contrary to the Climate Crisis narrative, CO2 is not a pollutant!\nAs we have seen, the correlated increase in CO2 concentrations-from about 290 ppm to 415 ppm since 1850-amounts to a rounding error in both the long trend of history and in terms of atmospheric loadings from natural sources.\nAs to the former, CO2 concentrations of less than 1000 ppm are only recent developments of the last ice age, while during prior geologic ages concentrations reached as high as 2400 ppm.\nLikewise, the oceans contain an estimated 37,400 billion tons of suspended carbon, land biomass has 2,000-3,000 billion tons, and the atmosphere contains 720 billion tons of CO2 or 20X more than current fossil emissions shown below. Of course, the opposite side of the equation is that oceans, land, and atmosphere exchange CO2 continuously so the incremental loadings from human sources is very small.\nMore importantly, even a small shift in the balance between oceans and the atmosphere would cause a much more severe rise/fall in CO2 concentrations than anything attributable to human activity. But since the Climate Howlers falsely postulate that the pre-industrial level of 290 parts per million was extant since the Big Bang and that the modest rise since 1850 is a one-way ticket to boiling the planet alive, they obsess over the \"sources versus sinks\" balance in the carbon cycle for no valid reason whatsoever.\nActually, the continuously shifting carbon balance of the planet over any reasonable period of time is a big, so what!\n - This article appeared at <url normalizedValue=\"https://brownstone.org/articles/wildfires-and-the-hoary-hoax-of-a-burning-planet/\">Brownstone Institute</url> and reposted from Stockman's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.davidstockmanscontracorner.com/wildfires-fried-smelt-and-the-hoary-hoax-of-a-burning-planet/\">personal service</url><br/>", "Heat and haze are expected to become more prevalent in North Dakota as the week wears on, though temperatures aren't likely to hit triple digits in most areas and wildfire smoke isn't expected to cause widespread health concerns.\nThe National Weather Service forecast for central and western North Dakota calls for above-normal temperatures by Thursday, climbing into the 90s and staying there through the weekend.

The Weather Service advises people who will be outdoors to wear light, loose-fitting and light-colored clothing, apply sunscreen, drink plenty of water and take regular breaks in the shade.\nNorth Dakota is on the periphery of the Western heat dome and the warmth will be \"nothing too crazy,\" Jones said, though she added that \"It's not out of the question that we could see some highs around 100 in the southwest on Saturday.\"\nMeanwhile, wildfire smoke from Canada is once again moving southward.\n\"It's just based on the upper air pattern -- you've got a flow that's really connecting us to northwest Alberta, where there are a lot of wildfires going on right now,\" Jones said.\nThe wildfires in Canada haven't been as extreme as they were last summer, when blazes\u00a0scorched about 45 million acres -- an area about the size of North Dakota.\u00a0The fires that stretched from the western provinces east to Quebec sent smoke south on a regular basis over the summer of 2023, leading to unhealthy air on many occasions.\nWildfires so far this summer have burned fewer than 3 million acres north of the border,\u00a0according to the\u00a0Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.\nMuch of the smoke expected in North Dakota this week is likely to remain high above the ground, meaning there will be hazy skies, a smoke smell and bright red-orange sunrises and sunsets, but no widespread ground-level health dangers.\n\"Certainly not near as bad as some of the days we had last summer,\" Jones said.\nAir quality in most of the state including Bismarck-Mandan on Tuesday was rated \"moderate,\" though areas in north central North Dakota and just across the U.S.-Canada border were rated \"unhealthy for sensitive groups,\" according to\u00a0AirNow, a partnership of federal and state agencies including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nWildfire smoke is particularly dangerous because it contains tiny particulate matter, the tiniest of pollutants. When inhaled, it can move deep into lung tissue and enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources including the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires. Such smoke has been linked to several health complications including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.\nInformation on wildfires and air quality is on the state Department of Environmental Quality website, at\u00a0bit.ly/3OhrD7E.", "There are many recognizable, man-made natura landmarks in the world. Stonehenge immediately comes to mind. The Pyramids, of course. The Roman Colosseum.\nAnd, certainly, the carved Moai Statues of Easter Island.\nNow some of those statues have been damaged in what authorities are saying is a deliberate act.\nAccording to numerous reports, including a story in USA Today, several of the statues were charred by a forest fire that covered 247 acres of Easter Island - a fire that authorities believe might be a case of arson.\nThe fire happened on Monday at Rapa Nui National Park on Eastern Island.\n\"The damage to some of the giant head statues is \"irreparable and with consequences beyond what your eyes can see,\" Ariki Tepano, director of the administration and maintenance of the park, wrote on Facebook Wednesday.\nEaster Island is located 2,000 miles off the coast of Chile in South America and has long been a tourist, bucket-list kind of destination for visitors. According to California-based Khan Academy, the stone statues \"were probably carved to commemorate important ancestors and were made from around 1000 C.E. until the second half of the seventeenth century. Over a few hundred years the inhabitants of this remote island quarried, carved and erected around 887 moai. The size and complexity of the moai increased over time, and it is believed that Hoa Hakananai'a dates to around 1200 C.E.\"\nIn an interview with Radio PAUTA, the mayor of Rapa Nui, Pedro Edmunds Paoa, said the fire was \"not an accident\" and that \"all the fires on Rapa Nui are caused by human beings. There is no money to prevent fires on Easter Island in the more than 32,000 archaeological sites. To prevent fire, we need to have guards permanently at the sites,\" he said, according to USA Today.\nAirGuide and Pyramid Media connects you to an affluent, influential group of business and leisure travelers from across the globe with our Advertising Multimedia Network, Advertising eMail: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:advert@AirGuideOnline.com\">advert@AirGuideOnline.com</email> and Elevate your Customer Experience with our Tech and Content Solutions.

According to news reporting out of Nuevo Leon, Mexico, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Recently, a decrease in insect abundance and diversity has been described, as well as an alteration of the forest fire regime. Due to the sensitivity of butterflies to environmental changes, we studied the richness of butterflies in 2 forests, one affected by fire and the other without signs of fire.\" \n<br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Autonomous University Nuevo Leon, \"By means of transect sampling and butterfly trapping during the 4 seasons of the year, the floristic and butterfly diversity was determined. The analysis of the data obtained showed that the forest with fire had a greater diversity of flowers and butterflies than the control area. Comparing the 2 forests, a dissimilarity of 27% and 41% was confirmed between the species richness of flowers and butterflies, respectively. In addition, a significant variation in the presence of flowers and butterflies was observed throughout the year in the burned area, which was not significant in the control area.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Therefore, it is important to study the effect of forest fires on plant and animal diversity, and to consider their results in forest management plans.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Post-fire Butterfly Diversity In a Pine-oak Forest In Northeast Mexico.

After surviving against the odds and being nursed back to health, the bear was brought to the Smithsonian Museum, where he was given a permanent home. Here, he became the real life Smokey Bear and the nation fell in love with him ever since.\nTo help celebrate Smokey's birthday, the Lakeview library is hosting a \"Smokey Bear Summer Reading Challenge,\" where students will be challenged with reading books related to wildfires and learning about forest safety and fire prevention.\nThe challenge can be found on the libraries Beanstack app, or at its website, lakeviewarealibrary.org. The challenge will have readers read specific books or complete simple activities. Once all activities are complete, the reader can earn a prize.\nThe event kicks off on July 23 with Goddard State Park educator Megan McDowell and, of course, Smokey Bear, coming to help teach kids about wildfire safety.\nMcDowell will begin the day with a short educational lesson, and a fire engine from Sandy Lake will be brought in for the kids to see. After that, the kids will participate in a water bucket relay race to put out a fire. Then Smokey will make his appearance riding on a brush truck while kids sing Happy Birthday for him.\nKids will hear a Smokey Bear book reading and have a photo time with Smokey. Afterward, children will receive a certificate with their name and a goodie bag filled with a comic book, fidget toy, balloon, pins, pens and other information things.\n\"It's important for kids to understand how quickly a brush fire is able to start and spread. Kids often do things because it's fun without thinking of the next step,\" Katelyn Struthers, library director, said. \"Last year, Sandy Lake had a fire start and got pretty big because someone tried to burn cardboard. We want to help kids see the next step.\"\nThe challenge will run until Nov. 1 to give kids time to finish after their usual summer reading. Prizes for finishing the challenge have yet to be set, though Struthers, a firefighter with Jackson Center Volunteer Fire Company, said she is hoping to keep the prizes on theme.\nShe suggested, though she didn't make a final decision, fire alarms, fire retardant blankets, at home fire extinguishers and a Smokey Bear book as well as gift cards and other small prizes.\n\"This started as just a little program, but we have quickly turned this into something I think kids can be really excited for and have fun,\" Struthers said. \"I hope to keep this energy and fun with our reading challenges and other projects.\"\nTy Kohler can be contacted at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tkohler@alliednews.com\">tkohler@alliednews.com</email>\n___ (c)2024 the Allied News (Grove City, Pa.)

Ice cores provide invaluable information that is used to determine past climate and environmental conditions.\n\"This is only the second study to publish a deep ice core record from the lower 48 states,\" said Susan Kaspari, CWU geological sciences professor, who led the research. \"It's unusual to get valuable environmental records from glaciers that are low elevation, but the black carbon record is less affected by melt, so the record stayed well preserved. We were also really lucky to be able to date the core well. One of the ways we dated the ice core was from an ash horizon from the 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption.\"\nBlack carbon, also referred to as soot, comes from gas and diesel engines, coal-fired power plants, wildfires, and other sources. It's a major component of air pollution and an important contributor to climate change.\nKaspari and her team found that black carbon concentrations were highest during the period 1940-1960 when black carbon was 16 times higher than during pre-industrial times. The dramatic increase is attributed to domestic coal burning and forest fire emissions during those two-decades.\nKaspari and previous CWU Master of Science student Dan Pittenger, the journal article's co-author, drill a shallow ice core on South Cascade Glacier in 2014.Interestingly, the South Cascade ice core showed the period of peak black carbon concentrations in Washington was later than other regions that industrialized earlier, such as the United States' East Coast and Europe due to the relatively small population in the Evergreen State before World War II.\nThe ice core from the South Cascade Glacier, a small valley glacier in the North Cascades Range, was collected by United States Geological Survey scientists in 1994 and was stored at the National Ice Core Laboratory until 2013 when Kaspari and her team gained access to it.\n\"We're also using the ice core record to tell us about the factors contributing to glacier and snowmelt in the region,\" she pointed. \"When black carbon is deposited on snow and glacier surfaces, it darkens the surface and causes more energy from the sun to be absorbed, leading to faster melt.\"\nThe CWU research is gaining national attention. It will be published in the June 16 issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres.

Forest Service firefighters as the risk of wildfire continues to decrease.\nA ban on open burning issued April 3 because of hazardous forest-fire conditions was lifted Monday, and the process for obtaining a burn permit is again open. While burn permits are available, state officials are asking people to be aware of the risks when burning yard debris and to consider putting it off through the end of May because careless burning is a leading cause of wildfires in the state, Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said in a press release.\n\"Recent rainfall across the state, especially in our western counties, has helped with dry conditions, but it is important to remember that we are still in the midst of spring wildfire season and the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Troxler said. \"Preventing escaped debris burns is something each of us can do to protect our communities and our first responders.\"\nBurn permits are available only online because all Forest Service offices are closed to the public because of COVID-19. Burn permits issued before the ban went into effect on April 3 were canceled, so residents who had one of those permits now have to obtain a new one before burning.\nThe National Weather Service's spring outlook shows an increased likelihood of above-normal temperatures through the end of May, bringing with them the slightly increased chance of above-normal rainfall. That continues a trend over the last six months of above-normal rainfall over the central and western parts of the state.\nAccording to Forest Service data, wind speeds of more than 10 miles per hour, a relative humidity of less than 25 percent and temperatures above 60 degrees greatly influence the behavior of fire in the Blue Ridge Escarpment.\nThrough the first 20 days of April, the Forest Service has fought 496 fires that burned more than 1,000 acres. So far this year, NCFS has documented 1,420 fires covering 6,382.4 acres.\n___ (c)2020 the News-Topic (Lenoir, N.C.)

The type of maple harvested by the defendants is highly prized and used to produce musical instruments.\nOn August 3, 2018, the group decided to cut a maple tree that contained a wasp's nest near the base of the tree. To remove the nest, the group sprayed insecticide and gasoline on the nest and base of the tree and then lit the nest on fire. The group failed to extinguish the fire, which developed into a wildfire later named the \"Maple Fire.\" The Maple Fire consumed more than 3,300 acres between August and November 2018 and cost approximately $4.2 million to contain. WILLIAMS did not himself set the fire, but was present when others set the fire.\nWILLIAMS pleaded guilty in December 2019.\nIn their sentencing memo, prosecutors highlighted the danger of Wilke and WILLIAMS's conduct. \"Forest fires present a dire and growing threat in this region. They destroy our forests, poison our air, and endanger responders, local residents, recreationalists, and wildlife. When this fire occurred in early August 2018, the Puget Sound region was (as it is today) already experiencing significant smoke from existing wildfires, and the high risk of fire was evident to everyone in Western Washington. Despite this atmosphere, Williams participated in taking the extreme risk of setting fire to a portion of a tree-deep in the forest, in mid-summer. The consequences of that decision-thousands of acres burned, millions of dollars in containment costs, and the release of huge amounts of smoke-were easily foreseeable.\"\nThe case was investigated by the United States Forest Service. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Will Dreher.

In these dark times, I close my eyes and see fuchsia blossoms buzzing with bumblebees. 2021 was the second year we've been living through this pandemic, and it's been hard. I've been feeling this sense of languishing, so I know you've probably been feeling it too. We are grieving. We've been sick and we've lost friends or family, our elders. Our jobs might've changed, our business shut down. Looking forward to a new year is hard for many of us. There's a lot of anxiety. This brings me back to the fireweed. I'm thinking about fireweed because fireweed gives me hope.\nFireweed is a gift from Tlingit Aan\u00ed. In our Ling\u00edt language it's called l\u00f3ol. I look to Tlingit Aan\u00ed to help heal, to enliven, to balance my life so this leads me to consider the lessons of the fireweed. What lessons can this flower offer us as we reflect on 2021 and move forward into 2022?\nPreparing: As snow keeps falling, we're not thinking about what the plants are doing in the winter, but the fireweed is there preparing for the next year. It's ever-present. It's still there under three feet of snow. The fireweed plant is an expert at preparing. This is one of the most important lessons we receive from this plant. We often think about other seasons as times to prepare for winter, but winter is also a time to prepare for our upcoming busy seasons. Fireweed tea is made from the leaves. High in vitamins A and C and there's an art to fermenting and preparing the tea for use in winter. If you're enjoying fireweed tea in the winter, you've practiced preparedness.\nGrowth and Tolerance: Fireweed grows along our roadsides, in disturbed areas, in our logged forests, along the borders of meadows, forests, and streams. It expands in a large and long-lived structure of shallow roots. It's tolerant of acidic, neutral, and alkaline soils. We can surely learn growth and tolerance from the fireweed. This winter, let's ask ourselves where we need to grow? In the fireweed's world there's always room for growth.\nBeauty: Fireweed are determined to share their beauty. A k\u00e1x yan ayd\u00e9l w\u00e9 tl'\u00e1tgi \u2014 We are stewards of the air land and sea. When we walk through a field of fireweed, we sense that the beauty in the moment is just for us, that this plant was created so we could share the world with bees and beauty. We are a part of that beauty.\nPersistence: You know why I like fireweed? Because they're one of the first plants to grow up after the land has burned from forest fire. They grow in adversity where nothing else does. Yee gu.aa y\u00e1x x'w\u00e1n. Be strong and have courage. Be a Fireweed!\nReclaim a place and space: Fireweed loves open spaces. It's the plant that returns and reclaims a place and beautifies it. One single plant can produce 80,000 seeds. It doesn't stop feeding places even in winter. We humans can claim a winter space too. Make space in the winter for art, storytelling, renewing relationships, planning, or learning something new. Make space for taking care of our Elders. Reclaim your winter space as a place for dreams.\nRoots: Consider where we come from: our clans, the land, our ancestors. Toow\u00fa klag\u00e9 haa t'aakx'\u00ed, ka haa naax sateey\u00ed, ka haa kusteey\u00ed. Have pride in our family and our clan and our traditions. I'm both Tlingit and Hawaiian. Alaska and Hawaii are two of my favorite places in the world and my favorite fireweed flavor combo is fireweed and dragon fruit. Fireweed teaches us to be diverse, to know who we are. Our roots are important, they're what holds us to place, and form our first relationships, which is to the land.\nEndurance: Over these last few years, we've witnessed how climate change is affecting the fireweed. But still, they endure. Yee toow\u00fa klatseen. Be strong. I've seen some strange alien-looking fireweed plants with thicker stalks. I've seen fireweed \"bushes\" rather than single stalk plants. I saw a fireweed that had more than 20 new start tips growing along the entire stalk. I've never seen a single fireweed with that many tips. I've seen fireweed stalks with bent shapes, and some with curled ends, and square stalks (not round), and some with leaves bunched together. But still, they endure.\nCommunity: We are like fireweed rhizomes. We are community so we must to tend to our community. Wooch eenx haa isteey\u00ed, wooch dusx\u00e1ni, wooch \u00e9et wutudasheey\u00ed. When we're together, we love each other, we help each other. Our community is resilient like the fireweed. In fact, fragmenting the rhizomes stimulates the shoots to grow. By harvesting fireweed, we are tending to our community because we're going to make something with it and gift it away. We're also helping the plant community flourish. This tending to our community is important, especially in the winter. We are rhizomes growing from roots, reaching out together to make a forest of fireweed.\nPeace: Whenever I walk into a field of fireweed, I sense peace. Tl\u00e9l k\u00fatx i y\u00e1a wdaw\u00f3odlik\u2014Have patience. This past year, in the moments the rain stopped, I walked my dog around the neighborhood and through the fireweed meadows. I picked fireweed blossoms and dried some and infused them in honey. I picked fireweed and brewed a mixed tea of s'ikshald\u00e9en (Labrador tea), blueberries, thimbleberry and ginger.\nHealing: Winter can be healing. For our minds it can be a time of reflection. For our bodies it provides rest. Fireweed medicine is good medicine that can assist us. Fireweed can be used as a decongestion for coughs and asthma, ulcers, gastritis, and colitis. Fireweed also has anti-inflammatory properties and has been used for arthritis and rheumatism. Tlingit Aan\u00ed provides many healing plants for us.\nFireweed (Chamerion angustifolium) offers us lesson at every stage including the dormant stage as it prepares for spring. Fireweed is a member of the Evening Primrose family (Onagraceae). It's a perennial growing from 4 to 6 feet high up to 9 feet high. It's a valued food for humans and animals too like deer, moose, caribou, rabbits, and muskrats.\nFireweed is my favorite harbinger of spring and it's one of the best first spring vegetables. As soon as the snow is gone, look for it. A lot of people don't notice when fireweed shoots come up, and by the time they do, its past the edible stage. Fireweed stalks, leaves, and blossoms are good to combine with other plants and foods. I've made fireweed scones, honey, jelly, smoothies, muffins, sauces, tea, lemonade, syrup and dressings. Fireweed shoots can be pickled and steamed, and the buds can be added to salads or pickled as capers. I make teas from dried or fermented leaves.\nThis winter, as we inhabit this winter space, as we layer on socks and long underwear, as we clomp in our cleats across ice and shovel the driveway yet again, think of the fireweed lessons. Fireweed lessons include preparedness, growth and tolerance, beauty, persistence, reclamation, roots, endurance, community, peace, and healing. Maybe we can all try to be a bit of fireweed.\n\u07e6 Y\u00e9ilk' Vivian Mork writes the Planet Alaska column with her mother, Vivian Faith Prescott.

If possible, use an existing site, or pick a site where vegetation is absent.\nIt In, Pack It Out - Inspect the campsite, picnic area, or rest site for trash or spilled foods. Pack out all trash, leftover food, and litter, leaving the place cleaner than you found it.\n* Answering Nature's Call - Find a spot at least 200 feet from any water source. Dig a hole 6-8 inches deep and bury human waste. Pack out used toilet paper and feminine products to prevent animals from digging them up.\nBe Considerate of Others - Respect each other and yield on the trail. Step to the downhill side of the trail when encountering pack stock. Take breaks and camp away from trails and other visitors. Avoid loud voices or noises and let nature's sounds prevail.\n* Pets in the Forest - Pets should be leashed in developed recreation sites, including campgrounds, picnic areas, and trailheads. Along the trail, there may be additional signs instructing pet owners to keep pets on-leash. Remember to pick up and pack out pet waste.\n* Respect Access - Stay out of closed areas. Do not trespass and do not cross private lands unless given permission. Leave gates as you found them, whether opened or closed. Do not cut fences as they keep livestock confined. Remember it is illegal to deface or destroy trees, signs, outbuildings, or other objects on federal lands.\n* Ride Ethically - Always stay on designated Forest roads and trails as they are designed using industry best practices to be environmentally sustainable. Go over, not around, obstacles to avoid widening trails. Remember it is illegal to ride cross-country on NFS lands, and motorized vehicles and bicycles are not allowed in wilderness areas.

They contained the initial blazes, but new fires raged closer to the decommissioned plant.\nEmergencies Service chief Mykola Chechetkin reported to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that rains helped firefighters put out the flames, but acknowledged that it would take a few more days to extinguish smoldering grass.\nChechetkin said emergency workers have prevented the fire from engulfing radioactive waste depots and other facilities in Chernobyl.\nThe 2,600-square-kilometer (1,000-square-mile) Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was established after the 1986 disaster at the plant that sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over much of Europe.

Movement of critical food supplies, emergency health care, essential cargo, emergency evacuation, forest fire fighting services are just a few examples of what regional and community airports deliver in addition to passenger air travel\".\nAccording to the RCAC all airports have been hit with severe reductions in revenues and reduced or canceled air service leaving them unable to meet the costs of operating the airports unless governments step in with direct financial support soon.\n\"2020 has been a year of deep staffing cuts and reducing services, under the pressure of exceptional revenue loses, to meet fixed operational and safety costs dictated by government regulation along with new pandemic related costs to ensure the safety and confidence of travelers\", continues Mr. Grant. \"In 2021 these airports are estimating upwards of 45-60% increases in rates and fees charged to airlines and passengers to continue operations as they exist today. In most cases reserve funds have been depleted and the only possible reductions left are closures of airport infrastructure\".\nRecommendations highlighted by the national organization for effective support include:\nEnsure regional and community airports' eligibility to all federal COVID assistance programs (i.e. emergency wage subsidy, debit relief and loans programs, and rent subsidy etc.) regardless of governance or ownership model.\nStabilize the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy for airports to not less than 75% for 2021 to protect the employment capabilities of these airports for employees.\nProvide financial assistance to cover fixed operating costs at 2019 levels to eliminate deficits and avoid rates and fees increases in order to bolster airline and travel activity.\nIncrease Airport Capital Assistance Program funding to $95 mil annually (an industry request prior to the COVID-19 pandemic dating back more than two years).\nAdjust the federal contribution limit to the ACAP to not less than 75% of eligible project costs and relax the eligibility requirement of commercial schedule passenger service for current eligible airports for 2021 through 2025, to ensure the protection and maintenance of essential infrastructure and equipment during the post-pandemic recovery period.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from US Eturbo News.

They contained the initial blazes, but new fires raged closer to the decommissioned plant.\nEmergencies Service chief Mykola Chechetkin reported to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that rains helped firefighters put out the flames, but acknowledged that it would take a few more days to extinguish smoldering grass.\nChechetkin said emergency workers have prevented the fire from engulfing radioactive waste depots and other facilities in Chernobyl.\nThe 2,600-square-kilometer (1,000-square-mile) Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was established after the 1986 disaster at the plant that sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over much of Europe. The zone is largely unpopulated, although about 200 people have remained despite orders to leave.\nUkraine's emergencies service said radiation levels in the capital, Kyiv, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the plant, were within norms after the forest fires.\nPresident Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians not to panic.\n\"We all remember the lessons of April 26, 1986,\" he said in an online statement Tuesday. \"No one is hiding the truth from you. Right now the truth is that the situation there is under control.\"\nOn Monday, activists warned that the blazes were getting dangerously close to waste storage facilities.\nYaroslav Yemelyanenko, a member of the public council under the state agency in charge of the closed zone around the plant, said one fire was raging within 2 kilometers (about 1.2 miles) from one of the radioactive waste depots.\nLast week, officials said they tracked down a person suspected of triggering the blaze by setting dry grass on fire in the area. The 27-year-old man said he burned grass \"for fun\" and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to spread quickly.\nOn Monday, police said that another local resident burned waste and accidentally set dry grass ablaze, triggering another devastating forest fire. They said he failed to report the fire to the authorities.\nBlazes in the area have been a regular occurrence. They often start when residents set dry grass on fire in the early spring - a widespread practice in Ukraine, Russia and some other ex-Soviet nations that often leads to devastating forest fires.", "The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Isaac\nCameco Corporation - Senior VP &amp; CFO\nConference Call Participants\n* Lawson Winder\nBofA Securities, Research Division - VP &amp; Research Analyst\nPresentation\nLAWSON WINDER, VP &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, BOFA SECURITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Hello, everyone. In this segment, we will hear from the only uranium company presenting today. And it happens to be Cameco, the world's second largest producer of the metal used for fuel in reactors. And joining me from Cameco today is Senior Vice President and CFO, Grant Isaac. Grant, welcome to Miami. And I'll turn the podium over to you.\nGRANT E. ISAAC, SENIOR VP &amp; CFO, CAMECO CORPORATION: Great. Thank you very much. If you don't mind, I'm just going to stay here. My tremendous laziness just keeps me right in this chair. It's a good spot to be. I'll make a few opening comments, but happy to go to your questions. At the beginning of that, I just want to, a bit of a shout-out to Lawson on the work that he's been doing in our space lately. It really is a good analysis of what's going on.\nOurs is a market where the fundamentals were improving. I think a lot of people saw nuclear kind of regain its place in the policy toolbox because of the decarbonization push. A lot of question marks around supply because it turns out that markets work after years of pervasive low prices. There wasn't a lot of investment in capacity, and that was starting to build momentum.\nAnd then everything kind of changed on February 24 when Russia invaded Ukraine. And now on top of that fundamental, we're going through an unprecedented geopolitical realignment in our market, which is just code for Western customers are looking to exclude Russia from their nuclear fuel procurement going forward. And Russia is a very big player in that part of our industry. I have no idea how everything is going to work out geopolitically. But I can say with confidence that we are extraordinarily well positioned in a market that's bifurcating. And there's more Western capacity required to meet Western demand.\nSo that's a really important dynamic going on. Hopefully, we can get into that in a little bit more detail. But just a final comment on how we're positioned. For us, the uranium isn't a spot market. It's not one where we see strong prices for spot conversions, spot enrichment, spot uranium and we rush forward to meet it. It's one where you need to secure homes for your planned production and then you make the right decision.\nSo for us, it's about marketing discipline. That continues. We have lots of customers interested in supply. We're looking for those terms and conditions that make sense for us. So marketing discipline then allows you to make the production decisions afterwards that make sense, the best and most economic way to fulfill it. And we're still in supply discipline mode despite how robust everything is looking. We haven't seen the procurement cycle yet to change those supply decisions. Maybe we could see ourselves there.\nBut the final piece I'll mention is just what's interesting is, we're talking about being on really the early innings of a contracting cycle. And we've never started one from such high prices already. Uranium term price starting with a 5. Conversion price has never been higher than it is today. SWU price is starting to approach historic highs. We've never launched a contracting cycle from a base of this stronger prices before. So lots to talk about in our industry, happy to take questions.\nQuestions and Answers\nLAWSON WINDER: I'd share an interesting comment that I heard from a fuel buyer I spoke with 2 weeks ago. His comment was, as this contracting cycle unwinds, people like Cameco are going to be very well placed to enjoy spot markets. Next down would be the assets that had operated but are currently on care and maintenance. And next would be the developers. So I think Cameco is very well placed. But what I wanted to talk about was the last point you made, which is on contracting activity.\nSo with Q4 results, obviously, you guys had a very exciting announcement of 50 million pounds of new contracting. Q1, there was nothing. I mean, you and I both know that it is very lumpy and it tends not to come on a regular basis, but it certainly surprised a lot of market participants. What I wanted to get your perspective on was when do you expect contracting to come back in a very meaningful way. And I know it's very hard to define, but kind of walk us through your framework.\nGRANT E. ISAAC: Yes. Good question. And here's our expectation. But one quick clarification, we contracted 40 million pounds in Q1. We just contracted it. And we're prepared to announce it in early February when we put out our Q4 release. So Q1 actually was one of our biggest contracting quarters ever.\nSo just a bit of history, in 2021, utilities were really paying attention to uranium supply. We saw a lot of uranium contracting going on because of that fundamental story that we were talking about. Us and our competitors in the industry were seeing a lot of interest in uranium. But that changed also on February 24. Utilities shifted their attention from where's my long-run uranium coming from to where's my enrichment and conversion going to come from?\nJust a reminder, Russia, about 40% of the global enrichment capacity is Russian. About 30% of the global conversion capacity is Russian. They're about 14% of global supply of uranium. They're 50% of the secondary supplies in our market. So utilities turned their attention from where is the uranium coming from to starting to contract the enrichment service.\nWe saw a 40% jump in the enrichment price 2 weeks ago. It went from $72 per unit enriched to $120 per unit enriched. That reflects the panic that's setting in among those Western fuel buyers to secure the non-Russian source of enrichment. Once they have their enrichment lined up, they then have to turn their attention to, I need the feedstock. And so their next focus will be on the conversion sector, which is already pricing strong. We expect to see more strength in conversion. We provide conversion. We're the only North American converter right now operating.\nAnd then they will return their attention to uranium because now you need the product to which you're going to apply these services. So February 24 was a bit of a change, and it really shifted attention downstream. And so uranium contracting will pick up again when they feel comfortable with their enrichment coverage and then their conversion coverage and then we'll see the return to the uranium demand in a big way.\nLAWSON WINDER: A lot of great material there. I would like to touch on blue sky. So I often get the comment from investors that Cameco, an investment in Cameco is capped because of your contract book, which I would note, it only goes out 5 years. And I would also note fails to account for the fact that you're also not fully contracted on that contract book and then there's still all the contracting that you can do beyond the year 2025 where you provide that guidance. Could you walk us through sort of the theoretical capacity that Cameco has in still uncontracted material? And I know it's probably dangerous for you to throw percentages, but that type of thing, I think, really helps investors think about what the true blue sky upside is.\nGRANT E. ISAAC: Yes. On that price sensitivity table, we have figured out that there's a lot of misunderstanding about how it's constructed. It only reflects our current committed sales, and we make no representation of an assumed production rate at certain spot prices. And so really, we vigorously retain 3 points of leverage to this market.\nNumber one is, we have a number of existing contracts that are market-related. And so as the uranium price goes up, we get the pickup of the higher prices in those existing contracts. They have a little bit of a kicker on them, too, in that utilities tend to be procyclical. In a rising uranium market, they flex up their contracts not flex down. The psychology there is the price is obviously rising because the product is getting scarce, I should flex up and take more of it. So market-related is our first point of leverage.\nSecond point of leverage is exactly what you talked about. It's the pounds we haven't sold yet. I mean, we are not trying to be sold out right now. We like to be covered in year. We like to have a good comfortable amount of coverage next year. And then we don't mind that uncommitted to fall off dramatically because we think that there's a better pricing environment for those pounds. And so take, for example, the extreme supply discipline at McArthur River. 115 million pounds left in the ground when uranium was $17.75 a pound. And now it's pricing at $50 a pound. That's a pretty good investment in supply discipline by leaving that material inventory into the ground.\nSo that's the second point of leverage, the pounds that haven't been sold and we're far from sold out. We're still in supply discipline mode. Yes, we're bringing McArthur back, but we're going to operate it at a lower than full capacity rate. And we're planning on bringing Cigar Lake back in 2024 as well because the procurement cycle isn't quite there yet. So we will run in 2024 on current plans at 40% below our productive capacity. We make no effort to sell the remaining 40% of supply. It's not our interest right now because we want to be leveraged to that market.\nBut there's a third piece of leverage that's really crucial too. And that is when utilities truly go into a security of supply driven mode reflected in the conversation you had with them. They don't turn to the greenfield projects and take a chance on schedule and risk. They turn to the incumbents that they already have contracts with and they say, look, I don't have time to start a brand-new RFP. I don't have time to launch a brand-new negotiation. We already have a purchase order. Let's just expand the volumes. So we vigorously protect the market-related leverage, the pounds we haven't sold yet and that incumbent advantage because we like to put that business into an up market, not a down market.\nLAWSON WINDER: Fill in the blanks a little bit on the contract book beyond 2025. How far out does it go out and how quickly does it sort of fall off?\nGRANT E. ISAAC: Well, we have about, in that contract table that we announced over the next 5 years, we have about 100 million pounds under contract. But then every year, we disclose that our entire book is about 150 million pounds. So we still have a lot of volume that's outside that 5-year window. We're starting to see in our market, began to see it last year, utilities started shifting their procurement back to a traditional mode. When the spot market was so horrendously oversupplied following Fukushima, the spot market became the home for a bunch of surplus production that didn't have a home. So it got dumped into the spot market in a low interest rate environment, utilities said to themselves, hey, I don't want to pay term prices for uranium. I want to pay spot prices forward. And so they were finding financial intermediaries to buy in the spot market, carry it on a carry trade and take it into the early part of term contracting, and this broke the term price.\nThe term price, instead of being anchored to production economics, was anchored to the forward curve of spot. Utilities then saw Sprott enter the market and start buying a lot of material. We bought a lot of material. The spot market became very, very thin. We actually entered backwardation. And as we entered backwardation, the most expensive pounds were the carry trade pounds. So the carry trade business basically dried up, then interest rates are starting to rise, which condemns the carry trade business going forward.\nSo utilities have gone back to taking bigger bites out of the market. So the tenor of the contracts have gone from 2 to 5 years, 2 to 7. Now we're seeing 2 to 10. The time frames are getting bigger. We had a contract that we announced in Q1 that was 2030 to 2040. So the window that utilities are looking at is getting bigger, reflecting their confidence in their reactor programs and volumes are going up. Not just because there's more years being added, but they're taking bigger bites out of the market. So no surprise, the underlying term price of uranium is back reflecting production economics as opposed to reflecting the carry trade on spot.\nLAWSON WINDER: Well said. Now a really interesting point in your Q1 results was the delayed material from Inkai. And I mean, you cited insurance concerns, but also other concerns. Maybe you could just speak to that other part. And also, why is there a delay in arranging an alternate route to get that material from Kazakhstan to the rest of the world, aside from Russia, because my understanding was you guys had already established that route. It was Caspian, Georgia, Azerbaijan into Black Sea.\nGRANT E. ISAAC: Yes. So we have a joint venture with Kazatomprom. It's an extraordinary joint venture with a great partner and a partner that's doing a tremendous job in a very difficult situation. And they can explain it better than we can for sure.\nFrom a Cameco perspective, we're very, very risk averse, and that's a part of the world we don't understand as well as our joint venture partner does. Our joint venture partner might look at forest fire risk in Northern Saskatchewan and say, that's crazy. Well, we can manage forest fire risk. We look at risk in that part of the world and we just don't understand it as well, and we're very risk averse. And so we've taken the position for a variety of reasons that range from the ability to secure insurance, the predictability of the transport system. We don't want to use the Russian route. And we've also taken the position, we shouldn't use the Russian route. And that is the exclusive route for getting Central Asian supply out of that part of the world.\nThere is an alternative route that's been established. It's been used by our joint venture partner. They've successfully used it. An Inkai shipment has actually successfully used it last year. But we just put that disclosure in because it's not clear to us. We can't predict at the moment when that route is going to be available for us. And so we just said, we're going to leave our material in-country. Now the good news for Cameco, we've got production sources in other parts of the world. We've got our long-term purchase program. We've got an inventory. It's a minor problem for us. It's just time and money is all it will take to get access to it.\nBut if you think about it from a utility point of view, it's actually a growing uncertainty and potential problem for the nuclear fuel supply because a lot of conversion facilities in the world require that material from Central Asia. So if there's delays, that's just going to delay the supply chain, which with the tightness in the market, you wonder how much it can tolerate those delays. So for us, it's a manageable problem. It's systemically a bigger challenge for the industry. It just reflects a different risk tolerance that we have because we don't understand that part of the world as well as others do.\nLAWSON WINDER: That's an excellent perspective. And I'll leave it there on that topic because I think we're going to get into a bit more tomorrow on our uranium plant panel at 10 a.m. What I would like to do is ask about conversion because that is something very specific to Cameco. So one thing, conversion prices, as you mentioned, are very strong, possibly at all-time highs. What do you see as the risk or something that could actually cause that to correct? But in the current environment, how does Cameco take advantage of that?\nAnd then secondly, in relation to that, the World Nuclear Association publishes this data on capacity and capacity utilization. They always show you guys using about 70% of your UF6 capacity utilization. Is it possible for you to displace what the rest of that unused capacity is currently being used for to take advantage of the higher prices?\nGRANT E. ISAAC: Yes. A lot to unpack there. Conversion is the tightest part of the nuclear fuel cycle at the moment. Western demand for conversion, just throw a few numbers at you, 35,000 tonnes of conversion is needed. Western supply is around 20,000 tonnes. So there's a 15,000 tonne gap.\nOn top of that, the enrichers need more conversion because while they're going to add more capacity to displace the Russian capacity, one way they can get more enrichment out of their plant is to what's called overfeed it, which is just code for they need more UF6 going into it, use it less efficiently. And that's another 6,000 tonnes on top of that. But the good news over time for the conversion industry is, well, there's a plant in the U.S. that's at 0 today. And it will come back to 7,000 tonnes, probably 10,000. There's a plant in France that's running at half capacity and it will go up to 15,000 tonnes. We're at 12,500. And the enricher overfeed will only last until they install new capacity.\nSo on balance, Western conversion to 2027, 2028 could catch up or there'll just be a small gap. So for us, it isn't about jamming a whole bunch of new production into the conversion space because we live through the times when it was oversupplied and we were running our plant at half capacity. So the goal for us is to fill it up, get those margins as good as we can, lock in these historic prices, but not forget that there's capacity that needs to come back and will come back with some of these restarts.\nLAWSON WINDER: Okay. That's great perspective. Thank you for the conversation today. Unfortunately, we are out of time. So thank you all for being here listening to our presentation, and thank you, Grant, for being here.\nGRANT E. ISAAC: Great.

It's an essential component of lab instruction for many Virginia Tech faculty in the College of Natural Resources and Environment, including Carolyn Copenheaver, an associate professor who teaches forest ecology.\nBut because these outdoor labs don't take place in a traditional classroom, students often let their guards down.\nA few years ago, Copenheaver was approached by female students sharing their experiences of harassment in the field.\nThat's when she realized that something had to change.\nFast forward a few years, and Copenheaver now is leading a charge to address sexual misconduct and harassment in her courses, which all involve field labs. In the process, she has become an outspoken resource for helping other faculty to maneuver this delicate topic.\nIn October, Copenheaver, along with three other colleagues, published the results of numerous focus group discussions with faculty at universities across the country. The discussions centered on how to address and prevent sexual harassment in higher education agriculture and natural resources programs with outdoor lab spaces.\nThe findings, which outline a list of best practices for faculty, were published in the North American College and Teachers of Agriculture journal: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nactateachers.org\">https://www.nactateachers.org</url>/\nThe work was funded by a USDA Higher Education Challenge Grant, and Copenheaver said she hopes to apply for another grant to continue this work.\nShe also has spoken with several professional groups about the work.\nFor many years, even during her own time in college, Copenheaver said she normalized some of the behavior and language that she heard in her forestry classes. She chalked up the language to the fact that the majority of students in those courses are male and some of the words were spoken as jokes. For example, in some of her classes for forestry majors at Virginia Tech, there may be only one female student among an all-male roster.\nCopenheaver herself was one of few females in her master's and doctoral programs, and she now recalls being a victim of sexual harassment. She heard certain language so often that she assumed it was what women had to endure in her field.\n\"I didn't even know that's what it was,\" she said.\nHer work over the last few years has opened her eyes to changes that she needs to make to ensure that her students feel secure.\n\"They [students] know how to behave in a classroom; they've been doing it since kindergarten,\" Copenheaver said. \"But we're driving to the woods, and people's informal behavior comes out.

It's an essential component of lab instruction for many Virginia Tech faculty in the College of Natural Resources and Environment, including Carolyn Copenheaver, an associate professor who teaches forest ecology.\nBut because these outdoor labs don't take place in a traditional classroom, students often let their guards down.\nA few years ago, Copenheaver was approached by female students sharing their experiences of harassment in the field.\nThat's when she realized that something had to change.\nFast forward a few years, and Copenheaver now is leading a charge to address sexual misconduct and harassment in her courses, which all involve field labs. In the process, she has become an outspoken resource for helping other faculty to maneuver this delicate topic.\nIn October, Copenheaver, along with three other colleagues, published the results of numerous focus group discussions with faculty at universities across the country. The discussions centered on how to address and prevent sexual harassment in higher education agriculture and natural resources programs with outdoor lab spaces.\nThe findings, which outline a list of best practices for faculty, were published in the North American College and Teachers of Agriculture journal. The work was funded by a USDA Higher Education Challenge Grant, and Copenheaver said she hopes to apply for another grant to continue this work.\nShe also has spoken with several professional groups about the work.\nFor many years, even during her own time in college, Copenheaver said she normalized some of the behavior and language that she heard in her forestry classes. She chalked up the language to the fact that the majority of students in those courses are male and some of the words were spoken as jokes. For example, in some of her classes for forestry majors at Virginia Tech, there may be only one female student among an all-male roster.\nCopenheaver herself was one of few females in her master's and doctoral programs, and she now recalls being a victim of sexual harassment. She heard certain language so often that she assumed it was what women had to endure in her field.\n\"I didn't even know that's what it was,\" she said.\nHer work over the last few years has opened her eyes to changes that she needs to make to ensure that her students feel secure.\n\"They [students] know how to behave in a classroom; they've been doing it since kindergarten,\" Copenheaver said. \"But we're driving to the woods, and people's informal behavior comes out. It's my job to police their language, because that's still part of the class, and I still have to create a safe space for all of my students.\"\nThe focus groups outlined a list of best practices for faculty to address sexual harassment upfront with their students.

But early in his undergraduate years, his destinationand the path to get therewas unclear.\nWhat was clearat least to economics professor Ben Hansenwas that Dodier in 2014 displayed an impressive curiosity and work ethic in Hansen's intermediate microeconomics course.\nHansen, whose work in applied microeconomics focuses on crime, health, and labor, is always searching for standout students to undertake research projects for academic and personal growth. He quickly recognized Dodier's talent. \"Matt was one of those students,\" Hansen says, \"who was always attentive, interacted, and then would come to office hours and ask me more questions.\"\nRELATED LINKS\nHansen enlisted Dodier's help as a research assistant. Then, in 2015, Dodier was selected as a Ronald E. McNair Scholar, joining a federal program that prepares first-generation students with financial need and underrepresented students for doctoral studies. He was required to complete a research project of his own, and Hansen served as his mentor.\nThe topic emerged from Dodier's interest in development economics and environmental economics: conducting research on how forest fires impact public health.\nWildfires in Oregon were particularly intense in 2014, and as Dodier and Hansen kicked around ideas related to air pollution, \"the idea of looking at forest fires came up,\" Hansen says. \"That's something that is salient to everybody, but nobody had studied the impact on hospitalizations or its impact on pollution.\"\nDodier examined the effect of wildfire smoke on respiratory health. He collected statewide data on hospital admissions for respiratory problems, forest fire statistics from the Oregon Department of Forestry, unemployment numbers from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, population data from the National Cancer Institute, and land data from the US Department of Agriculture. He then looked at the origin, size, and location of forest fires and data on local particulate matteror air pollutionto measure whether forest fires resulted in more pollution.\nThe research showed that the wildfire smoke emanating from forest fires indeed increased air pollution and caused hospitalizations to rise. That finding, Hansen says, \"speaks to one of the potential costs of a warmer, drier climate where we have more of these fires. And more broadly, it speaks to the role of pollution affecting the health of the local population.\"\nThe issue takes on new relevance as researchers examine the connection between air pollution and COVID-19. A recent study from Harvard, for example, found that Americans living in more polluted areas are more likely to die from the disease than those in clearer regions.\nThe research was Dodier's first taste of a complex, fast-moving project with tough deadlines. The first big hurdle Dodier encountered was accessing the wealth of data he needed in a short amount of time. Then came the arduous task of merging all those disparate data sets to measure the impact of forest fires.\n\"Some of it was just frustrating,\" Dodier says. \"It was really stressful, and it taught me to deal with that.\"\nIt also ignited a passion that still burns in the 2016 graduate today, as a PhD candidate in public policy at Harvard Kennedy School.\nDodier now has a clear path: he's set his sights on a career in academic research as a professor, perhaps not unlike Hansen, who helped Dodier discover where he could go with economics.\n\"I could talk to him about anything, not just econ,\" Dodier says. \"He was always encouraging and he gives real, honest feedback.\"\nBy Emily E.

'Our elected officials are not doing enough to keep us safe.' <br/> The 'State of the Climate' rally, organized by a coalition of environmental groups including 350 Colorado, the Sierra Club, GreenLatinos and Colorado Rising, came as new data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed[1] that the last six months were Colorado's hottest on record. <br/> In a monthly summary[2] released Thursday, state climatologists with the Colorado Climate Center echoed other experts in identifying a warming climate as a key factor in the unprecedented Marshall Fire, which surpassed the 2013 Black Forest Fire to become the most destructive wildfire in state history. 'Underlying climate conditions of drought, record warmth over the previous 6 months, and near record dry air provided all the ingredients,' the report said. <br/> Inside the Capitol, Polis, too, told lawmakers that recent disasters like the Marshall Fire and last year's Glenwood Canyon mudslides underscore the urgency of 'meeting the climate crisis head-on.' <br/> 'I'm grateful for the work my administration has done in partnership with Colorado's legislative leaders to move our state toward a cleaner, more renewable energy future,' Polis said. 'We've set Colorado on a path to reducing emissions statewide.' <br/> But that path isn't aggressive enough for many environmental activists, who want to see more ambitious emissions-cutting policies \u2014 and an approach from state government that includes restricting fossil fuel extraction. Their list of demands[3] to Polis includes the development of a plan by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to phase out drilling by 2030. <br/> 'Fossil fuels are responsible for 80% of carbon emissions, but it's business as usual at the COGCC,' said Christiaan van Woudenberg, an anti-fracking activist and member of the Erie Board of Trustees. 'Not a single permit has been denied. Governor, in order to keep your promises, you need to stop issuing drilling permits.' <br/> Focus on environmental justice <br/><br/>Wednesday wasn't the first time Polis' environmentalist critics have sought to put a spotlight on these issues during his State of the State address. Two years ago, 38 protesters[4] were arrested by Colorado State Patrol officers for a variety of disruptions, including chanting and displaying banners, before and during the governor's speech in the House chamber. The disruption charges were later dropped. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC_0372-scaled.jpeg\">https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC_0372-scaled.jpeg</url> Abolitionist and state House candidate Elisabeth Epps addresses the crowd gathered at the Colorado Capitol for a 'State of the Climate' rally on Jan. 13, 2022. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline) <br/>'No matter how many years in jail they threaten us with, we won't stop our accountability on Polis or any leader that turns their back on us or future generations,' GreenLatinos activist Ean Thomas Tafoya, who was among those arrested in 2020, told the crowd Thursday. <br/> Activists have clashed for years with Polis and his predecessor, Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper, over the rapid expansion of oil and gas drilling activity in Colorado during the last 15 years. That's especially the case when it comes to the fossil-fuel industry's impacts on communities with a long history of pollution, like the neighborhoods that surround the Suncor oil refinery in north Denver and Commerce City or the controversial drilling site[5] near Bella Romero Academy in Greeley. <br/> Thanks in large part to legislation passed by Democrats in the General Assembly, efforts to strengthen protections for 'disproportionately impacted communities' have been launched by multiple state agencies in recent years, including the COGCC, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Colorado Department of Transportation. But now activists want to see those processes produce tangible results. <br/> 'We're tired of being harmed,' said Renee Millard-Chacon, an activist and co-founder of the Indigenous group Womxn from the Mountain. 'We've defined disproportionately impacted communities \u2014 I'm no longer here to define or be on councils. I'm here to finally bring change.' <br/> Other speakers at the rally included Elisabeth Epps, founder of the Colorado Freedom Fund and a recently declared candidate for House District 6. Epps told rallygoers that the struggle for environmental justice and efforts to reform policing and prisons are linked \u2014 noting, for example, that some of those who are hurt the most by more intense and more frequent heat waves are inmates at prisons and jails who often have inadequate air conditioning. <br/> 'There are people in this building that have never stood up to power,' Epps said. 'If you want leaders that are going to take the actions necessary to protect not just our planet but the people and cultures on it, you need to elect leaders that have already been doing that work. <br/> 'I hope this isn't too controversial \u2014 y'all, the Earth is going to make it,' Epps added. 'Do you understand that? The Earth is going to last. It's us that might not make it.' <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/donate\">https://coloradonewsline.com/donate</url><br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2022/01/13/colorado-climate-average/\">https://www.denverpost.com/2022/01/13/colorado-climate-average/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.colostate.edu/monthly_summary.html\">https://climate.colostate.edu/monthly_summary.html</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/unitedforclimatedemands/\">https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/unitedforclimatedemands/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/01/23/colorado-climate-protest-capitol-polis-criminal-charge/\">https://www.denverpost.com/2020/01/23/colorado-climate-protest-capitol-polis-criminal-charge/</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/23/bella-romero-greeley-school-fracking/\">https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/23/bella-romero-greeley-school-fracking/</url>\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

The average number of hectares burnt over the same period between 2008 and 2020 was 1,700 hectares. <br/>\"When this nightmarish summer ends we will reverse the damage as soon as possible,\" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis pledged on Saturday. <br/> The blazes are set to continue with strong winds and high temperatures forecast Photo: Eurokinissi / Sotiris DIMITROPOULOS  <br/>In Pefkofyto, in the north of Athens, pensioner Tasos Tsilivakos struggled to contain his tears. <br/> \"This is a horrible disaster,\" he told AFP. <br/>\"I'm really afraid that maybe only our great-grand children will have the chance to walk again in these areas.\" <br/> In Turkey, eight people have been killed and dozens more hospitalised Photo: AFP / Yasin AKGUL  <br/>One 62-year-old man from nearby Agios Stefanos told Alpha TV how after being evacuated he had had to watch his house burning on television. \"My child is still crying from the shock,\" he said. <br/> In the Evia village of Limni, more than 1,300 people fled the fires on ferry boats. Photo: Eurokinissi / Sotiris DIMITROPOULOS  <br/>Greece and Turkey have been fighting devastating fires for more than a week as the region suffers its worst heatwave in decades. Officials and experts have linked such intense weather events to climate change. <br/>So far, they have killed two people in Greece and eight in Turkey, with dozens more hospitalised there during 10 days of the blazes. <br/>A UN draft report seen by AFP labelled the Mediterranean region a \"climate change hotspot\", warning that heatwaves, droughts and fires would become more fierce in the future, supercharged by rising temperatures. <br/> At least 1,450 Greek firefighters are battling the infernos Photo: AFP / Louisa GOULIAMAKI  <br/>But the weather gave Turkey some respite Saturday. Officials in the Turkish coastal city of Antalya said the blazes were under control in the southwestern province after rainfall there. <br/>And heavy rainfall was expected to continue until the afternoon in areas including Manavgat, one of the most affected by the fires. <br/>The situation remained serious however around the tourist hotspot of Mugla, where at least three neighbourhoods have been ordered to evacuate. <br/> The damage has been significantly more than in previous years Photo: AFP / LOUISA GOULIAMAKI  <br/>There have been over 200 fires in 47 of Turkey's 81 provinces, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Bekir Pakdemirli tweeted early on Saturday. Thirteen fires continue in five provinces. <br/>Greek Civil Protection deputy minister, Nikos Hardalias said on Saturday that 55 blazes were raging across Greece. <br/>They were burning on Evia, the country's second largest island, which lies east of the capital; in the Peloponnese region in the southwest; and in Fthiotida in Central Greece. <br/>The fire front on Evia alone ran across 30 kilometres (18 miles) long, said Fanis Spanos, regional governor of Central Greece, but in Attica peninsula there the situation was \"more stable\". <br/>There is, however, concern as winds are expected to pick up pace later in the day, the Fire Brigade said. <br/>Part of a motorway linking Athens to the north of the country that had been shut down as a precaution was reopened Saturday. <br/>In the northern Evia, where more than 1,300 people fled the fires on ferry boats Friday from the coastal village of Limni, another 23 were evacuated Saturday morning from a nearby beach at Rovies. <br/>Navy warships are on high alert off the north of the island in case more evacuations are required. <br/>Local officials there have already called for more air support in the firefighting efforts warning for hundreds of homeless families. <br/>Fanis Spanos told the Athens News Agency (ANA) that more than 300 families whose homes had been burned down were being sheltered in hotels. <br/>The situation remained dire in Mani, in the Peloponnese, where 5,000 people were evacuated on Friday. <br/>Eleni Drakoulakou, the mayor of East Mani, told ERT TV on Saturday that half the town had been burnt, blaming a lack of water-dropping air support during the critical first hours of the wildfire. <br/>ANA also reported that two people had been charged for arson. <br/>Authorities have banned visits to parks and forests through Greece. <br/>A 43-year-old man was arrested in the area of Krioneri and charged with arson, according to ANA. <br/>", "Australian High Court acquits cardinal of child sex offenses\nCANBERRA, Australia - Cardinal George Pell, who is serving a six-year jail sentence for child sex abuse, has been successful in his bid to overturn his conviction in the Australian High Court.\nPell, 78, will be released immediately today after more than 400 days behind bars.\nThe judgment was handed down by Chief Justice Susan Kiefel in a near-empty courtroom in Brisbane due to coronavirus social distancing restrictions.\nThe appeal was allowed and the High Court ordered Pell's \"convictions be quashed and judgments of acquittal be entered in their place,\" as outlined in a statement sent to media.\nPell was sentenced by a Victoria state County Court judge in March last year to six years in prison for sexually abusing two 13-year-old choirboys in a back room of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne in December 1996 while he was archbishop of Australia's second-largest city.\nPell was also convicted of indecently assaulting one of the boys by painfully squeezing his genitals after a Mass in early 1997. Pell would have had to serve three years and eight months behind bars before he becomes eligible for parole.\nA jury unanimously convicted Pell of all five charges in December 2018, but he was spared prison for three months while he underwent replacement surgery for both knees.\nThe High Court examined whether the Victorian Court of Appeal was correct in its 2-1 majority decision in August to uphold the jury verdicts.\nU.N.: Syria likely behind attacks on 5 facilities\nUNITED NATIONS - A U.N. investigation has concluded it is \"highly probable\" that the Syrian government or its allies were responsible for attacks on five facilities in the last opposition stronghold in the northwest in 2019 - a school, two health care centers, a hospital and a child care facility.\nThe investigators said it is \"probable\" a sixth attack on a Palestinian refugee camp in Aleppo was carried out either by armed opposition groups or by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the strongest militant group in northwest Idlib province that is affiliated with al-Qaida.\nA summary of the 185-page confidential report by a board of inquiry appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was released Monday. It was charged with investigating incidents in the northwest after Russia and Turkey agreed to establish a \"de-escalation zone\" in Idlib on Sept. 17, 2018.\nIraqis report rocket attacks on U.S. oil facility\nThe Iraqi military said Monday that five rocket attacks hit a U.S. oil production facility.\nThe rockets targeted the site of Halliburton in the Burjesia area in the oil-rich Basra province, the military statement said. Two Iraqi security officials and one official at the state-run Basra Oil Company said five rockets at struck the area. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.\nA rocket launcher was subsequently found on the Zubair-Shuaiba road by security forces, according to the statement, with 11 unused missiles that were later defused.\nNo militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the rocket fire. There was no significant damage, the military said, adding that Iraqi security forces in Basra are searching for the perpetrators of the attack.\nHalliburton is an American oil service provider working in the Zubair oil field, which is operated by the Italian ENI.\nMonday's attack was the first since last summer to target U.S. oil companies working in the oil-rich south. A rocket struck an oil-drilling site in Basra last June, landing inside a compound housing energy giant Exxon Mobil, Shell and ENI.\nUkrainians fight forest fire near Chernobyl nuclear site\nKYIV, Ukraine - Emergency teams in Ukraine on Monday continued battling a forest fire in the contaminated area around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant that has raised radiation fears.\nPolice said they tracked down a person suspected of starting the blaze by setting dry grass on fire in the area. The 27-year-old man said he burned grass \"for fun\" and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to expand quickly.\nTwo blazes erupted Saturday in the zone around Chernobyl that was sealed after the 1986 explosion at the plant.\nFirefighters said they managed Monday to put out the smaller of the two fires, which engulfed about 12 acres, but the second one continued burning, covering about 50 acres.\nAuthorities said that radiation levels in the area substantially exceed normal levels, but the emergencies service said radiation levels in the capital, Kyiv, 60 miles south, were within norms.\nMigrants force their way into Spain\nMADRID - Some 50 migrants on Monday forced their way into Spain's Melilla city over the fence that separates the European enclave in northern Africa, authorities there said.\nThe central government's delegation in Melilla, which borders Morocco, said that they were part of a group of around 250 migrants who launched a \"massive and violent entry\" into the city, scaling the fence and ignoring the Spanish law enforcement officers on guard.\nA Red Cross spokesman in the city said that volunteers had assisted several migrants with cuts and bruises at the gates of Melilla's temporary migrant internment center, and that at least four of them had been transferred to a hospital with possible bone fractures and other ailments.\nMelilla and nearby Ceuta are two tiny enclaves separated from Morocco by barbed-wire fences and constant border monitoring.\nPoland will vote for president through the mail\nWARSAW, Poland - Polish lawmakers voted late Monday to conduct the country's forthcoming presidential elections exclusively through postal voting due to the lockdown imposed for the coronavirus pandemic.\nParliament also empowered house speaker Elzbieta Witek to push back the date of the election, if necessary. Both decisions by parliament require approval from the Senate and from President Andrzej Duda, who is seeking reelection.\nTime was pressing for a decision on whether and how to hold the election that had been scheduled - before the pandemic hit - for May 10.

As compared to the assessment of 2019, there is an increase of 2,261 sq km in the total forest and tree cover of the country.\nThe Minister expressed happiness over the fact that the present assessment reveals that 17 states/UTs have above 33 percent of the geographical area under forest cover and stated that the focus of the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is not just to conserve the forests quantitatively but to enrich it qualitatively.\nThe ISFR-2021 provides information on forest cover, tree cover, mangrove cover, growing stock, carbon stock in Indias forests, forest fire monitoring, forest cover in tiger reserve areas, above ground estimates of biomass using SAR data and climate change hotspots in Indian forests.\nMAJOR FINDINGS\nThe total forest and tree cover of the country is 80.9 million hectare which is 24.62 percent of the geographical area of the country. As compared to the assessment of 2019, there is an increase of 2,261 sq km in the total forest and tree cover of the country. Out of this, the increase in the forest cover has been observed as 1,540 sq km and that in tree cover is 721 sq km.\nIncrease in forest cover has been observed in open forest followed by very dense forest. Top three states showing increase in forest cover are Andhra Pradesh (647 sq km) followed by Telangana (632 sq km) and Odisha (537 sq km).\nArea-wise Madhya Pradesh has the largest forest cover in the country followed by Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Maharashtra. In terms of forest cover as percentage of total geographical area, the top five States are Mizoram (84.53%), Arunachal Pradesh (79.33%), Meghalaya (76.00%), Manipur (74.34%) and Nagaland (73.90%).\n17 states/UTs have above 33 percent of the geographical area under forest cover. Out of these states and UTs, five states/UTs namely Lakshadweep, Mizoram, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya have more than 75 percent forest cover while 12 states/UTs namely Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Goa, Kerala, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Assam, Odisha, have forest cover between 33 percent to 75 percent.\nTotal mangrove cover in the country is 4,992 sq km. An increase of 17 sq Km in mangrove cover has been observed as compared to the previous assessment of 2019. Top three states showing mangrove cover increase are Odisha (8 sq km) followed by Maharashtra (4 sq km) and Karnataka (3 sq km).\nTotal carbon stock in countrys forest is estimated to be 7,204 million tonnes and there an increase of 79.4 million tonnes in the carbon stock of country as compared to the last assessment of 2019. The annual increase in the carbon stock is 39.7 million tonnes.\nMETHODOLOGY\nIn tune with the Government of Indias vision of digital India and the need for integration of digital data sets, FSI has adopted using the vector boundary layers of various administrative units upto districts level as provided by Survey of India along with digital open series topo sheets, in order to ensure comprehensive compatibility with the geographical areas as reported in Census, 2011.\nThe biennial assessment of forest cover of the country using mid-resolution Satellite data is based on interpretation of LISS-III data from Indian Remote Sensing satellite data (Resourcesat-II) with a spatial resolution of 23.5 meters with the scale of interpretation 1:50,000 to monitor forest cover and forest cover changes at District, State and National level.\nThis information provides inputs for various global level inventories, reports such as GHG Inventory, Growing Stock, Carbon Stock, Forest Reference Level (FRL) and international reporting to UNFCCC targets under CBD Global Forest Resource Assessment (GFRA) for planning and scientific management of forests.\nSatellite data for the entire country was procured from NRSC for the period October to December 2019. The satellite data interpretation is followed by rigorous ground truthing. Information from other collateral sources are also used to improve the accuracy of the interpreted image.\nThe accuracy level achieved in the current assessment is the significantly high. The accuracy of forest cover classification has been assessed 92.99%. The accuracy of classification between forest and non-forest classes has been assessed 95.79% against internationally accepted accuracy of classification of more than 85%. A rigorous QC and QA exercise was also carried out.\nOTHER SIGNIFICANT FEATURES of ISFR 2021\nIn the present ISFR 2021, FSI has included a new chapter related to the assessment of forest cover in the Tiger Reserves, Corridors and Lion conservation area of India. In this context, the decadal assessment of change in forest cover within Tiger Reserves, Corridors and Lion conservation area helps in assessing the impact of conservation measures and management interventions that have been implemented over the years.\nFor decadal assessment, change in forest cover, during the period between ISFR 2011 (data period 2008 to 2009) and the current cycle (ISFR 2021, data period 2019-2020) within each Tiger Reserves has been analysed.\nA new initiative of FSI has also been documented in the form of a chapter, where the Above Ground Biomass has been estimated. FSI, in collaboration with Space Application Centre (SAC), ISRO, Ahmedabad, initiated a special study for estimation of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) at pan-India level, using L- band of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The results for the States of Assam and Odisha (as well as AGB maps), were presented earlier in ISFR 2019. The interim results for AGB estimates (and AGB maps) for the entire country are being presented as a new chapter in ISFR 2021. The detailed report will be published after completion of the study.\nFSI in collaboration of with Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani, Goa Campus has performed a study based on Mapping of Climate Change Hotspots in Indian Forests. The collaborative study was carried out with the objective to map the climatic hotspots over the forest cover in India, using computer model-based projection of temperature and rainfall data, for the three future time periods i.e. year 2030, 2050 and 2085.\nThe report also contains information on various parameters State/UT wise. Special thematic information on forest cover such as hill, tribal districts, and north eastern region has also been given separately in the report.\nIt is expected that the information given in the report would provide valuable information for policy, planning and sustainable management of forest and tree resources in the country.", "McCLELLANVILLE, Jan. 4 -- The Citadel issued the following press release:\nA Citadel student recently discovered new populations of Carolina birds-in-a-nest, a relative of the mint plant with a showy pink flower that had never before been recorded in Charleston County.\nThe plant, which grows a few feet off the ground and can be hard to spot when it's not in bloom, prefers a wet, sunny environment.\nCelie Dailey, who is pursing a master's degree in biology, stumbled on several thickets of the plant in bloom this summer at a conservation site on the Black River in southern Georgetown County.\nThe rare wildflower lives in a limited range in the coastal plains from Georgia to North Carolina. The federal government considers it an \"at-risk\" plant, and will decide whether it should be listed as threatened or endangered in 2023. Dailey reported the sighting to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\"They were really excited to find it,\" Dailey said. \"It turned out, it was kind of a monster population.\"\nBut shortly after, Dailey spotted this rare plant again in an unexpected place - a roadside ditch in McClellanville. It was the first recorded population ever found in Charleston County.\nCelie Dailey in 2019 with a patch of Carolina birds-in-a-nest, or Macbridea caroliniana, which she has found in several new spots around Charleston and Georgetown County. April Punsalan/Provided Joel Gramling, a Citadel professor and Dailey's adviser, said the discoveries are important in part because the plant, with the Latin name Macbridea caroliniana, is hard to keep track of. A 2016 survey couldn't find about 45 percent of the Macbridea population at previously discovered locations in South Carolina, Gramling said.\n\"We see this trend where we aren't able to find these populations, and now, all of a sudden, here's (Dailey) in several different counties, finding new populations,\" he said.\nIt's possible that the plant has been hard to detect because it blends in with other flora when it's not blooming. If previously sunny areas become shaded by new trees or shrubs, it may also recede into simple green stems.\nThriving populations are found in \"disturbed\" areas, which may have been cleared of larger plants by natural causes, such as a forest fire, or man-made ones, such mowing in a drainage ditch.\nOne of its main habitats - the edges of a swamp or inside a bog - can also be hard to access when the telltale blooms are out. Dailey said that in trips to the Black River site, she had to push through thickets of grass taller than she was, and was showered with ticks in the process.\n\"Nobody wants to be in a swamp in July,\" Dailey said. \"It's just nasty.\"\nBut she said that the plant, though unassuming, is not just rare, it's special to the state. South Carolina has the biggest population of the plant among the three states in which it's been found.\nIt's just one of several overlooked plants that make up the state's biodiversity, she said.\n\"I just love these wild places because they are just so diverse,\" Dailey said. \"Roadside places where you have so-called 'weedy' plants growing wild, people just want to cut these areas down ... those types of areas are so cool to me, to see the abundance of life there.\"\nResidents who spot Carolina birds-in-a-nest can report it to the Fish and Wildlife Service office in Charleston at (843) 727-4707.

In the meantime, we are doing a good job keeping it away from people's homes.\"\nFire departments from across Haywood County and beyond battled the blaze through the night, along with support from the N.C. Forest Service, National Park Service and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.\n\"Crews are working around the clock. They are coming in from all over Western North Carolina lending a hand,\" said Christina Esmay, public information officer for the Haywood County Sheriff's Office.\nBrenda Mancuso, who lives on Sheepback Mountain, was grateful to the crews who put themselves in harm's way to stop the fire.\n\"It was a rough night. I didn't sleep at all,\" said Mancuso, who stayed with a friend after having to evacuate her RV. \"I just kept reminding myself no matter what happens to me I am on God's plan, and I don't have control over it. You just have to trust in God. So that's what I did.\"\nTuesday morning, emergency officials allowed Mancuso to return to her property and see how it had fared. Speaking by phone as she pulled up to her RV, she broke into tears upon finding it had been spared.\n\"If I had lost everything, it would have been catastrophic. I think it would have broken me,\" she said.\nShe had to evacuate so quickly Monday, she only had time to grab her two cats and her dog.\n\"I kind of just froze. I couldn't think of what to bring,\" said Mancuso.\nEvacuations\nAn evacuation notice was sent out via the Haywood County Emergency Text alert system shortly after the fire broke out. Responders followed up by going door-to-door.\nMark Jones, who lives on Sheepback Mountain Road, returned home from work Monday afternoon to find the road leading to his home barricaded and the mountainside billowing with smoke and flames.\n\"They wouldn't let me get up the hill at first, but when I told them I had pets to go after, they drove me up in a utility vehicle,\" Jones said.\nJones was put at ease upon seeing a fire tanker truck stationed in his driveway to guard the house should the flames encroach.\n\"I said, 'Do I have a minute or two to grab some other things?'\" Jones recalled.\nBut as he tore through his house, he found himself at a loss.\n\"You always think about what you need to have in case you ever have to evacuate, but when it happens, your mind kind of goes blank,\" Jones said. \"We were mostly just worried about the babies.\"\nSo he got his dog Bailey, a rat terrier, and his ball python, Buttercup.\n\"When I told the fire chief at the bottom of the hill I had a python, he joked 'I was going to help you out until you told me that,'\" Jones said.\nJones and his wife spent the night at a hotel in Maggie Valley. But he couldn't sleep. So around 1:30 a.m., he got in his car and drove up Soco Road to the observation tower to look down on the fire. By day, thick smoke mostly obscured the flames, but by night, the mountainside was awash in an eerie orange glow.\nAs firefighters battled the Sheepback Mountain fire on Monday afternoon, a smaller and unrelated fire broke out on the other side of Soco Road up Setzer Cove. Leilani Hutchinson had been watching the smoke when her phone dinged. It was a Haywood County Emergency text alert with another evacuation notice \u2014 this time for her area.\n\"It told us to leave immediately,\" she said. \"I got my dogs and our medicine, and that's about it.\"\nHow the fire started\nHaywood County emergency officials had not publicly confirmed how the fire yet started as of Tuesday. But according to eyewitnesses, the fire originated from a controlled brush fire by a landscaping crew that had been doing some clearing.\n\"Around 11 o'clock, they started burning brush and trees on the property just below my cabin,\" said Tom Kassem, who lives along Pless Underwood Road. \"They said they dug a big hole and were being very careful, and it wasn't windy, so I don't know how it got out of hand.\"\nKassem left for a while, but his housemate Saad Ghanem was still home when the fire enveloped him.\n\"All the way around the cabin was fire and smoke,\" said Ghanem, who speaks limited English. \"Too much scared. I grabbed my dog and run down the mountain so fast.\"\nGhanem tried to run down the driveway toward the road, but the fire was blocking his way. So he took off down the steep mountainside, leaping and jumping through the woods with his dog in his arms.\nHe fell as he was running, scratching up his back and injuring his shoulder in the process. Ghanem made his way to a nearby home, where an ambulance came and picked him up.\nThe fire moved quickly once it got out of control. By dusk, it had already burned 75 acres.\nKassem said he doesn't blame the landscaping crew that had been burning the brush. The crew was in their truck at the mobile command center set up at the base of the mountain Monday evening to coordinate the response.\n\"They told me they weren't trying to hurt anybody, that it wasn't intentional. I said 'It's OK, everybody makes mistakes,'\" Kassem said.\nQuelling the flames\nAlong with ground response, firefighting efforts were aided by robust air support.\n\"We have two spotter planes circling the fire to monitor its movement, plus a helicopter and two air tankers dropping water,\" Richmond said, speaking Monday from the mobile command center. \"The spotter planes keep an eye on which direction the fire is moving and where they need to concentrate their efforts.\"\nThe helicopter made a continuous circuit between Maggie Valley and Lake Junaluska, where it scooped up water to carry back to the fire. The tanker planes had to go to the Asheville Airport to refill, however, Richmond said.\nThe fire had burned 75 acres by the time dusk fell Monday night. It had grown to 200 acres by 10 a.m. Tuesday morning, with the fire only 30% contained. WIthin an hour of rain moving in Tuesday afternoon, the fire was 100% contained.\nCommunity pitched in\nAn outpouring of community support was provided to firefighters and first responders, Esmay said.\nLocal churches showed up at the mobile command center with a steady stream of donuts, hot coffee, snacks and food to keep the crews fed. Victory Baptist Church offered its parking lot for the mobile command center and opened bathrooms to the crews.\nMaggie Valley Fire Department was the lead agency for the fire response, though aid came in from every fire department in the county. Two fire departments from Jackson County \u2014 Savannah and Balsam-Willetts \u2014 brought crews and trucks to staff the Maggie Valley Fire Station and respond to any other calls that came in since local firefighters were occupied with the forest fire.\nA shelter and reunification center was set up at Calvary Baptist Church Monday afternoon.\n\"We are serving as a staging area to help folks that may have been displaced or are looking for loved ones who evacuated,\" said Teresa Allison with Haywood County Health and Human Services. \"Anybody that needs a place to stay in the interim while they are putting out the fire is welcome to come here and help with whatever their needs may be.\"\nPull-offs along Soco Road leading up to the Blue Ridge Parkway were crowded with people Monday who watched in shock from the vantage point overlooking the valley. Maggie Valley Alderwoman Tammy Wight was among them.\n\"My prayers are with the families and firefighters and first responders. I just hope everybody's safe,\" Wight said.\n___ (c)2022 The Mountaineer (Waynesville, N.C.)

But recent research provides some good news regarding the park's owls, and it may be due to Yosemite's unique history and fire management strategy.\nIn\u00a0a study published last week in the journal\u00a0Forest Ecology and Management, researchers from The Institute for Bird Populations and Yosemite National Park found that Spotted Owl numbers and nesting rates remained stable in areas of the park that were burned by the Rim Fire. Between 2015 and 2017, the researchers surveyed for Spotted Owls, locating their territories and determining their breeding status. They used satellite data to characterize the habitat in the study area, including how severely it burned.\n\"What surprised me, primarily, was not that owls were still present, but they were still present in the same numbers and still successfully setting up territories and breeding,\" says the study's lead author Lynn Schofield, a biologist with The Institute for Bird Populations. While the owls avoided the most severely burned areas, they still held territories within the fire's perimeter.\nCalifornia Spotted Owls can tolerate forest fire, but Schofield cautions that not all fires are created equal. Yosemite's forests have not been commercially logged since the early 1900s and fire suppression efforts since the 1970s have been kept to a minimum. This results in a forest structure and fire regime that is distinct from what is found outside of the park.\n\"In Yosemite there is a diversity of forest habitat\" explains Schofield, \"This means the Rim Fire burned with a diversity of severities creating a range of post-fire habitat for owls to choose from.\" The study notes that in portions of the adjacent Stanislaus National Forest that were also burned by the Rim Fire, burn severity was more homogenous likely due to the contrasting logging and fire management regime on the National Forest.\nThe frequency of large, high intensity \"megafires\" like the Rim Fire is expected to increase in the Sierra Nevada. These megafires are considered one of the most important conservation threats to the California Spotted Owl. This study suggests that Yosemite's owl population has benefited from the park's diverse forest habitats and restored fire regime, and that these factors have allowed them to thrive even after a major disturbance like the Rim Fire.\n\"At Yosemite, restoring fire to its natural role is one of our management priorities,\" says Sarah Stock, a wildlife ecologist at Yosemite and co-author of the study. \"It's gratifying to see that this strategy is paying off for the park's wildlife.\"\nThe article Megafire Doesn't Deter Yosemite's Spotted Owls appeared first on Eurasia Review.", "MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) \u2014 Vermont has the lowest number of COVID-19 cases in the country and hasn't had a death from the illness in more than a month but the state has to remain vigilant because of the rapid spread of the coronavirus in other parts of the country, Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday.\n\u201cIn looking across the country, we continue to see a forest fire spreading in the south and west and things could shift back towards us so we have keep our guard up,\u201d said Scott, a Republican, during his regular virus briefing.\nThe state is considering expanding its mask mandate, Scott said, although he added that he's concerned that \u201ca mandate will create unnecessary conflict.\u201d\n\"With the numbers that we see in Vermont, particularly in our most rural areas, the data hasn't yet supported a change to the status quo,\" said Scott, who said he would have more information on Friday.\nHe advised Vermonters to be smart about where they travel and only go to areas that the state has identified as low risk. Residents who are traveling from other locations or taking a flight or public transportation to Vermont should quarantine for 14 days, he said.\nMANCHESTER-AREA CASES\nEighty percent of the 65 patients who tested positive for the virus after taking an antigen test that is not considered to be as accurate as the test used by the Health Department have been retested and only four were confirmed positive cases, said Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\"Through interviews and lab data, we've determined that 59 of the 65 antigen positives are not cases,\" he said.\nVermont does not count tests as positive unless they are done with a more reliable system, Levine has said. The Health Department uses a PCR test.\nThe PCR test is more available and has been used extensively nationally and internationally, Levine said. \u201cGive it a little time and they'll be able to rely on the antigen test, I would hope, too,\u201d he said.\nThe PCR test is preferable for people who are asymptomatic, Levine said. The likelihood of developing symptoms would probably occur from the fourth to seventh day, he said. The Health Department recommends that people who feel they've been exposed to the virus to get a test on the seventh day, Levine said.\nTHE NUMBERS\nThe Vermont Health Department on Tuesday reported seven new positive cases of the virus that causes COVID-19, bringing the state's total number since the pandemic began to 1,366.\nThe total number of deaths from COVID-19 has remained at 56 for more than a month.\nFor most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause more severe illness and can lead to death.", "When people piloting a small-wing plane take to peninsula skies this spring, it won't just be because they want to see the sights. They'll be part of a borough effort to improve and update the Kenai Peninsula Borough's aerial imagery resources.\nThe flight will be one of four made possible by a recent unanimous vote in support of legislation by the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly. That legislation also approved additional funds to pay for the flight this spring. The four flights are described in a sole source award the assembly voted for the borough to enter into with the company EagleView, with flights planned for the purpose of gathering updated and high-quality imagery of the borough.\nWhile most beneficial to the borough's assessing department, which can use the imagery to meet assessing canvassing criteria, the imagery can also be used for general government, safety and public uses.\nThe last time the borough conducted a general capture of imagery was in 2012 and 2013 for the western Kenai Peninsula. Borough Land Management Officer Marcus Mueller said during a Feb. 16 meeting of the Assembly's Finance Committee that the borough has undergone many changes since that capture. Reflected in a new capture, Mueller said, would be things like forest fire damage, spruce bark beetle outbreaks and new homes and roads.\nMueller noted that while borough captures are used often by borough departments, the borough's parcel viewer webpage is their most-visited \"by a long shot,\" with several hundred thousand hits a year.\n\"This is a really big deal,\" Mueller said during the February meeting. \"Imagery is a really central information piece for a municipality to have.\"\nBorough Acting Assessing Director Adeena Wilcox said during the February meeting that the technology will save the borough's Assessing Department money and will reduce the risk posed to employees while out in the field, which she said can be dangerous and costly. Putting staff on a boat to survey the outer banks of the Seward area, for example, costs almost $20,000.\nThe department used the same technology last year to gather imagery of the eastern peninsula, Wilcox said. That project was able to be funded using CARES Act funds because it prevented assessing staff from having to go out into communities.\nWilcox said the technology will also grant the borough visual access to places they've been unable to survey on the ground.\nThe Native Village of Tyonek, for example, as a sovereign entity, has said that they do not want the assessing department in the community and has even escorted assessing staff off of property in the area.\n\"We don't want to be on the property if the taxpayer doesn't want us on the property,\" Wilcox said. \"They have the right to tell us not to be there.\"\nAerial imagery, Wilcox said, will not replace in-person sales, appeal and year-end inspections conducted by the department and would be used specifically for canvassing.\nIn all, the ordinance outlines four projects with EagleView that have a projected combined cost of almost $650,000.\nThe first flight, to take place in spring 2021, will cost about $340,000 and would cover most of the western peninsula.\nThe second flight, to take place in spring of 2022, will cost about $127,700 and would cover the western shore of Cook Inlet, the tip of the peninsula and the southern shore Kachemak Bay plus Seldovia.\nThe third flight, scheduled for spring 2023, will cost about $116,000 and would cover most of the peninsula south of Skilak Lake.\nThe final flight, estimated for spring 2024, would cost about $64,000 and cover the central peninsula.\nWilcox said during the February meeting that conducting flights in spring produces better imagery because many trees lack substantial leaves that block views of the ground.\nThe ordinance, which was approved unanimously by the assembly during their March 2 meeting, adds about $63,000 to the borough's GIS budget to help fully fund the initial flight scheduled for this spring.\nInteractive GIS imagery of the Kenai Peninsula Borough can be found on the borough website at kpb.us/gis-dept/interactive-mapping.\nReach reporter Ashlyn O'Hara at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ashlyn.ohara@peninsulaclarion.com\">ashlyn.ohara@peninsulaclarion.com</email>\nCopyright 2021 Homer News", "The fire wasn't real that day in the rolling hills of Northern California, already turning crisp and brown at the beginning of May. But it offered the perfect opportunity for a group of NASA researchers to test the technology they've been building.\nTheir demonstration at a wildfire simulation outside Redding, California, showed how emergency responders of all kinds could work more safely and effectively using the prototype tools of NASA's STEReO project - Scalable Traffic Management for Emergency Response Operations.\nThe faux fire, marked out with orange flags and smoke flares, was being used for aerial firefighting training by STEReO's partners at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CAL FIRE, and the U.S. Forest Service. The exercises focused on the role in wildfire response of an air traffic controller in the sky.\nCircling above the scene, this person watches from the window of a plane. They visually track numerous aircraft and juggle their requests - over multiple radio frequencies - to fly near the fire or drop fire retardant, all while steering everyone clear of the firefighters on foot.\nWhile the partners' trainees were learning this demanding job, NASA's STEReO team got to work testing tools that could one day assist them.\nNew Solutions Require New Coordination\nWildland firefighting is no joke, and, today, critical decisions about dangerous situations rely in part on reports that come in from teams in the field. New technologies could help here: imagine, instead, drones sending real-time data from the perimeter of a forest fire to determine where crews will be most effective.\nBut that means even more moving parts to coordinate and, without the tools to do it, drones have largely had to stay on the sidelines of wildfire incidents when piloted aircraft are around.\n\"Planes and helicopters fighting fires have had limited awareness of the drones' whereabouts,\" said Joey Mercer, STEReO's principal investigator at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, \"but STEReO provides a way to see all operations responding to a disaster, in the air and on the ground.\"\nIt also sends out alerts to signal potential issues, like a plane getting close to a drone. STEReO is building on the agency's expertise in drone traffic management to develop these tools that let all elements of an emergency response stay in close contact and out of each other's way.\nThe result is a system that can be deployed during and after emergencies, from fires to hurricanes, wherever they may be.\n\"STEReO is a portable system,\" said Mercer, \"and we're developing a sort of 'bring your own internet' capability. That means the system works without high-speed internet access from the usual providers, which is likely to be lacking in a remote area struck by wildfire or a city following an earthquake or major storm.\"\nFirefighting in the Air, on the Ground, and on Screen\nThe project also created software tools that show in real time which operations are happening and where. Teams responding to a disaster can follow the action on their own screens, with a data display like a cell phone map in satellite mode. Moving icons show aircraft and humans at work, and the areas where drones will fly are marked.\nFrom April 26 to May 7, 2021, the STEReO team got to see their tools in action in the most realistic setting yet: working alongside CAL FIRE and Forest Service firefighting teams in training.\nIn this part of Northern California's countryside cell phones have only sketchy coverage, so STEReO's portable internet would definitely be needed. The team arranged their communications equipment strategically and proved that the area of a fire, even in hilly terrain, could be blanketed with STEReO's wifi coverage.\nAbove them, firefighting planes and helicopters flew in coordination with NASA drones. STEReO tracked them all, along with ground crews and some simulated aircraft for added complexity.\nBy the end of the demonstration, STEReO's partners had seen how the technology could work for them in a real-world setting, and which tools would help them most when fires strike.\nNew Technology for a Growing Need\nThis work, which is led by Ames in collaboration with two other NASA centers - Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and Glenn Research Center in Cleveland - is a concept study under NASA's Convergent Aeronautics Solutions project. The CAS activity is designed to determine STEReO's feasibility, and the results will help determine whether to pursue further development.\nSupport from CAS is something like a start-up investment for technology exploration government research is well suited for.\n\"For STEReO, we built basically four or five individual 'products',\" said Mercer. \"We designed them based on input from our partners, and, after seeing how it all came together during the flight demonstration, they identified the products they needed most. This was a low-cost way of connecting technology still in development with their immediate needs - something NASA is particularly good at.\"\nAs climate change impacts extreme weather events, there may be a growing need for tools like those STEReO is creating. The team will continue developing the system, aiming to let its partners test some of the tools independently next year.\nBy applying NASA technologies to responders' most critical needs, STEReO's creators hope to let them work together seamlessly, helping save property, homes, and lives.", "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jun 24, 2021( VentureBeat: <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com\">http://venturebeat.com</url>/ Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> How to protect your game from cheaters and pirates  <br/> Join Dean Takahashi and others to learn how to defend your game against cheaters and pirates.  <br/> Register Now[1]  <br/><br/>Where does your enterprise stand on the AI adoption curve? Take our AI survey[2] to find out.  \n<br/><br/> Icarus[3] is the new game from developer RocketWerkz[4], which DayZ creator Dean Hall[5] founded in New Zealand following his time at Bohemia Interactive[6]. The quick-and-dirty description for Icarus is that it is like Valheim in space. It's a survival game where you'll need to gather resources and build up your tech tree to survive harsh environments. But Icarus puts a spin on the formula with a session-based structure that may make the game even more addictive and appealing when it launches on Steam for $30 on August 12[7]. <br/> I've spent some time playing Icarus, including a session with Hall, who showed me around the world. And one of the first things I noticed is that I had no desire to cut my first run into the world short. I was getting my bearings and learning the mechanics, and the last thing I wanted was to go back up to my space station. And that's something that Hall said the team learned when testing the game. <br/> RocketWerkz originally designed Icarus with short early sessions and longer late-game sessions in mind, but the team actually found that people prefer the opposite. Like me, most people want to spend a long time in a world when they first boot up Icarus. Then later, after leveling up a character and getting in a flow, players enjoy shorter, more goal-oriented runs. And while that was not immediately intuitive or obvious to RocketWerkz, the designers see why that makes sense now. <br/> Like in a lot of sandbox-style games, everything seems possible when you first land in Icarus. And you want to take time to learn the boundaries and dynamics of the world. You will then apply those lessons to accomplish specific purposes once you know what you want to do. <br/><br/> Systems, DLSS, and ray tracing <br/>We tried to start a forest fire. That's the key takeaway from my time in Icarus. It has physics systems that simulate fire and its spread, but we actually failed at getting the fire to jump from one tree from another. But Hall thinks that is because it had just rained in the game. That thunderstorm itself was spectacular \u2014 with its own fire-causing lightning strikes. But the moisture left the forest too wet for our arsonist inclinations. <br/> Icarus is brimming with systems like that, and it adds to the sense that you're exploring a sandbox or possibility space. <br/> Another factor that makes Icarus stand out is its visuals and tech. RocketWerkz has already implemented Nvidia's deep-learning supersampling (DLSS) as well as RTX-powered global illumination. This means that you can get realistic-behaving light rays, and DLSS then means you can even run the game at a decent framerate. Even in my early sessions, Icarus regularly hits a better-than-playable framerate thanks to DLSS. And that's before RocketWerkz had given the game its final optimization pass before launch. <br/> We'll see what the game is like once its out for everyone, but it's definitely a game I find myself gravitating toward. A part of that is I haven't had a survival game in my life recently. But I also think Icarus is promising a compelling loop with the potential for emergent storytelling, and that could help it find an audience when it's available beginning August 12.

That project was able to be funded using CARES Act funds because it prevented assessing staff from having to go out into communities.\nWilcox said the technology will also grant the borough visual access to places they've been unable to survey on the ground.\nThe Native Village of Tyonek, for example, as a sovereign entity, has said that they do not want the assessing department in the community and has even escorted assessing staff off of property in the area.\n\"We don't want to be on the property if the taxpayer doesn't want us on the property,\" Wilcox said. \"They have the right to tell us not to be there.\"\nAerial imagery, Wilcox said, will not replace in-person sales, appeal and year-end inspections conducted by the department and would be used specifically for canvassing.\nIn all, the ordinance outlines four projects with EagleView that have a projected combined cost of almost $650,000.\nThe first flight, to take place in spring 2021, will cost about $340,000 and would cover most of the western peninsula.\nThe second flight, to take place in spring of 2022, will cost about $127,700 and would cover the western shore of Cook Inlet, the tip of the peninsula and the southern shore Kachemak Bay plus Seldovia.\nThe third flight, scheduled for spring 2023, will cost about $116,000 and would cover most of the peninsula south of Skilak Lake.\nThe final flight, estimated for spring 2024, would cost about $64,000 and cover the central peninsula.\nWilcox said during the February meeting that conducting flights in spring produces better imagery because many trees lack substantial leaves that block views of the ground.\nThe ordinance, which was approved unanimously by the assembly during their March 2 meeting, adds about $63,000 to the borough's GIS budget to help fully fund the initial flight scheduled for this spring.\nInteractive GIS imagery of the Kenai Peninsula Borough can be found on the borough website at kpb.us/gis-dept/interactive-mapping.\nReach reporter Ashlyn O'Hara at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ashlyn.ohara@peninsulaclarion.com\">ashlyn.ohara@peninsulaclarion.com</email>\nCopyright 2021 Peninsula Clarion", "PR Newswire\nLOS ANGELES, Sept. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- The upcoming full-length album, \"Soar,\" from LA based acoustic duo, Joselyn &amp; Don, will be released September 4th on all streaming platforms, and available on Joselyn &amp; Don's website to purchase as a physical CD or digital download.\n'Soar' is somehow timely and timeless, recalling the singer songwriters of the 1970's with a fresh, modern perspective. \"You can just imagine yourself traipsing through the Wild West when listening [to Joselyn &amp; Don]... and there's something very evocative about the whole thing,\" says Jane Howking of York Calling Magazine.\nThe couple recorded the album over the past two years in their home studio aptly named Garden Studio after the surrounding bountiful fruit trees and vegetable garden. The project was finished during the COVID-19 pandemic and features Don on guitars, drums, horns and bass. Besides her vocals and songwriting, Joselyn adds ukulele, keys and various hand drums. \"This new project is rooted in my early upbringing in Montana listening to bluegrass and folk, and my connection to nature.\" Joselyn shares, \"I'm writing better songs now than I did in my 20's. Motherhood and the challenges I've faced in life have enriched my work. Being a musician and sharing your art should be something you can do at any age, because our experience of being human is constantly changing.\"\nInitially inspired by a California forest fire, the driving anthem, \"Storm,\" from the album acknowledges that the many challenges we face have created a storm we can no longer ignore. An intimate acoustic intro quickly swells with electric guitar, African percussion, and soaring female vocals.

I really do. Rep. Liz Cheney has conducted herself honorably for the past nine months. Her courage in telling the truth about the election and the insurrection of Jan. 6 has been punished by the Republican conference, which booted her from leadership and replaced her with the lying, scheming Trumpist, Rep. Elise Stefanik. Former President Donald Trump is apparently working feverishly to unseat Cheney from Congress altogether, and his lickspittle lieutenants are joining the effort.\nThe invertebrate minority leader, Kevin McCarthy -- who, let's recall, declared on Jan. 13 that \"the president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters\" -- has long since scurried back under Trump's skirts, from whence he issues barbs against the few remaining Republicans who still have some principles. McCarthy sniped that Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, the other Republican appointed to the Jan. 6 committee over the objections of party leadership, are \"Pelosi Republicans.\"\nThe opening segments of the Jan. 6 committee were another fine moment for Cheney. She began by thanking the police officers who testified about their experiences defending the Capitol that day:\n\"Thank you to each of the witnesses appearing before us today. ... You defended the Constitution and our Republic, and every American owes you our undying gratitude.\"\nShe went on to outline the stakes:\n\"If those responsible are not held accountable, and if Congress does not act responsibly, this will remain a cancer on our Constitutional Republic, undermining the peaceful transfer of power at the heart of our democratic system.\"\nThose are good words, and as I said above, I respect Cheney's willingness to pay a price. She understood that by taking on the \"Big Lie\" and the almost-as-consequential lie about what happened on Jan. 6, she was risking her leadership position, her seat and possibly her own security. Every word of truth that she (and Kinzinger) utters is like a balm of Gilead.\nAnd yet, the voice in the back of my head keeps saying, \"Is it too late?\"\nBoth Cheney and Kinzinger, may they live to be 120, had many, many earlier opportunities to extinguish this forest fire before it became a raging inferno. Both supported Trump's reelection in 2020. Kinzinger said he was \"upset\" by President Joe Biden's victory. Cheney appeared on \"Fox and Friends\" in July 2020, and while she allowed that she disagreed with Trump on some issues, most notably withdrawal from Afghanistan, she emphasized how important it was that Trump be reelected: \"Whether or not we have debates and discussions internally -- as I'm sure we continue, we will continue to do -- we are going to be absolutely united going forward on the big issues, and I'm not going any place.\"\nBoth Cheney and Kinzinger voted against the first Trump impeachment. They stuck with their support for his reelection, despite the first debate with Biden, despite the catastrophic handling of COVID-19, despite Trump's green light to China's Uyghur camps, despite QAnon, and despite the avalanche of lies and cruelty that corrupted America's soul -- and prepared the ground for the violent insurrection they are now investigating.\nIs it welcome that they finally found a line they couldn't cross? A thousand times, yes. But how might this story have unfolded differently if they, and thousands of other Republicans, had found their uncrossable lines sooner?\nYou can say, \"The base is calling the shots, and the elected are just following what the voters demand.\" That's nonsense. The base doesn't get its ideas from nowhere. It gets them from Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and the rest of the conservative media world. And it gets them from elected officials. To paraphrase what Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn told the Jan. 6 committee: When elected officials give permission, there is no limit to the violence that may ensue.\nTrump was the arsonist. But if every time he dropped a match on the dry tinder of American polarization, Republican elected officials and others had leaped to extinguish the small flames, we would not be here.\nAnd where is here? We have seen the end of 160 years of the peaceful transfer of power. We've seen the majestic United States Capitol turned into a scene from a dystopian fantasy; an armed mob attempting to subvert an election. They smashed and tortured and caused deaths. They erected a gallows and hunted for the speaker of the House and for the vice president. And Republicans, almost to a man and woman, are excusing, downplaying or whitewashing what happened. An entire political party has abandoned commitment to the rule of law.\nTo speak up now, well, it's better than nothing. But it's a little like saying you'll take away a drunk's driver's license after he crashed into and killed an 8-year-old. What about all of those times when you saw him get behind the wheel after five drinks and did nothing?\nTrump attacked the basics of American democracy. The consequences were foreseeable. There were countless warnings. The great tragedy of this moment is not that Trump attempted what he did, but that so few Republicans tried to stop him when it would have made a difference.\nMona Charen is a syndicated columnist.", "LEXINGTON, Va., April 4 -- Virginia Military Institute issued the following news release:\nLEXINGTON, Va., April 4, 2022-The 32nd annual Environment Virginia Symposium at Virginia Military Institute returned to a live, in-person event on March 29-31. The event was held virtually in 2021 and canceled altogether in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event, organized and co-hosted by the VMI Center for Leadership &amp; Ethics (CLE), attracted nearly 400 attendees from state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, higher education and the private sector. Col. Dave Gray, director of CLE, served as master of ceremony for the event.\nTopics at this year's symposium included offshore wind energy, solar farm mitigation strategies, food waste, land conservation, nature-based and construction solutions, solutions to decreasing plastic pollution, algae bloom across Virginia, partnerships in the Chesapeake Bay and more.\nThe keynote session featured three newly appointed state government officials: Rob Farrell, director of the Department of Forestry (DoF), Mike Rolband, director of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), and Matthew Wells, director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR).\nFarrell serves as the eighth state forester of Virginia as well as the director of the DoF, which is responsible for protecting the forest resources of Virginia and ensuring trees and forests provide the greatest possible sustainable social, ecological, and economic benefits to the commonwealth. He joined the DoF as an area forester serving Gloucester and Mathews counties in 2000. He also served the agency as the first director of the forestland conservation program and as deputy state forester. In his opening statement at the symposium, he stated that two thirds of Virginia are covered in forest, a significant part of the commonwealth, and he supports and encourages good management of the forest. He stated that \"job number one is forest fire prevention,\" with which he believes the department has done an exceptional job, \"and our second mission is protecting the water during timber harvest.\" He also stated that he is proud of the conservation easement program, a legal agreement between a landowner and a government agency or land trust that permanently limits future development of the land to protect its conservation values, while providing a tax reduction for the landowner.\nRolband founded Wetland Studies and Solutions Inc. (WSSI) in 1991 and grew his company into a multidisciplinary natural and cultural resources consulting firm with a staff of more than 200. His firm constructed the first LEED Gold facility in Virginia and utilized multiple low impact development practices for stormwater management in 2005. In 2014, WSSI was acquired by The Davey Tree Expert Co. and under Rolband's leadership, expanded to include offices in Maryland and across Virginia. WSSI assisted land developers and public works agencies navigate the Clean Water Act, Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act and local environmental regulations. During his talk at the symposium, Rolband stated that the DEQ has a strong foundation, and he wants to build on it to make it better. He cited four main initiatives:\n1. \"One DEQ\": The DEQ has six regional offices and a central office and Rolband wants a better balance of the workload among the offices to improve efficiency.\n2. Permitting Enhancement &amp; Evaluation Platform (PEEP): Rolband is developing a critical path management scheduling system for every class of permits that DEQ touches making the permitting process easier and more efficient. People applying for permits will be able to monitor the permit process online.\n3. Stormwater Programs: Rolband plans on creating one comprehensive manual that does not expire. Currently there are five manuals that have conflicting rules and regulations. After the completion of the one manual, he plans to have training and certification requirements to reduce workloads.\n4. Commodity Trading: There are streams, wetlands, and nutrients credits. Rolband currently sees there is a lack of information regarding supply, demand, and price. He wants a commodity trading platform that lets people buy and sell credits in real time and which get extinguished when associated with a permit used.\nWells has 20 years of experience related to Virginia politics, policy, and environmental advocacy. Most recently, he was the Senior Regional Manager for State Government Relations for WestRock, a global leader in sustainable fiber-based packaging solutions. Before joining WestRock in 2016, Wells held senior analyst and special advisory positions with Virginia's departments of Motor Vehicles and Alcohol Beverage Control. He holds a degree in foreign affairs from the University of Virginia and a certificate in sustainability from Virginia Commonwealth University. Wells stated that the parks and preserves are the \"backbone of our quality of life.\" His focus will be on the Chesapeake Bay and the maintenance of the 2,700 dams in the state. He stated, \"We must take care of our people, so my first priority is safety.\" He added that flood prevention and land conservation are also crucial.\nA meaningful part of the annual symposium, is the announcement of the winner of the Captain Ron Erchul Environmental Leadership Award. This year's winner is Bettina Ring, the chief sustainability and diversity officer for the Sustainable Forestry Initiative. The award recognizes a Virginian who has made significant individual efforts to improve the environment. Members of Virginia's environmental community nominate candidates who are judged based on their vision, expertise, commitment, integrity, communication skills, accomplishments, and diplomacy. The award is named for the late VMI professor Ronald A. Erchul, Ph.D., founder of the Environment Virginia Symposium.\nRing is an innovative and thoughtful leader with more than 30 years of expertise in the public sector and nonprofit management, natural resources management, land and water conservation, agriculture and food systems, rural economic development, and public policy. During her very impactful career, she has served as Virginia's fourth Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry, as state forester (director of Virginia Department of Forestry), deputy state forester, senior vice president at American Forest Foundation, and in leadership roles with several other nonprofits.\nRing has been involved in the Virginia Department of Forestry water quality efforts since early in her career, worked on the Healthy Forested Watershed Project, and served on the Chesapeake Bay Principal Staff Committee for the last four years.\nIn addition to her trade missions and promotion of Virginia's No. 1 and No. 3 industries, Ring also worked with former Governor Ralph Northam '81 and the General Assembly to increase funding for Agriculture Best Management Practices, riparian buffers, and watershed positions, and most recently in the proposed funding for re-opening New Kent Forestry Center to expand seedling capacity in the state, Trees for Clean Water and urban tree canopy, establishing the first-ever state funding for urban and community forestry and land conservation including farmland preservation funding specifically designed to address heirs property issues.\nShe took an active role, working with the UVA Institute for Engagement and Negotiation, to put on the Governor's Summit on Equitable Collaboration.\n\"Ring is an outstanding leader who is very worthy of being named this year's Erchul Award winner,\" said Joe Maroon, executive director of the Virginia Environmental Endowment.\nEach year, Virginia Military Institute donates $1,500 to a nonprofit environmental organization of the recipient's choice in their honor. Ring has requested that this donation be made to Virginia Natural Resources Leadership Institute.\nOther awards presented at the symposium are the Governor's Environmental Excellence Awards, which recognize successful and innovative efforts that improve Virginia's environment. This year's gold medal winners are: Catawba Hospital for Greening of Government; the City of Harrisonburg Department of Public Works for the Harrisonburg urban forestry program; Coastal Virginia Ecotourism Alliance for the Virginia Water Trail; Fauquier County for Upper Rappahannock River Water Trail; George Mason University for Mason Sustainability Council's Circular Economy &amp; Zero Waste task force and the University of Virginia for waste minimization.\nSilver medal winners are the City of Petersburg for Appomattox River Trail University Boulevard Overlook &amp; Trailhead; Virginia Tech for Plastic Pollution and Solid Waste Reduction Campus Wide Working Group and William &amp; Mary for institutionalized composting.\nReceiving bronze medal awards are Arlington-Fairfax Chapter Inc., Izaak Walton League of America for their environmental management system; Chesterfield County for North Courthouse Library Neighborhood Connector Trail; Defense Supply Center Richmond for their fuel reduction program and Virginia Tech Office of Sustainability for their student internship program.\nReceiving honorable mention is Hitachi Energy USA Inc. for their Paint Line Process Improvement Project and Smith Creek Watershed Partnership c/o Ridge to Reefs, Inc. for the Yancy Bioreactor.\n-VMI- For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email>", "TS Conductor Corp., a pioneer in high-efficiency conductors for electricity grids, today announced that Breakthrough Energy Ventures, National Grid Partners and a subsidiary of NextEra Energy have joined Talkot and Herv\u00e9 Touati in its oversubscribed Series A financing, for a total $25 million in funding. The new capital will be used to build the company's first state of the art manufacturing plant in the United States.\n\"We are thrilled to have Breakthrough Energy Ventures, National Grid Partners and a subsidiary of NextEra Energy investing in TS Conductor. Our mission is to make electricity networks greener. TS achieves that through a combination of energy efficiency and faster and cheaper renewable integration,\" said Dr. Jason Huang, CEO at TS Conductor Corp.\nWhile the electricity generation segment of the energy industry has progressed to cleaner and more efficient solutions, the overhead conductor technology used by transmission and distribution grid operators has not materially changed since the emergence of Aluminum Core Steel Reinforced (ACSR) cables in 1908. ACSR still today represents over 95 percent of the utility cables deployed across the world.\nAccording to <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketstudyreport.com%2Freports%2Fglobal-wires-and-cables-market-size-research&amp;esheet=52530605&amp;newsitemid=20211116005043&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Market+Study+Report%2C+LLC&amp;index=1&amp;md5=8c4b1aacc5a5f66b9662517a4f4079c9\">Market Study Report, LLC</url> , the global wires and cables market was estimated to represent $183 billion of sales in 2020, with an annual compounded growth rate anticipated to exceed 4 percent until 2028. Global investment in the power sector reached $780 billion in 2020 and was largely dominated by renewable power (48 percent) and electricity networks (32 percent) investments, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iea.org%2Freports%2Fworld-energy-investment-2021&amp;esheet=52530605&amp;newsitemid=20211116005043&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=International+Energy+Agency&amp;index=2&amp;md5=39ded247d7fe8dbc7923f343b9c723e9\">International Energy Agency</url> (IEA). While considerable, the IEA notes that current levels of renewable energy and energy efficiency investments still fall short of what is needed to maintain global temperatures well below a 2 \u00baC rise.\nThe UN climate targets create the need for new cable technologies that can reduce electricity network losses and accelerate the connection of wind and solar farms, which is one of the major bottlenecks of renewable energy expansion. Network losses amount to approximately 2000 TWh annually, or 6.7 times the electricity consumption of the U.K.\n\"Transmission is fundamentally important to our climate mission, yet it has seen limited innovation over the years. It is rare to find a transmission technology like TS Conductor with as much potential in terms of deployability, cost and efficiency,\" said Carmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures. \"TS Conductor will be a major enabler of increasing electricity demand and increasing penetration of renewables in a critical time. We are delighted to lead this round with a stand-out team and an outstanding technology.\"\n\"National Grid has committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions 90 percent by 2040 and to net zero by 2050, and to accelerating the incorporation of wind, solar and battery storage in our grids in the UK and North America,\" said Lisa Lambert, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of National Grid and the President and Founder of National Grid Partners. \"There are few solutions enabling grid operators to reduce their electricity consumption, and TS Conductor is the most impressive solution I have encountered so far to decarbonize electricity grids. Their product, when combined with a top-notch management team, positions TS Conductor to be a leader in the market.\"\nTS Conductor was founded in 2018 by Rulong Chen, James Huang and Jason Huang, based on James Huang's patented conductor design. This new class of conductors is based on a unique combination of carbon composite and aluminum encapsulation of the composite core. The conductors can be installed with the same tools and operating procedures as ACSR cables. And they are compatible with industry standard field practice and can be used for:\nLine reconductoring, allowing for the doubling of capacity of an existing line without having to change or retrofit any structures.", "The following information was released by the World Bank:\nTrees with twisted trunks, countless waterfalls, fauna and flora resistant to annual droughts and periodic fires. This is the Cerrado, Brazil's second largest biome that spans an area of 2,036,448 km2 and is celebrated this September 11 across the country. Encompassing approximately 22% of Brazil's land, the Cerrado's high aquifer potential has earned it the \"water tank\" moniker for housing the springs of the three largest watersheds in South America. In total, an estimated 11,627 species of native plants have been catalogued in the biome, as well as 199 species of mammals, and a rich avifauna composed of 837 species[i].\nConsidered the area with the greatest agricultural potential on the planet from an economic perspective, the Cerrado is where most agricultural activities in Brazil take place, accounting for 60% of the country's grain production[ii]. In addition to its economic importance, the Cerrado carries social relevance as a place with traditional populations who subsist on the region's natural resources, in addition to indigenous peoples, geraizeiros, baba ueiras, riverside communities, vazanteiros and quilombola communities that, together, are part of Brazil's historical and cultural heritage and possess ancestral knowledge of the country's biodiversity.\nIn recognition of such rich biodiversity, ten years ago Brazil conceived the Brazil Investment Plan under the Forest Investment Program (FIP) aimed at the conservation and sustainable development of the Cerrado. I was part of the team that designed the program in 2011 and could hardly imagine then that FIP Brasil would become so relevant to the integration of government efforts aimed at environmental conservation and development in the Cerrado, which involve all 11 states located in the biome.\nAt the time, the government made the strategic decision to work with several ministries instead of just one, thus joining efforts to address the challenge of promoting conservation in the Cerrado. After a lengthy consultation process with the government and private institutions, researchers and traditional communities, the decision was made to use a portfolio of individual projects and the World Bank as the focal point for multilateral development banks involved in FIP in Brazil[LS1] , funded with support from the Climate Investment Fund (CIF).\nIn these ten years, the FIP Brazil has achieved significant and innovative results, improving production methods in the Cerrado, integrating institutions at different levels and fostering unity among traditional peoples and communities living in the region. Estimates show that these combined actions have already impacted the lives of 51.7 beneficiaries, 37,000 rural properties and 64 traditional communities so far.\nUnder the FIP ABC Cerrado project (ended in 2019), rural producers changed their properties in the field by recovering pastures and employing other low-carbon agricultural practices. These producers show their commitment to sustainable practices by investing 7 reais for each 1 Brazilian real put in by the project. Where once there was degraded pasture, today productive pastures and protected springs abound.\nIn late 2021, the activities under the FIP Monitoring project will come to a successful end. They will leave behind a legacy of reliable and publicly-accessible systems and data on deforestation, fire management, forest fire risk management, and estimating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from deforestation and fires in the Cerrado. The main outputs have already been delivered, organized and unified in the project's website.\nDGM Brazil (Dedicated Grant Mechanism for Indigenous People and Local Communities), a project that the entire team cares about, will be delivering its results in early 2022. With 55 completed sub-projects under its belt, DGM Brasil not only strengthened the traditional communities and indigenous peoples of the Cerrado, but also presented an opportunity for indigenous peoples, quilombolas, geraizeiros and coconut breakers to sit together at the same table and begin a dialogue, joining forces to achieve common goals for the protection of the biome. Women have played a key role in this project, leading 13 of the 64 sub-projects, in addition to the National Steering Committee, currently headed by quilombola Lucely Pio.\nFIP in Brazil activities will continue in the coming years with the Paisagens Rurais (Rural Landscapes) project, which promotes sustainable agricultural techniques, restoration and environmental conservation among rural producers in selected areas. FIP Rural Environmental Cadastre project also includes activities to formalize rural properties and adapt them to Brazil's environmental laws. FIP Coordination, in turn, continues to monitor and evaluate project activities and enable information exchanges and synergies across the entire portfolio.\nA decade later, some of the things we planned from the outset continue to apply, such as efficient production practices and environmental conservation. But reality has imposed major challenges on us all, such as changes in legislation and public policies, changes to the market, exchange rate challenges and, finally, the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced us towards remote and virtual solutions.\nAs such, this Cerrado Day is an important milestone and a chance to look back at the path trailed by the projects so far and all the achievements made in this constant journey to conserve our Cerrado.\n[i] BRASIL.

According to Cal Fire, the wildfires, called the SCU Lightning Complex, are spotted in Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, and San Benito counties. The fires have burned 383,157 acres so far, with 60% containment. The SCU Lighting Complex[3] is the second-largest wildfire recorded in California history, and the LNU Lightning Complex, which has burned 375,209 acres across Napa, Sonoma, Solano, Lake, and Yolo counties, with 63% containment, was named as the third-largest wildfire in the state's history.Several U.S. states have extended their help to California and Gov. Gavin Newsom said he urged [4]countries like Australia and Canada also to rush assistance for California firefighters. However, it is unclear when the forces from Australia and Canada will be deployed.

For the climate, for Willamette National Forest,\" Anderson said.\nThe groundswell of apparent consideration for mature Douglas fir shows that managing forests for climate, wildlife and water quality can co-exist with private timber interests.\n\"Just leave it intact,\" Anderson said. \"We need it.\"\nHistory\nTalks of a Douglas fir national monument began in 2015 by a coalition of environmental groups. At the time, they were eyeing 481,324 acres. Seven years later, the total acreage has risen to more than 530,000 and includes land that abuts the Warm Springs Reservation.\nThe proposed monument would include all of the Middle Santiam and Menagerie Wilderness areas, Quartzville Creek Wild and Scenic River and a portion of the Mount Jefferson Wilderness.\nThen in 2016 with Donald Trump's ascension, the proposal screeched to a halt. The Antiquities Act authorizes the president to proclaim national monuments on federal lands that contain historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific interest.\nWhile more uncommon, a national monument also can be established by an Act of Congress.\nWith Biden in office, the proposal has gained momentum once again. On April 22 \u2014 Earth Day \u2014 the president launched the America the Beautiful Initiative, which supports his goal to conserve 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.\nWithin a week of this announcement, The Coalition to Protect America's National Parks named the Douglas-fir proposal and five others in a letter to Biden, urging him to declare them all national monuments.\nThe monument's supporters haven't heard back from the president, although Tucker claims a Washington, D.C. lobbyist \u2014 whom he prefers not to name \u2014 informed him that the proposal could soon be up for discussion.\nIn response, Tucker and his two colleagues on the Board of Commissioners, Sherrie Sprenger and Roger Nyquist, penned a letter to DeFazio, Merkley and Wyden, asking them to stop the proposed monument. Tucker said he plans to write another directly to the president.\nThis is not the first letter Tucker has written to stop the monument. He sent one by himself a few years ago. He never heard back.\nWyden declined to comment on this story, according to staff.\nMerkley communications staff responded in an email, indicating no information would be available before press time. A ranking DeFazio staffer took a phone call requesting information but did not respond before press time.\n\"I know my writing is falling on deaf ears,\" he said. \"All I'm asking for is five seconds. This proposal takes forest management in the wrong direction.\"\nLack of input\nAlthough the proposed monument shares a border with the Warm Springs Reservation, neither the proponents nor the opponents have spoken directly with tribal leaders to ask their opinion.\nStone said he was able to reach the tribe one time, but representatives said they were too busy to get involved with the campaign and ultimately did not give their input one way or the other.\n\"I've reached out to them a number of times, and they say it's a nice proposal, not knowing much about it. So I'm not implying they endorse it,\" he said. \"We don't have evidence of active use (of the proposed land) currently.\"\nTucker said that while he has not yet contacted the tribe, he is confident that its members will be \"equally as concerned.\"\n\"I think they feel that the rules and regulations placed on their tribal lands have been changed without their involvement,\" Tucker said. \"When you take more lands and place more rules on them, the tribe's trust of the government is low for exactly this reason.\"\nCombating climate change\nBoth sides of the Douglas-fir debate disagree with the other's way of combating climate change.\nThose who are against the monument believe logging is an essential part of maintaining a forest. The management of timber to sequester carbon, Tucker said, is one of the most important things that needs to be done, in addition to planting new trees.\nThe vast majority of timber sales in Linn County are from private lands, a yearly average 237,384 million board feet of timber compared to 34,703 million from public lands. Private sales generally increased between 2010 and 2019, logging 263,284 million board feet in the most recent year of data.\n\"As we are watching these fires burn, it just makes me want to cry because had that timber been cleaned up, the fuel wouldn't have been there as much as it did,\" Tucker said.\nStone, however, said a forest fire is either the beginning of a new forest or the continuation of a current forest. In his view, fire is a natural disturbance that is beneficial to fish and wildlife, and logging after a fire removes essential wood mass needed for the forest to recover.\nTucker also mentioned that Douglas firs do not need protection; in fact, they grow so abundantly he has some in his own yard.\n\"To call it a Douglas fir monument just shocks me,\" Tucker said.\nCascade-Siskiyou litigation\nLinn County is currently involved in a lawsuit with the U.S. government regarding the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument, located in Southwest Oregon and Northern California.\nPresident Bill Clinton in 2000 declared the range a national monument. In 2017, Obama expanded the monument by 48,000 acres.\nMany industry groups, including Linn County, believe this expansion violated the Oregon and California Revested Lands Act of 1937, which requires forest maintenance for 2.4 million acres of forestland across 18 counties in Western Oregon.\nThe county lost, appealed, then won, and the decision was once again appealed. The Department of Justice in February 2020 put both sets of litigation on hold until the DC District Court issues its final order on cases related to the Bureau of Land Management's resource management plans.\nLack of communication\nThe Linn County Commissioners and Friends of Douglas-fir National Monument have never spoken directly about the proposal.\nStone, who lives in Springfield, said he's interested in working with the people of Linn County to better understand their needs, and he's not trying to shut out their voices.\n\"You can't just go into a rural county and just ignore what's important to them and expect to succeed,\" he said.\nHe referenced the economic impact study posted on his website, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.douglasfirnationalmonument.org\">www.douglasfirnationalmonument.org</url>, which finds Western rural communities with national monuments do better economically than adjacent counties without national monuments.\n\"It's obvious. If you drive through downtown Sweet Home,\" he said, \"there's all those boarded-up stores. You get to see the suffering that happens in a rural county in the West that doesn't have protected land.\"\nStone said he is confident that the proposed monument will be established, as he's been in contact with Wyden, Merkley and DeFazio for several years about it.\n\"As we see, climate change is wrecking everything we hold dear,\" Stone said. \"Protection of the land is real important; it's real urgent right now.\"\nJoanna Mann (she/her) covers education for Mid-Valley Media.

The inability of federal agencies to offer competitive pay and benefits is creating hundreds of wildland firefighting vacancies.\nVacancies, of course, limit how much federal firefighters can do. If Western communities want to be protected, they need to ensure that their firefighters receive better pay and benefits.\nIn my 11 years of work as a wildland firefighter, I\u2019ve managed aircraft, trained people and run fires myself, but I also did outreach and recruitment for the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. I know how hard it is for hiring managers to make 2,000 hours of grueling work, crammed into six exhausting months, sound appealing when the pay is $13.45/hour. The pay doesn\u2019t come close to matching the true demands or everyday dangers of the job.\nFederal wildland firefighters, by necessity, are transient workers. During the fire season \u2014 now nearly year-round \u2014 they must be available to travel anywhere in the United States at any time. And to advance in their career, they have to move to other federal duty stations to gain more qualifications.\nFinding affordable housing has always been a problem for career firefighters on a federal salary. To make matters worse, federal agencies revoked the \u201cTransfer of Station\u201d stipend for career employees, which helped offset the cost of moving. Just recently, a national forest supervisor also revoked a \u201cboot stipend.\u201d It might sound minor, but it isn\u2019t When you\u2019re in the firefighting business, boots tough enough to save your life can easily cost you $500.\nSome states aren\u2019t relying on the government to act quickly. \u201cWe aren\u2019t just waiting for the next crisis to hit,\u201d said California Gov. Gavin Newsom, in establishing an $80.74 million Emergency Fund that delivers an additional 1,256 seasonal firefighters to boost CALFIRE\u2019s ranks. This Emergency Fund is in addition to the governor\u2019s $1 billion budget request for California\u2019s Wildfire and Forest Resilience Action Plan.\nIn Washington, state legislators unanimously passed a $125 million package that will enable the state\u2019s Natural Resources Department to hire 100 more firefighters. The legislation furthers the state\u2019s efforts to restore forest health and creates a $25 million fund to ensure community preparedness around the state.\nUtah\u2019s House Bill 65, recently signed into law, appropriates money to help Utah\u2019s communities offset the cost of wildfire suppression. Most importantly, it commissions a study to evaluate the current pay plan for firefighters within Utah\u2019s Natural Resources Department.\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Casey Snider, was amazed to learn that frontline wildland firefighters make more money at McDonald\u2019s \u201cThese positions are critical,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the first ones on fires.\u201d This year, Utah has already had five times the number of wildfires it normally experiences in a year.\nAnd firefighters are organizing and speaking up. The Grassroots Wildland Firefighters is working to halt the exodus of firefighters from federal agencies by advocating for pay parity with state and local fire protection agencies. The group also supports initiatives to assist the physical and mental health of firefighters and their families. The statistics they highlight are shocking Wildland firefighters have a suicide rate 30 times higher than the average. They also experience high incidences of cardiovascular disease and lung cancer.\nThere is talk on the federal level of creating a permanent, year-round firefighting workforce. I think this is a necessary step, but it won\u2019t fix the workforce capacity issue unless increased pay and benefits are used to encourage the recruitment and retention of federal firefighters.\nWe all know that today\u2019s wildfires are longer, more damaging and more frequent than ever before. We also know that men and women are putting their lives on the line for less than they\u2019d earn at a McDonald\u2019s.\nOur firefighters do all this to protect our lives, our forests and our communities. We owe them at least a living wage and a chance for a healthy life. I hope more states and legislators will start paying attention. This is a debt that needs to be paid.\nJonathon Golden lives in Moab, and is a contributor to Writers on the Range, writersontherange.org, a nonprofit dedicated to spurring lively conversation about the West.

We are home to the largest Ponderosa Pine forest in the world, making healthy forests one of our top interests and priorities as we work to protect lives and communities from the impacts of catastrophic wildfires and post-wildfire flooding.\nIn the past ten years, Coconino County has experienced four major wildfires on federal land that has negatively impacted us through the tragic loss of life, homes and businesses, decreased property values as well as social and economic burdens on our communities. Just one year ago in my district, the Museum Fire, which burned less than 2,000 acres, cost the U.S. Forest Service over $11 million to suppress and rehabilitate and cost Coconino County nearly $2 million in response to the post-wildfire flooding threat to the City of Flagstaff.\nWhile forest restoration has been on the hearts and minds of our citizens for years, we are currently in the eighth year of a ten-year landscape scale restoration project called the Four Forest Restoration Initiative or 4FRI, an effort to restore 300,000 acres of forest over 10 years. In those eight years, the contractor has only been successful at treating 14,000 acres. While there are many factors that have played into the small amount of acres being treated, the lack of a market for the biomass (non-merchantable trees, limbs and tops) that is created from forest restoration treatments continues to be the bottleneck.. This is quite evident by the fact that a mere 125 miles away, where a bioenergy plant is located in Snowflake, Arizona, industry has been able to treat over SIX TIMES as many acres in the same timeframe precisely because there is a market for biomass. Support for biomass energy facilities as well as the \"High Hazard Area Wood Biomass Fund\" in S. 4603 to fund the processing, removal and hauling of biomass to end markets that can be hundreds of miles away from the source, is critical for increasing the pace and scale of forest restoration on federal lands.\nIn the early 1990's, much of Arizona's forest industry \"left town\" due to increasing litigation on federal timber sales. Add to that the Forest Service policy to put every forest fire out, we have created conditions where the forest is overstocked with trees and is a virtual tinderbox waiting to combust. Northern Arizona University's Ecological Restoration Institute cites that pre-1900, tree densities in Arizona's forests averaged around 24 trees per acre due to the frequent lightning caused fires naturally thinning the forest. However, that average today has skyrocketed to well over 1,200 trees per acre. The goal of forest restoration is to reduce the tree density to a healthy average of 80 trees per acre, allowing for the re-introduction of wildfire back into our fire adapted ecosystem. Attempting to do that work primarily through prescribed fire is too risky and not feasible based on the current density of trees. However, mechanical thinning treatments brings a multitude of benefits, although success depends on markets being made available for the forest products and biomass. One of the greatest benefits of mechanized thinning operations, aside from creating a healthy, fire-resistant forest, is the creation of well-paying jobs in some of the most rural areas of the country where they are desperately needed.\nBiomass energy plays a significant role in the success rate of forest restoration in Arizona and yet has struggled to get support from state and federal lawmakers. Biomass energy is the only viable option, at this time, in our efforts to thin 30,000 to 50,000 acres per year for the next twenty years as we work diligently to improve forest health and reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires across the West. We often look only at the cost of bioenergy when determining its viability and knowing that it has a higher cost than green energy systems like solar and wind. Therefore, it often gets overlooked. However, we must not forget that the ecosystem benefits resulting from forest restoration treatments that supply the biomass for energy, is creating healthy forests and watersheds, improved wildlife habitat, protecting communities and lives from catastrophic wildfires and the negative air quality impacts, as well as recreational and economic opportunities within our national forest lands. S. 4603 is critical for support of biomass removal from federal lands and biomass energy to reduce the amount of carbon emissions from wildfire, open-burning fire and prescribed fire. In addition, the financial impact from forest restoration, made possible by having biomass energy as an end market for forest by-products, is the reduction of catastrophic wildfires that have cost the federal government nearly $3.4 billion in suppression costs alone in 2020, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Furthermore, it is estimated that the total economic impact from wildfires in 2020 will reach between $130 to $150 billion in losses.\nThe facts on the ground in our region prove out the need for biomass as a tool to dispose of the forest products in our area. Senator McSally's legislation, S. 4603, is a critical step towards creating this policy goal and funding that will plant the seeds for biomass utilization in forest restoration efforts in Arizona and elsewhere across the West.\nIn Arizona, where we have only one 30 MW bioenergy plant, there is a need for an additional 90 MW of biomass energy to consume the biomass residue that will be produced from the Four Forest Restoration Initiative. Over the last several years, the bioenergy facility captured over 98 percent of the particulate matter (PM) 2.5 created by burning biomass for energy. The EPA has published that \"Wildland fires now account for 40 percent of the total PM emitted in the country, making it a major source of the pollutant, which causes lung and health problems.\" Consider that against all particulate matter emitted from vehicles, power generation, industrial facilities, etc. forest fire represents 40 percent of the PM emitted.\nIn conclusion, it is critical that the federal government upholds its responsibility to the American people in supporting the most viable and economic way to dispose of the millions of tons of small diameter trees, limbs and tops (biomass) that result from forest restoration projects across the West and more specifically in Arizona, where there are no other industry markets available, allowing for more acres to be treated each year. Without your support, we will continue to see catastrophic wildfires ravage the landscape and watersheds, turning once beautiful forests into a desolate wasteland of ash and dust. I applaud the subcommittee for holding this important hearing today and urge you to pass S. 4603 to protect our fragile forest ecosystem in the West.\nCopyright Targeted News Services\nnull-7299396 T40-MgEditor", "<br/>2025 MAR 04 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Tech Daily News -- Investigators publish new report on Technology. According to news reporting out of Yunnan, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"A fundamental challenge in remote sensing-based forest fire detection lies in accurately discerning fire characteristics on various scales against the backdrop of intricate and heterogeneous forest landscapes. In response to this challenge, we propose a dual-path network (DPMNet) with multidimensional feature interaction for real time remote sensing forest fire detection.\" \n<br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Yunnan 10000 Talents Program, Research and Achievement Cultivation and Teaching Reformation Project on Graduate Education at Yunnan University, Hongzhi Zhao Expert Workstation in Yunnan Province, Hongwei Ding Grass-roots Expert Workstation in Yunnan Province, The 14th Research Innovation Project of Yunnan University School of Information Technology, Yunnan Provincial Education Science Research Fund Project. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Yunnan University, \"Initially, a dual-path backbone network is designed, integrating coarse-grained and fine-grained parallel pathways, working in tandem to capture both global visual features and nuanced local texture details. Subsequently, we develop the Multidimensional Interactive Feature Pyramid Network (MiFPN), a novel structure that amalgamates information streams from varied levels through a three-branch structure and engenders profound fusion and dynamic interaction of features across multiple scales. Thereafter, the Context-Enriched Adaptive Fusion Module (CEAFM) is proposed, which emerges to meticulously blend macroscopic visual elements harvested via coarse-grained conduits, employing a multi-faceted pathway strategy to bolster the model's overarching comprehension and precision in forest fire detection. Finally, the Enhanced Contextual Pooling Bottleneck (ECPB) is put forward, an integration that augments the model's spatial perception and contextual acumen through the incorporation of dilated convolution and global pooling techniques. Extensive experiments are conducted on the remote sensing forest fire dataset in order to confirm the efficacy of DPMNet.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The experimental results demonstrate that our DPMNet achieves satisfactory performance in terms of real-time performance as well as accuracy and provides an effective solution for real-time detection of remote sensing forest fires based on UAVs.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Dpmnet: a Remote Sensing Forest Fire Real-time Detection Network Driven By Dual Pathways and Multidimensional Interactions of Features.

In the third quarter, the company completed two high-quality acquisitions totaling $459 million, including its previously announced transaction for timberlands in North Carolina and Virginia. Additionally, in the third quarter Weyerhaeuser advanced three divestiture packages of non-core timberlands - two of which were closed or under contract in early October, totaling $410 million of expected cash proceeds by year end. The company anticipates the third divestiture to close in early 2026, with total proceeds from all divestitures expected to exceed the cash outlay required for its recently completed acquisitions.\n\"These transactions represent strategic opportunities to recycle capital in a tax-efficient manner to further optimize and improve our timberlands portfolio,\" says Devin W. Stockfish, president and chief executive officer. \"As we've demonstrated over the last several years, we are committed to active portfolio management across our timber holdings and have remained disciplined and nimble in our approach to growing the quality and value of our timberlands. Through this process, we've achieved the multi-year growth target we announced in September 2021 - and by early 2026, we will have offset a significant portion of our acquisitions with divestitures of non-core acreage. Over a similar period, we've also returned a substantial amount of cash back to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase and announced a compelling engineered wood products growth opportunity - all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Looking forward, we will continue to evaluate capital-efficient opportunities that enhance the return profile of our timberlands, while also balancing other levers across our capital allocation framework to drive superior long-term value for our shareholders.\"\nSummary of Acquisitions\nUnique, off-market transactions featuring high-quality and strategically located acreage with portfolio-leading timber and financial attributes in their respective regions.\nAcquired at a combined timber-only Adjusted EBITDA multiple of 21x1.\nPress Release article 2 of 12, Source: Company Website, 177 words \nOctober 30: Weyerhaeuser Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results\nWeyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today reported its third quarter 2025 financial results.

Through a free online resource hub, first responders can find specially designed content, including videos about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and suicide prevention, along with mental health tips, educational articles and contacts for occupationally aware support groups and counselors in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.\nWeyerhaeuser's support for wildland firefighting efforts in the Pacific Northwest began in the aftermath of the Yacolt Burn in 1902, when the company began advocating for Washington's first forest fire legislation and the funding of community fire prevention education and patrols. Today, as Weyerhaeuser celebrates its 125th anniversary, the company continues to play an active role in fire prevention and response through its forest management operations. Weyerhaeuser employees and contractors receive annual fire readiness training, build fire breaks and containment lines, conduct aerial surveys and deploy tanker trucks, helicopters and quick-response crews to wildland fires.\n\"After launching the Fighting Fires Together campaign with FBHA four years ago, we're proud to continue this effort to support wildland firefighters and their mental health as they work in challenging conditions to protect our communities,\" says Bill Frings, vice president of Western Timberlands for Weyerhaeuser.\nPress Release article 7 of 12, Source: Company Website, 299 words \nMay 22: Weyerhaeuser Acquiring High-Quality Timberlands in North Carolina and Virginia\nCapitalizing on unique off-market opportunity to further enhance Southern Timberlands portfolio with highly productive and strategically located acreage\nSEATTLE, May 22, 2025 - Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today announced an agreement to acquire approximately 117,000 acres of high-quality timberlands in North Carolina and Virginia from Roanoke Timberlands LLC, a subsidiary of Roseburg Forest Products, for $375 million. Comprised of mature, highly productive timberlands, the acreage will be well-integrated with existing Weyerhaeuser timberland and mill operations in North Carolina, will expand the company's footprint into attractive markets in southeastern Virginia and will offer substantial alternative value opportunities. The acquisition is expected to deliver immediate and sustained portfolio-leading cash flows within the company's Southern Timberlands business.\nKey attributes of the acquisition:\nLocated in strong and growing sawlog and fiber markets in the U.S. South Primarily fee ownership with 81 percent planted pine acreage, strong site productivity and favorable all-weather logging operability Mature planted pine age class expected to produce an average annual harvest of 7.4 tons per acre (or 860,000 tons) over the first five years Expected to deliver an average annual timber free cash flow yield of 5.1 percent over the first five years Significant optionality to capture additional upside from real estate, natural climate solutions and natural resource opportunities \"These are exceptional timberlands, and we're excited and well-positioned to capitalize on this unique off-market opportunity,\" said Devin W. Stockfish, president and chief executive officer. \"As we've demonstrated over the last several years, we are committed to active portfolio management across our unmatched timber holdings and have remained disciplined in our approach to growing the value of our timberlands - including through strategically targeted private transactions like the one we're announcing today.\nPress Release article 8 of 12, Source: Company Website, 310 words \nMay 21: Weyerhaeuser to Sell Princeton, B.C., Lumber Mill to Gorman Group\nAgreement with local buyer includes manufacturing facility and associated timber licenses in British Columbia\nSEATTLE, May 21, 2025 - Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today announced it has reached an agreement to sell its lumber mill in Princeton, British Columbia, to the Gorman Group, owners of Gorman Bros.Lumber Ltd., a family-owned wood products manufacturer headquartered in West Kelowna, B.C. The purchase price is approximately $120 million CAD in cash, which includes Weyerhaeuser's manufacturing facility, all associated timber license assets in British Columbia and the value of working capital, which will be subject to customary purchase price adjustments at closing.\nWeyerhaeuser and Gorman Group have a long-standing relationship in Canada. Gorman Bros.Lumber is currently the Princeton mill's largest customer, and Gorman Group has operated in Canada for more than 75 years, with offices and facilities in B.C. and Washington state.\n\"We are grateful to all the dedicated employees who contributed to the success of our Princeton operations over the years,\" says Devin W. Stockfish, president and chief executive officer for Weyerhaeuser. \"The community has always been incredibly welcoming and supportive of our mill and people, and it was important for us to sell to a local buyer with deep roots in the region. Gorman has been a great customer and strategic partner, and we believe this will be a seamless transition that will position the mill for future success in a challenging operating environment - providing long-term certainty for the mill and the broader community.\"\n\"Weyerhaeuser's Princeton operation will be a natural fit with the Gorman Group,\" says Nick Arkle, chief executive officer of the Gorman Group. \"We've had a strong connection to the Princeton operation for many years, and we know firsthand the skill, commitment and quality that define its team.\nPress Release article 9 of 12, Source: WEC, 75 words \nMay 12: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady\nWeyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 21.0c per share for Q1/2025; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q4/2024) dividend of 21.0c.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S.\nPress Release article 12 of 12, Source: WEC, 76 words \nNovember 13 2024: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady\nWeyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 20.0c per share for Q3/2024; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q2/2024) dividend of 20.0c. The ex-dividend date is Friday, November 29, 2024 and the record date is Friday, November 29, 2024 and it is payable on Friday, December 13. Total dividends per share paid in the 12 months ended November 14 were 79.0c.\nSECTION 5 WEYERHAEUSER 10-Q: 12 CONSEQUENTIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS\nStrategic Expansion of Engineered Wood Products Capacity\nManagement has committed $500 million to constructing a new TimberStrand facility in Monticello, Arkansas, beginning in 2025, with operations expected by 2027. This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.\nShareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program\nFollowing completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.\nMaintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges\nWeyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.\nStrengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility\nThe company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.\nCapital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing\nManagement refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.\nFocused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency\nExcluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.\nExpansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth\nWeyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.\nUnlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures\nThe announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.\nTimberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base\nManagement advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.\nOperational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures\nInitiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.\nProactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities\nReserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.\nPrioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness\nRecognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.\nSource: Weyerhaeuser's, 10-Q filing dated October 31, 2025, available at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/106535/000119312525260808/wy-20250930.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/106535/000119312525260808/wy-20250930.htm</url> and Weyerhaeuser's website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/\">https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/</url>.\nSECTION 6 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS\n6.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield\nDividend Yield &gt; 2/3rd Bond Yield:\nThe dividend yield of 3.63% is 0.89 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.06%; it is also above the benchmark of 2/3rd set by Benjamin Graham. \n(All figures in %)\n<table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dividend Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.63</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bond Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.06</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Spread</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.43</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\nThe Dividend Yield of 3.6% is better than the Index average of 1.9%\n- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 3.6%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index of 1.9% is 192.1%.

As platforms like Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) govern the flow of information through opaque algorithms and profit-driven content curation, societies worldwide face the dual challenge of platform domination and information disorder. Traditional regulatory and educational frameworks have struggled to respond effectively to these transformations. As a result, media literacy has emerged as a strategic and necessary policy response to empower citizens, especially youth, with the critical skills needed to navigate, interpret, and engage responsibly with digital content.\nThis article explores media literacy not merely as a pedagogical tool, but as a crucial element of democratic resilience and information governance. It traces the evolution of media literacy from its early focus on broadcast media to its current relevance in algorithmically structured and socially networked environments. The article argues that media literacy policy must be robustly integrated into national education systems, public institutions, and platform accountability frameworks. Drawing on international case studies\u2014including Finland, Canada, and the European Union\u2014the discussion highlights successful policy approaches that address both the cognitive and civic dimensions of media literacy. However, it also emphasizes the limitations of isolated initiatives and the need for holistic, inclusive, and culturally adaptive strategies. In conclusion, the article proposes a multi-stakeholder roadmap for advancing media literacy policy in the digital age. This includes government leadership, platform cooperation, educational reform, and the active engagement of civil society. Only by embedding media literacy into the core of democratic policy responses can societies mitigate the harms of information disorder and reclaim agency over their digital environments.\n<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf\">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf</url>\nThe Industry\nCanadian and French media producers strengthen partnerships and open new paths for transatlantic content\nBack to all press releases \u2013 25/3/2025\nTORONTO, March 25, 2025 \u2014 France\u2019s Union Syndicale de la Production Audiovisuelle (USPA) and the Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA) today announced their joint delegation of producers from France and Canada, participating in a dedicated mission to explore coproduction opportunities for drama and documentary projects.\nThe delegation will first travel to Series Mania in Lille, France, and then head to Paris, where participants will meet with potential collaborators, as well as commissioners, studio execs, and other industry leaders, equipping themselves with the tools for future partnerships. The initiative aims to strengthen bilateral connections between French and Canadian producers, with a focus on the development of new English-language television series across genres.\nIn addition to bringing together experienced producers from Canada and France to strengthen bilateral content collaboration, the CMPA and USPA will discuss the ongoing shared challenges faced by the independent production sectors in their respective countries.\n\u201cUSPA is thrilled with the ongoing international cooperation fostered by its partnership with CMPA in Canada. In the current international context, it is necessary to strengthen the links between our two countries, both operationally and politically,\u201d said Amanda Borghino, Deputy General Delegate of the USPA. \u201cWe look forward to continuing this collaboration and shaping together new paths for transatlantic content.\u201d\n\u201cFrance has long been a valued production partner for Canada, and we are thrilled to collaborate with USPA on this initiative,\u201d said Reynolds Mastin, President and CEO of the CMPA. \u201cToday, our two countries are leading global efforts to ensure foreign streaming services respect the right of national governments to require equitable contributions to domestic production, and opportunities for local producers to hold and exploit their own intellectual property. This is critical to the success of local independent production sectors, and to safeguarding individual countries\u2019 national cultural sovereignty.\u201d\nParticipants from Canada:\n   Amos   Adetuyi, Circle Blue Entertainment  ", "NYSE END-OF-DAY STOCK REPORT\n<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url>\nWeyerhaeuser Company's (NYSE: WY $22.52) stock price hit a 52-week low of $22.43 during the day.

Its core business activities center on sustainable forest management, timber harvesting, and the production of wood products.

Additionally, Weyerhaeuser operates a Real Estate, Energy, and Natural Resources segment, focusing on land sales and renewable energy opportunities. Among its business lines, the Wood Products segment has shown notable growth, driven by strong demand in the housing and construction markets.

The acquisition is expected to deliver immediate and sustained portfolio-leading cash flows within the company's Southern Timberlands business.\nKey attributes of the acquisition:\nLocated in strong and growing sawlog and fiber markets in the U.S. South Primarily fee ownership with 81 percent planted pine acreage, strong site productivity and favorable all-weather logging operability Mature planted pine age class expected to produce an average annual harvest of 7.4 tons per acre (or 860,000 tons) over the first five years Expected to deliver an average annual timber free cash flow yield of 5.1 percent over the first five years Significant optionality to capture additional upside from real estate, natural climate solutions and natural resource opportunities \"These are exceptional timberlands, and we're excited and well-positioned to capitalize on this unique off-market opportunity,\" said Devin W. Stockfish, president and chief executive officer. \"As we've demonstrated over the last several years, we are committed to active portfolio management across our unmatched timber holdings and have remained disciplined in our approach to growing the value of our timberlands - including through strategically targeted private transactions like the one we're announcing today.\nPress Release article 6 of 10, Source: Company Website, 310 words \nMay 21: Weyerhaeuser to Sell Princeton, B.C., Lumber Mill to Gorman Group\nAgreement with local buyer includes manufacturing facility and associated timber licenses in British Columbia\nSEATTLE, May 21, 2025 - Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today announced it has reached an agreement to sell its lumber mill in Princeton, British Columbia, to the Gorman Group, owners of Gorman Bros.Lumber Ltd., a family-owned wood products manufacturer headquartered in West Kelowna, B.C. The purchase price is approximately $120 million CAD in cash, which includes Weyerhaeuser's manufacturing facility, all associated timber license assets in British Columbia and the value of working capital, which will be subject to customary purchase price adjustments at closing.\nWeyerhaeuser and Gorman Group have a long-standing relationship in Canada. Gorman Bros.Lumber is currently the Princeton mill's largest customer, and Gorman Group has operated in Canada for more than 75 years, with offices and facilities in B.C. and Washington state.\n\"We are grateful to all the dedicated employees who contributed to the success of our Princeton operations over the years,\" says Devin W. Stockfish, president and chief executive officer for Weyerhaeuser. \"The community has always been incredibly welcoming and supportive of our mill and people, and it was important for us to sell to a local buyer with deep roots in the region. Gorman has been a great customer and strategic partner, and we believe this will be a seamless transition that will position the mill for future success in a challenging operating environment - providing long-term certainty for the mill and the broader community.\"\n\"Weyerhaeuser's Princeton operation will be a natural fit with the Gorman Group,\" says Nick Arkle, chief executive officer of the Gorman Group. \"We've had a strong connection to the Princeton operation for many years, and we know firsthand the skill, commitment and quality that define its team.\nPress Release article 7 of 10, Source: WEC, 75 words \nMay 12: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady\nWeyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 21.0c per share for Q1/2025; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q4/2024) dividend of 21.0c.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S.\nPress Release article 10 of 10, Source: WEC, 76 words \nNovember 13 2024: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady\nWeyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 20.0c per share for Q3/2024; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q2/2024) dividend of 20.0c. The ex-dividend date is Friday, November 29, 2024 and the record date is Friday, November 29, 2024 and it is payable on Friday, December 13. Total dividends per share paid in the 12 months ended November 14 were 79.0c.\nSECTION 5 WEYERHAEUSER 10-Q: 12 CONSEQUENTIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS\nStrategic Expansion of Engineered Wood Products Capacity\nManagement has committed $500 million to constructing a new TimberStrand facility in Monticello, Arkansas, beginning in 2025, with operations expected by 2027. This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.\nShareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program\nFollowing completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.\nMaintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges\nWeyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.\nStrengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility\nThe company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.\nCapital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing\nManagement refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.\nFocused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency\nExcluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.\nExpansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth\nWeyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.\nUnlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures\nThe announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.\nTimberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base\nManagement advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.\nOperational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures\nInitiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.\nProactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities\nReserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.\nPrioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness\nRecognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.\nSECTION 6 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS\nPrice/Earnings of 60.9 &gt; Building Materials &amp; Fixtures sector (of 24 stocks) avg of 28.1:\n- The price-to-earnings ratio of 60.9 indicates overvaluation compared with sector average of 28.1 and market average of 15.5.\n6.1 3-DAY: STRONG MOMENTUM DOWN \nWY decreases 2.9% on high volume 2.5 times average.

Its core business activities center on sustainable forest management, timber harvesting, and the production of wood products. The company''s largest sources of revenue come from its Timberlands segment, which includes the sale of logs and timber, and its Wood Products segment, which manufactures and distributes lumber, engineered wood, and other building materials primarily for residential and commercial construction. Additionally, Weyerhaeuser operates a Real Estate, Energy, and Natural Resources segment, focusing on land sales and renewable energy opportunities. Among its business lines, the Wood Products segment has shown notable growth, driven by strong demand in the housing and construction markets.

In FY 2024, revenue growth was highest in REAL ESTATE &amp; ENR [7.7%] .\nWeyerhaeuser Company has consistently demonstrated its commitment to sustainable forestry and community development through strategic investments and philanthropic efforts. Recently, Weyerhaeuser made headlines with its land donation for the Row River wildfire substation, exemplifying its leadership in wildfire protection and emergency services partnerships. This initiative underscores Weyerhaeuser's dedication to wildfire mitigation and response infrastructure, crucial in safeguarding forests and nearby communities.\nIn West Virginia, Weyerhaeuser's investment strategy is robust, epitomized by a $1 million community investment in Buckhannon. This investment is set to bolster rural economic development and enhance Weyerhaeuser's community grants and support efforts. Highlighting its philanthropic endeavors, Weyerhaeuser's charitable giving focuses on corporate social responsibility, revered by the Buckhannon community for fostering sustainable forestry.\nThrough such initiatives, including timberland and forestland donations, Weyerhaeuser maintains a steadfast commitment to land stewardship, enhancing community resilience, and ensuring a sustainable future for generations.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.\nShareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program\nFollowing completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.\nMaintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges\nWeyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.\nStrengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility\nThe company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.\nCapital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing\nManagement refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.\nFocused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency\nExcluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.\nExpansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth\nWeyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.\nUnlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures\nThe announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.\nTimberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base\nManagement advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.\nOperational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures\nInitiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.\nProactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities\nReserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.\nPrioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness\nRecognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.\nSource: Weyerhaeuser's, 10-Q filing dated October 31, 2025, available at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/106535/000119312525260808/wy-20250930.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/106535/000119312525260808/wy-20250930.htm</url> and Weyerhaeuser's website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/\">https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/</url>.\nSECTION 6 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS\nPrice/Earnings of 41.6 &gt; Building Materials &amp; Fixtures sector (of 24 stocks) avg of 25.0:\n- The price-to-earnings ratio of 41.6 indicates overvaluation compared with sector average of 25.0 and market average of 15.3.\n6.1 3-DAY: STRONG MOMENTUM DOWN \nWY decreases 2.3% on robust volume 1.7 times average.
