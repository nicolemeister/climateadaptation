Wallace, Idaho, is the centre of the universe. Until someone can scientifically disprove it, the 784 residents will continue to annually celebrate the fact around the manhole at the main intersection of town. \"We're all odd ducks here,\" the Prime Minister tells me on my first evening in town. </p><p>\"If we were normal, we'd be somewhere else.\"It's September and mild enough to dine on the footpath near the smokehouse's southern-style barbecue. The forested valley walls rise steeply around us and, after a long slow dusk, downtown Wallace begins to glitter and glow.Prime Minister Rick Shaffer is a tall, energetic blond in his mid-50s. We are joined by a wan young man fresh from the neighbouring state of Washington and a messy divorce who is obsessed with yoghurt-covered pretzels - another odd duck. Over a pulled-pork dish, Philadelphia-born Shaffer tells us everything he knows about this town he's called home for 20 years. In 1884, a Colonel Wallace, who wasn't actually a colonel, staked his claim and built a cabin in the swampy cedar forest and called it Placer Centre. His wife became the first postmistress in a town of 14, soon renamed Wallace. Coeur d'Alene was on its way to becoming the world's richest silver district. Before long the town of Wallace had a saloon, school, narrow-gauge railroad, plank footpaths, banditry, shoot-outs, bordellos and roving card sharps such Wyatt Earp.In 1890 a fire started in the flue of the Central Hotel and the whole business district - all wooden buildings - and pretty much the rest of town burnt down.Rebuilding was consciously done in brick and in 1910, when a huge forest fire swept through this narrow valley, only a third of the town was lost. Shaffer cites Lana Turner's birth in the local hospital in 1921, then jumps forward more than half a century to the building of the country's longest highway stretching 5000 kilometres, from Boston to Seattle. I wonder why he thinks we want to hear about some old road, then realise he's leading up to Wallace's second significant act of resistance, and one that has forged the town's collective consciousness.Wallace fought construction of the Interstate 90 through its centre by placing the entire downtown on the National Register of Historic Places. After holding up completion of the I-90 for 17 years a compromise was finally reached, but in the meantime Wallace got on a roll. Now virtually the whole town is on that register and any new shop-front business must comply with a strict set of aesthetic rules. \"There will never be a Starbucks or a McDonald's here,\" Shaffer says, waving to some locals chugging down the main street on quad bikes, which the council allows and even advertises on its list of 89-plus things to do here (in winter it's snowmobiles). I'm beginning to notice that Wallace makes delicious mincemeat of the numerous stereotypes we hold about modern America. There are no police here, just a county sheriff. This town is so darned sweet, even the port-a-loos are branded Honey Bucket. \"It's so weird,\" the man from Washington says. \"It's like everyone who lives here has found home.\" He looks like he can't wait for that to happen to him, too, as we get up to leave.The following morning I've got time before meeting Shaffer for a walking tour of town and stop into Angie's Hub at Vintage Games. While Angie makes me a huckleberry shake, I ask if she was born here. \"Nope,\" she tells me, looking happy, \"I actively went in search of 'small town America' and just kept coming back to Wallace.\"Shaffer meets me at the universe's midpoint and we go from there. Sitting in the town's spaceship, I ask how he became PM and he tells me it began as a joke to a tour group back in 1993. Introducing himself as the US's only prime minister got such a good response he just kept using it. Twelve years later the council made it official and awarded him the city charter. He grins at me across the capsule: \"In Wallace, anyone can be anything.\"FAST FACTSGetting there United Airlines flies direct from Sydney to San Francisco with connections to Spokane, Washington.

The writer was a guest of Idaho Tourism.</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elspeth Callender sips a huckleberry shake and joins the Idaho townsfolk celebrating a tiny haven of eccentricity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wallace, Idaho, is the centre of the universe. Until someone can scientifically disprove it, the 784 residents will continue to annually celebrate the fact around the manhole at the main intersection of town. \"We're all odd ducks here,\" the Prime Minister tells me on my first evening in town. \"If we were normal, we'd be somewhere else.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's September and mild enough to dine on the footpath near the smokehouse's southern-style barbecue. The forested valley walls rise steeply around us and, after a long slow dusk, downtown Wallace begins to glitter and glow.</p><p>Prime Minister Rick Shaffer is a tall, energetic blond in his mid-50s. We are joined by a wan young man fresh from the neighbouring state of Washington and a messy divorce who is obsessed with yoghurt-covered pretzels - another odd duck. Over a pulled-pork dish, Philadelphia-born Shaffer tells us everything he knows about this town he's called home for 20 years. In 1884, a Colonel Wallace, who wasn't actually a colonel, staked his claim and built a cabin in the swampy cedar forest and called it Placer Centre. His wife became the first postmistress in a town of 14, soon renamed Wallace. Coeur d'Alene was on its way to becoming the world's richest silver district. Before long the town of Wallace had a saloon, school, narrow-gauge railroad, plank footpaths, banditry, shoot-outs, bordellos and roving card sharps such Wyatt Earp.</p><p>In 1890 a fire started in the flue of the Central Hotel and the whole business district - all wooden buildings - and pretty much the rest of town burnt down.</p><p>Rebuilding was consciously done in brick and in 1910, when a huge forest fire swept through this narrow valley, only a third of the town was lost. Shaffer cites Lana Turner's birth in the local hospital in 1921, then jumps forward more than half a century to the building of the country's longest highway stretching 5000 kilometres, from Boston to Seattle. I wonder why he thinks we want to hear about some old road, then realise he's leading up to Wallace's second significant act of resistance, and one that has forged the town's collective consciousness.</p><p>Wallace fought construction of the Interstate 90 through its centre by placing the entire downtown on the National Register of Historic Places. After holding up completion of the I-90 for 17 years a compromise was finally reached, but in the meantime Wallace got on a roll. Now virtually the whole town is on that register and any new shop-front business must comply with a strict set of aesthetic rules. \"There will never be a Starbucks or a McDonald's here,\" Shaffer says, waving to some locals chugging down the main street on quad bikes, which the council allows and even advertises on its list of 89-plus things to do here (in winter it's snowmobiles). I'm beginning to notice that Wallace makes delicious mincemeat of the numerous stereotypes we hold about modern America. There are no police here, just a county sheriff. This town is so darned sweet, even the port-a-loos are branded Honey Bucket. \"It's so weird,\" the man from Washington says. \"It's like everyone who lives here has found home.\" He looks like he can't wait for that to happen to him, too, as we get up to leave.</p><p>The following morning I've got time before meeting Shaffer for a walking tour of town and stop into Angie's Hub at Vintage Games. While Angie makes me a huckleberry shake, I ask if she was born here. \"Nope,\" she tells me, looking happy, \"I actively went in search of 'small town America' and just kept coming back to Wallace.\"</p><p>Shaffer meets me at the universe's midpoint and we go from there. Sitting in the town's spaceship, I ask how he became PM and he tells me it began as a joke to a tour group back in 1993. Introducing himself as the US's only prime minister got such a good response he just kept using it. Twelve years later the council made it official and awarded him the city charter. He grins at me across the capsule: \"In Wallace, anyone can be anything.\"</p><p>FAST FACTS</p><p>Getting there United Airlines flies direct from Sydney to San Francisco with connections to Spokane, Washington.

Supreme court judges in New Delhi this week were intoning that 1997 Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy's latest work - a small book against big dams called The Greater Common Good - is an attack on their dignity. In Gujarat state, Congress party youth activists made a bonfire of the book, and threatened shops that stock it. Roy was waking up to her own part in an environmental struggle of epic proportions: the Narmada Valley project, designed to put 3200 dams on a river that gives life to 25million people. The author's latest bout with controversy started when she put her celebrity - and the 20,000 ($48,500) of her Booker winnings for The God of Small Things - behind the fight to block the dams. Next week she will lead environmental activists visiting some of the 60 villages that will be drowned below the 88-metre walls of the Sardar Sarovar dam.</p><p>FOUGHT. The Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, helped to beat out flames when a forest fire threatened to engulf a villa in Tuscany belonging to the family of her friend Count Gaddo della Gherardesca. The fire was stopped 150 metres from the villa near Livorno on Saturday. At one stage she contacted the British embassy in Rome to help alert authorities. The Duchess was in Tuscany for the wedding of one of the count's cousins. A friend said: \"Sarah was to be seen in a T-shirt, shorts and tennis sneakers, frantically rushing round, beating the brush and undergrowth.\"</p><p>ENDANGERED. The Arabian white oryx, saved from extinction earlier this century by one of the world's first successful captive breeding programs, is again under threat. British scientists estimate that poachers have removed or killed at least 200 oryx in the past three years from the central desert in the Sultanate of Oman. Many of the animals are thought to have been taken for private zoos. The return of Oryx leucoryx to Oman in 1982, 10 years after it was exterminated in the wild, was hailed by scientists as a shining example of species conservation - captive breeding followed by reintroducing the animals into the wild.</p><p>BARRED. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the wild man of Russian politics, was barred at the weekend from running for governor of a key Urals region when officials found more than 2000 forged signatures on his nomination papers. Handwriting experts were asked to examine the papers after electoral officials noticed that several Zhirinovsky \"supporters\" had used an almost identical signature, despite living in different cities of the Sverdlovsk region. Zhirinovsky promised on Saturday that if the signatures were confirmed as forgeries, the local branch of his Liberal Democratic Party would be purged.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Four photos</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8H-NPD0-TXN5-S1KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yi2qas1g541mket02o4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB1999</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"444\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1999 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"1999\"><dateText>July 28, 1999 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RURCQkNBRjUwM0UxNDFCQ0E2NkM1MEREOTFGRjczQ0M7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEJGM0REMThGNjk0NDBGNUE3RUM0ODg1N0U3NTczMDc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp;

This is the story of the ocean voyage of an Australian soldier and his English bride travelling back to Australia after World War I.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a failed marriage to Edward McInnes one which yielded two sons, Graham and Colin Angela married an Australian soldier, George Thirkell. Their journey to Australia, with her sons, provided the background for Trooper to the Southern Cross. The family settled in Melbourne. A son, Lance, was born and, in 1929, Angela and Lance returned to England leaving Graham and Colin with their step-father.</p><p>She never returned to Australia. I thought this might be a more interesting story than Trooper to the Southern Cross.</p><p>A reader wrote to me and recommended a book by the elder son, Graham McInnes, The Road to Gundagai. The reader \"had read it as a homesick expat Australian married in London\". I have an association with the town of Gundagai so I put the book on my reading list. This year I found a copy in a second-hand bookshop in Fyshwick.</p><p>(The only reference to Gundagai in the book is in the lines from Jack O'Hagan's poem from which the title is taken presumably to identify the book as Australian.)</p><p>When Angela and George Thirkell, and the two boys, arrived in Australia in 1920 they lived briefly in Hobart before moving to Melbourne. The narrative of The Road to Gundagai is an account of a boy, Graham McInnes, growing up in suburban Melbourne in the 1920s. I was surprised to find aspects of this boyhood that were similar to my own boyhood in country towns of NSW in the 1940s and 1950s. Two of the most vivid were school teachers throwing blackboard dusters at misbehaving pupils and the recalcitrant behaviour of \"chip heaters\" used to heat bathwater. I identified with McInnes's descriptions of rabbit-trapping and his struggle with the discipline of a boy scout troop. Girls were reading books of the Billabong series by Mary Grant Bruce also popular with my sisters and both McInnes and myself were keen readers of the exploits of \"Sapper's\" Bulldog Drummond.</p><p>I noted McInnes's description of the country near the Victorian village of Kinglake. \"A forest fire ten years before had cleared away the timber, leaving sweeping slopes of bracken with here and there charred sentinels lifting against the sky as a reminder of the former forest.\"</p><p>While The Road to Gundagai is the story of Graham McInnes's life, he does give glimpses of his parents' characters before final chapters that deal with Angela and George Thirkell in more detail. As they moved into their Melbourne home, McInnes writes, \"Mother had an invincible contempt for things Australian and made no bones about it ... her relationship with shopkeepers, officials, neighbours and local tradespeople, was an unending guerrilla warfare\", and a couple of chapters later: \"Mother [had] taken the view that, broadly speaking, nothing worthwhile ever happened in Melbourne.\" His final word on his mother is that he has \"wonderfully amusing, witty and loving letters from her; but to be demonstrative, in person, ah! That was different.\"</p><p>McInnes enjoyed a much warmer relationship with his step- father. He refers to him as \"Dad\" or \"Thirk\" throughout the book. At mealtimes, \"Mother presided and carved: Dad, who was rarely in on time, ate and talked.\" Similarly, \"With Mother everything was sharp and tight and on schedule ... with Dad it was a world of laissez- faire, sudden impulses, tuneless cheerful whistling, odd tasks begun and never finished ... Dad never paid a school bill of mine in his life ... but if you wanted ten bob suddenly ... \" Angela Thirkell realised that she and George were incompatible and returned to England. Maybe she also realised that Graham and Colin were closer to their step-father than herself. However, a couple of years later, Colin McInnes followed his mother back to England.</p><p>Graham stayed in Melbourne.

There was also evidence that there are just not enough fire-fighters to meet the government's own fuel reduction targets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Australian Workers Union told the Commission that the Victorian Government had broken a 2004 promise to boost the number of firefighters protecting public land.</p><p>Lawyers acting for the Victorian Government didn't challenge any of the union's claims.</p><p>Samantha Donovan reports.</p><p>SAMANTHA DONOVAN: Fuel reduction on public land in Victoria is one of the most contentious issues for the Royal Commission to consider. Athol Hodgson is a forest fire expert and a former chief fire officer with what was once the Victorian Department of Conservation. He was blunt in his assessment to the Commission.</p><p>ATHOL HODGSON: The Government of Victoria with respect to public land management has allowed fuel levels to accumulate to levels that I believe are quiet unnatural and they've accumulated to the levels and got so dry on a, in a period of drought that it became impossible to stop some fires unless you were standing beside them when they started.</p><p>And those unnaturally high levels of fuel contributed significantly to the fact that people died in large numbers in a very short space of time.</p><p>SAMANTHA DONOVAN: The Commission heard today that the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment currently burns less than two per cent of Victorian forests to reduce fuels. But its own corporate plan says a desirable target is two to three times that.</p><p>Mr Hodgson asked the Commission to recommend that the state almost triple its fuel reduction burns and enshrine the targets in legislation so performance can be accurately assessed. The Australian Workers Union represents field staff and fire-fighters employed by state government departments.</p><p>The secretary of the Victorian branch, Cesar Melhem told the Commission that the state is \"tragically unprepared\" for another Black Saturday. He said the number of fire-fighters has fallen dramatically since the 1980s and '90s.</p><p>CESAR MELHEM: It's a huge difference, I mean as you said, the numbers back has fallen from a shameful 257 to a 237 notwithstanding the government promise to increase this number.</p><p>SAMANTHA DONOVAN: The current statistics of the Victorian DepDepartmentt of Sustainability and Environment put the number of staff at 3,000. But Cesar Melhem says the figures are misleading.</p><p>CESAR MELHEM: It's fine to have all these good numbers, 3,065 but we need to really look at how many actual fire-fighters, how many field staff, there's too many chiefs and less fire-fighters. You can't go and fight a war with a part -time army. You need a fully trained professional fire-fighters to prepare us and the resources are not there.</p><p>SAMANTHA DONOVAN: Counsel assisting the Commission, Rachel Doyle showed the Union's Cesar Melhem a 2004 Victorian government press release. It announced that 200 new staff would be employed to work on fire fighting and prevention over the next four years.</p><p>Mr Melhem said at the time he understood that to mean an extra 151 field crew would be employed.</p><p>CESAR MELHEM: But unfortunately they have broken that promise and we've only seen an increase of 23 field fire-fighters and we're waiting, we're still waiting for the other 128.</p><p>SAMANTHA DONOVAN: Lawyers acting for the Victorian Government didn't cross-examine Mr Melhem on any of the union's claims. But examined by senior counsel assisting the Commission, Jack Rush QC, the secretary of the Department of Sustainability and Environment, Greg Wilson acknowledged the department was reviewing its staffing levels.</p><p>GREG WILSON: We've got staffing submissions before the Government that go to questions about resources into the future which I'm unable to talk about from a cabinet and confidence point of view but we're certainly building our resources, building our capability and getting better at it.</p><p>The Government will want to look at the findings of the Commission and a whole range of other factors, I suspect, before it makes definitive decisions about resources in response to the proposals that we've put to them recently.</p><p>MARK COLVIN: Greg Wilson, secretary of the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment ending Samantha Donovan's report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-2825118</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7XV1-MWH1-2RG6-Y55R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473393</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"727\"/><timeReceived>6:32 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>February 19, 2010 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Event/ROYAL COMMISSION.

Much of it was formerly managed by the old SECV and the Forestry Commission.</p><p>Regular, managed burning reduced fuel levels and when a bushfire did start it was fought with local volunteers.</p><p>When these organisations disappeared the resources dried up and governments refused to take up the slack.</p><p>The fuel load builds up to crisis levels, fires start and the Department of Sustainability and Environment does not have enough people to put them out.</p><p>The problem gets worse because paid CFA executives have squeezed out experienced and knowledgeable local volunteers.</p><p>Authorities have let fire trails return to nature and fire crews cannot reach fires.</p><p>Instead of fighting the fires, huge bulldozed containment lines are ripped into the forest around the fire perimeter.</p><p>At one stage during the current fires some 60 bulldozers were reported to be going flat out.</p><p>As the fires spread, countless wild animals, plants and insect colonies are destroyed.</p><p>The ground cover is killed, seeds get washed away and much of the forest gets replaced with grassland.</p><p>These days the Man from Snowy River might ride a lawnmower.</p><p>The greens are also quiet about the competition between native species and introduced feral pests.</p><p>For example, some of the first vegetation to return after the fires is the noxious blackberry vine, which fuels much of the fire in the first place.</p><p>Native animals struggling to recover get crowded out by introduced pests such as the big samba deer and wild goats, dogs and brumbies.</p><p>It is estimated there are more than 200,000 such pests in the fire country. Yet they are effectively protected because killing more than a handful might cause protests in the city.</p><p>INSTEAD, the mountain cattlemen get painted as vandals, even though they used to graze as few as 6000 cattle for 16 weeks a year.</p><p>The president of Forest Fire Victoria, Athol Hodgson, correctly observes that country people have been isolated from the protection and maintenance of public land.</p><p>The huge risk for Melbourne relates to the security of water supply.</p><p>The current fires actually reached the Thomson River catchment, which supplies most of Melbourne's water.</p><p>It is only a matter of time before the catchment burns and Melbourne University's Dr Peter Attiwill says regrowth will reduce stream flows by 30 to 50 per cent.</p><p>If the catchment does burn, the remaining water will be contaminated with ash and silt and it will be like drinking from an ashtray.</p><p>Such a disaster in the middle of a drought could see household water restricted to a trickle.</p><p>Some people would need to move to find water and Victoria's water chasers would become Australia's first environmental refugees.</p><p>Victorians must be allowed to have an informed debate about forest management so that our environmental treasures receive the resources and management they need.</p><p>That debate would also restore some respect for the role played by

With a melancholy, detached vocal style and a habit of moulding pretentious, stream-of-consciousness lyrics into genuinely touching laments, Cole needed musicians to bring his literate tales to life. From the stark organ and vocal arrangement of the bitter hymn Forest Fire to the sparkling, pristine pop singles Rattlesnakes, Lost Weekend and My Bag, The Commotions made it happen with brevity, inventiveness and style. Cole should never have left them, for the quality of his solo work since the elegant early single No Blue Skies has generally tapered off. 8/10</p><p>Cross reference: The Triffids, Ron Sexsmith, Aztec Camera</p><p>The Islander</p><p>Dave Dobbyn (Columbia/Sony)</p><p>WAY too un-hip for the national youth network (Triple J) and subject to the extreme caution displayed by 2DAY and Triple M's music directors, it is little wonder an artist such as Dave Dobbyn finds himself existing in a void. One quality release follows another, only to be feted in his homeland of New Zealand and stupidly ignored here. It is sad because Dobbyn, founding member of DD Smash and best-known for his cheesy 1980s hit Slice Of Heaven, owns a soulful vocal and writes a mean pop song. Highlights include Waiting, which comes on like a Blur out-take from the early 1990s, and the gentle, melodic acoustic hops Mobile Home and Hanging In The Wire. 7/10</p><p>Cross reference: Neil Finn, Blur, The Bodeans</p><p>Sister And Brother</p><p>Melky Sedeck (MCA/Universal)</p><p>AS with their older brother, the Fugees' Wyclef Jean, Blandinna \"Melky\" Jean and Farel \"Sedeck\" Jean were raised in a strict Christian household in Brooklyn, New York. Sister And Brother is a hip-hop soul collection that swings effortlessly between contemporary middle-of-the-road raps and timeless, Motown-inspired r 'n' b. With smart use of strings, odd keyboard noises, guitars and mouth harp and sharp vocal arrangements, Melky Sedeck manage to save the so-so songs from complete blandness. However, the programmed beats are way too thin. 6/10</p><p>Cross reference: Maxwell, Gladys Knight, The Fugees</p><p>Various</p><p>Aussie Rock (Warner)</p><p>DESPITE the dodgy spelling on the sleeve notes Aussie Rock provides a pleasurable enough mosey down memory lane. Highlights include Spectrum's plodding classic I'll Be Gone, Masters Apprentices' swinging garage stomp Turn Up Your Radio, Australian Crawl's atmospheric ballad Reckless, Mi-Sex's early synth exploration Computer Games and Max Merritt &amp;

Rick Feneley profiles RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was another fire emergency, 10 or more years ago. Shane Fitzsimmons, already a senior manager or \"white shirt\" at the Rural Fire Service, had put in some hard hours. Then commissioner Phil Koperberg told him: \"Shane, whether you like it or not, you're going home. You need to rest. I need you at your best.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"He reluctantly agreed,\" Koperberg recalled this week. \"Then I happened to go out where the fires were and I found him on a fire truck.\" There he was, fighting a fire with the \"yellow overalls\". \"I said, 'This doesn't look like a bed to me.' \"</p><p>Koperberg would go on to anoint Fitzsimmons as his successor in 2007. \"This week's event was his trial by fire, if you'll pardon the pun, and he has emerged from it soundly - exceptionally.\"</p><p>On Friday last week, the day after firestorms erupted and razed 208 homes, Premier Barry O'Farrell appeared before the cameras with Fitzsimmons. \"I was behind him when he broke up at the lectern, when he was asked how his volunteers and paid firefighters were coping,\" O'Farrell tells the Herald. This display of emotion was a potent scene: the unflappable Fitzsimmons - the stoic who would stand at that lectern eight times a day over the next week and deliver the grim news in monotone - suddenly overwhelmed, gulping back tears before they could flow, the Premier placing a supporting hand on his shoulder.</p><p>O'Farrell reasons: \"When you hear the Fitzsimmons story, particularly about the loss of his dad, he does not have to be reminded about the risks that are involved in firefighting.\"</p><p>Shane Fitzsimmons was 15 when he joined the Duffys Forest Rural Fire Brigade in northern Sydney. He volunteered so he could fight bushfires alongside his father, George, a full-time firey. Young Shane was enthralled. George Fitzsimmons worked with fire-prevention crews from the Warringah Control Centre. The centre's fire control officer was Keith Simpson, whose daughter Lisa worked on the radio. Shane and Lisa would become teenage sweethearts, then husband and wife.</p><p>Shane got his trade as a motor mechanic but never stopped his RFS volunteer work. He was in his 20s when Koperberg met him at Warringah in 1994. The commissioner told his executive assistant: \"This young man has real potential. We need to bring him in.\"</p><p>Within two years, Fitzsimmons had become the RFS state operations officer and in 1998 he was appointed assistant commissioner responsible for operations. His father, a yellow-overalls man who had been awarded the National Fire Medal, would give him the gee-up for being a white shirt. They were close. George was a young father. Only 21 years separated him and his son.</p><p>George was 52 when he and three other firemen were killed during what was meant to be a routine hazard-reduction burn in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park on June 8, 2000. While media reports suggested George had led his trapped party uphill, contrary to procedure, the coroner exonerated him and found he had trusted an inaccurate map.</p><p>Shane was working that day and Koperberg remembers: \"There was an immediate flood of support for him to go and attend to his own personal loss. Shane has never been one to walk away from his post at a time of adversity.\"</p><p>That tragedy must inform the compassion he feels for firefighters, the burden of responsibility he carries for them, and the displays of emotion, Koperberg and O'Farrell say.</p><p>Fitzsimmons acknowledges this when he finds a few minutes for the Herald on Thursday night. He is not long off the phone to the wife of David Black, a father of three killed that day when his plane crashed while fighting fires on the south coast. Hours earlier, Fitzsimmons had again struggled to compose his emotion before the cameras when he said the pilot's children would soon have to understand why \"their dad hasn't come home\".</p><p>\"I think the experience I went through and the families of the other men went through - I became close to them - it's an ordeal you wouldn't wish upon anybody,\" he says. \"I can't think of a more horrifying way to go than to be incinerated in a fire.\"</p><p>So didn't he want to quit after his father's death? \"I did for a fleeting moment think, 'Why do this?' But I remember it strengthened my resolve to say, 'No, you can't stand on the outside and pontificate. If you want to make a difference, you have to get in there.' \"</p><p>Koperberg, who spent 21 years as commissioner from 1985, and who went on to become a state Labor minister, saw early that Fitzsimmons could make a difference. He saw the same qualities in another volunteer he hand-picked, Rob Rogers. Koperberg exposed both men to wide-ranging experience in middle and senior management. \"This was part of my succession planning.\" Rogers is now deputy commissioner. O'Farrell has called back Koperberg to co-ordinate the recovery in the Blue Mountains.</p><p>At RFS headquarters, Fitzsimmons presents as a man with old-fashioned manners; after one of his news conferences - the first is at 7.05am, the last at 8.05pm - he opens the door for a stampede of journalists rushing to file stories. In the kitchen, he refers to Ally, the woman making coffee, by name. \"He doesn't hold airs and graces,\" Keith Simpson, his father-in-law, says. \"He's not someone who looks for accolades. He's just a firey.\"</p><p>Shane and Lisa Fitzsimmons have two daughters, Lauren, 16, and Sarah, 13. He has considered entering politics \"to the extent that I want to serve the community. But then I see what happens to politicians today and I think, 'Why would you?\"'</p><p>He adds: \"I'm lucky. I've grown up in the RFS. I found my wife through this organisation. The RFS is family. I love what it stands for. I love what its people stand for - and I love them for what they do.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>TWO PHOTOS: Young volunteer: Shane Fitzsimmons at the age of 16 (centre) with his father George (bottom left) and the rest of the Duffys Forest fire crew in 1985.

effect, according to new research.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A CSIRO and Monash University study of the effect of an expected doubling of carbon dioxide levels during the next century because of the greenhouse effect showed an increase in fire risk across most of Victoria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Firefighters said yesterday they will move faster on implementing new fire control measures, including Neigborhood Watch-style community groups, because of the data.</p><p>Victoria already has one of the most severe fire climates in the world, recording 72 per cent of Australia's 467 wildfire deaths since 1900 and a yearly average annual property loss of $51 million since 1970.</p><p> In the Ash Wednesday fires in February 1983, 46 people died and 1511 houses were burnt, leaving a damage bill of almost $500 million.</p><p> CSIRO bushfire research unit scientist Dr Tom Beer said a drop in relative humidity - a major factor in bushfire risk - would come with the greenhouse effect.</p><p> The atmosphere would heat and carbon dioxide levels would jump as the protective ozone layer was depleted.</p><p> The model predicted large areas of Victoria would become more fire-prone, with East Gippsland recording the largest increase in the Forest Fire Danger Index.</p><p> \"East Gippsland would experience a 38 per cent rise in the index if the carbon dioxide level were to double during the next century,\" Dr Beer said.</p><p> \"Almost every summer, that would raise the fire danger in this region to a value as high as those experienced on Ash Wednesday.\" Senior fire control officers say work will be speeded up on new firefighting procedures, including a co-operative commmunity-based approach to protection.</p><p> The chief fire officer at the Conservation and Environment Department, Mr Rod Incoll, said the study had added new urgency to fire prevention work.</p><p> He said a Neighborhood Watch-style program was high on the agenda as two-thirds of wildfires were caused by people.</p><p> There will be closer links between the department and the Country Fire Authority and a more ecologically-based fire prevention approach.</p><p> \"Fire prevention needs to be seen as a whole community responsibility and the CSIRO information showed that this would become more essential as climate change progressed,\" Mr Incoll said.</p><p> Rio summit

lives and is the largest in China for at least four decades, has turned away from a northern city of 100,000 people, but it was still out of control on several fronts late today.</p><p>Yesterday, the blaze reached the outskirts of Tahe, in Heilongjiang province, near the Sino-Soviet border, prompting another 10,000 soldiers and volunteers to join the 15,000 people already fighting the fire.</p><p>Fortunately, the wind dropped and Tahe, which Chinese officials had said was in \"serious danger\", is now safe.</p><p>Firefighters and soldiers are being parachuted into thick forest to cut firebreaks, while several planes have been seeding clouds in the area in the hope of encouraging rain.</p><p>Since the fire began last Wednesday, about 300 people have been injured, 51,000 have been left homeless and 400,000 hectares of forest has been destroyed.</p><p>Xilinji, a town with a population of 20,000, has been razed, and 20,000 people have been evacuated from in and around Tahe, which has been protected by a 20 kilometre-long firebreak.</p><p>The blaze apparently began when a faulty forest clearing machine caught fire on a farm close to the border, and it has been fanned by

Sting has previously attributed his boast to a drunken night out, but he supplies the details for the first time. \"It was simply me and Geldof bitching,\" says Sting, whose hits include Roxanne and Don't Stand So Close to Me.</p><p> \"We were chatting and talking about having hours of sex. It then became really a joke that went around the world like a forest fire.\"</p><p> Geldof has given his version of events in a separate interview. \"We did have a few drinks together,\" concedes the former Boomtown Rat, now better known for his interest in Third World issues. \"I said to Sting, 'Why would you want it for eight hours? It must be so boring. She (Trudie) must have said, 'Get on with it'.\"</p><p> According to Geldof, it was Sting who enthused about prolonged sex. To which Geldof replied: \"Thirty seconds, that's enough, that'll do me.\"</p><p> Styler, who works as a movie producer and environmentalist, landed herself in hot water recently when talking about her sex life on US radio.</p><p> Interviewed by shock-jock Howard Stern, she said she and her husband enjoyed wife-swapping, and that she liked the attentions of women.</p><p> When Stern asked, \"Are you guys still swinging?\" Styler replied, \"Yes, big time, honey.\"</p><p> Stern's sidekick on the program, Robin Quivers, inquired if the 49-year-old mother of four knew what swinging meant. Styler responded, \"Swinging is like wife-swapping, right? Of course we're doing it.\"</p><p> She told Stern that she and her ex-Police frontman spiced up their love life by watching Sting meeting other women at sex clubs. But a couple of days after her interview on US radio, Styler came clean, admitting the whole thing had been a hoax. \"I was joking, for goodness sake,\" she said.</p><p> Now well into middle age, Mr and Mrs Sumner seem finally to have put to bed the stories about their love-making.</p><p> Quite why they allowed these urban myths to spread, and are now so keen to deny them, probably only a sex counsellor or psychotherapist would know.</p><p> Geldof may have the answer: \"It's like tantric shopping.

The most vocal critic of the way Japan's Liberal Democratic Party is selecting its leader is not the opposition, the media or the markets, but an influential party member whose father was the master of the back-room deal. Makiko Tanaka, daughter of the late Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, is not only an influential woman in a male-dominated environment, she is also outspoken. \"This election will decide whether the LDP can change itself, but the candidates merely give speeches. There is no debate. We need to be more open,\" she said this week as a stream of senior politicians traipsed into her office to canvass her support. The influence of her father, who built up the party's most-powerful faction, is still strong and Ms Tanaka is said to have the support of about 20 LDP legislators.</p><p>CRUISING. As the battle for the non-permanent seats on the UN Security Council hots up, Greek suntans are the order of the day at the United Nations. More than 110 UN ambassadors have accepted an invitation from the Greek Government to take their families on an all-expenses-paid Aegean cruise. The invitations are ostensibly aimed at boosting international support for an Olympic truce centre to be located at Olympia in southern Greece, the historic seat of the Olympic Games. But nobody has any doubts that the initiative is part of Greece's bid to secure a non-permanent seat on the Security Council when the 185-nation UN General Assembly votes on the new members in November.</p><p>ENDANGERED. The health risk to tens of thousands of Indonesians hit by smoky haze last year may be more severe than expected, US Environmental Protection Agency officials warned this week. \"We have every reason to project that there probably was a much more substantial public health impact, a much more likely increased mortality among these people, and increased hospital admissions,\" Lester Grant, director of the EPA's Environmental Criteria and Assessment Office, said. The EPA based its conclusions on studies of forest fire haze in large areas of the region. It found that for Malaysia and Singapore the health risk was less severe.</p><p>DIAGNOSED. Medical tests conducted on Jordan's King Hussein at a hospital in the United States suggest the 62-year-old monarch has cancer, the king told his brother, Crown Prince Hassan ibn Talal, in a letter made public in Amman. \"All the indications lead one to believe that I have a lymphoma,\" wrote the king, adding that he was about to \"undergo chemotherapy\". The king had said in a note to his brother that doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, expected to reach a precise diagnosis after obtaining the laboratory tests.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Four photos</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8H-NPK0-TXN5-S070-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yi270lzavchkq2c2o4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB1998</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"443\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1998 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>July 23, 1998 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000639</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL LAW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>STX000248</classCode><className>CANCER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp;

Not that I\u2019ve changed the minds of any trolls, nor have I expected to.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I have received an education in the tactics many trolls use. These tactics are common not just to trolls but to bloggers, journalists and politicians who attack science, from climate to cancer research.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some techniques are comically simple. Emotionally charged, yet evidence-free, accusations of scams, fraud and cover-ups are common. While they mostly lack credibility, such accusations may be <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/you-idiot-course-trolls-comments-make-you-believe-science-less\">effective</url> at polarising debate and reducing understanding.</p><p>And I wish I had a dollar each time a scientifically incompetent ideologue claimed . The chairman of the Prime Minister\u2019s Business Advisory Council, Maurice Newman, trotted out that old chestnut in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/were-illprepared-if-the-iceman-cometh/story-e6frg6zo-1227023489894\">The Australian</url></emphasis>last week.

There are thousands of professors scattered across academia, so it isn\u2019t surprising that a few contrarians can be found.

How do the scientifically illiterate select this minority of experts?</p><p>I\u2019ve asked trolls this question a few times and, funnily enough, they cannot provide good answers. To be blunt, they are choosing experts based on agreeable conclusions rather than scientific rigour, and this problem extends well beyond online debates.</p><p>Earlier this month, Senator Eric Abetz controversially seemed to link abortions with breast cancer on Channel Ten\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-project/extra/season-5/eric-abetz\">The Project</url></emphasis>.</p><p>While Abetz distanced himself from these claims, his <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.webcitation.org/6RgV5sDoO\">media statement</url> doesn\u2019t dispute them and talks up the expertise of Dr Angela Lanfranchi, who does link abortions with breast cancer.</p><p>Abetz does not have expertise in medical research, so why did he give Dr Lanfranchi\u2019s views similar or more weight than those of most doctors, including the Australian Medical Association\u2019s president , who say there is <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/abortion-miscarriage\">no clear link</url> between abortion and breast cancer?</p><p>If Abetz cannot evaluate the medical research data and methods, is his choice largely based on Dr Lanfranchi\u2019s conclusions?

They teamed with the air crane to help quell the fire, looking like underfed insects next to the mighty Ericsson. But they did the job, their waterfalls shining in a silver curtain as they hurled towards the ground.</p><p> A red and white helicopter patrolled the sky, directing the water-bomber crews towards their target.</p><p> The two-pronged attack -- ground and air -- turned the tide and the smoke plumes soon shrunk to thin wisps of white, like an old man's combover.</p><p> A house nestled in clearing less than a kilometre from the two-hectare fire. Other houses were dotted along Mt Sabine Road, pockets of private land vulnerable in the face of a forest fire. While their occupants might have had the smell of smoke in their nostrils, they were safe. The fire did not threaten any private property.</p><p> As the afternoon crept on and the fire shut down, the helicopters left. The air crane departed first, called away to another fire.

It's the year's first inspirational film, the story of a genius born on the wrong side of the tracks. Will Hunting (Damon) is a kind of enfant sauvage from the mean Irish streets of south Boston. He's an orphan, and he and his pals love baseball, girls and fighting turf wars with the local Italian boys. Will's in denial of what he is, for one thing: he refuses to act like a genius, even though he knows he probably is one. After what seems an eternity of clues, he is noticed by Professor Gerald Lambeau and the plot to civilise Will Hunting begins. Lambeau rescues Will from the gutter and hands him over to a famous therapist called Sean McGuire (<person><nameText>Robin Williams</nameText></person>). Most of this is predictable - fireworks, bad behaviour, tough love - and it gets progressively more maudlin, but the film does have one surprising grace note, and that's the casting of Minnie Driver as Skylar, an English girl studying at Harvard. Driver steals Will's heart and the movie itself. - Paul Byrnes</p><p>FIRESTORM</p><p>FORMER pro football star Howie Long quickly becomes part of the scenery in his screen debut - an action adventure about a gang of firefighters in the Wyoming state forests. With a neck like a tree trunk, a face seemingly chiselled out of pine and an acting style to match, he could beat a forest fire to death, if he didn't first bore it into submission. Howie and his team are \"smokejumpers\" - firefighters who parachute into burning forests. Writer Soth isn't strong on logic. Nor does he trust the fearsomeness of the fire to keep the plot revved up. As a result, he throws in a gang of escaped convicts, led by William Forsythe, a good actor when the circumstances are right, but completely baffled by his role here. He plays a sort of paste-up of villains gone by. While Forsythe hams it up, Howie doesn't act at all, and Scott Glenn, who actually manages a performance, has nowhere to take it, as the director Semler pumps up the music and lays on the bathos. - Sandra Hall</p><p>HERALD'S CHOICE</p><p>* The Wings of a Dove</p><p>* As Good As It Gets</p><p>* Boogie Nights</p><p>* Ma Vie En Rose</p><p>* Hurricane Streets</p><p>* Jackie Brown</p><p>* The Boxer</p><p>* All Over Me</p><p>* The Winter Guest</p><p>* The Garden of the Finzi-Continis</p><p>See Saturday's Spectrum for reviews of A Little Bit of Soul A Mongolian Tale.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yhvwanibug10rizn7qz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P85-1CN0-TXN5-R1TC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1998 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>March 19, 1998 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

During the visits, we seek input from the membership on existing programs and suggestions for other areas in which PATA can provide assistance,\" Mclnerney said.</p><p> Initial elements of the plan include the following:</p><p> - Effective with the Dec. 1, 1997 edition of \"What's New in the Pacific Asia,\" PATA is placing special emphasis on bargains and promotions being offered by PATA members.</p><p>\"What's New\" is distributed to PATA's international media mailing list and is also posted online for consumers at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pata.org\">www.pata.org</url> under \"Travel News.\"</p><p> - The listing of special bargains and promotions will also be provided to all 79 PATA Chapters for distribution to member travel agents.</p><p> - Travel agent workshops will be organised in Australia and New Zealand during the first half of 1998 to promote travel to Asia. Coupled with the sessions will be media events for consumer and trade reporters.</p><p> - From October 1997, PATA will have conducted five major working media trips by May 1998, with North American and European journalists to help promote travel to the region.</p><p> Participating destinations include Vietnam, India, Hong Kong, Papua New Guinea and Sarawak, Malaysia. In addition, a working trip to the South Pacific will be organised later this year.</p><p> - PATA and Time Magazine are collaborating to offer Communications workshops throughout the region. The two-day workshops are designed to help mid-level public relations employees improve their media relations skills.</p><p> - In conjunction with the Communications Workshops, the host destination will have the opportunity to hold a single-day media or product promotion workshop.</p><p> (PNA)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3S1W-9M80-0048-T27N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"474\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>AAP NEWSFEED</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 AAP Information Services Pty.

Now the singer-songwriter is just bleak, he tells Sophie Best.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When Lloyd Cole and his band the Commotions landed in Australia for their 1986 tour, they were ushered into the most expensive hotel they'd ever seen. Marvelling at the luxury of their suite, the band members dialled the singer's room to compare notes. Cole's room was even bigger, and he was mortified. \"I was embarrassed,\" he says, \"so I asked to be moved.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"In retrospect,\" he says in his charmingly plummy, English-gentleman voice, \"I should have taken it. After all, we weren't paying for it! But I was embarrassed to be the leader of the band, and that saddens me. I should have enjoyed it.\"</p><p>Cole didn't know it then, but the band had already peaked. Their debut album Rattlesnakes yielded three UK hits (the title track, plus Perfect Skin and Forest Fire), but that chart success was never to be repeated. Nor were they to play to crowds of 25,000 again, as they did in Sydney that night.</p><p>Not long after returning to England, Cole disbanded the group. \"Once I realised I could do things on my own, I had this great joie de vivre. I wish I could have had that feeling when the band was together, but we were very uptight.\"</p><p>Behind their front as thinking women's heart-throbs, Cole says they were a miserable bunch. \"We were afraid of offending each other, afraid of doing something that might be perceived as politically incorrect, afraid of having fun. Thank heavens we made decent records.\"</p><p>Cole moved to New York to pursue a solo career. \"I had great fun being a solo artist,\" he says, \"trying to be the David Bowie of my generation, and finding out quickly that I wasn't.\"</p><p>At the age of 42 and with his fifth solo release, Music in a Foreign Language, on the shelves, Cole says he'd now rather be Leonard Cohen. \"Without becoming a Buddhist monk, or sacrificing my family for my art,\" he qualifies. \"I want to make quiet songs for people who want to hear quiet music.\"</p><p>The songs on Music in a Foreign Language are indeed quiet - sombre, subdued, and quite often bleak. \"I'm not trying to negate the beauty of life, the love and joy that I have,\" insists Cole, who now lives in rural Massachusetts with his wife and two children. \"This group of songs just happens to be the bleakest I've ever done.\"</p><p>Cole has been exploring the mid-life yearning for escape. \"You find yourself in status quo situations,\" he explains, \"and sometimes you want to tear the whole thing up. You drive your car, seven days a week, and sometimes you just want the next truck to hit you.\"</p><p>Cole puts his family first, and is unconcerned as to how long his songwriting career might last. \"If I wake up one day, and my creativity's gone, and I'm not writing songs anymore, that's fine,\" he says.</p><p>\"In fact it's a bit of a pain, driving your car with this bloody song going round in your head,\" he adds playfully. \"So I do rather look forward to when that's not the case.\"</p><p>Lloyd Cole plays the Forum Dec 4.

Plants and gardeners alike have to contend with heatwaves and cyclonic rains.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When choosing which summer flowers to plant, look for hardy varieties with a long flowering period so that several months of color will be obtained from one planting.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>QNP</p></bodyText></section><p>Ideal summer annuals need the capacity to endure all kinds of weather conditions and to cope with insect pests and flower freely in spite of temporary setbacks.</p><p>A lot of summer annuals meet these requirements. Others require a certain amount of coaxing.</p><p>Years ago I had an excellent crop of Giant Crego Asters in full bloom in mid-February. Then there was a week of heavy rain and wind.</p><p>The blooms, weighed down with water, were swept back and forth over muddy soil.</p><p>Now I advocate early planting of asters so that they flower before the end of the year when cyclonic con- ditions are less common than later in the summer.</p><p>There are fewer sum- mer flowers for cutting for vase use than there are among spring flowers; but that is offset by a group of annuals that provide garden color for long periods.</p><p>Some of the summer annuals can be raised very easily from seed.</p><p>Warm conditions favor rapid germination. Seed boxes or special seed beds are not always necessary.</p><p>Places in garden beds where the sown patch can be attended to easily will do nicely for marigolds, amaranthus, celosia, zinnia and cosmos, for instance. If the seeds are tiny, as for torenia and portulaca, seed boxes are advisable.</p><p>Annuals for cut flowers Asters are the best of the summer flowers for vase use. Once seedlings are established there is little to do beyond the usual maintenance but watch for insect damage in the heart of the plant. A caterpillar that establishes its home there causes some distortion of the leaves or even eats the growing point of the flower.</p><p>When preparing to flower the aster develops flower stalks from the central growing point. Because this insect pest is quite common, it is worthwhile to put Carbaryl, Dispel or Endopest into the hearts of the plants early in their life.</p><p>Several varieties of aster are sold. Colour Carpet is a dwarf type for edging beds and Giant Crego, Perfection and Totem Pole are sources of cut flowers.</p><p>Zinnias are available in many varieties, some of a stature and flower type that make them suitable for vases. Showman and Gold Medal are two in that category. Happy Talk, a variety with slightly curled and quilled petals, is a semi-dwarf offshoot from the variety Coquette.</p><p>The flower stalks of Happy Talk are relatively short, but the flowers can be used to good effect in certain sorts of vase. Some people regard the large-flowered zinnias as being too stiff and they might find Happy Talk more to their liking.</p><p>The African Marigold variety Jubilee is one with flower stalks that make it useful for cutting. Objections to the odor of the leaves of marigolds rule it out from consideration sometimes. Minimal trouble will be experienced if you avoid crushing the foliage.</p><p>The recently introduced Inca (from Thompson and Morgan) and African Queen (from Yates) are varieties with very large, fully double flowers.</p><p>Although short in the stalks, the flowers can be used effectively in certain kinds of container. For garden decoration they are a spectacular success.</p><p>Tall plants for garden color Amaranthus is the tallest of the summer annuals, providing a bright effect with its colored foliage. Its relative celosia makes its show with its colored inflorescences, that is, the total flowering parts.</p><p>Forest Fire is the variety to choose, the other celosias being short to medium in height.</p><p>Amaranthus plants should grow a metre or more high and, to ensure that, the soil should be enriched with organic matter and complete fertiliser before plants are set out.</p><p>Add supplementary fertiliser as they grow and ensure there is never any water shortage. Forest Fire celosias need similar treatment. These very colorful plants mix well with the tall varieties of zinnia.</p><p>Low to medium height Plants of limited height are used for edgings. Torenia (blue), and Zinnia linearis (Little Star) and Globe Amaranth (Little Buddy), portulaca and French Marigolds are all hardy and free-flowering. Little attention is needed once they are established, remembering of course that watering and weeding are essential, routine procedures.</p><p>The African Marigolds make an excellent show over many weeks. Cosmos should not be neglected. Perhaps they fell into disfavor when off-white and washed-out red were predominant colors.</p><p>Sunny Gold Cosmos, introduced last summer, has yellow, double flowers. My plants reached about 60cm high.</p><p>Mammoth, a single variety with rose and crimson flowers, can be even taller. Salvia (red), annual balsam (with red, white or pink flowers resembling small camellias) and petunia all do well in summer. Salvia should have spent flowers removed weekly and should never be allowed to run short of water. ]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PICS SHOW MARIGOLDS AND SUMMER ANNUALS</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-SML8509158039P129255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYMAIL(QLD)LTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49JV-RVM0-01S8-G15W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"854\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>SUNDAY MAIL (QLD)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1985 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"1985\"><dateText>September 15, 1985 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000773</classCode><className>GARDENING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D5IA</classCode><className>INSECTS &amp; ARACHNIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Earlier this week the Foreign Minister committed $1 million in emergency relief for medical and health supplies to help locals cope with the hazardous smog pollution.</p><p> The crisis was poised yesterday to claim its first political casualty after Indonesian Forestry Minister Jamaluddin Suryohadikusumo took responsibility for the fires in the face of growing criticism of the Government's failure to mount an effective response.</p><p> In Amsterdam, Greenpeace urged Indonesia's President Suharto to help prevent new fires while the UN humanitarian affairs office in Jakarta said the fires were \"out of control\" and it was \"unlikely that current firefighting operations will have a marked effect on extinguishing the fires\". In Singapore, the Straits Times newspaper used a series of colour photographs to make the point the fires were no accident or act of nature.</p><p> The photos showed forests were being cleared to make way for plantations, with fire used to remove natural vegetation.</p><p>\"The fires raging in Kalimantan and Sumatra appear to have been started deliberately to clear huge tracts of land on plantations as well as on small farms,\" the pro-government paper said.</p><p> It noted Indonesian timber barons had denied clearing by fire, and Indonesia's Co-ordinating Minister for People's Welfare said the fires were caused by the El Nino-induced drought. But the paper quoted an environmental expert saying El Nino did not start fires.</p><p> The report said the pictures, taken by the National University of Singapore Centre for Remote Imaging Sensing and Processing, could pinpoint the fires to within 10 to 20 metres. They were precise enough that \"by just looking at the photographs, Indonesian authorities should be able to tell who owns a piece of land which has been cleared by fire, or from which plumes of smoke rise\". \"With these pictures, the fire-starters cannot escape. If the Indonesian authorities need help, we can give it to them,\" a centre director said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS9710021006236624</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALIANLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:457Y-MHB0-0197-52TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"464\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>THE AUSTRALIAN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>October 2, 1997, Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0UNITED NATIONS \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0UNITED NATIONS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000056</classCode><className>AIR POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001348</classCode><className>POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp;

Simon, what are the main recommendations that Mr Rush wants to see made?</p><p>SIMON LAUDER: Well, as a whole Peter the suggestions amount to sweeping changes with the main objective to save lives and prevent a repeat of the disaster that saw hundreds of people trapped in their communities on Black Saturday.</p><p>In fact the senior counsel assisting the enquiry, Jack Rush QC, has recommended that the primacy of life become the main priority for fire agencies and that means a big focus on providing better warnings.</p><p>The counsel assisting says the warning tone which is used in cyclone areas should also be used to warn people in bushfire zones. It recommends towns also have the option of being warned by siren which may be operated by the local fire station.</p><p>A lot of witnesses at the royal commission have also asked that the public be told information which authorities used to judge the severity of predicted fires called \"The Forest Fire Danger Index\". The counsel assisting says that should happen.</p><p>And instead of having different fire agencies reporting different information at different times, the royal commission is being urged to propose a single website which people can access for information about what fires are doing in their area.</p><p>PETER CAVE: What other criticisms have there been of the way the authorities handled the situation on the day itself?</p><p>SIMON LAUDER: Well, the criticisms focussed on the heartbreaking revelations over the past few weeks that communities where dozens of people died had no public warning that the fire was coming or only about half an hour's notice and this is despite the fact that warnings had been drafted and were ready to go hours earlier.</p><p>It is due to a mix of communication breakdowns and a rigid sticking to the chain of command - people reluctant to go over someone's head and Jack Rush QC wants to see that change.</p><p>The commission's heard that no agency has a legal obligation to actually warn communities and the head of the Country Fire Authority, Russell Rees has given evidence that his role on the day was to provide general oversight but Jack Rush QC says one of the core responsibilities of the chief officer of the CFA is to warn communities of the risks the fires pose.</p><p>JACK RUSH: The coordination role as described by Mr Rees, we say is divorced from fundamental aspects of the statutory responsibility which was delegated on the day. The statutory obligations of the chief officer provide, we submit, for oversight in relation to fire prediction, provide for provision of information to communities, provide for the protection of life.</p><p>That is what is encompassed in the statutory role of the chief officer.</p><p>PETER CAVE: Jack Rush QC there.</p><p>How will the commissioners react to the suggestions, do you think?</p><p>SIMON LAUDER: Well, it is pretty much a take it or leave it scenario for them. They have got until the 17th of August to deliver an interim report so any recommendations can be put in place before the start of the next fire season. The commission will then resume and keep sitting well into 2010.</p><p>The counsel assisting has suggested that they actually set up a royal commission ombudsman to oversee the implementation of any recommendations and that would operate beyond the royal commission.</p><p>Senior counsel assisting the enquiry, Jack Rush QC this morning made it clear that his submission is only one element the commissioners will have to consider as they draft their interim report.</p><p>JACK RUSH: It needs to be understood that the submissions of counsel assisting are exactly that. The submissions represent the collective work and thoughts of counsel assisting at the bar table and the solicitors appointed to the royal commission. Our submissions as to suggested findings and recommendations, based on the evidence, carry no greater weight than the submissions put to you by any other represented party.</p><p>PETER CAVE: Jack Rush again and our reporter there Simon Lauder.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-2614830</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W2G-8HV1-2RG6-Y3JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473395</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><timeReceived>12:26 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>July 2, 2009 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Melbourne 3000</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires/Bushfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Event/ROYAL COMMISSION.

REPORTER</nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Federal Opposition has described the Government's response to Indonesia's forest-fire crisis, which includes a $1 million assistance package, as slow and indifferent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Opposition environment spokesman Duncan Kerr accused the Government yesterday of being far too slow to realise the urgency of the crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fires have been burning for about four months, and intensely for six weeks, generating a pall of smog which has blanketed South-East Asia and caused several disasters, possibly including the crash of an Indonesian air liner in Sumatra with the loss of 234 lives.</p><p>Australians with health risks have been urged not to travel to Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia or Brunei and some Australians have been offered government help to escape the extreme air pollution in Malaysia.</p><p>Mr Kerr said the Government should have offered immediate help to put the fires out and should have had a team of people on the ground now in Indonesia.</p><p>\"It is plain common sense that if your neighbourhood is burning, the most immediate help you can give is pitch in and help put out the fire,\" he said.</p><p>\"Whilst Mr Downer's offer of financial assistance will be of some use, it is not the most useful form of help and could send the wrong message.\" A government source said Australia was responding to specific calls for assistance from Indonesia and actual firefighters had not been requested.</p><p>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, announced the $1 million package after discussions with his Indonesian counterpart Ali Alatas.</p><p>The money will be used to provide medical and health supplies and other equipment such as water filters and face masks.</p><p>Mr Downer has also instructed Australia's aid agency, Aus- AID, to send two emergency response teams to Indonesia to assess the medical and fire-management needs.</p><p>A four-person medical team has been put together with the help of the Australian Red Cross and will leave for Indonesia at the weekend.</p><p>A five-member fire-management team from the Australian Fire Council Authority will leave on Friday and will be in the country for at least two weeks.</p><p>Both teams will begin reporting to the Government immediately.</p><p>Mr Downer said the Government was committed to working closely with Indonesian authorities to provide technical assistance in sustainable forestry and land management to avoid a recurrence of the crisis.</p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade warns people at risk, including those with respiratory disorders and pregnant women, not to travel to Malaysia, Indonesia or Brunei.</p><p>Garuda pilot was confused Page 9.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Yet the strategies employed reflect the resistance of entrenched bureaucracies to modern methods and the unwillingness of governments to fund them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over decades, a volunteer army has been deployed in what have nearly always been lost wars. Thousands of buildings have been destroyed -- some, like Mount Stromlo, national treasures; hundreds have died; there has been huge cost to government, insurance companies, communities and individuals. Yet every fire season, the generals commanding this army order their troops ``over the top'' in fruitless charges against the enemy -- crown fires in volatile eucalypt forest in inaccessible country.</p><p>The most devastating fires in Australia's history -- the Black Saturday fires in Victoria in February 2009 -- took 173 lives and cost millions in property damage, yet the focus of the royal commission came down to what individuals should or should not do when uncontrollable firestorms threaten. For example, Katharine Haynes of RMIT University, a researcher for Bushfire CRC, reasonably concluded from studying this and other fires over the past century that residents in risk-prone areas should prepare, stay and defend, or leave early.</p><p>What was not scrutinised was the basic concept of rural fire services built primarily on forces operating and controlled at ground level, hampered by untrafficable trails in inaccessible terrain and dependent for water supply on cumbersome, unmanoeuvrable vehicles. Aerial attack, the principal arm of forest and wildfire fighters in other countries, is still regarded, somewhat grudgingly, as an ancillary support service. For years, vested interests opposed the introduction of aircraft. Until that attitude changes, no government can claim to be taking bushfire-fighting seriously.</p><p>Greece may be bankrupt, but it supports a squadron of eight specialised water bombers. In the fire season they are controlled by an airborne observer who prioritises the firefronts and directs the attack.</p><p>Yet years after this strategy was proven, the NSW Rural Fire Service played down the role of aerial support. In the inquiry into the 2002 new year fires in the Shoalhaven district, the written submission of the RFS said: ``It is an understatement to suggest that aircraft and their reputed ability to extinguish fires is surrounded more by myth than realism.'' Former commissioner Phil Koperberg notoriously opposed aircraft. The lease of the S64 Sikorsky Aircranes had been delayed by bitter opposition on the grounds of cost, because aerial firefighting was always represented as an expensive addition to, instead of replacement for, the investment in the huge volunteer organisations.</p><p>In December 2006, as fires were burning in Tasmania and Victoria, I wrote to then prime minister John Howard and opposition leader Kevin Rudd, asking them to sponsor the establishment of a national firefighting squadron of water bombers. I nominated the specialist Canadian CL-415 (now designated Bombardier 415) used in 10 countries. When I lived in Italy, I helped set up a local bushfire brigade to deal with small grass and scrub fires, but when a serious fire in the pine and chestnut forest on the hills threatened, it was the Canadair water bombers that saved our village. Canadair operators in several northern hemisphere countries were willing to lease their aircraft to Australia during our bushfire season and their winter. Neither Howard nor Rudd replied to my letters.</p><p>The huge Sikorsky/Erickson S64 Aircranes that Australia leases from California may look impressive, but they represent gesture politics. What counts in water-bombing is turnaround time and load. Each of the giant helicopters can carry 9500 litres of water, but they take almost a minute to suck it up; they fly slowly to the fire at 100km/hour; and they can remain airborne for less than three hours before refuelling.</p><p>The Bombardier, a high-wing twin-turboprop aircraft, can scoop up its 6000 litres in 12 seconds, skimming any lake, river or the ocean at 130km/hour, fly to the fire at 300km/hour, dump and return for more while the Skycrane is still lumbering along with its first load. A single 415's ability to deliver 80,000 litres an hour within a 4km radius of its water supply means a squadron could have saved Mount Stromlo in 2003 -- as well as most of the 500 houses destroyed or damaged in the Canberra fires. The Victorian townships destroyed in 2009 were within operational reach of Lake Eildon, 60km away.</p><p>Both Los Angeles and San Diego have leased Bombardiers to fight their wildfires, but the US has so many mothballed aircraft that their place is increasingly taken by surplus Douglas DC-6 and DC-10 airliners, and ex-military Lockheed Hercules, Neptune and Orion planes. All are more effective and cost-effective than the light helicopters, which can lift only about 1000 litres but are commonly used in Australia because they are available and can attach a bucket without expensive conversion.</p><p>Every time bushfires take their toll in Australia, there are loud lamentations and even louder excuses. Politicians of all stripes hurry to sympathise with survivors. This is not to criticise them or decry the efforts of the ``orange army'' -- the thousands of volunteers who risk their lives at ground level -- but isn't it time for a complete rethink about bush firefighting? Every other country with serious seasonal wildfire risk has moved to make aerial attack the principal weapon against forest fire; only in Australia have vested interests rejected the strategy.</p><p>Shouldn't Australia be funding a modern aerial firefighting force as the principal arm, with the volunteer infantry used for what they do best -- containment, local protection and fuel reduction? Perhaps this time we might get a debate.</p><p>At $35 million each, a squadron of six Bombardier 415s would cost the commonwealth government only $210m.</p><p>This is peanuts compared with the recent waste in federal programs.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>&gt;&gt;

Many changes have already been made to bush<br/>firefighting procedures since the Linton tragedy.<br/></p><p>The full force of the coroner's criticism was levelled at the<br/>poor management of the CFA and Department of Natural Resources and<br/>Environment (DNRE), and the lack of appropriate training for those<br/>sent to dangerous situations.<br/></p><p>He found the CFA and DNRE, Mr Scharf and the owner of a property<br/>neighbouring the forest, Peter Neyland, had contributed to the<br/>deaths.<br/></p><p>But he said Mr Neyland, whose rubbish fire ignited the forest,<br/>\"took every reasonable precaution\" to put out the fires, while he<br/>did not believe Mr Scharf had the tools or knowledge \"to understand<br/>the danger he was in\".<br/></p><p>Mr Johnstone reserved his final words for the firemen's<br/>families: \"It's obviously been a harrowing experience for each and<br/>every one of you.<br/></p><p>\"\u2026 I hope that from this comes improvements in safety<br/>systems.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2002</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"517\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>AAP NEWSFEED</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 AAP Information Services Pty.

residents<br/>evacuated when bushfires rapidly spread across Canberra this<br/>afternoon.<br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Authorities were unsure how many fires were burning, with winds<br/>of up to 60kph fanning fires across the capital's fringes, but<br/>those threatening homes had been contained by 2100 AEDT.<br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two helicopters from the federal government were deployed to<br/>waterbomb the areas, with fires at one stage within 200 metres of<br/>Government House and the exclusive inner suburb of Red Hill.<br/></p><p>Police directed people to stay indoors and wet down fences and<br/>gutters at the peak of the fire, only announcing most of the fires<br/>were contained well after night fell.<br/></p><p>ACT Emergency Services operations manager David Foot said fire<br/>crews would remain on duty but there was no immediate threat to<br/>households.<br/></p><p>\"Due to some tremendous work by the firies out there, the direct<br/>risk to the residents of Curtin, Duffy, Holder areas and O'Connor<br/>has been removed,\" Mr Foot told ABC radio.<br/></p><p>Residents could have peace of mind that crews would remain on<br/>alert overnight and water bombing would continue, with help from<br/>the Department of Defence, tomorrow, he said.<br/></p><p>\"There will be fire units on duty throughout the night,\" Mr Foot<br/>said.<br/></p><p>NSW fire units were this afternoon called in to aid 36 ACT<br/>brigades battling to contain the fires in Curtin, Holder and Duffy<br/>in the west, O'Connor Ridge and Black Mountain in the north, and<br/>inner-suburban Red Hill.<br/></p><p>Flames from the original Stromlo Forest fire spread rapidly in<br/>mid-afternoon winds, shrouding the city in smoke.<br/></p><p>A house at the Forrest Park Riding School near Yarralumla was<br/>partly damaged and horses were evacuated.<br/></p><p>In the city's north, residents were evacuated and later allowed<br/>to return from a Dryandra Street caravan park near O'Connor Ridge<br/>in Canberra Nature Reserve.<br/></p><p>Electricity was cut to Government House, the National Aquarium<br/>and to houses in Curtin and Yarralumla, later extending to inner<br/>eastern suburbs of Red Hill, Deakin and Forrest.<br/></p><p>Major thoroughfares Adelaide Avenue and Tuggeranong Parkway were<br/>closed, along with other roads including the road to Black Mountain<br/>and to Red Hill, which is home to many diplomats.<br/></p><p>Most remained closed late in the evening.<br/></p><p>The governor-general and his family were safe inside Government<br/>House even though spot fires continued to burn into the night.<br/></p><p>Fire crews were in the grounds and the road into the property<br/>was closed, Dr Hollingworth's personal secretary Martin Bonsey<br/>said.<br/></p><p>\"We'll be watching it in confidence that the emergency services<br/>will keep us nice and secure,\" Mr Bonsey said.<br/></p><p>\"And if worst comes to worst, we'll hop in the lake.\"<br/></p><p>Authorities would not comment about whether the fires were<br/>sparked by arsonists, but said a total fire ban was in place.<br/></p><p>Radio stations broadcast an emergency announcement from ACT<br/>Bushfire Service reassuring people all available crews were on site<br/>to protect the community.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

It gives them a very easy way of saying `this is all too hard' or `this is going to cost too much money'.''</p><p>Mr Brumby acknowledged that systems put in place after previous bushfire disasters in Australia including the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires, failed on Black Saturday.</p><p>``All of the steps that were put in place after the Ash Wednesday fires, all of the work of successive governments . . . the reality is that on Black Saturday 2009 those systems failed and 173 lives were lost,'' Mr Brumby said.</p><p>The stay-or-go policy was considered to be among the most contentious issues to be raised in the final report, but there was no recommendation to scrap it as anticipated.</p><p>Commission chairman Bernard Teague and commissioners Susan Pascoe and Ron McLeod said key elements ``remain sound'' though the stay-or-go policy was too simplistic.</p><p>They urged the Government to provide more options for people facing fire danger, including planning for emergency evacuations which would be carried out by police and ordered by incident controllers in charge of fires.</p><p>Community fire refuges and bushfire shelters should also be available, with the commissioners criticising the Government for dragging its feet.</p><p>One of the biggest changes foreshadowed in the report is the recommendation to appoint a fire commissioner who would become the most senior fire officer in the state.</p><p>The fire commissioner's responsibilities would be to spearhead reform and direct chief officers of all fire agencies on extreme fire days.</p><p>In other changes, the system of having the emergency services minister ultimately in charge during major bushfires should be dropped and replaced with the state's police chief, the report said. The commissioners said the actions of then police chief Christine Nixon, who left the control centre on the night of the fires, were ``inadequate''.</p><p>Police and Emergency Services Minister Bob Cameron acted properly but should have considered advising the Premier to declare a state of disaster, the commissioners said.</p><p>Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu committed to implementing all the report's recommendations if the Coalition was elected to government in November.</p><p>But Mr Brumby raised questions over whether his party would go that far, saying the Government would consult with the community.</p><p>He said the Government would provide a full response ``within weeks''.</p><p>2009 VICTORIAN BUSHFIRES ROYAL COMMISSION</p><p>THE REPORT</p><p>Days since Black Saturday: 540</p><p>Number of recommendations: 67</p><p>Pages in the final report: 900</p><p>Witnesses before commission: 434</p><p>Exhibits: 1000</p><p>Transcript pages: 20,767</p><p>Cost: $40 million</p><p>KEY FINDINGS</p><p>* The stay-or-go policy is sound but must improve</p><p>* A new position of fire commissioner should be created</p><p>* Police chief to become 'Co-ordinator-in-chief of Emergency Management.</p><p>* People in risk areas should be able to sell their property to the state through a 'retreat and resettlement strategy</p><p>* Fuel reduction burns must be doubled</p><p>* Warning systems must be enhanced, shelters established and emergency communication networks improved</p><p>* Ageing powerlines should be replaced/upgraded</p><p>* At-risk regions to have no powerlines within 10 years</p><p>* National centre for bushfire research</p><p>FACTS:</p><p>* It has been estimated the Kinglake-Marysville firestorm north of Melbourne released energy the equivalent of 1500 Hiroshima-sized atom bombs.</p><p>* The McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index reached unprecedented levels in the lead-up to Black Saturday, ranging from 120 to more than 200.

That's the urgent threat official warning.</p><p>Every effort was made and hindsight is a wonderful thing, as we all know, but people were making efforts to warn the communities, including the community of Kinglake and in realising the whole state and the issues that pertained to the risks to the whole state at the time.</p><p>SAMANTHA DONOVAN: Jack Rush QC observed that the Country Fire Authority has the statutory responsibility for declaring days of total fire ban.</p><p>But as Russell Rees told the commission, that responsibility doesn't extend to the issuing of warnings.</p><p>RUSSELL REES: CFA seeks to give information but it depends on the public understanding of that information and taking that information in.</p><p>JACK RUSH: Does the CFA warn or does it provide information?</p><p>RUSSELL REES: The CFA's policy is that it gives advice to the community before and during fires. If one wants to interpret that advice as a warning, I don't shy away from the language warning, but there is much more in what CFA is striving to do than simply to warn.</p><p>SAMANTHA DONOVAN: In the wake of the fires, many residents of affected towns have asked why sirens weren't sounded to alert them of the approaching fires.</p><p>But chief officer Russell Rees says sirens at CFA stations aren't used for that purpose.</p><p>RUSSELL REES: Importantly, the use of the CFA siren at a fire station is not for the purpose of warning the public. The use of the siren on a CFA fire station is for alerting fire brigade members to respond to fire.</p><p>SAMANTHA DONOVAN: Although he isn't ruling out the use of sirens in future.</p><p>RUSSELL REES: Nothing is off the agenda in this discussion. There are however severe limitations in audible warnings.</p><p>SAMANTHA DONOVAN: What's known as the Forest Fire Danger Index was almost off the charts on Black Saturday, with an almost unprecedented reading of 328.</p><p>Russell Rees was asked why that figure wasn't communicated to the public.</p><p>RUSSELL REES: To understand those figures, as in the numerical numbers of the fire danger indices, you need to understand what they mean; so there needs to be an educative process. And the language of low, moderate to extreme, high extreme, is the language that's considered best to explain that scenario.</p><p>SAMANTHA DONOVAN: The CFA's Russell Rees was excused from the witness box late this afternoon but it's expected he'll be called to give evidence several times during the commission's hearings.</p><p>His counterpart at the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment Ewan Waller was the next witness called this afternoon and he'll resume his testimony tomorrow morning.</p><p>MARK COLVIN: Samantha Donovan.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-2567202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VNF-S171-2RG6-Y01X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473393</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><timeReceived>6:18 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"05\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>May 11, 2009 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Event/ROYAL COMMISSION.

Milne, bought when she and her husband were on holiday in Dorset 11 years earlier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When she returned after the fire, Gursky, a 49-year-old former librarian, found that the rest of her 2300-volume personal library had burned, along with her house and everything in it.</p><p>Thousands of scorched tree trunks still range up the hillside across the street from Gursky's new home, but her library is well on the way to recovery. In September, she received a birthday gift from her husband that earned her the envy of her book-loving friends: the complete Penguin Classics Library, 1082 books sold only by Amazon.com for nearly $US8000 ($10,900).</p><p>Penguin Classics, the paperback volumes with the familiar black spine and the orange-and-black penguin logo, are known to generations of former students who struggled through Dickens and dozed through Henry James in school.</p><p>Not since Penguin started the collection in 1946, however, has anyone been able to easily buy a complete set of the books, which range from ancient Greek poetry to the novels of Thomas Pynchon and include the complete works of Shakespeare, four translations of the Iliad and 20 volumes each of the works of Henry James and Dickens. (The complete list can be found at www.amazon.com by searching for \"Penguin Classics Library\".)</p><p>\"We'd always wanted to sell them together, but it was always an issue of how could we sell all of the books in a single bookstore,\" says Tim McCall, Penguin's director of online sales and marketing, noting that most bookstores carry only a few hundred titles in the series. \"Finally, the internet became mature enough to give us the ability to display all the books and to reach an audience out there that might want them.\"</p><p>Gursky's collection arrived in mid-September packed in 25 boxes, shrink-wrapped on a pallet and weighing almost 320 kilograms. She has spent countless hours unpacking, shelving, categorising, alphabetising and rearranging the books. Oh, yes - and reading; she has read more than 30 of the books in eight weeks. Even at that rather remarkable pace, it would take her about six years to make her way through the entire collection.</p><p>So where did she start? \"I ran my finger along the shelves, closed my eyes and stopped on one,\" Gursky said, sitting in her new library, 31 rows of great literature looming behind her.</p><p>She picked Herland, a feminist utopian novel by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, combined in one Penguin volume with Gilman's short fiction and poetry.</p><p>Despite its daunting scope, the Penguin Classics Library Complete Collection is not actually complete. Penguin lists about 1300 titles in its catalogue but included only 1082 in the Amazon collection. \"We included every title in stock at sufficient levels to ensure the continued availability of the collection,\" McCall says. \"In the final analysis, there were approximately 200 titles that did not make the cut due to limited availability, most often because they were on our schedule to be completely revised.\"</p><p>Amazon will not say how many sets have been sold so far or who has bought them, citing the need to protect buyers' privacy. Penguin seems not to know who the buyers are, other than Gursky, who acknowledged her ownership in a review of the collection on Amazon's website.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-57isd79oitcoqrunfjm</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P6W-51J0-TXN5-R2VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"568\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2005 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"12\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>December 23, 2005 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS454111 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp; MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>AMZN (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp; SHORT STORIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIER</classCode><className>FICTION LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N519120MM</classCode><className>LIBRARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UI0</classCode><className>LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D89F</classCode><className>FEMINISM &amp; WOMEN'S RIGHTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001028</classCode><className>LIBRARIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009UCO</classCode><className>POETRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009UJX</classCode><className>CLASSICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST0009RQI</classCode><className>ONLINE MARKETING &amp; ADVERTISING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N4491211M</classCode><className>BOOKSTORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N519120MM</classCode><className>LIBRARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001028</classCode><className>LIBRARIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000354</classCode><className>COMPUTER NETWORKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST0009RQI</classCode><className>ONLINE MARKETING &amp; ADVERTISING</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We use the simile deliberately. The past 12 months have been a year of fire. Australians, scarred in recent days by one of the worst ever bushfire seasons, know well the destructive power of fire, quite apart from the human tragedy. They have first-hand knowledge from the fires of Black Saturday that these disasters are getting worse in a landscape already blasted by drought. They know, too, the warming of Earth's climate will make such severe events more frequent and more destructive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They are of course not alone. Fires in California burned hundreds of homes and tens of thousands of hectares last November. Parts of Lebanon burned in October. Before that, on Rhodes, a large fire offered a reminder of the previous year's horrific fires through Greece. Earlier this month, a NASA satellite took pictures of a rare large-scale forest fire in Nepal, in the foothills of the frozen Himalayas. The Earth is getting burned by global warming.</p><p>Not only are fires the result of worsening drought caused by global warming, but they hasten that warming by releasing vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. That will no doubt be part of the reason why Earth's carbon sinks - the oceans and forests which in the past have soaked up a little more than half the carbon dioxide produced by human activity - are becoming less effective, according to recent research cited in Climate Change In Australia, jointly produced by the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology.</p><p>The news was bad two years ago when Earth Hour started. It is worse now. Carbon dioxide emissions are increasing faster than the worst-case scenario imagined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007.</p><p>Fire is a tangible thing, an obvious sign of the change that is happening. Beyond the immediate reaction of fear and grief at its destruction, and the outpouring of generosity to help its victims, there is a growing unease at the thought that Earth's fiery present might be just a foretaste of the future. What will the climate be like if nothing is done? More fires will burn, certainly. There are plenty of other effects, though: storms and hurricanes increasing in frequency and intensity; melting glaciers and icecaps; rising sea levels; dwindling water supplies; dying rivers; spreading deserts. That unease at what the future may hold is heightened when politicians bicker over what is to be done and quail before the seriousness of the threat, economists dither over what mechanism might best harness the market to reverse present trends, and investors and industrialists do their best to stymie any change at all.</p><p>But if the dangers from global warming have grown as the climate heats under its greenhouse of man-made gas emissions, so too has a determination to face the problem squarely and to beat it.</p><p>In 2007 one city in one country was involved: our city, Sydney. The Herald backed the World Wildlife Fund's campaign to highlight concern for the fate of the Earth by encouraging readers to switch off lights and power for one hour. The response was overwhelming: 2.2 million homes and businesses blacked out to show their support.</p><p>The next year, the event went to all Australian capitals and overseas. In 11 countries, 26 cities signed up and 50 million people took action.</p><p>This year the event has gone global. The organisers thought they would get 1000 towns and cities to join; they have now signed up nearly twice that number, in 81 countries.</p><p>This year the event has been shaped as a vote for the Earth. Certainly the planet needs your support. As our politicians head for Copenhagen, to devise the climate treaty that will shape the world's response to this vast, intractable threat, they need to be made aware that behind them, in all the countries they come from, there is a reservoir at least as vast of public support - not for temporising or delay, nor for protecting special interests - but for effective action to address the problem.</p><p>Earth Hour is the way to have your say.

Now they had almost doubled in size. \"These fires are really too big to try and directly attack,\" said Ms Johns. \"We are hoping to keep people safe and to protect their assets.\"</p><p>In the Nariel Valley, near Benambra, more than 20 properties were placed under threat and residents were urged to evacuate or implement bushfire action plans at two properties.</p><p>The Mount Buffalo fire is expected to breach containment lines as weather conditions deteriorate.</p><p>The Pinnabar fire has destroyed a communications tower and burnt through more than 20,000 hectares of bushland. It had linked with blazes across the state border into the Kosciuszko National Park.</p><p>Heavy smoke caused problems getting fire aircraft in the air during the day.</p><p>Thirteen New Zealand firefighters with specialist forest fire knowledge helped relieve fire crews yesterday and 100 army reservists arrived in Myrtleford yesterday to help build firebreaks before backburning.</p><p>Firefighters took more than three-and-a-half hours to control a grassfire that burnt about 15 hectares of grassland just north of Glenrowan about 4pm yesterday.</p><p>The heritage-protected Red Robin gold mine has been burnt by the Mount Feathertop fire. The mine had been operating since 1939.</p><p>Smoke from the bushfires, combined with those in Canberra and NSW, caused a thick haze over Melbourne and other parts of Victoria, with the EPA reporting poor air quality across the state.</p><p>The haze forced Qantas to divert two Melbourne-bound international flights to Sydney.</p><p>Smoke also caused several call-outs for respiratory problems across the city.</p><p>Premier Steve Bracks has cut short his holiday to talk to firefighters returning from the fire front in Myrtleford this morning. -- with AAP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Horses wearing eye protection at Mount Beauty.

The local Green-dominated council had sued the owners for breaking the council's changed planning laws about removing trees.</p><p>The cost of legal action had ruined the family financially but at least their actions saved their home.</p><p>On balance this criticism of the green activists is excessive because we know now that there are many other factors which explain the causes and intensity of Victoria's Black Saturday.</p><p>The royal commission appointed by the Victorian government should reveal all these factors.</p><p>Many Tasmanians have first-hand experience of the intensity of a fire storm having lived through Black Tuesday on February 7, 1967, when 73 Tasmanians perished and 1100 homes were destroyed.</p><p>More recently, a bushfire on Tasmania's East Coast swept through Scamander and its environs -- its intensity again fuelled by a dense, dry uncleared undergrowth.</p><p>Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown has responded to this criticism by arguing that the greens are not opposed to regeneration burns generally, and they do support the ecologically appropriate use of fire, whatever ``ecologically appropriate'' means.</p><p>Dr Brown and the Tasmanian Greens do not show the same flexibility in dealing with Forestry Tasmania's regeneration burns, which they appear to see as unnecessary, creating visual pollution impacting on tourism and the health of locals.</p><p>Their argument about forest-fire management seems to run as follows ``if fire is kept out of Australia's forests the trees will grow, canopies will close up, the ground will moisten and there will be fewer wildfires.''</p><p>I could not find a skerrick of scientific evidence to support this argument but I can find plenty in relation to the benefits of controlled burning, which removes most of the dry undercover, reduces the probability of wildfire and makes the suppression of fire easier.</p><p>Clive Hamilton, of Australia Foundation fame, blames Victoria's fire holocaust on global warming. I think this is a furphy.</p><p>If Black Saturday is the result of global warming then what about the other bushfire travesties which seem to occur each January-February somewhere in Australia?</p><p>Victoria alone has experienced galeforce wind-driven fires in 40 degree plus heat in 1919, 1926, 1932, 1939 and 1994 with the same tragic outcomes.</p><p>January 13, 1939, was previously the big daddy of all fires, accounting for 70 lives, two million hectares burnt and 1300 homes lost.</p><p>These varied accounts about the causes of bushfires are confused, confusing and dangerous because if we do not understand the causes of fire then we will never know what to do when fire confronts us.</p><p>Confusion also extends to the advice offered by the relevant authorities.</p><p>When fire sweeps through do we stay with the family home or abandon it and when do we abandon it?</p><p>The answer seems to vary from state to state, presumably because fire conditions vary so we are not sure about the answers to such critical issues.</p><p>Australia, and Tasmania in particular, has a myriad of planning schemes and laws and it is important that the planning laws have a degree of uniformity.</p><p>The question about our capacity to take a national rather than local approach to fire control and management must be high on the list of the terms of reference for the royal commission.</p><p>Social capital, the level of trust and reciprocity existing in society, gives rise to the sense of community on which social cohesion is based.</p><p>We have managed over the years to run down our stock of social capital, an outcome which is largely explained by the electronic revolution.</p><p>It has tended to isolate us in our living rooms, degrading our sense of community.</p><p>It is sad that we must wait for catastrophes such as Black Friday to rebuild our stock of social capital but that's exactly what has happened. There has never been a better time to love your neighbour.</p><p>* Dr Bruce Felmingham is a leading commentator on economics and business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-STS-20090215-1-019-579508</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYTASMA2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7V15-8XF0-YBDY-R01P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"743\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Tasmanian (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>February 15, 2009 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DSTY</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp;

It's got nothing to do with border security or people-smuggling or locking people up on mounds of birds . . . and shooting at them.</p><p>The fact is we only have 0.001 per cent of the world's refugees but whine more than any other country on Earth.</p><p>Marilyn Shepherd, Angaston</p><p>Saints turn rules into rugby</p><p>DOES the AFL Commission have the power to suspend the St Kilda Football Club coaching staff for bringing the game into disrepute?</p><p>Their game plan consists of the whole team following the ball and developing into a rugby maul.</p><p>I feel sorry for their gifted footballers who do not have a chance to showcase their skills.</p><p>The later that Channel Seven can delay telecasts of St Kilda games the better.

You have to be ready to kill instinctively.</p><p>How do you think the Defence Force achieves that? They make you angry or stressed to a point that if you are ambushed, a soldier's button is pushed and you run firing your weapon straight toward the danger.</p><p>In recruit training, the instructors even made us watch Romper Stomper at least 10 times to instil hate for other races. You have to be full of enough hate that you can drive a bayonet into somebody and look into their eyes as they die.</p><p>This fuss about soldiers in Afghanistan calling the people who they see names is just stress relief and probably pointing out to each other possible dangers, like suicide bombers.</p><p>Stretto, ex-army</p><p>LETTER OF THE DAY</p><p>WELL, well, mothers living their own failed dream of being a beauty queen (Little Beauties on Show, 26/3).</p><p>In my opinion, the role of a mother is doing what is right for the child.</p><p>Plucking out eyebrows has a touch of senseless vanity, and is not in the child's best interest.</p><p>The young girls in this competition will believe that beauty is everything, which is not a real confidence-booster.</p><p>Do mothers ever stop to think how their child will feel if she loses?
